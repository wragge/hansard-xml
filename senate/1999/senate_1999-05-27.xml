The Community Affairs References Committee has raised with me a matter of privilege under standing order 81. This matter was the subject of documents tabled in the Senate by the committee on 29 April 1999. The matter concerns the compilation of a document known as the Allars report and the subsequent treatment of the document by the Department of Health and Family Services. Having considered the history of the matter as set out in the documents provided to me, the committee is of the view that the following contempts of the Senate could have occurred in the compilation and subsequent treatment of the Allars report: witnesses who gave evidence before the committee may have been punished for their evidence by the inclusion of certain material in the report and its subsequent publication by the department; the proceedings of the committee may have been misused in order to make damaging statements about, and to inflict harm upon, witnesses before the committee; the proceedings of the committee may have been misrepresented; and there may have been an unauthorised publication of a document compiled for submission to the committee and submitted to the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Under standing order 81, I am required to determine whether a motion should have precedence to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee. Under Resolution 4 of the Senate's Privileges Resolutions, in making that decision I am required to take account of the following criteria:</para><para>(a) the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial 
 nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</para><para>(b) the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</para><para>I am not required to consider whether a case of contempt of the Senate has been made out or the merits of that case. Past presidential determinations have indicated that precedence will be given to a motion to refer a matter to the Privileges Committee if the matter is capable of being held by the Senate to meet criterion (a) and if there is no other readily available remedy. Past reports by the Privileges Committee and determinations by the Senate have indicated that the committee and the Senate take very seriously any suggestion that witnesses may have been harmed because of evidence they have given to Senate committees. Interference with witnesses has traditionally been regarded as belonging to the most serious category of contempt. The matter, therefore, meets criterion (a).</para><para>In relation to criterion (b), the only other available remedy would be a law suit by the witnesses against the department but such an action would be severely limited by parliamentary privilege. Past presidential determinations have indicated that the possibility of such civil proceedings is not regarded as a readily available other remedy.</para><para>I therefore determine that precedence be given to a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee and I table the documents provided to me by the committee. In accordance with standing order 81, a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee may now be moved.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crowley</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the following matters be referred to the Standing Committee of Privileges</para><para>Having regard to the documents provided by the Community Affairs References Committee in relation to the compilation and distribution of the Allars report:</para><para>(a)	 whether witnesses who gave evidence before the committee were injured in consequence of their evidence;</para><para>(b)	 whether the proceedings of the committee were misused to inflict harm upon witnesses before the committee; 
</para><para>(c)	 whether the proceedings of the committee were misrepresented; and</para><para>(d)	 whether there was an unauthorised publication of a document compiled for submission to the committee and submitted to the committee;</para><para>whether any contempt of the Senate was committed in relation to these matters.</para></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>5520</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>5520</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>5520</page.no><name

Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:</para></talk.start><para>That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to this motion No. 232.</para><para>I am surprised at the Labor Party wanting to not allow this motion to go to a debate. I know that they will come up again with the general principle that any motion that has to do with affairs outside Australia should not be brought to a vote, because we will find that the Labor Party not only is denying a vote in the way that we just saw a vote on the Collins class submarines but also will not vote for a debate on the matter. Essentially, the Labor Party is denying the Senate the opportunity to vote on a matter of enormous importance to our nearest neighbours in West Papua, otherwise called Irian Jaya by the Indonesian military regime.</para><para>I have brought this motion forward because we have two million neighbours—in this small country under occupation from Jakarta—whose political rights, civil rights and cultural rights are totally repressed. We have a series of political leaders from the major parties in Jakarta visiting West Papua at the moment and speaking to rallies, but there is a highly organised resistance by the West Papuan people themselves who want independence. The two million people of West Papua deserve an act of self-determination. It 
 is extraordinary that it takes me as a Green member of the Senate to bring this issue before this parliament.</para><para>The world has closed its mind to an enormous wrong that is occurring. The meagre news coming through to Australia not only talks of the resistance by the whole populace of West Papua, who are trying to organise a total boycott of voting in the upcoming Indonesian elections, but also talks of a grisly list of deaths, mutilations and torture of political leaders in West Papua, particularly since 1 July last year, when the raising of the West Papuan flag in Biak led to machine gunning of innocent people who were protesting under that flag and then the gathering of women and children in particular, the taking out to sea of those people and the killing of them and the dumping of their bodies in the ocean. There is a tumultuous situation occurring in West Papua, but it is being ignored.</para><para>I thank the ABC for what little information we are getting through, and there are occasional reports in the newspapers. The latest report speaks of the key opposition party leader from Jakarta, Megawati Sukarnoputri, giving a speech to about 3,000 people on a hillside in Irian Jaya earlier this week—this report came through on Tuesday. While she was at that rally, a leader of the Free West Papua movement grabbed the megaphone, called for independence and got enormous, rousing support for that from the crowd. I call on the Australian government to identify that leader because her or his death is imminent, if we look at what has happened to other people who have spoken out simply for their own freedom—an act of self-determination.</para><para>This motion simply calls on our government to maximise diplomatic efforts to ensure the safety of such people who are taking part in political discourse in the run-up to elections. There is worse; there is violence on both sides. At the moment, seven hapless Javanese are being held in deplorable conditions by the OPM just on the western side of the border with Papua New Guinea. I call on the OPM to release these people, who are innocent victims caught up in this maelstrom of violence and denial of rights. I am simply putting forward a motion calling on the government 
 of Australia to maximise its efforts to ensure the safety of the West Papuans and their political leaders. I am thoroughly dismayed again at the Labor Party effectively blocking this matter from getting prominence and coming to a vote as it ought to. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>5523</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Brown misunderstands the processes in this place. The Labor Party calling `not formal' was to indicate that they were not prepared to have a vote taken without debate, contrary to what Senator Brown has just asserted. The issue is the appropriate time for that debate. There is time for non-government business debates in the Senate program and the time is not now. One of the reasons why we are seeking extended sitting hours—which was just criticised by Senator Brown—is that these techniques, which are being taken up by Senator Brown in particular, take time out of government business.</para></talk.start><para>The suspension of standing orders therefore requires Senator Brown to demonstrate why this debate should take place now rather than at the proper time, and he has failed to do that. We are not against debate of this issue. If Senator Brown regarded it as important, he would have given notice much earlier and would have arranged, through the normal processes in this place, for his matter to be given attention in non-business time.</para><para>On the merits of the action, which I will mention briefly, the Australian government recognises Indonesian sovereignty over Irian Jaya, which was the result of the 1969 UN sponsored act of free choice. Having said that, we wish to see the elections which are now taking place take place in an atmosphere where voters are free and able to make their determination without threat or concern for their personal health or wellbeing. Therefore, the Australian government supports the sentiment that all action should be taken by the Indonesian authorities to ensure that the vote is conducted in that environment.</para><para>It is true that there have been isolated calls for a boycott of the vote, but we have no evidence to suggest that the wider population 
 plans to boycott the election. In fact, key Irianese figures have reportedly urged people to participate. I would have much preferred to hear Senator Brown this morning urging participation by the population in the opportunity that is presented to them to make a determination on their future. Voting may not be high, and we get some indication of that from the number of registrations, but Senator Brown needs to take into account the difficulties of accessing remote and mountainous areas.</para><para>The position of the Australian government therefore is that a vote is taking place and we welcome democratic processes of this type. We note the urging by key Irianese figures for the people of Irian Jaya to participate in that process. We urge the Indonesian authorities to ensure that it is a free and safe process within which the people of Irian Jaya can participate. We take this opportunity to again reiterate our very strong position on improving human rights not only for people within Irian Jaya but for all within the region, who still do not necessarily have the same sort of freedoms that we would regard as desirable for all human beings.</para><para>Therefore, the case has not been made out to suspend standing orders, in our submission, but we take this opportunity to express our desire that there be a free and fair participation in the election process that is taking place at the moment, and the Indonesian authorities should make every effort to ensure that that is the case.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>5523</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Brown well knows the Australian Labor Party's position in this chamber on foreign affairs motions and I restate the comments of Senator Faulkner on 27 May 1998 when, for motions dealing with foreign affairs policy issues, he said:</para></talk.start><para>In cases where there is not unanimous agreement on such motions, the opposition will not be agreeing to formality.</para><para>That is a statement I have made, together with others, in this chamber when motions on foreign affairs matters have been raised and, in those previous debates, I outlined the reasons for the ALP's position, as did Senator Faulkner on 27 May 1998. That position has 
 not changed and, for that reason, we deny formality to a motion that, frankly, we do not support in the form in which it is set out. I understand that the government is also opposed to the motion. So it clearly was not a non-contentious motion.</para><para>In terms of the issues which surround the motion that Senator Brown put, he last sought, by way of a formal motion, to raise the important issue of Irian Jaya in July last year. On that occasion, Senator Faulkner informed the Senate of Labor's position as set out in the resolution adopted by our national conference last year. For the record today, that resolution reads:</para><para>In the light of Australia's support for the United Nations International Decade for the World's Indigenous Peoples, Labor supports the right of the people of Irian Jaya to develop their own distinctive culture and institutions and expresses its concern about government and commercial activities such as unrestrained logging, mining, trans-migration and expropriation of lands that impact negatively on local communities.</para><para>Labor notes reports of social unrest, environmental damage and human rights abuses associated with the activities of the Freeport mine and urges the Australian government to ensure that Australian companies conducting operations in Irian Jaya fully respect the rights and traditions of local communities, and develop and observe appropriate codes of conduct.</para><para>Labor urges the Australian government, particular through its aid program, to provide more support to local communities and non-government organisations to enable them to better protect their interests and rights.</para><para>Labor calls on the Indonesian government to respond to concerns regarding conditions in Irian Jaya by allowing unhindered access by independent media and by humanitarian and human rights organisations.</para><para>Labor further urges the Australian government to send a parliamentary mission to Irian Jaya to observe the situation and needs of the Irian Jayan people including with regard to adequate provision of drought relief and to consult with local communities on how Australia can better assist with their development.</para><para>Labor is very concerned about the situation in Irian Jaya, particularly the ongoing reports of human rights abuses in the territory. In some respects, Senator Brown's motion could have gone further in dealing with the issue of human rights and in calling for greater access 
 by international media and human rights organisations to investigate the situation. It could also appropriately have called for the Australian government to release, with appropriate safeguards for confidential sources, the Australian embassy's report on last year's Biak massacre.</para><para>We are also aware, of course, of continuing calls for independence for West Papua and of the most recent reports of a boycott in the territory of the 7 June Indonesian national election. These are all matters of considerable interest for us, but we do not consider that Senator Brown's motion today is the best way of addressing these issues. As a consequence, Labor is not prepared to endorse the motion today, nor are we prepared to endorse a suspension for further considering the matter, but should Senator Brown wish to discuss the language and timing of a further motion with the opposition, we would be happy to do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>5524</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is an urgent issue because the election process in Indonesia is occurring now. I hate to be the one to tell the government their own processes. However, the Greens would generally get a general business debate maybe once or twice a year. It just so happens that we are not able to advise the Indonesian government to have their elections to coincide with the times when there might possibly be a debate on general notices of motion on a Thursday afternoon. The issue of whether or not there is debating time for motions that are not government motions is an important one because, during the process of response, Senator Hill said, `Notices of motion, outrageous! Notices of motion are taking time out of government business.' The time allotted to notices of motion within the program is not actually just government business. It is an opportunity not just for parliamentarians but for the community, through their elected representatives, to bring up issues which governments and, dare I say, main opposition parties may not consider to be their individual priorities.</para></talk.start><para>There is the process by which debate can take place. It is outrageous, I believe, for the government to suggest that we should take that process to its logical conclusion, that is, 
 to ask for debates on notices of motion. I realise that notices of motion may be inconvenient for both the government and the opposition, but nevertheless that is not going to stop the Greens from putting forward those notices of motion and endeavouring to get resolution on those where they are important. Here we have a situation where the issue is self-determination. In the motion itself, let us look at what could be a problem:</para><para>(a) notes that:</para><para>	 (i)	 during the recent visit of Indonesian political leaders, West Papuans called for independence for West Papua (Irian Jaya)—</para><para>well, yes, it did happen—</para><para>	 (ii)	 the widespread boycott of participation in Indonesia's upcoming general election is being organised by West Papuan leaders—</para><para>Well, yes. And whether or not that is everybody is not even up for question; it is widespread. The fact is that none of the 10 political parties who are participating in the current Indonesian elections supports self-determination for West Papua.</para><para>We know there is a degree of support for self-determination for East Timor within the ALP, but West Papua and, dare I say, Aceh are the forgotten areas of Indonesia because they do not get the same level of media attention and perhaps because Australians are there making a bit of money associated with some of the elements of the Freeport mine and other environmental disasters. Despite the qualified words of the statement from the Labor Party conference, I still cannot see what in this motion would be a problem. The first two parts are statements of fact, and the third is calling on the Australian government to maximise diplomatic efforts to ensure the rights and safety of West Papuans and their political leaders.</para><para>If the wording of the motion had been a problem for the Labor Party, why did they not contact Senator Brown to ask for a change of wording? They are saying: `It is all right to vote on foreign affairs policy statements if they are nice and safe and if they happen to be something that we put forward. But it is very unlikely that all foreign affairs motions 
 will be agreed upon by all parties.' So the consensus issue for the Labor Party is a very nice excuse for not going outside the square, for not getting into anything that is considered to be contentious in any way. In lots of ways, this means that whatever foreign affairs decisions governments make are protected, because there will be no real debate within this parliament if this is the way we carry on.</para><para>This is important. At least today this motion of Senator Brown's has brought this issue into the parliament. It is on the record that some people in Australia are concerned about self-determination and human rights in relation to West Papua and are at least prepared to bring them to debate so that those people in West Papua know they are not forgotten.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The statement read as follows</inline>—</para><para>The core function of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is to scrutinise legislative instruments to ensure that they do not breach personal rights or parliamentary propriety. One aspect of parliamentary propriety is that legislative instruments should not contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment.</para><para>The Committee does not raise this principle often, but when it does it often highlights fundamental issues of the proper relationship between the Parliament and the executive and of the appropriate prerogatives of Parliament. This Report describes Committee scrutiny of the <inline font-weight="bold">Financial Management and Accountability Orders 1998 (Amendment)</inline> , which illustrates such issues.</para><para>The Report first outlines the criteria which the Committee apply to determine whether the subject matter of a legislative instrument should be included in a Bill, where it would face the full rigour of parliamentary passage. The Report describes how these criteria have been applied in practice. In one such case the Committee obtained an undertaking to amend the Act to bring to an end seven years of yearly extensions by regulations of discrimination based on sex. Some of the other circumstances where the Committee has raised this matter included the censorship of books, magazines, films and computer games; disclosure of personal information by Australia Post to, among others, ASIO and law enforcement agencies; substantial constitutional change to Australian territories; and the prohibition on advertising natural remedies as drug free.</para><para>The Report next analyses the enabling <inline font-style="italic">Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997</inline> , which provides for the management of public money and public property. The Report notes a number of wide powers under the Act to make legislative instruments. For instance, it provides for the Minister to issue Special Instructions, which are not subject to tabling or disallowance, breach of which is punishable by two years imprisonment, which override the Act and the regulations. The Report mentions Committee scrutiny of instruments made under some of these powers.</para><para>The great bulk of the Report, however, addresses Committee scrutiny of the <inline font-weight="bold">Financial Management and Accountability Orders 1998 (Amendment)</inline> . The substantive part of these Orders, which was six lines long, established Comcover, described as a managed insurance fund, which will insure or arrange insurance, for all Commonwealth insurable losses except for employers' liability risks already covered by Comcare. The substantive part of the Explanatory Statement, which was seven lines long, merely repeated what was in the Orders. The Committee obtained further information from the Minister, which advised that Comcover would be 
 a comprehensive disciplined managed fund, collect premiums, accumulate reserves, meet losses out of reserves, be modelled on the best managed funds in Australia and overseas, improve accountability and transparency to the Parliament, deliver a dividend to the government at least comparable to industry standards and adopt a business-like approach to the government's insurance and risk management arrangements through the provision of services at competitive market rates.</para><para>In these circumstances the Committee considered that the scheme may have been more appropriate for parliamentary debate and passage, particularly since a similar agency, Comcare, was established by detailed statutory provisions. The Report notes that Committee scrutiny of the Orders took nine months, over two Parliaments, including extensive correspondence, a meeting between the Committee and the head of Comcover and a meeting between the Chairman and the Minister, following which the Minister agreed to amend the Orders to meet the Committee's concerns. The Committee is now able to report to the Senate that the amended arrangements will not contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Quirke</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title><page.no>5527</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>5527</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>5527</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Allison, I present the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee on the powers of the Commonwealth and environmental protection and ecologically sustainable developments in Australia, together with submissions and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  record of proceedings.

The overwhelming majority of those submissions deplored the recurrent lack of political will and leadership on the part of all Commonwealth governments to employ the extensive power they possess in order to protect and conserve the environment, which is every Australian's common legacy.</para></talk.start><para>It is the view of the committee that the Commonwealth government has the constitutional power to regulate, including by legislation, most, if not all, matters of major environmental significance anywhere within the territory of Australia. Various constitutional heads of power confer on the Commonwealth extensive legislative competence with respect to environmental matters. The committee appreciates that, while the Commonwealth possesses extremely wide constitutional powers over the environment, that power is not entirely unlimited. With an express environmental power, the legislative result would be constitutional certainty. The committee's view is that a large part of remaining constitutional uncertainty surrounding the use of existing Commonwealth power on the environment could be alleviated by the use of independent environmental law and constitutional law experts.</para><para>An independent statutory environmental and constitutional law experts commission—made up, for example, of members from Commonwealth, state and territory attorneys-general departments, academics, private practitioners 
 and lawyers with environmental community legal centres, such as the Environmental Defenders Office—could advise the government if, when and how the Commonwealth should legislate with respect to environmental matters. The committee is recommending the establishment of such a body. This body could also monitor, review and advise on the government's execution of its responsibilities for environmental protection and ecologically sustainable development.</para><para>The committee is critical of the narrow approach adopted by the government in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998, where only six of the 30 matters listed in the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, heads of agreement on Commonwealth-state roles and responsibilities for the environment are matters of national environmental significance which act as triggers for Commonwealth environmental assessment and approvals. The committee has argued strongly in any case for the Commonwealth to take a proactive role in environmental management. It does not see the `matters of national environmental significance' approach as being particularly useful and has recommended that it be abandoned. That approach takes a narrow view of the wide-ranging environmental powers the courts and the Constitution have conferred. The committee sees this as a deliberate attempt to constrain the environmental powers of the Commonwealth, which cannot be justified.</para><para>The committee was struck by the strong support expressed in the submissions for Commonwealth leadership and involvement in the protection of sites that come under the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage and the Ramsar Convention. In the committee's view, the Commonwealth should acknowledge that it has ultimate responsibility for the safekeeping of world heritage areas. The Commonwealth should not only exercise primary legal control over the protection, preservation and management of these areas but it should also ensure that they are further protected by extending its legislative powers over a defined and adequate buffer zone around world heritage properties that takes into account the 
 natural ecosystem to which the world heritage listed area belongs.</para><para>The committee notes that the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment, IGAE, supports the precautionary principle, as does the committee. A cautious approach is absolutely vital. Once a pristine area has been damaged, it is often too late for the Commonwealth to act. The only safe approach, and in the committee's view the only responsible one, is to protect an area while it is being assessed so that its unique properties are conserved in the event of inclusion under conventions and agreements.</para><para>On the issue of conservation of biological diversity, the committee believes that the confluence of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the external affairs power enables the Commonwealth to unilaterally promulgate national requirements for the environmental impact assessment of all proposed projects. It can do this regardless of jurisdiction, as long as it believes the proposed project is likely to have a significant impact on biological diversity anywhere in Australia. Consequently, the committee believes that the Commonwealth should establish such national environmental impact assessment standards for the benefit of protecting our biological and ecological resources.</para><para>The committee is mindful of the roles of state and local governments in environmental protection, but the committee is of the view that strong national leadership with uniform national environmental standards for environmental regulation is the most effective and efficient way to approach environmental regulation. The committee believes that, once minimum national standards are set by the Commonwealth, the accreditation of state and local environmental assessment programs that either meet or beat these standards has a vital role to play in environmental protection in Australia. But the Commonwealth retains approval power for all environment matters of interest to the Commonwealth.</para><para>National standards must be reinforced by improving opportunities for community participation. Accordingly, the committee is recommending open standing provisions to 
 allow public access to the courts in order to test the validity of governmental decisions and restrain breaches of the law and increased funding for conservation groups, such as the environmental defenders offices, EDOs. Finally, as the 20th century draws to a close, the committee recommends changes to the Constitution that would better equip the Commonwealth to play a strong national role in environmental protection into the 21st century.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the work of my colleague Senator Meg Lees, who set up this committee some time ago. I would also like to acknowledge the extraordinary work of the committee secretariat in pulling together this document as well as—as Senator Bolkus has already referred to—so many other references to it over the last few months. I would like to note the work of the Environment Defenders Office of New South Wales, particularly Dr Don Anton for his work in relation to this report.</para><para>I thank all of the people who made contributions to the committee terms of reference and those who appeared before the committee at its various hearings around Australia. It was a most informative process, and I think we have a document which will be a very valuable one in terms of both the description of Commonwealth powers and suggestions for a way forward. I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>5529</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—As I was saying earlier on, I want to start by thanking the secretariat. They had two major reports over the Christmas break—on GST and the environment, as well as the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill—and the presentation of this report was another pressing demand on their agenda. This is an extremely timely report, because the environment is back on the front pages as a national issue. It should also be understood in this place that there are national environment issues which will have to be tackled by national government sooner or later. Some of those issues have international dimensions and some may only have national dimensions, but the reality is that increasingly there are 
 demands on the national parliament to make decisions in respect to the environment.</para></talk.start><para>In terms of national environment issues at the moment, it is significant that we are in a situation where the trend towards greater interest nationally is an irreversible trend. There are international expectations on governments to perform in respect to the environment and those international expectations have direct national implications. There are also issues of a national nature—of land degradation and the like—that require national responses. The environment as a national issue will not just be here while we discuss the environment and the GST or while the Democrats are trying to work out a compromise with the government in respect to such issues. Fundamental environmental issues are emerging or are on the agenda and will not go away.</para><para>Let us start with international issues. The role of the national government in respect to meeting its international commitments was raised by quite a number of people in submissions to this committee in the conduct of this inquiry. Senator Allison was right when she said the overwhelming body of evidence before the committee was that the Commonwealth government had a critical national role to play in terms of the environment. A lot of those submissions concerned meeting international commitments. There are issues such as greenhouse and climate change which need a nationwide response, a national government leadership role and unilateral action. To meet our international obligations, this government needs to be able to act in a way that ensures compliance with such obligations.</para><para>There are issues of a local nature, such as Kakadu, which is already on the international agenda. If an area is listed on the world heritage endangered list, once again that issue will not go away from this agenda and governments and parliaments here will have to tackle ways of trying to redress the consequent damage that will be done to Australia's reputation if action is not taken. Such issues include the Great Barrier Reef, another world heritage area which is increasingly attracting attention because of the environmental degra 
 dation in certain aspects of it. Issues such as that will not go away from the national table.</para><para>We recognise there is a role to play for the Commonwealth government. At a time when those issues are growing and are not going away, the advice and the submissions to the committee indicate that we are quite fortunate that the constitutional capacity of the national government to act has been defined and expanded over the last 30 years or so. There have been critical constitutional cases, dealing with south-west Tasmania, Daintree and other areas, which have seen the High Court define once and for all the extension of Commonwealth powers in respect to the environment to be based on the external affairs power, corporations power, export control powers and the like. That those functions and responsibilities can be based on those powers has been one of the most fundamental findings of constitutional law development over the last 30 years or so.</para><para>We are concerned that those powers are recognised and that the functions flowing from those powers are accepted. We do not accept the government's view and its concern that the Commonwealth acts on the basis of what the government calls `ad hoc triggers'. Those so-called ad hoc triggers are the triggers that have provided the foundation for the protection of so much of Australia's wilderness and so many critical areas like Daintree and Kakadu over recent years. We would contend and disagree with the chair's recommendations in respect to the establishment of a constitutional law experts commission. We contend that powers have been defined by the highest court in this land over the last 25 or 30 years and those powers are there for the Commonwealth to use. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, the establishment of a constitutional law commission would not resolve anything further. Cases would still be resolved in the courts and the political issues would still have currency in this place and on a state level.</para><para>The timing of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill also attracted a lot of attention from people making submissions with respect to this inquiry. Quite a number of submitters felt that this 
 particular bill should await the presentation of the report at the end of the deliberations of this committee. I have had that view and increasingly have it, given the nature and complexity of that legislation. It has to be placed on the record that we are talking about a bill which goes in the other direction from what this committee is recommending—a bill that basically devolves responsibilities for the environment to the states, that carries some 17 major escape clauses to flick off Commonwealth responsibilities and give them back to states, and that, through its bilateral network and framework, would ensure that so much of what has been protected over the last 20 years would not be able to be protected by federal government intervention if the legislation the government has before the Senate goes ahead.</para><para>It is not a surprise that the government want to do that because, consistently and traditionally, they have always had the view that protection of the environment should go back to the states with respect to the areas about which the major High Court cases and the major battles have been fought over the last two or three decades. It is surprising, though, that the Australian Democrats have not put on the record their opposition to a second reading of that legislation. We oppose that legislation because we think it goes in the wrong direction. We think it goes in a direction contrary to the direction that the chair of the committee, Senator Allison, indicated just a few minutes ago. We can see the fundamental flaws in it, we can see the fundamental connection between that legislation and where the environment movement in this country wants to take environmental protection, but we cannot understand why the Australian Democrats are still playing footsies with the government with respect to this legislation.</para><para>How will you overcome that fundamental connection? How will you overcome that fundamental conflict between the national action with respect to the environment and the government's framework legislation, which has so many escape clauses that a national response would be rendered inoperative? We are concerned that, in the current discussions between the Democrats and the government on the GST, we not only will get a sell-out on 
 the environment but might get a bargain basement sale. It has to be recognised that the legislation before us is in direct conflict with where national responsibility should be for the environment. For the Democrats to be entertaining a compromise with the government on a fundamental piece of legislation like that shows a great degree of naivety. It is almost like children playing with matches. You cannot win in compromising on that legislation. At the moment, the environment movement needs a very clear statement from the Democrats that their opposition to the legislation will not be compromised by any negotiations that are going on with respect to the GST.</para><para>There is a national role. There is a role for national unilateral action, but there is a greater responsibility for the national government to ensure that there is cooperation not just by states but also by local government and an enhanced role for local government in the protection of the environment. That is another area where the Labor Party has put its position on the record in a minority report of this committee, a report which defines a role for local government that is increasing into the future as well. I commend those senators who were involved to a greater extent than I was in the considerations and deliberations of this committee in the preparation of this report and congratulate the chair for her work as well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>5531</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Environment Powers </inline> brings up an important opportunity to look at what is happening in this great country of ours as far as the environment is concerned, and it is a tragedy. The Howard government has sought and is seeking to engage in a process of dismantling not only the Commonwealth powers but its responsibilities to the environment at a time when the environment is of major concern to all Australians, not least young Australians. It is a time when all the opinion polls show that, if you ask young Australians—people under 25—what the most important issue on their agenda for the future 
 is, the environment streets the field. Yet we have in process what is essentially a movement by the Howard government and the unfortunate Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Robert Hill, to transfer the powers over our environment back to state governments, as they were in the 1950s, and more and more, through secret processes, to the corporate sector. This is a major process of `greenwash', of green beads being put around this process which is enormously threatening to the environment.</para></talk.start><para>This report helps illuminate this process, but I am afraid it is not going to help change it. Let me join the call from Senator Bolkus of the Labor Party, who has just urged the Democrats to come out strongly and clearly against the forthcoming environmental legislation which is going to sell out on the environment movement's aspirations to have the Commonwealth responsible for what is happening to the forests, the arid lands, the seas and the biodiversity of this country.</para><para>Senator Allison read out the lead-in to this report. There is one thing there that I want to repeat. She said:</para><para>. . . the Convention on Biological Diversity and the external affairs power enables the Commonwealth to unilaterally promulgate national requirements for the environmental impact assessment of all proposed projects, regardless of jurisdiction, likely to have a significant impact on the biological diversity anywhere in Australia.</para><para>Let me paraphrase that. The Commonwealth can protect Australia's environment. It can protect every species. It can protect every important tree. It can protect every acre of coastline. It can protect every marine ecosystem. All those long words mean is that the Commonwealth has that power; but, instead of using it, it is selling out that power. On page xv of the committee report, recommendation 15 says:</para><para>The Commonwealth should ensure that an assessment of World Heritage values is required in the early stages of the Regional Forests Agreement (RFA) process.</para><para>Let us look at what is happening in Tasmania. Such a report on the world heritage values of the forests was done. But today, as we sit in this Senate, the bulldozers and the chainsaws are into those world heritage value forests, 
 cutting them down. They are cutting down dozens of coupes in the Great Western Tiers, the Well Valley, the Picton Valley, the Huon Valley and the valley of the tallest trees of the Southern Hemisphere, the Sticks Valley. Today, a cable logging machine is ripping down world heritage value forests. And what will this report do to stop that? What will the Democrats do to stop that? Are they going to support this devolution of power back to the state government in the case of Tasmania's Bacon Labor government, which has given authority to the bulldozers of the woodchipping corporations to wreak havoc on those forests and their wildlife?</para><para>This is a time for environmentalists and their representatives in this place not only to speak out but to insist that the government change direction. This report finds that the federal government has, and has always had, the power to protect Australia's environment. Greenpeace, in a submission to this committee, pointed to the corporations power—a power which gives the federal government the ability to direct corporations to protect the environment. Former Prime Minister Hawke thought about using this power in 1985 to protect the very same Tasmanian forests that I am talking about and then backed off. The power is there and it ought to be used in the interests of this nation, but it is not because the corporate sector frightens the big parties so much. The trade and commerce power, the taxation power, the specific purposes grants and loans power, the federal spending powers and the external affairs powers are all there. But we are now faced with a situation where the Commonwealth wants to put those powers under the cushion and sit on them while it hands away its responsibilities to state and territory governments.</para><para>There is very little analysis of this process in the press. I think it is time that the gallery took up this issue. It does concern Australians. We are facing this year—it is on the agenda of the Senate now—legislation which is going to throw the environment to the wolves, to the resource extractors. I might add that, at the same time, we are looking at a GST package where the Democrats went to the table with a $1 billion gift in diesel fuel 
 rebate at the outset to those very same entities. It is a parlous situation for the Australian environment. It is an extraordinary situation. It is the darkest political hour for the Australian environment at least, when we look back in history, since the early 1970s. This report ought to be analysed not for what is not there but for what is there, which is the specific statement, if you read through the big words, saying, `The Commonwealth has the powers to protect the environment.' We must act to safeguard those powers and to insist that they be used.</para><para>I endorse again that call by Senator Bolkus to the Democrats. I understand that negotiations are taking place at the moment with the government on that legislation. That is very worrying indeed. I suggest to the Democrats that they spend more time negotiating with the environment movement about its fears on this legislation. It cannot be fixed up, it needs opposing, and to come in here with a series of amendments to try to make it good is to make the same mistake that they have made tactically in believing that they can come in here with a series of amendments which will somehow make the GST package good. This is an appeal to the Democrats from both the Greens and the Labor Party to get back on track on the environment to ensure that we use the numbers in this place in the coming months to get the government back on track with its responsibility to 18 million Australians, particularly young Australians, to use its powers to defend the environment of this country of ours at a time when we all know that the world's environment, the planetary environment, is undergoing the greatest denouement, the greatest degradation, since the dinosaurs went to extinction 65 million years ago.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>5532</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is not a lack of powers at the Commonwealth level in relation to the environment, but there clearly is a lack of political will. This is not something that has been newly discovered by this current government; it is an issue that came up on a number of occasions with the previous government. It is perhaps more obvious with the current government because they seem to think the 
 environment is simply a matter of land management and that they can sheet it off as a states rights issue. It then ends up being an argument about who has the rights to destroy the environment, who has the rights to do whatever they darn well like with the environment because somehow they own it. The reality is that we do not own the environment. We are on earth to look after and nurture the environment. It is not a matter of whether we own it; it is a matter of whether we are stewards of that which is the future and not just have the ability to rip out profits now for the present. I do not think the government has understood that in any way, shape or form.</para></talk.start><para>I did not have the ability to follow through the hearings of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee because of my other time commitments, but I note that a minority report was submitted by government senators Tierney and Payne. They talk about authoritarian centralism, but I am afraid they have missed the point of the message that was clearly given by many witnesses to this inquiry. The point was that they want all levels of government to take an environmental responsibility. It is my clear belief—because there is this excuse built into our current constitutional basis, which was set up over 100 years ago, that the environment was not specifically mentioned—we need to clarify the Constitution. Quite clearly, the High Court has indicated that the powers that exist with the Commonwealth now are quite sufficient for the Commonwealth to be involved in ecological sustainability. What we need is the political will.</para><para>When we gave Labor the chance to vote on issues such as the D'Entrecasteaux national park they chose not to do it. They said they would support it but then chose not to bring it to a vote, so the political will was lacking there. The issue now is one of bringing that political will to a head. Unfortunately, we are in a crisis with the environment at the moment. It is a crisis of bloody-mindedness, neglect and short-term economic issues over long-term ecological sustainability, and I am afraid I will not be here long enough to see 
 that crisis through. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>5533</page.no><id.no>r636</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r635</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r637</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (UNIVERSAL SERVICE LEVY) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r633</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>NRS LEVY IMPOSITION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r634</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>5533</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 22 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Minchin</inline>:</para><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para><para>(Quorum formed)</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>5533</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the government's package of telecommunications bills, of which the main thrust is the full privatisation of Telstra.

In 1996, on the traded vote of Senator Colston, who was offered the job of being then Deputy President of the Senate, the coalition was able to achieve its objective of the one-third privatisation of Telstra. When the full privatisation was put before the parliament just before the last election, Senator Colston voted against it, so the bill for the full privatisation was defeated.</para><para>The issues we in the opposition raised in opposing the one-third privatisation, with the support of the Democrats and the Greens, are still relevant today. One of the issues we raised during the inquiry into the one-third privatisation of Telstra was the fact that the government was demonstrably undervaluing the asset. I remember evidence given by Professor Quiggan which was laughed at by government senators on the committee at the time. The minister, Senator Alston, attempted to discredit Professor Quiggan when the professor said he thought the full value of Telstra would be at least between $55 billion and $60 billion, therefore one-third would be around $20 billion plus. It was argued that he did not know what he was talking about. `He is ideologically opposed to privatisation. He would say that, wouldn't he?' were the remarks made by the minister and by government senators on the committee.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Remember what he said about the Commonwealth Bank?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—He has subsequently been proven to be absolutely correct.

The louder the noise the Parliamentary Secretary makes indicates the weaker the case the government has for full privatisation. At the one-third privatisation we had a guarantee that a third of the shares would be sold and allocated to overseas interests. Overseas stockbroking companies made millions and millions of dollars selling. On a number of occasions we were told by the minister that we had to get overseas expertise into the shareholding of running Telstra; that is why one-third was allocated. So what did we find? A day after they got the shares and the price went up, those interests in America sold their shares and made a killing. They weren't interested in providing expertise in improving the telecommunications system in Australia. They took their profit in a day and disappeared forever.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This government's administration of the process was shameful. Not only did they allow for the diddling of the Australian public—by $14 billion—but also they allowed foreign interests to walk off with a capital profit in 24 hours.

They know it is unpopular, particularly in rural Australia. At the last federal election two senators from the National Party lost their seats. Two parties, further to the right than the government on some issues, on this issue campaigned against them. The One Nation party opposed the privatisation of Telstra. One of the reasons? That party, unfortunately, got a lot of support in rural Australia. So we know why the government is sensitive about it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to return to the issue of the value of Telstra. The government under the arrangements in this bill have said that up to two per cent of the gross proceeds of what they get from the sale can go as fees and charges to the stockbroking companies and the institutional and financial advisers who are going to be in charge of the privatisation process. If the two-thirds is sold for the price which the market now values it at, at around $50 billion plus, that means that two per cent, over $1 billion, could be available to stockbroking firms and financial advisers both inside and outside Australia.</para><para>A billion dollars. How many hospitals would that build? How many aged care centres would that improve? How many high schools would that improve? How many research centres at universities would that build? All of those things could be done with a billion dollars. But no, this government wants to give it to its mates in the financial sector. No wonder that group is cheering in the newspapers every day, saying: `We support the privatisation of Telstra.' They want to get their hands in the public till and get their fees and charges, worth up to a billion dollars, in the process. I think all ordinary Australians would agree that there is a better way to spend a billion dollars of the public's assets than giving it in fees and charges to the stockbroking community, including international stockbrokers.</para><para>The issue here is about what we see as our telecommunications system in a country the size of Australia, with 18 million people 
 sparsely spread across this massive continent. We are a lucky country in that we have a continent to ourselves, but it is a sparsely populated continent. The opposition would say that all Australians, wherever they live, having adequate access to reasonable telecommunications is a fundamental right, not something that governments or the community can choose not to provide.</para><para>We all know that in the 21st century if you do not have access, wherever you are, to up-to-date communications systems, you will be disadvantaged socially and economically. A phrase that has been used before is that, in the next century, there will be groups of people who will be information rich and information poor. There will be new terminology for the definition of poverty.</para><para>We have to ensure that all Australian citizens, wherever they are, are not accidentally made poor by being prohibited from having access to the latest communications systems. In a country of our size, with only 18 million people, that is a big ask with respect to delivery. If you let the free market decide it alone, it will mean that Sydney, Melbourne and the other capital cities will have the up-to-date system but the rural and outback areas will not, or they will only get it if a higher price is charged which will make it uneconomic for them to use, whether it is for business or for social communication. We in the opposition believe that this is a fundamental issue about keeping Australia together. If you do not have a communications system that can provide that equally to all, you disadvantage some citizens. This is an issue of equity as much as it is an issue of economics or privatisation.</para><para>Some people claim that because we have a competitive market in communications it is therefore impossible to have public ownership. We in the opposition have never subscribed to that view. We believe that the communications system has been improved for all Australians by allowing competition—setting up rules that allow other people to compete with Telstra. But we know that, if you remove Telstra from public ownership, in the long run there will be no-one there at the behest of the public to provide the service to 
 all Australians. That is why maintaining Telstra in public ownership is so important. All Australians, each day of their lives, need to have access to the telecommunications network that Telstra built as an investment when it was fully government owned, on behalf of all Australian people.</para><para>Other public enterprises in the past have been privatised. The issue of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas has been raised. The fundamental difference is that Qantas provides a service, on a daily basis, which fewer than two or three per cent of Australians regularly use. Qantas is not an operation—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Two million frequent fliers in this country.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—But I have to say that because of the way in which the civil aviation market works, there are plenty of other opportunities in other companies. Qantas does not provide the service every day that Telstra provides to every citizen in this country. It is the same with the Commonwealth Bank: it has only about 20 per cent of the financial market. Eighty per cent of Australians choose not to use it. Eighty per cent of Australians have to use Telstra's network at some stage each day when they make a phone call, even if they are going through Optus or one of the other competitors. Overwhelmingly, they have to interconnect to Telstra's network.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Often in these debates in recent times, with the ideology of this government, public interest seems to be given a great big miss. Public interest is the issue that we in this parliament should always be fundamentally concerned about. It is in the public interest to hold Telstra in majority public ownership.</para><para>We have accepted that one-third has gone. We accepted at the last election that we will not be able to buy back that one-third; it will stay in private ownership. But we know that, as soon as you give away majority ownership and remove the right of the minister to use the power to direct Telstra in the public interest, Telstra will shift to a different form of operation. It will shift to an operation driven only by profit. That is what a privately owned company is about. The issue of providing public interest is not high in its priorities. 
 And why should it be? That is the difference between the private and the public sectors.</para><para>If you are a farmer on the western plains of New South Wales or in the mid-north of South Australia, your public interest, your economic interest, is to ensure that in the future you have access to the best telecommunications system which everyone else is using. If we want to be a clever, modern country, that is what we must have. They know; that is why there is such strong opposition in the rural areas of Australia to the privatisation of Telstra. That is why some members of the coalition government who represent those outback areas are strongly opposed to the privatisation of Telstra. Mr Katter, the member for Kennedy, and Mrs De-Anne Kelly, the member for Dawson, representing outback areas of Queensland, are on the record as saying that they oppose the privatisation of Telstra. When they are asked why they oppose it, they say, `We know what will happen: the service will get worse, the costs will go up, people will lose their jobs and the service will be reduced.' They also say that, overwhelmingly, their constituents who vote for them to represent them in this parliament do not want them to vote for Telstra's privatisation.</para><para>On this occasion, the view overwhelmingly in the bush cannot be ignored. There are enough difficulties in the economic future of regional and rural Australia without running the risk of reducing the one area of service that provides an opportunity for these areas to have an economic future—that is, access to the full, modern communications system. We do not want to take that risk. The government is willing to take that risk because it is ideologically obsessed with this issue and wants to go to full privatisation.</para><para>The government has said it will have some form of private inquiry into or review of services to the bush before privatisation proceeds. I am not sure whether a further sale of 16 per cent is covered by this review, or whether the review will automatically take place even before 16 per cent is sold. That is unclear. At the moment, maybe the government is negotiating with Independent senators about that. What they have put up here, as we 
 had last time, is a joke. The review would take place and make comments, but it would not hold up the privatisation process—that will take place anyway. It is already in the budget papers, before this legislation has been passed. All the budget estimates and outlays for the next four years are predicated on the full privatisation of Telstra.</para><para>So the government has made its intention clear. Any review of the services provided by Telstra is irrelevant according to the budget papers. There will be a very interesting discussion in the estimate hearings in the next two weeks about how the government can put those estimates in without the review being conducted and without any outcome being known. It is a charade and most people in rural and regional Australia know it. Most ordinary Australians know it. Most ordinary Australians, even those who own shares, do not want a majority of Telstra sold. They want to keep it in public ownership because they know that privatisation now means three things: increased charges, reduced services and a loss of jobs. That is what the sale of one-third of Telstra did. Something like 25,000 jobs went out the window. There was no excuse made by Mr Blount and others that this is the outcome in order to make a more competitive Telstra—to meet the challenge of providing a competitive service to improve profit. The profit is already substantial. The profit should remain year in, year out—going back to the bottom line of the budget—to provide increased services. We announced that policy at the last election.</para><para>The ordinary members of our community know deep in their souls that to sell all of Telstra would be a fraud on their public interest. In this Senate, we have to be very careful how we vote—that we do not allow Australia's greatest national asset to be sold off at a whim to meet the ideological obsessions of this government.</para><para>We have been told that there is privatisation occurring in many countries. That is true. But I note that, although a lot of countries have sold a part of their telecommunications companies, many of them are reluctant to sell the lot. Many of them are still holding a majority of those companies in public owner 
 ship. Most of them in Western Europe, with a couple of exceptions, still have in one form or another public influence or public majority ownership. They know their own people do not want it. They know that there is a risk to the public interest if you sell the lot because communications, telecommunications and all the new systems are fundamentally going to organise and affect the way our societies are run. Therefore, the opposition maintains its unequivocal opposition to any further sale of Telstra. We have opposed it from when the legislation first appeared in this place in 1996, and we continue to oppose it. I hope again on this occasion there is a majority in the Senate to oppose this very awful bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>5538</page.no><name role="metadata">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Reynolds)</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before calling the next speaker in this debate, I want to read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  a section from chapter 10 of <inline font-style="italic">Odger's Australian Senate Practice</inline> , in relation to clarification of the use of certain words in this place.

The most significant of the five bills in the package is the <inline ref="r637">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998</inline> . This is the bill that sells Telstra and privatises what is an 
 essential part of Australia's national infrastructure. This bill contains the provisions which enable 16 per cent of Telstra to be sold, an inquiry to be held and, subject to the findings of that inquiry, the balance of Telstra—the other 51 per cent of Telstra that would not be in public ownership—to be put on the auction block.</para></talk.start><para>We are coming to the point of no return with this bill. Once we go beyond this bill, if it is carried, Telstra inevitably and inexorably will go to full private ownership because the so-called device of the inquiry is a flawed device. No-one with any credibility believes that that device will result in there being proper pause, proper consideration and a proper decision that Telstra should not be sold. It is seen by everyone, and reasonably, that it is a device to get over the objections of the National Party and to nonetheless achieve the government's goal of full private ownership for Telstra.</para><para>You would have to be very credible—indeed, you would have to be very gullible—to believe that that device was anything other than a device for the full sale of Telstra. The bloke that tried to sell me the Sydney Harbour Bridge the other day—the guy with slicked back hair in the white suit, the black shirt and the red tie—is about as credible on the subject of selling me the Sydney Harbour Bridge as the government is on selling to the community of Australia that Telstra would not go into full private ownership if this bill were passed.</para><para>As far as this debate over Telstra is concerned, we have arrived at the point of no return, and because of that I want to briefly summarise the main reasons why the Australian Labor Party has consistently stood four square in opposition to the full sale of Telstra. We did so and made it a part of our party platform at the last federal election. We do not need to be kept honest; we are honest. By pursuing this goal, there is no-one here who can describe us as bastards because we are consistent and principled in this debate.</para><para>There are three points that need to be put on the record by way of emphasis—they are on the record now. Senator Bishop and others in this debate have articulated the Labor Party 
 position with great care and considerable persuasion over the course of this debate. Stephen Smith, the Labor Party's spokesperson on communications, has done so consistently in the other chamber and publicly for the whole of the time since the last election when this matter has been subject to political scrutiny and consideration in Australia.</para><para>The three reasons why the Australian Labor Party opposes the full sale of Telstra, and indeed the selling down to 49 per cent of Telstra—that is, an additional sale of another 16 per cent—are these. Firstly, Telstra is a fundamental and important part of Australia's national infrastructure. It needs to be in public ownership. Put it in full private ownership and you remove from the nation an opportunity to build on a fundamental part of our national infrastructure. Secondly, since the partial privatisation of Telstra, service levels that Telstra has provided the Australian community around this nation, most importantly in Tasmania, have fallen consistently and hard. Thirdly, Telstra is a contributor to the national economy in both its efficient operation and as a payer of dividends to the national budget and the government which can then be dispersed to the community for the national good.</para><para>There is a two-card trick here. The government is proposing a bonus system and has announced that when it sells Telstra it will provide these bonuses to the community. The superior proposition is that of Labor. During the election, we announced a Telstra reward scheme. The difference between the two points of view is that if you sell the farm you make a quid and you distribute some of that to the community, but if you keep the farm and keep a productive, ongoing entity, you have a continuous income stream which you can divert in perpetuity for the national good. Balance a one-off hit against a continuing benefit: that is the difference between our two proposals. In summary: national important infrastructure, we want service levels to go up—to go north, not south—and we want to ensure that there is a continuing benefit to the national good, not a one-off hit.</para><para>When these bills come before the chamber for the vote at the second reading stage, my colleague Senator Bishop will be asking that the  Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998  come to an independent vote, not a cognate vote. He will be asking that for the very strong reason that we in the Australian Labor Party intend to vote against it. We want to be recorded in the annals of the Senate as voting against it because that is our position. We hope to persuade this chamber that it should join us in voting down this bill. As far as the other bills in this package are concerned, we are on the record about those—we will be voting for them.</para><para>Let me make a few supporting remarks about what I have just now put to the chamber, the three reasons for our opposition: the important and fundamental part of national infrastructure that Telstra represents; the importance of keeping service standards up and not, as happens in privatisation, forcing service standards down to the lowest common denominator and particularly dudding the bush and regional Australia; and maintaining an in-perpetuity reward to the Australian community, not a one-off bribe that the government wants.</para><para>Taking the first question first, the important part of Australia's national infrastructure, in many respects this is a self-evident argument. You only have to consider the significance to industry, to the commercial activities of this nation and to the heartbeat of our economy to understand the significance to economic growth of an efficient communication service like Telstra. But it is wider than that. The Labor Party would particularly identify the human dimension of the importance of Telstra as a service, not as a profit taker; that is, it puts the Australian community in touch with one another. It brings families together, is part of our social life and is fundamental to the wellbeing and social intercourse of this nation. In private ownership, where it is run for a profit and a return to shareholders, then that becomes the ruling ethic, not the service which is necessary for such an essential part of national infrastructure.</para><para>Concerning the service levels, what we forecast when the original privatisation bill 
 came before the chamber has in fact occurred. The government will obfuscate, the government will juggle the figures, the government will justify Mark Twain's adage that there are `Lies, damn lies and statistics' by pretending that, as best it can present it, the service levels are retained at superior levels under the privatisation banner. Anyone who takes the time to examine the facts will see that the truth is they have declined significantly and the worse hit segment of Australia is regional and rural Australia, that part of this nation which this government proclaims ritually—like a mantra—at question time in this chamber that it is concerned about. Certainly, it is concerned about it. It is concerned to dud it, if its performance on Telstra is any guide.</para><para>Importantly, we want to see the service component of Telstra remain enshrined. You can do that, as the government will now say, by providing particular provisions in the Telstra bill which will ensure that that occurs, and you can do it by regulating that that occurs.</para><para>But what is the empirical evidence here? The evidence is of decline and of scarcer and less reliable services to the bush—scarcer and less reliable services and a slower turnaround time in meeting service demands for regional and rural Australia. That is the record and, whichever way you cut it, that is the final conclusion in terms of the service provision of Telstra. It is not surprising that is the case because what we have here is an inherent contradiction. We have an inherent contradiction that an entity which is partly privatised has making a profit for its shareholders as its ruling objective. An entity in those terms will always aim to maximise the bottom line and the provision of return to the shareholders. That is a definition of private enterprise—to do that—but in doing that, you exploit the most profitable routes and you cut back on the unprofitable routes in order to get a bigger return for redistribution to the shareholders, keep the share price up and encourage a greater dividend to shareholders.</para><para>We are taking that entity and applying it to a service industry that should provide the same level of service right across the economy. You cannot take oil and water, mix 
 them together and say that what you have got is something that works. As long as you have got a degree of private ownership and protection for minority shareholders in our Corporations Law, as we have and as we appropriately should have, you have got an entity—whatever the provisions in its act are—that will seek to maximise profit and, to do so, will withdraw from maximising services. That is the essential contradiction and that is why, empirically, the truth is that, since the partial privatisation of Telstra, service provisions in the unprofitable areas have declined. That is why I said inexorably they will continue to do so.</para><para>Turning to the final of Labor's three key points: the question of reward to the Australian community. The Swedes have a saying, `Is it better to slaughter the cow or to milk it?' They have that saying when they debate what is the best way of receiving the greatest outcome for their domestic economy; when they debate whether or not particular industries should be privatised; and when they debate how they balance that against public obligation—is it better to slaughter the cow or to milk it? We are very much in the `milk it' category; we are not in the `slaughter it' category. If you slaughter the Telstra cow, you can sell the meat and make a quid and perhaps invest that money in some community services, but that is the end of it. If you milk the cow, you can get an ongoing revenue stream which will benefit the community and benefit your enterprise.</para><para>The reason why we are strongly in this camp is that Telstra pays an annual dividend and, as long as Telstra is in public ownership, it will continue to pay that dividend. That dividend can then be distributed to the community on an ongoing basis; not a one-off hit. I know the government has tried to blind the Australian community by taking the bribe route rather than the ongoing dividend route. If you take the current assessed values of Telstra you would say that all up it is a $80 billion concern. Selling 16 per cent of it would probably yield in the market somewhere around $25 billion to $30 billion. How much are they going to give back to the Australian community? Well, out of $25 
 billion to $30 billion, they are going to give back to the community $671 million—that is the so-called benefit to the community—and they are going to use the rest of it for government revenue.</para><para>Even it you believe the bribe route, this is a pretty pallid form of bribe in terms of what is coming back to the Australian community. But how do they hide that? They hide it by saying, `Well, look, there are five areas in which we are going to give this money back.' They spread a little jam a long way to pretend that everyone is going to get a benefit but, when you actually look at it, the total value of that benefit is infinitesimal compared to the total return to the government. This is a way of blinding people by nominating five different areas, which makes it seem that everyone is going to get a slice of the pie. What they do not tell you is that the slice of the pie is a very thin, narrow, wafer-like slice anyway and nothing like what a government that actually believed what it said would do if it was sincere, genuine and honest with the community about distributing that dividend. Compare that to the ongoing revenue stream that Labor supports and you can see in a trice how effective our approach to managing this major public asset is.</para><para>I conclude by again summarising the reasons why Labor opposes this bill—the reasons stated by my colleague Senator Bishop back when this debate started in March—the reasons for Labor opposing the further privatisation of Telstra. I have named three reasons; there are probably four, the fourth one being this is the point of no return.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">ALSTON</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name></talker><para>—You said that last time.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—Yes, I am summarising and I am glad that you are listening.

 bill is carried—inevitably, as night follows day, privatisation of Telstra becomes 100 per cent, not 49 per cent. The so-called review is simply a blind to lull people into believing that somehow you are considering the issues when this will be the greatest piece of a con job that we have seen. That would be the first reason. Secondly, this is a nationally important part of Australia's infrastructure. Thirdly, under the partial privatisation, service levels have declined, particularly in regional and rural Australia—notably in Tasmania. Under full privatisation, Telstra will continue to go south; we want it to go north—we want service levels to improve. Maintaining public ownership is a way of doing that because it does not conflict with the profit motive in the same way. Fourthly, the Telstra reward scheme that we announced at the last election ensures an ongoing benefit to Australia, not a one-off bribe which will leave Australians gasping as the losers at the end of the day.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>5541</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The legislation that we are dealing with at the present moment does envisage the full sale of Telstra. In other words, there are provisions in this legislation which are designed to lead to the full sale of Telstra. Let me make it perfectly clear, as I have done to the government and to the public: I am not prepared to vote for the full privatisation of Telstra. I do not intend to support any move that would see majority control pass from public hands to private hands, and I hope that the Senate would not. How this will be done I am not too sure. As far as I can see, the best way to do it would be to excise that part of the legislation completely. Leaving that aside, the question then arises as to whether there should be an additional partial sale of 16 per cent up to the 49 per cent level. There are a number of issues to be considered. If all things are equal after those issues have been considered, then the decision is easier to make.</para></talk.start><para>The question has just been raised by Senator Cook about the dividend stream issue—the question of debt reduction versus the dividend stream. I have been very interested in this subject for some considerable time, but the latest advice that I have in this matter I am 
 happy to share with the Senate. The advice that I have is as follows: at the close of business on Friday, 21 May 1999 Telstra shares were worth $7.55 each. That value is one-sixth of Telstra at $16.2 billion. I am not sure where Senator Cook got his $25 billion from. Allowing deductions for selling costs and discounts to encourage take-up, the proceeds may be in the order of $15 billion. That would save $889.5 million in annual interest costs based on the 10-year bond rate of 5.93 per cent at close of business on Friday, 21 May.</para><para>Against that, Telstra dividends of around $300 million per annum would be forgone based on the dividend paid, 14c, over the last 12 months. On an earning per share measure, which Professor John Quiggin would prefer, the government would miss out on $534 million. Shareholders in Telstra can also expect their earnings to grow by at least 10 per cent per annum based on recent experience. Might I interpolate here: it has been suggested to me that is rather an overconfident prediction but it may not be. If that continued to be the case into the future, the dividends forgone through the sale of Telstra shares would be equal to the interest savings on government debt in 11.4 years. A number of questions flow from that as to whether or not in the sale of Telstra, or this further 16 per cent, there were better ways of dealing with this matter, given that scenario.</para><para>There have been a number of questions raised, and I will go through them briefly. For example, the effect of the Telstra restructuring on jobs and employment in various areas, including regional areas; the performance of Telstra; the question of decision making, that is, where those decisions are made—I have particular concerns so far as Tasmania's decision making is concerned; and the power and influence of the government over a 51 per cent public owned organisation, and so on.</para><para>Let me deal with, first of all, the question of jobs. Telecommunications is a very high growth area, both in capital and labour. We all know that. Telstra is a significant employer, but as the industry becomes more capital intensive through such technological changes as the elimination of manual exchanges—they 
 are long gone—and the reduction in dependence on traditional copper wire infrastructure, it has become obvious that employment growth will ease or may even decline over time.</para><para>A lot of allegations have been made which have concerned me about the question of its effect on jobs—whether or not the partial privatisation has caused the employment shifts and the restructure in Telstra. I also sought independent advice on that, and the bottom line of that independent advice was that the predominant influences on Telstra employment have been the impact of deregulation and the labour shedding effects of technological change.</para><para>To those on the Labor side who have said, `Oh no, all of this is the result of partial privatisation, of 33 per cent privatisation,' I respectfully say: that is not accurate. You are missing the main ball game if you are dealing with it on that basis; it is best if you sit down and try to get the best you can out of the deregulatory environment which, as I recall, was a decision of the previous Labor government.</para><para>Let me go to the question of employment in the telecommunications services industry in my state of Tasmania. I have figures from February 1997, which is the start of the first year after the float, and February 1999. The figure for employment in telecommunications services in Tasmania in February 1997 was something like 1,100. The figure as at February 1999 was 1,900. I think that is a result of getting down and trying to get the best out of this environment. I acknowledge that there have been considerable changes within the organisation and that deregulation has caused many Telstra employees to make career and lifestyle changes which are not easy and which do concern us. Some of these employees have of course welcomed the packages, but others have not. Nevertheless, there is considerable disruption and, indeed, anxiety.</para><para>I have been carefully monitoring the situation. I have had meetings with the senior management of Telstra in order to minimise job losses. I suggest that you go and compare what has happened in Tasmania, the percentage of job losses there, with any other state 
 on the mainland. I have also been urging Telstra management and the government to create new job opportunities and, most importantly, to cushion as much as possible the impact on employees and their families. It is also of concern to me that deregulation has led to the transfer of executive positions from Tasmania and that many important management decisions affecting Telstra are now not made in Tasmania but in Melbourne or elsewhere. As honourable senators will know, Tasmania is an appendage of rural Victoria under the new set-up. The biggest organisation within Telstra, the Telstra Commercial and Consumer Organisation, is presently divided into regions, and the Tasmanian and country Victorian regions are presently combined into one region. I cannot for the life of me see why the government cannot see the commonsense of having a separate region for the state of Tasmania, particularly in respect of this large commercial and consumer unit. I think that is a reasonable thing. I have put that to both Telstra and the government, and I think that is a matter that should be determined irrespective of this legislation.</para><para>On the question of jobs, let me say to the Senate: have a look at the departments which are fully owned by the Commonwealth. Look at what is happening there. There is outsourcing going on—is that as a result of privatisation? Of course we rail against it, but nothing happens. There is a considerable amount of outsourcing and thus a reduction in jobs or no increases in jobs in a whole range of departments. That is happening in Telstra as well, and would have happened had there been no partial privatisation.</para><para>Despite the upsets and the anxieties within the work force of Telstra in Tasmania, I want to stand here and congratulate those employees. I am compelled to give recognition to the achievements of Telstra's staff throughout Tasmania in meeting some very significant milestones. They have made considerable progress towards meeting its obligations to Tasmanian customers and, in the process, additional jobs have been created. I refer here to a number of achievements, including 90 per cent ISDN deployment; improved mobile phone coverage on the east coast, the Tasman 
 Peninsula, the Huon Valley, Hobart surrounds, Deloraine and Sheffield; the expansion of operator assisted services in Burnie; and the establishment of a new national call centre in Hobart, providing an additional 140 jobs.</para><para>I am concerned about the drift of very skilled jobs from Tasmania. I do hope that Telstra and the government look at this and acknowledge that Tasmania is an intelligent island. It does have the capability to perform a large amount of work, if you have a look at it. It is a congenial place to live, and it would be desirable from the point of view of not only Tasmania but also those who might come to the state and those within the state who would be employed in those areas.</para><para>There has been much talk about the provision of Internet and data services to the bush—to regional areas—and I firmly support any measures designed to improve these services. Under the universal service obligation, all Australians, wherever they live or work, have a legal right to reasonable access on an equitable basis to a standard telephone service and payphones. The number of people using the Internet in country areas is only half that of those using it in the cities. I am not convinced that the provision of better access through improved technology will change that, as I suspect that there are other factors at play, such as demographics. However, I respect the right of all Australians to have access to new technologies, and the more that this can be advanced, by whatever reasonable means, the better.</para><para>There is quite a lot that I need to say, but my time is coming to a close. One needs to wonder whether a 51 per cent holding as against a 66⅔ per cent holding would affect the influence of government on the carrier. I am aware, of course, that certain other countries have 51 per cent holdings, and I have not heard that that has limited the power of their governments to exercise influence. That was a matter which was of concern to me but I am—again, with independent advice—convinced that going from 66⅔ per cent to 51 per cent is not going to affect the power of the government to influence, and the power of direction, of course, is in this legislation. Not that any government of any colour has 
 given directions to Telstra for years and years. It may well be that it needs to be done. With 51 per cent, the organisation would need to pass public scrutiny, including scrutiny of the parliament, estimates committees and so on.</para><para>Whatever is the case before us, I need to consider a number of things. If all things are equal, then the Senate does come into play. We are a house of review. There has been a lot said about the Senate recently. I did hear that one of the things that is being said about the Senate is that it is no longer a states house. If all things are equal on those matters that I have raised, then I intend to exercise my vote as a member of this chamber as a states house.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>5544</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Once again a debate on Telstra has provided an opportunity for an endless exchange of views and arguments. I think one can safely say that the majority of the arguments which have been presented by non-government senators opposing the legislation have one thing in common: they have nothing to do with the ownership of Telstra. Time and again there has been a failure to provide any evidence of a link between issues raised and the ownership of Telstra. The competition regime of which they complain was put in place by none other than Mr Beazley when he was the relevant minister. He was the one responsible for opening up the marketplace, introducing new players and generally putting much more pressure on Telstra to gets its house in order and to become more efficient and competitive in world terms.</para></talk.start><para>There is nothing new about complaints about Telstra's quality of service. In fact, when Senator Boswell and I were in North Queensland last week—before he actually tried to spike my drink—it became abundantly clear that many people have had complaints about Telstra for many years. I do not think that ought to be seen as a reflection on the current administration but rather as a reflection of the frustration of people, particularly outside the metropolitan areas, who want the best possible degree and range of services and have generally until now had to wait in 
 the queue until these benefits, readily available in metropolitan areas, trickled down.</para><para>In fact, I found some quotations from back in the 1970s where the union movement was out there accusing Telstra of being the usual monster: putting profits before people and neglecting quality of service issues. It has always been thus. Telstra has always been the butt of criticism, and in a number of respects that is perfectly understandable. Ever since we have had an independent regulator in the shape of, originally, Austel, there have been quality of service reports released which have indicated that Telstra's performance in a number of critical rural areas has not been what the public in general would expect. But, as Senator Harradine rightly points out, many of these problems and developments occur because of technological change and because of the need to improve productivity performance levels and a concern on the part of Telstra simply not to waste resources.</para><para>We all know you have to get the balance right. We are particularly concerned to ensure that people in rural areas do get a good deal, and for the first time they are in a position to do that. For the first time, in part because of the technological opportunities that are opening up in the wake of what some might call the death of distance, it is now going to be increasingly possible to leapfrog, for rural areas to get immediate access to high speed digital data services and reap the full benefits of the 100 per cent digitalisation of local exchanges. To date the bush has really lacked that combination of technological opportunity and the wherewithal on the part of the carrier to put in place institutional arrangements to generate sufficient income to make a lot of these services commercially attractive. There will always be a USO regime, as we all know and understand and as is supported on all sides of the chamber, but without the capacity to deliver a social bonus of the magnitude that we took into the last election the bush would simply have missed out on a lot of those very important issues.</para><para>I think that many people in the bush are still trying to come to terms with the fact that the Labor Party have never for a moment expressed any sympathy. They have never 
 said, for example, `We urge the government to set up an RTIF but split it from Telstra.' They were simply opposed from the outset. They never at any stage conceded that the bush stood to benefit dramatically from those initiatives.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Mackay interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—Here we go again.

To the extent that the parliament needed to do uneconomic things, it could then do them by legislation and other means. That is why you have a USO. That is why you have untimed local calls. That is why we introduced a customer service guarantee. That is why you have price caps. That is why there is a whole series of market interventions designed to ensure that consumers are not left behind. But, time and again, all we get from the Labor Party is this mantra that they are 
 opposed to privatisation. They see this as a good opportunity to pay back the union movement for all that they have done in getting these otherwise unemployable people into safe spots in the parliament. We remain absolutely committed to ensuring that quality of service continues to rise. And it will, and if it does not then Telstra is under no illusions that the parliament will obviously want to take what action it can to improve those levels of service.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—What will you do?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—We would move in the parliament to introduce new legislative arrangements.

He understands the concerns—many of them valid—that people have about getting access to services. Very interestingly, there was probably more emphasis on getting access to new technologies than there was to simply complaining about installations, faults and repairs. We know that that has been an area of deficiency in the past. That is why we introduced the new regime, tightened the penalties that applied after five days and gave a general power for wilful and persistent 
 breach, to make Telstra liable to fines of up to $10 million. These are potentially draconian measures designed to leave, in this instance, Telstra—because it happens to be the only game in town at present in some of those areas, and certainly it is the universal service carrier—in no doubt that we are prepared to act, if necessary. But I am very confident that Dr Switkowski will ensure that these matters are sympathetically and speedily addressed.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—Like the work management centre in Hobart?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—You can rabbit on about work management as much as you like.

We began with the establishment of the Networking the Nation program from the first tranche of the sale and will continue with the social bonus from the second tranche. These are unique opportunities to inject funds into the telecommunications area and into the lifeblood of rural Australia that have never been available before and would never be made available again.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Carr interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—You had every opportunity over 13 years to do something about the bush but you turned your back on all of those needs. You did not exercise any power of direction. You just simply said, `Too bad.' We do not think that is good enough. We see the opportunity here to do something very sensible. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We do not accept the option of using the power of direction for ad hoc interventions. We reject the view that the government's shareholding should be used as the basis of a nudge-nudge, wink-wink approach to make Telstra do this or that. One of things that really scared the pants off the entire industry was Senator Schacht wandering around and saying, `If necessary, don't you worry. If we think that there are no services in areas of sensitivity—that is code, of course, for marginal seats—we will simply make sure that Telstra puts them in. We do not give a damn about profits. This is a big bad multinational and we will fix it right up, don't you worry.' He might have thought that played well at branch meetings and some of the few marginal rural seats that the Labor Party still holds, but it sent an absolute shiver down the spine of anyone with a responsible approach. I would be amazed if his successor even contemplated flirting with that sort of approach in public.</para><para>We should all remember who decided to turn Telstra into a Corporations Law company: Mr Beazley and his cohorts back in 1991. We also reject the view that the taxpayers' interests are best served by our sitting on a large non-core asset such as Telstra. Telstra's dividends are not extra money to spend on wish lists. As you well know, they have always been available for general appropriations to meet essential services, to the extent that you argue that that money ought to be earmarked for telecommunications matters. In that case, you have an obligation to identify where else you would make the cuts.</para><para>Quite clearly, we are concerned to ensure that the money is applied in the best possible manner. No-one should be under any illusions about the intensity of competition in this area. As a monopolist 10 years ago and as a company exposed to competition now as a voice carrier, Telstra suddenly finds the market shifting beneath its feet. Those who are not concentrating largely on mobile data services will probably find that they can be rendered irrelevant, irrespective of their size. That is why you are finding that even massive telcos in the US are coming together in mergers and 
 joint ventures. Don't be under any illusions that somehow this will be an ongoing dividend stream which you can milk for recurrent purposes; it is not. It may well be that now is the best time to capitalise that dividend stream and ensure that the more rosy projections of future growth can be captured in the sale price.</para><para>I have talked about the $671 million in savings through the social bonus program. Once again, that has been received with enormous enthusiasm in rural areas. The only thing that has surprised them is the fact that the Labor Party has been totally uninterested in the clear and obvious benefits that flow from untimed local calls in outer extended zones, continuous mobile coverage on major highways, broadcasting black spots and the roll-out of SBS. These are all absolutely essential initiatives which have been met with a total lack of interest by the Labor Party. I think we all know where the Labor Party stands on this issue.</para><para>I note that Senator Bishop said during the debate that the government should keep Telstra in public ownership to retain the right to direct Telstra on matters of service and technology in rural Australia. The government is not able to use its majority ownership of Telstra for that purpose. Service and technology levels can be, and are being,  addressed transparently through the regulatory regime and through measures such as the social bonus. We will always stand ready to take legislative and other action to ensure that minimum standards are met. Indeed, the whole approach we are taking in terms of expanding the USO to accommodate digital data capability is a classic example of how we are meeting the very genuine concerns expressed by Senator Harradine and others that the bush should not be denied access to new technologies. You know as well as we do that employment levels are unrelated to privatisation.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Mackay interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—You well know that the downsizing of Telstra commenced long before privatisation was on the books in this country. You know that at that time the OECD considered that there was something 
 like a 30 per cent gap between Australia's performance and world's best practice. You know that Telstra has an absolute obligation to its shareholders, whether they be private shareholders or the government, to make sure that it gets the best possible rate of return. Over and above that, it understands the rules of the game: governments will always reserve the right to have a legal and regulatory framework that puts consumers first. We have made no bones about that. We have said all along that maximising revenue from Telstra was not our main game in terms of privatisation. We remain very much committed to the opportunities that competition will provide to introduce new services and to keep forcing prices down as it has in recent years around the world. But we will not stop there if we feel there is a need to take further legislative or other action.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In all of this debate, we have had the classic schizophrenia: Telstra was portrayed as an icon of the benefits of public ownership, kindly benevolent and rich, to be kept in public hands at all costs; on the other hand, it was portrayed as a ruthless market predator, indifferent to consumers and interested only in the almighty dollar. That has been a recurrent approach. We reject both of those ways of portraying Telstra. The truth is that Telstra is neither a welfare fund nor a robber baron; it is a very large company in a cutting edge business which is critical to Australia's broad economic development.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—It is non-core, according to you!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—I do not think you know what you are talking about there.

The Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Amendment Bill 1998  is manifestly not a bill imposing taxation.

The proposed amendments include a digital data service obligation in the universal service regime.</para><para>The government has long recognised that equitable access to advanced telecommunications services for regional Australia is a vitally important issue. Of particular concern has been the need to provide data services which operate at acceptable speeds. We announced during the election campaign that we would include in the USO access to ISDN on demand for 96 per cent of the population. For the balance not able to access ISDN on demand, there would be provision of an on- 
 demand, Internet based, asymmetric satellite service that delivered a satellite down-link service comparable to 64 kilobits, together with reimbursement of up to 50 per cent of the price of purchasing the necessary satellite receiving equipment. These amendments give effect to that policy.</para><para>In essence, the amendments insert new provisions to include a digital data service obligation. The amendments provide for a general digital data service to be provided by a general digital data service provider. This is the ISDN equivalent service required to be available to 96 per cent of the population. As well, there will be a special digital data service which will cover the remaining four per cent. Funding arrangements provide for the subsidy to be paid for the equipment necessary to receive the special digital data service, funded by the industry as part of the existing universal service levy arrangements.</para><para>Provisions requiring the development of digital data service plans have also been applied to the digital data service obligation, as have price control arrangements, providing the government with the flexibility to intervene. In addition, these amendments include amendments consequential to the main digital data service obligation. They have therefore been prepared in the form of the request referred to by the Chairman.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>5562</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to make a few general comments concerning the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Bill and then make some general comments in respect of the specific amendments moved by the government. This bill is about the consumer service guarantee, USO and service standards. These principles, which the ALP holds dearly, are very close to the heart of rural and regional Australia. They are threefold: universality, affordability and accessibility of telecommunications services.</para></talk.start><para>Until recently telephone services have been the phone in the home, public phones and the odd fax machine. An array of potential services is now coming onto the marketplace. In the main they are driven by technical technology—an example is data feed. People are interested in having access to those services. 
 It doesn't matter whether they live in our major cities, the suburbs of our major cities or in the most remote parts of our continent; all people are becoming aware of those services and they regard it as their right to have access to them. Those principles of universality, affordability and accessibility of minimum service standards are very important to rural and regional Australia. Indeed, they are so important that they have been incorporated into the national platform of our party.</para><para>Turning to the key amendments moved by the government, such as the extension of the USO to include provision of digital data at 64 kilobits or a level equivalent upon demand, the government is proposing to implement its 1998 election commitment. The government chooses to ignore, and hopes that no-one remembers, its 1996 election commitment. That 1996 election commitment was for provision of data at 64 kilobits to all people in Australia—those in the major cities, in the suburbs of major cities and in all parts of regional and rural Australia, without exception.</para><para>At the time the ALP said this was an aspiration, that you could do it for 95 per cent or 96 per cent of the population but for the rest, the other four per cent, it would be inordinately expensive. At that time we were pilloried up hill and down dale because we were `unreasonable'—we had no trust in technology, we would refuse to give services to rural and regional Australia. But as it has turned out, we were correct.</para><para>Upon coming to government, the coalition commissioned a report. That report, from Mr Shore at the ACA, said that this extension of the USO to the remaining four per cent of the population would cost $800 million. Telstra said it would cost $1.8 billion. Those figures were the figures we had identified as the real cost. The coalition had pooh-poohed them, but when it came to government it requested proper advice and, lo and behold, the advice it received was identical to the advice that the Labor Party in government had given to the then opposition. We had said that to meet the election commitment the USO cost would be between $800 million and $1.8 billion. We remind the government of the truth. We 
 informed the then opposition of the actual cost. The opposition, now the government, chose to ignore that advice and to go to people with a misleading promise, which it then went back on.</para><para>Armed with that, it then went to the 1998 election. It agreed with an extension of the USO because it conformed with previous principles. With regard to the four per cent equivalent data service, the government says it will pay half the cost of installation and equipment. The expected cost per consumer is somewhere between $1,200 and $1,800, as I understand it. However, the 64-kilobit ISDN equivalent—that is, via satellite—is one way only. It doesn't work both ways. I would have thought that businesses and consumers in rural and remote areas who are interested in fast and effective services would have liked the services both ways—sending and receiving, up and down. This equivalent data service to the outstanding four per cent of the population in rural and regional Australia half-delivers on the promise: it delivers on the up but not on the down.</para><para>So the government is halfway home. It had a full commitment in 1996. It was advised that that commitment could not be practically carried out because of the exorbitant cost. It chose to ignore that advice from the government of the day. On coming to office, it sought advice from authorities within the ACA. The advice from Mr Shore of the ACA was the same as the previous government, the ALP government, had given to the then opposition. It now changes its position, saying it is honouring its altered election commitment by offering equivalent satellite services to that four per cent of Australia. But the honouring of that commitment is only a halfway house: it is only on the up and not on the down. So I ask the minister two questions. Is it true that the up-load rate will remain slow? The second question, consequential upon the first, is: will the minister advise us how many exchanges in Australia have been digitised to date?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>5563</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the second question is that if it is not 100 per 
 cent, it is pretty close to it. That process should have been completed more than 12 months ago. As far as the speed of the uplink is concerned, it is essentially designed to cater for dial-up services; in other words, people who want access to a vast range of information on the material which they would like to download or stream, but who essentially wish to access a lot of information, will be able to get it at a very high speed.</para></talk.start><para>Sixty-four kilobits, which is the ISDN satellite equivalent to the fixed-line service, delivers absolutely on our election commitment. It gives people the opportunity to access that quantity of information at very high speeds. It does not give you the opportunity to transfer equivalent levels of material at high speeds. That is essentially a commercial operation. People can use VSAT and other ways to achieve that. We are talking here about what is a reasonable minimum standard of service for ordinary Australians.</para><para>We have not mandated mobile phones and all the latest whizzbang technology; we mandate a standard telephone service and define it so that everyone understands that you will get a normal telephone service. Similarly, we are amending the legislation in terms of digital data so that you will be able to get what we regard as a reasonable entitlement for ordinary Australians, not for big businesses and the like. It is the same principle extended from voice to data.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>5563</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate that the Democrats support these amendments. They almost fulfil an election commitment. Their effect is to mandate the availability of digital data capability as part of the USO. The Democrats have been pushing for this for some time, so we are pleased to see that it is now part of the legislation.</para></talk.start><para>However, the major problem that we have with these amendments is their inadequacy with regard to the pricing of digital data services. The amendments do give the minister the power to make price control arrangements and to cap pricing of these services, but as far as we are aware—and I hope the minister will clarify this as soon as possible—the minister has no intention of 
 regulating the price of ISDN. So the only financial assistance that will be provided under the USO relates to the provision of customer equipment for four per cent of Australians who need to purchase satellite equipment. There is no cross-subsidy under the USO for the service charges associated with obtaining ISDN.</para><para>There hardly seems to be any point in bothering to mandate the availability of these services when the price at which they are set is simply too high for the average consumer to afford. I understand that the cost of ISDN is in the region of $700 a year, plus timed call charges. We think that the price of ISDN services needs to be set at an affordable level, and what the government is not doing is making this technology affordable. Again, it is almost pointless to mandate the availability of a product or a service under the USO if the USO provider makes it available at an unaffordable price.</para><para>I would like to recount a comment made by Mr Alasdair Grant, from the carrier AAPT, in his testimony to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee inquiry into the bills. He said:</para><para>Telstra has been dragged kicking and screaming to make 64 kilobit services available to I think now 98.4 per cent of the population. Having done so, it has now somewhat petulantly decided to price it at a level that no-one can really afford.</para><para>So while ISDN access is available to 98.4 per cent of the population, the ACA's report says that something like 65 residential consumers in the entire country are purchasing it. The issue becomes not just the availability of these services, because where those services are available but only available under monopoly conditions, they will be there but no-one will take them up because they are far too expensive.</para><para>The price of obtaining digital data capability must be affordable. The Democrats' first amendment on sheet 1258 proposes mandating the availability of ISDN or comparable services, but the difference between the government's amendment and ours is that it proposes that the service be provided at an affordable price. So we will be supporting these government amendments but we will be pursuing our amendment, which will involve 
 the regulation of the price of ISDN services to make them affordable.</para><para>I have a couple of questions to which I would be obliged if the minister could turn his mind. Having regard to yesterday's decision that there will be a cap applied to the USO, what are the cost implications of this amendment? In other words, is there any part of this amendment which mandates the availability which will be accounted for in the USO? Will the cap be increased as a result of that, and what is the process for doing so?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>5564</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—To the extent that these matters are built into the USO, arrangements such as the 50 per cent subsidy will be a matter for recoupment from the industry. Beyond that, we do not need to regulate the price of these services because the ACCC has already made ISDN a declared service, which means that in due course, if wholesalers such as AAPT are not able to negotiate what they regard as a fair and reasonable price for interconnect arrangements, they will be able to have those matters arbitrated upon by the ACCC. So it is a very significant advance. It is very much consistent with the part 11B and C regime that is now in place and which, I believe, is working effectively, although there are always refinements and improvements that one can consider. We will look at some of those a little later. I think the fact that this has already been made a declared service is a very big step ahead.</para></talk.start><para>I am not aware of the suggestion by Senator Allison that somehow Telstra has jacked up the rates in recent times. I am certainly aware of concerns that ISDN pricing has been non-competitive, and I have shared those concerns, because there have not been other players in the marketplace. It has been a suspicion of mine for quite a while that it was being priced as a premium product rather than a commodity.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL PRIVATISATION BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>5564</page.no><id.no>r801</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>5564</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 26 May.</para><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>5565</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><para>Clause 7, page 3 (after line 9), after the definition of <inline font-weight="bold"> ASIC</inline> , insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">authorised trustee corporation</inline>  means each of the bodies it corporate listed in schedule 9 to the Corporations Regulations in force from time to time.</para><para>Clause 9, page 6, (after line 2), at the end of the Clause, add:</para><para>(4)	 TrusteeCo must ensure that there is in force at all time between the conversion time and the finalisation time a deed under which:</para><para>	 (a)	 TrusteeCo authorises an authorised trustee corporation to exercise all rights, privileges and benefits vested in TrusteeCo by or under this Act or the Wool International Act; and</para><para>	 (b)	 TrusteeCo undertakes not to exercise those rights, privileges and benefits; and</para><para>	 (c)	 the authorised trustee corporation undertakes to perform all duties, liabilities and obligations (other than the obligation imposed by this subsection) vested in TrusteeCo by or under this Act or the Wool International Act.</para><para>(5)	 A deed under subsection (4) may relieve the authorised trustee corporation from liability except in the case of fraud, wilful default or neglect.</para><para>(6)	 All acts done by the authorised trustee corporation under the deed are taken to have been exercised or performed by TrusteeCo for the purposes of this Act (other than this section) and the Wool International Act.</para><para>These amendments emanated out of hearings of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, which I chair and of which other senators in the chamber are members. We believe the changes to the legislation are necessary because they clearly create a situation where the management of TrusteeCo—through an independent trustee—is independent and at arm's length. Therefore, the committee made recommendations that these amendments should go through and they have been adopted by the government.</para><para>There was quite a bit of discussion about the number of equity holders who were not identified through a correct process under Corporations Regulations. It was argued by 
 some that the figure was as high as 40 per cent, but we believe now that it was much closer to 26 per cent and is coming down. At the hearings, we were given assurances that there would be a major campaign to identify those people, and that letters have gone out to growers or equity holders who were not identified in the right form. Also, in the Western Australian <inline font-style="italic">The Countryman</inline> this week there was an advertisement about it, so the task is being carried out.</para><para>I believe this legislation and these amendments are incredibly important to the wool industry. Some comments were made in this chamber last night with regard to the freeze, and claims were made that prices have gone backwards or that the freeze had not helped the wool industry. I want to put a couple of facts on the table. I know I have very limited time, and it is more important to get the legislation through than it is to listen to me, but it is worth noting that since the second freeze the growers' stockpile has been reduced from 992,000 bales to 642,000 bales, which is a significant improvement on what would have been sold under the previous arrangements. The money that has come from that has gone directly into growers' pockets. As of an hour ago, the price rise since the second freeze has been from 465c to 531c, which is also very significant.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">WOODLEY</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>—That is very good news.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name></talker><para>—Thanks, Senator Woodley. Another point I make about this legislation is that it would not have been possible to privatise the wool stockpile and give control back to the growers without the freeze. You may have been able to do it with what was proposed by the previous government under Wool International Holdings or Global Wools but in fact you would have been compulsorily acquiring growers' money—figures ranged from $26 million to $40 million. But under these arrangements whereby the government wished to truly privatise the wool industry and put the responsibility back into the hands of the equity holders, it had to occur. We now are in that position.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I believe the wool industry will continue to recover  much of the ground it lost in recent 
 years through a series of not only agro-driven decisions but also decisions driven by the previous government. One can lay blame wherever one likes, but some realities cannot be denied.

I will address some of the other issues that were raised in an adjournment speech at a later date, because I think the record on some of the things that were said last night needs putting straight.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>5566</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, the opposition supports the government's amendments. We note that these amendments have been drafted after a tortuous exercise over the last couple of days, commencing with the recommendation of the legislation committee that the bill needed to be amended to ensure not only that independence of the trustee operation existed but that it was seen to exist.</para></talk.start><para>We had originally felt that this should be achieved by an arrangement whereby an authorised trustee corporation should be appointed as the overall trustee. However, the arrangements that have now been proposed would ensure that TrusteeCo—that is, the trustee company within WoolStock Australia—would authorise another trustee corporation to exercise all the rights and privileges and benefits vested in TrusteeCo under this act.</para><para>That is particularly important, as Senator Crane has outlined and as I drew attention to in my speech and other senators have commented on, with regard to that block of shares that will not or may not ultimately be able to be converted and issued to individual equity holders because of technical problems or inability to identify the persons or companies involved. It was always a concern that we might not end up with a situation where a substantial block of shares—even if it is 20 per cent or 25 per cent, it is still substantial—were effectively in the hands of the directors of WoolStock Australia, who of course under the legislation are given the power to in turn appoint the directors of TrusteeCo.</para><para>One thing that has become clear throughout this exercise from the views right across the industry sector is that they did not want to see out of this privatisation process Wool Interna 
 tional mark 2; in other words, that we just went through all of the processes of privatisation, of establishing new boards, new companies, new trustee companies, but ended up with either the same old faces or the same old agro-politics driving the decisions. I was going to say `agri', but I take Senator Crane's comment. We are glad that all members of the committee—government, Democrat and opposition—agreed to this and that the government has finally been able to produce an amendment which is acceptable and will enshrine that principle.</para><para>If the trustee arrangements ultimately are not as independent as was intended—we hope that does not happen—then senators from this side will have something to say about it. We have been assured by the government that this process will work. On that basis, we are happy to support the amendments.</para><para>I do not have time to take issue with all of Senator Crane's comments. We will leave them for another day. I reiterate: many decisions were made in the past where unfortunately the blame was laid at the feet of government or at the feet of the previous ministers, but the real culprits were those in the industry who thought that they could sustain the high prices forever. It was industry that had the power and pushed the reserve price up to 870c back in 1990—a totally unsustainable price, as was later proven to be the case.</para><para>With those few comments and with the expectation that there will be plenty more debate about the future of the wool industry—we all hope that the industry returns to prosperity for the sake of the nation and for those involved in the industry—we look forward to the ongoing debate over coming months.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>5566</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will also be supporting this amendment.

The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation was reported yesterday as blaming the opposition for its spoiling role in relation to the Senate. I think it is worth while to detail the tortuous journey of these bills to the Senate today just to see the roles that Labor and the government have played. The Wallis report, the recommendations of which form the basis of this package of bills, was released in 1997. The government had planned at one stage to get these bills into effect by December last year and yet it only introduced them into the other chamber in March of this year. Labor referred them to a Senate inquiry with an expedited timetable and the report, with a minority report by Labor, was tabled on time on 13 May.</para></talk.start><para>Until Friday afternoon, the government had not even bothered to list on the government's draft Senate program the bills for debate this week. When they finally did appear on the revised list, they were listed as non-controversial—to be confirmed—even though the government had not indicated that it would address all of Labor's concerns raised in the minority report. The government did not supply Labor with amendments responding to the report until Monday of this week. Labor responded to these amendments with its own amendments the next day. Finally, on Wednesday night, the government having agreed to most of Labor's amendments and compromised on the others, agreement was reached to treat the bills as non-controversial. Labor can hardly be accused of spoiling the chances of these bills being debated and passed today. Indeed, we have bent over backwards to ensure that the bills are passed, but importantly passed in a vastly improved form to that in which the government originally presented them. </para><para>Labor is broadly supportive of the bills before the Senate today. However, we have serious reservations about some aspects of the unamended bills, which we believe unduly weaken the prudential and corporate regulatory controls over the financial sector that have contributed to the sector's strength in recent times. To be fair to the government, after initially presenting a most unsatisfactory set of bills to the other place, it has now been accommodating in relation to many of Labor's concerns, and I understand that the government will be moving six pages of detailed amendments today in response to issues raised by Labor. I place on the record my delight that the government has seen fit to follow Labor's lead in relation to financial reform. Labor has, after all, been a leader of financial sector reform. As the Prime Minister said just last week, the strength of today is the product of yesterday's reform.</para><para>While the Wallis reforms have produced some significant modifications in the regulation of the sector, today's strengths stem from Labor's reform record during our last period in government. We lifted restrictions on outward investment by Australian companies, floated the Australian dollar and abolished exchange controls in 1993. We introduced an extensive program of liberalising foreign investment restrictions in 1989 and we worked to open the Australian financial system to foreign banks. These reforms contributed to a fundamental shift in the way the Australian financial sector operates and in the way financial services are provided in Australia. I am delighted that the Prime Minister has recognised Labor's excellent record of reform. The government has continued the reform of the sector largely with Labor support following the Wallis financial system inquiry. The package of bills under consideration today implement some of the Wallis recommendations.</para><para>One of the package's main intentions is to bring building societies, credit unions and friendly societies under the prudential regulation of the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, known as APRA, and Labor welcomes this. The effective and consistent prudential regulation of a financial system is 
 most important for economic stability, as many of our Asian neighbours have learnt the hard way in recent times. I hope that the changes, as the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation indicated in the other place, allow those non-bank institutions to compete on a more even footing with the banks. We shall have to wait and see to measure the effectiveness of these changes on that front.</para><para>The bills also provide a single regulatory framework for life insurance companies and friendly societies, and alter the regulation for life insurance and the flexibility of its application. One concern raised by the Australian Friendly Societies Association to the inquiry was the lack of provision in the legislation for the transfer of friendly societies to companies limited by shares, despite several members of the association having indicated their desire to adopt that corporate structure. It appears to Labor strange that, while the government has indicated an intention to level the playing field in the financial sector, it has erected a hurdle that only friendly societies have to jump while credit unions and building societies can move directly into that corporate structure.</para><para>The Labor members' minority report to the inquiry recommended that consideration be given to removing the distinction from the bills. The report noted the following:</para><para>Treasury argues that there are a number of complexities involved in permitting a limited by shares structure as an option on transfer for friendly societies as opposed to other transferring entities, but goes on to say that despite this, any friendly society wishing to convert to limited by shares form will have that option after transfer under existing procedures in the Corporations Law.</para><para>In other words, on the transfer day, the limited by shares option is not available but after the transfer it will be.</para><para>Since the tabling of the report, Treasury has advised that the conversion on the transfer day would be to a statutory share, whereas under the Corporations Law a more conventional share would be adopted. On the basis of this advice, and noting Treasury's earlier advice to the inquiry that it will be open to friendly societies to move across to a company limited by shares after the transfer to 
 APRA has occurred, Labor will not be proposing any amendments on this issue. However, it is hoped that friendly societies do not have to bear an unnecessarily complex administrative burden as a result of this special treatment under the bills. They should be seeking answers from the government if that occurs.</para><para>Labor supports a strong prudential regulatory regime for the financial sector. Part of the strength of that regime is its flexibility. APRA needs some room to move on various issues. However, Labor is concerned that elements of this package go too far on the flexibility front, and it is not just Labor who values the current regulatory system, despite what these bills appear to suggest. On 17 May 1999, while announcing Joe Hockey's new role as ambassador for the financial sector, the Prime Minister also had some kind words for the current system. He said Australia has:</para><para>. . . a strong, stable, well-supervised and prudently regulated banking system. We have a clear coherent body of law. We have sound traditions and principles of corporate governance. And one of the fascinating things about economic debate in this country and around the world in recent times is how some things that were a few short years ago seen almost as impediments to Australia aspiring to what we are about today are now seen by some as our greatest strengths. I can even recall some businessmen a few years ago saying that we were too stodgy, that our banking system perhaps was a little too conservative . . . Now, of course, those very apparent signs of stodginess are seen as some of the greatest strengths that this country has. Perhaps what some would call our very conservatism in the approach of many of our financial institutions, that is now seen as having been one of the virtues of this country over the last few years and one of the reasons why we have been able to stare down the Asian economic downturn.</para><para>Frankly, I could not have put it much better myself. What was seen as stodgy is now understood to have been an important contributor to Australia's stability in the midst of the Asian storm. But what the Financial Sector (Transfers of Business) Bill seeks to do is unravel this protection. The bill introduces the transfer mechanism to the federal sphere for the first time. The mechanism will allow authorised deposit taking institutions and life insurance companies to transfer assets between themselves. The mechanism already 
 exists at the state and territory level for building societies and credit unions, but this bill extends it to banks and life insurers.</para><para>Labor is concerned at this extension of the mechanism. We accept the need for flexibility in the financial sector. No-one is happy to see the collapse of any financial institution, and any mechanism that assists in the prevention of that collapse is a welcome addition to the arsenal of the prudential regulator. However, the transfer mechanism, as it currently stands under the transfers bill, provides a machete where a scalpel would have done the trick. Section 43 of the bill operates to make anything done under the transfers bill exempted from the operation of all other acts—save those prescribed by legislation and breaches of confidence or contract or civil wrongs.</para><para>My colleague the shadow Treasurer pointed out in the other place that would mean, for example, that, unless the Trade Practices Act was prescribed by legislation, a transfer could occur under the bill even if it breached the merger provision of the Trade Practices Act and that there is no guarantee that the Trade Practices Act will be prescribed. I understand that the government will be proposing an amendment which incorporates the merger provision of the Trade Practices Act into the transfers bill. I am delighted that they have responded to Labor's concern on that front, but we return to the machete versus the scalpel. What of the other acts that are excluded from the transfers bill? What of the exclusion of breaches of confidence or contract and civil wrongs?</para><para>The government has indicated that it will prescribe by regulation the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998, the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1991 and the Foreign Acquisition and Takeovers Act 1995. While there is nothing in the transfers bill to compel this to be done, the minister has indicated in the other place that that will be done. Labor will be watching closely for those regulations, but of course there are many other acts with potential operation. The inquiry process brought to light the Banking Act and the Workplace Relations Act, and the Corporations Law was highlighted by the 
 Labor senators' minority report. There are likely to be many more.</para><para>The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation has advised that most of the Banking Act will be prescribed by regulation. Labor is pleased with its inclusion. The minister has also indicated that the government will agree to a Labor amendment that brings the Workplace Relations Act and section 63 of the Banking Act into operation under the transfer of business bill. Of real importance, the current corporate safeguards under the Corporations Law must operate where any transfer occurs. As the Labor members of the inquiry into these bills found:</para><para>While there is a need to provide flexibility for the transfer mechanism—particularly the compulsory mechanism—for prudential reasons, Labor members consider that this flexibility should not be at the expense of the legislative safeguards built into other legislation for shareholders, deposit-holders, policy-holders, creditors and the wider community.</para><para>The office of the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation has advised that the transfer rules to be prepared under the transfers bill will preserve many of the corporate safeguards under the Corporations Law, with any changes necessary to maintain sufficient flexibility for the transfer mechanism.</para><para>I have seen a draft version of these rules, supplied yesterday. While I need the opportunity to study them in more detail, my initial reaction is one of concern. Even allowing for some flexibility, how the four pages I have seen can replicate the legislative and common law rights currently available in respect of mergers and acquisitions is beyond me. As the Prime Minister said, our corporate and prudential regulatory system may once have been viewed as stodgy, but that perception is long gone. That view has been replaced by one that acknowledges that our system is now one of the best in the world. I put the government on notice here today that Labor will be watching its implementation and administration of the transfers mechanism closely. Australia must not squander the strength of our prudential system which has been built up over decades of reform.</para><para>Another strength of our financial system is the four pillars policy. The policy assists in promoting competition in the sector, safe 
 guarding service levels and types, accessibility to services, and employment in the sector. One of the few legislative safeguards for the policy is the requirement, under section 63 of the Banking Act, for the Treasurer's consent for any bank mergers. The transfers bill and related sections in the amendments and transitional provisions bill as originally drafted could have operated to remove the requirement for this consent, both for bank mergers and for transfers between authorised deposit taking institutions, which are, in effect, de facto mergers.</para><para>I understand that the government will be moving amendments and agreeing to an amendment moved by Labor to ensure that the Treasurer is still required to consent to mergers and to ensure that the Treasurer will also be required to consent to transfers between authorised deposit taking institutions. I am delighted that the government has seen fit to acknowledge and respond to Labor's concerns.</para><para>A further concern Labor has with the transfers bill as originally presented is that it does not require APRA to consult with either the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, even though there will be both competition and corporate regulatory issues under consideration in any transfer application. I understand that the government will propose amendments requiring consultation with these bodies, and I am delighted that it will do so. After all, the government itself set up the regulatory regime for financial institutions, split between APRA, ASIC and the ACCC, and it would be rather ironic if it collapsed its own system so soon after establishing it.</para><para>As I said before, the transfer mechanism appears to adopt a machete approach where a scalpel would have done. It is not as if the government has not had a fair bit of time to think about it, yet we find out through the committee process that, for example, the ACCC, the chief competition regulator for the Australian economy, was not consulted in the original drafting of these bills—bills that, without the amendments to be debated today, provided a new mechanism to potentially 
 significantly reduce competition in the financial sector.</para><para>APRA itself appears to have a few problems in relation to its employees. The movement of staff into new statutory authorities is an event often fraught with difficulties. The experience of APRA's staff appears to have been rather more difficult than most. The minority report on these bills sets out Labor's concerns in detail so I will restrict my comments to calling on the government to ensure that APRA acts within the spirit and intention of the Workplace Relations Act and allows those staff who wish to negotiate a certified agreement to do so.</para><para>I will be proposing amendments in the committee stage that address this issue in more detail as well as the issue of how staff affected by the transfer mechanism will be treated. I am pleased that the government has indicated that it has no difficulty with those amendments. I will also be moving a number of amendments on behalf of Labor that deal with the public's access to information and some issues in relation to reporting and payment requirements. I had also intended to move amendments on behalf of Labor to ensure that APRA publishes in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> and newspapers the names of new ADIs transferring to the federal sphere as a result of these bills and the conditions imposed upon them at time of transfer. However, in the interests of expediting these bills, I have agreed to the undertaking by the government that it will publish a list of all transferring institutions—building societies, credit unions and friendly societies—in the national press prior to or on the transfer day to ensure that consumers are aware of the change, and that it will ensure that the conditions are publicly available to interested parties in due course.</para><para>Labor is supportive of the  Income Tax Rates Amendment (RSAs Provided by Registered Organizations) Bill 1999 . In conclusion, Labor is broadly supportive of the package of bills before the Senate today but we have real concerns with elements of the bills, particularly in relation to the proposed transfer mechanism. This government has demonstrated a distinct lack of commitment to consumers in relation to the financial sector, especially in 
 relation to bank fees and charges. It is important that the Wallis reforms do not roll on apace without parallel action being taken to safeguard the interests of consumers in any reforms.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>5572</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The purpose of the <inline ref="r742">Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 1) 1999</inline>  and related bills is to enable the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority to extend its power to effect transfers of businesses between authorised deposit taking institutions to credit unions, building societies and friendly societies. The Australian Democrats agree with that broad intention. This will occur on 1 July and has the strong support of those institutions, which anticipate that it will improve their perception in the retail market and that it will not cause them any problems in the transfer from existing state regimes across to a national regime.</para></talk.start><para>The bill exempted the Financial Sector (Transfers of Business) Bill 1999 from the operation of section 63 of the Banking Act 1959, which provides that the consent of the Treasurer must be obtained prior to any merger or restructure of an authorised deposit taking institution. This gave rise to the concern that the bill could be used as a backdoor to circumvent the four pillars policy, particularly given that there is no stipulation in the legislation that the power to effect a transfer of business can only be used where an authorised deposit taking institution is in financial difficulty. The government has, however, amended the draft legislation to ensure that the bill is no longer exempt from the requirement that the Treasurer give consent to a transfer of business by APRA.</para><para>There were concerns raised that the remuneration and working conditions of former Commonwealth employees would not be preserved upon their move to the newly established APRA. This situation has occurred before, notably in the case of former CES staff moving to Employment National, and there is concern that a trend of downgrading employment conditions of former Commonwealth employees is becoming apparent. As I understand it, late last night the government 
 acquiesced to an amendment to ensure that the remuneration and working conditions of these employees would be preserved. I would like to compliment Senator Conroy, in particular, and the Labor Party on pursuing this issue and, through their amendments, we believe, ensuring that this matter is improved. I would also note for the record that APRA is an independent authority and therefore I would not expect them to adopt the ideology of the ruling government of the time and to pursue a just and equitable outcome for their new employees in this matter.</para><para>Having complimented Senator Conroy, I would like to compliment the government as well because you have been particularly accommodating, as I understand it, in your efforts to ensure that the bills go through and in accepting the Labor amendments. The Democrats record that we will support both the government and Labor amendments and we therefore note in passing our broad support for these bills.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>5572</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on this package of bills.

Such problems arise because of the official imprimatur which publication of a specific prudential measure by APRA might be seen to represent—for example, by retail investors. This could disadvantage an institution and have an anticompetitive effect. Labor acknowledges APRA's argument, but is still concerned at the lack of transparency of the mechanism. Labor has reached a compromise 
 position with the government which will require APRA to give to the Treasurer a copy of any individual prudential regulatory standards. We will monitor how this prudential tool is used.</para><para>Item 3 is intended to preserve the current requirement under section 63 of the Banking Act 1959 for the Treasurer to give prior consent in writing to ADI mergers, acquisitions and transfers.

In the last financial year, Australia's exports amounted to $114 billion, over one-fifth of the value of Australia's gross domestic product. Looking at our top exports and imports, sales of coal, gold, wheat, wool and iron ore allow us to buy cars, computers, computer parts, petroleum and telecommunications equipment—not a very diverse bunch of exports, and that is part of the reason why the Export Market Development Grants Scheme does need to be expanded. But trade matters not only for economic reasons. In the words of the British policy analyst, Geoff Mulgan:</para></talk.start><para>The world can be more easily unified through the peaceful activity of buying and selling than through international treaties or fantasies of world government . . . Trade breeds trust, and trust breeds trade.</para><para>Tantalising stuff. At present, however, Australia's trade is in a parlous situation. This government holds two records in the trade area: (1) Australia's highest ever trade deficit of over $10 billion for calendar year 1998 and (2) Australia's highest ever current account deficit, in original terms, of $28.6 billion for calendar year 1998.</para><para>The Asian economic crisis has caused particular difficulties for exporters. Extra work is required just to remain a presence in their Asian markets and yet, if they do not keep their foot in the door, they will have additional work to do as the Asian economies inevitably recover. At the same time, exporters need to look for new markets in North America and Europe and to make up for lost sales in Asia. Both of these tasks are made much simpler by a government that understands the needs of exporters and is willing to give them the support they deserve, not the parsimony and the red tape epitomised by the 
 current export market development grants legislation.</para><para>But then there is the GST. What impact will it have on exports? If you believe Tim Fischer, exports will go up under a GST. But the experts do not necessarily think so. Take, for example, tourism. Mr Murphy, the government's modeller of choice, says tourism will decline as an employer and as an industry as a consequence of the GST. Secondly, Treasury's analysis also indicates that the GST will lift the exchange rate of the Australian dollar by some 3.5 per cent. The government's preferred modeller, Mr Murphy, says that it could be as much as 4.1 per cent. Either way, it will make our goods and services much more expensive in overseas markets. With a record trade deficit, a record current account deficit, the Asian crisis and a GST looming on the horizon, the Export Market Development Grants Scheme is one of the few bright lights for exporters. Yet what did this government do to the EMDG Scheme when it came to power? Typically, it slashed its funding. As Senators Forshaw, Hogg and I said in our report when the Export Market Development Grants Scheme Act 1997 was considered by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee:</para><para>It is clear from the evidence before this Committee that the significant narrowing of the scheme will disadvantage a great number of Australian exporters.</para><para>The Howard government, unfortunately, took no notice of our warning. They brought in extra red tape and capped the scheme at $150 million per annum. $150 million is pretty stingy for a scheme like this when you consider that this is the same Howard government that earlier this year gave $100 million to Comalco to develop a gas pipeline in Queensland.</para><para>To see the effect of the 1997 Howard government's slash and burn philosophy you just need to compare Austrade's 1996-97 and 1997-98 annual reports. There are three points: (1) total export market development grants down from $213 million to $147 million, a fall of 31 per cent; (2) total number of grant recipients down from 3,553 to 2,933, a fall of 17 per cent; and (3) total jobs attribu 
 table to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme down from 77,000 to 59,533, a fall of 22 per cent.</para><para>The government should remove the cap it has placed on the scheme. During the last financial year, the cap was not met. Grants and administration costs amounted to some $3 million less than the $150 million cap. But next year the cap is likely to bite. In fact, my sources tell me that, in the coming financial year, exporters will get back only 80 per cent of that which they claim. Who will be hurt by this? Our cutting edge exporters, of course.</para><para>I now turn to the amendment foreshadowed by Senator Stott Despoja requiring Austrade to undertake a review of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme with a view to placing it on a permanent footing. Labor strongly supports this amendment. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme has operated continuously from 1974—nearly one-quarter of the time since Federation—and yet it is still considered a temporary scheme. It has no firm legislative footing. It requires extension in dribs and drabs. At least for most of its history, it has been extended in four- and five-year blocks. But this time the government proposes to extend it by only two years. You can see the writing on the wall.</para><para>Had the Democrats' amendment not been foreshadowed, I would have brought forward one of my own to extend the scheme for another four years, but I prefer the review mechanism to look at placing the scheme on a more permanent footing.</para><para>The industry—that is, the exporters of Australia—are strongly in favour of a longer horizon for the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. They require long, strong signals from the government that this is a stable scheme and that they can plan their corporate vision and their corporate strategy to lift exports knowing that the scheme will be there and can be relied on.</para><para>In a recent letter, the Export Consultants Association wrote to me of the value to them of being able to plan with more certainty and make long-term commitments for export marketing activities. In that letter, they said:</para><para>In the current economic situation in Asia, exporters should maintain a presence in markets which have 
 provided good opportunities in recent years but are currently suffering a decline. Many Asian buyers have been critical of Australian exporters in the past for disappearing when times were not so good and, if this is repeated, long term damage would be caused to Australia's prospects in those markets when they recover.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Ferguson)</name></talker><para>—Order!

If I could complete my remarks, that would save us some time. Let me resume the quote from the Export Consultants Association's letter. After emphasising the importance of Australian exporters maintaining a presence in the Asian market, they go on to say:</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is therefore critical that the government encourage Australia's exporters to maintain their presence in these markets and the EMDG program can assist in achieving this goal.</para><para>We must also remember what this government hope will be the situation in mid-2001 when their extension to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme is due to run out. Under their plans, Australia will have had a GST for a year. Let me quote from another letter—from the Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia—representing an industry which earned the nation over $16 billion last year. The letter states:</para><para>The prime purpose [of the Bill] is to extend the life of the Scheme by a further two years. We do not consider this provides adequate certainty to our industry. If for some reason the government is able to get its ANTS legislation through the Senate the 
 inbound tourism industry will be dealt a serious blow. Having achieved this then we can expect the Treasurer to move to terminate the EMDG scheme . . . This would be a double whammy for the tourism industry.</para><para>I emphasise that it is this industry that offers mostly young people—and particularly job seekers—their first taste of employment, that it is this industry that is the strongest growth industry in creating jobs in Australia; and that organisation, the Inbound Tourism Organisation, speaks for a large part of it.</para><para>Labor strongly supports the proposed review. We will be putting to it our view that the Export Market Development Grants Scheme should operate on a permanent basis. It should still be subject to periodic review, but the onus should be on those who seek to do away with the scheme, not on those who wish to see it continued. I understand the government is also supporting the Democrats' amendment. I sincerely thank Minister Fischer's staff and Senator Brownhill—who is in the chamber—for the thoughtful and constructive way in which they have approached discussions on this legislation. We did not reach agreement on every point, but there was broad consensus that the Export Market Development Grants Scheme is a good scheme. I hope that, when it comes to the review next year, there will be bipartisan consensus to put export market development grants on a permanent footing. I move:</para><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>"but that the Senate is of the opinion that:</para><para>	 (a)	 in view of Australia's record current account deficit (over $28 billion in 1998) and record trade deficit (over $10 billion in 1998), there is an urgent need to increase exports;</para><para>	 (b)	 the Government's 1997 imposition of an annual funding limit at the same time as the introduction of more red tape for small exporters has had the effects of:</para><para>		 (i)	 reducing funding for exporters under the EMDG scheme from $213 million to $147 million—a fall of 31 per cent; and</para><para>		 (ii)	 cutting the total number of EMDG grant recipients from 3,553 to 2,933—a fall of 17 per cent; and

The Democrats will be supporting the Export Market Development Grants Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 today for the Export Market Development Grants Scheme which was established in 1974.

I understand that the most recent review of this scheme was conducted by Austrade in 1994. That review published a number of key findings that include: the EMDG Scheme was achieving its objective of encouraging firms to seek out and develop export markets; revenues from taxes on grant receipts and 
 profits on additional exports were estimated to return 42 per cent of the cost of the scheme to the Commonwealth; the minimum level of qualifying expenditure, the grant rate, number of grants and performance test were largely appropriate; the scheme should be extended for a further five years; and the scheme should be extended to all claimants in the tourism sector. Austrade has informed us that a comprehensive review of the scheme has not been undertaken since 1994.</para><para>The Australian Democrats believe this is a worthy scheme. There is no doubt that this type of scheme provides real encouragement to business to pursue export markets. A measure which has been used to compare the relative effectiveness from year to year of the scheme in encouraging exports is the ratio of the value of exports to grants. This gives a measure of how many export dollars were earned for each dollar spent in grants through the scheme. In the financial years from 1992-93 to 1996-97, the ratios were 21 to one, 27 to one, 26 to one, 28 to one and 35 to one respectively. That means that, for each dollar spent by way of grants, $35 was received into Australia from exports. I consider that quite a reasonable return on this country's investment and, clearly, the efficiency of the scheme is increasing. This is not an expensive scheme for the benefits that it generates for this country. In the 1996-97 financial year, the government paid $138 million in grants to 2,933 recipients.</para><para>When the scheme was revised in early 1997, it was capped so that expenditure on grants and administration would not exceed $150 million. At the time, my colleague Senator Andrew Murray expressed the Australian Democrats' view, which was that the scheme should not be capped. The basis on which we took that view was that the growth of the scheme was not open-ended, that it was not the subject of widespread abuse and that there was no danger of the scheme causing budgetary problems. The Democrats are still of the view that the scheme should not be capped. We appreciate that the exporters of Australia are lucky to have this scheme at all. We suspect that had it been left to the Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, the whole thing might 
 have been abolished back in 1997. I suspect we have the Deputy Prime Minister and Senator Brownhill to thank for the fact that we at least have a modified version of the pre-1997 scheme.</para><para>One of the positive aspects of the revision of the scheme in 1997 was the recognition of the role that tourism plays as an export earner for this country. Prior to that revision, tourism operators were entitled to be reimbursed for only 25 per cent of their expenditure. The 1997 act allows tourism operators to claim the full 50 per cent on expenditure, like any other exporter. In his second reading speech, the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill at the time, said:</para><para>The government has also recognised the significant contribution made to our exports by the tourism industry. We have increased the grant rate for all tourism providers to the full rate of 50% . . . </para><para>It is encouraging that the government has recognised the valuable contribution that tourism industry exports make to the Australian economy.</para><para>I will now discuss broadly the amendments contained in the bill. The most significant amendment is the extension of the scheme for a further two years until 30 June 2001. While the Democrats commend the government for the continuation of the scheme, we consider that, in some ways, this is a rather piecemeal approach to the extension of the scheme, and that is inadequate. It provides exporters and prospective exporters with no certainty that the scheme will continue for their benefit. An Australian manufacturer or service provider would not realistically think that they could commence promotion of their work or their product or their service in overseas markets and establish a place within the market within two years. The decision to attempt to develop an export market is, without doubt, a substantial one for any exporter or prospective exporter, and it is a decision which involves a lot of planning. That is where problems immediately arise as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the continuation of this scheme.</para><para>If a producer of goods decided tomorrow that they wanted to consider exporting their products to Asia or Europe, the assistance that 
 could be obtained from the EMDG Scheme would be a major consideration. But how do they go about forecasting their future position while trying to break into that market if they do not know whether the assistance under that scheme is to continue beyond 30 June 2001? I acknowledge that the office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade provided my office with a briefing from Austrade in relation to the bill and I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for that cooperation. During that briefing, we were concerned that we did not receive a satisfactory answer to the question about extending the scheme for at least a few years beyond the proposed extension, with a view to providing prospective exporters with some certainty and some ability to plan on the basis of receiving grants for a number of years. As Senator Peter Cook mentioned, I will be moving an amendment when we reach the committee stage of this bill that provides for a review of that scheme.</para><para>In conclusion, as I said, the Democrats are happy with the scheme. We are very happy to support the government's extension of the scheme, but we would like to see a comprehensive review of that scheme with a view to giving exporters some certainty and encouraging them to make medium-term and long-term plans to promote their products and services in overseas markets.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>5581</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Export Market Development Grants Scheme, or EMDG Scheme, commenced in 1974. The scheme was established by the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974. That act was repealed in 1997 by the Export Market Development Grants (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Act 1997 and replaced with the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997.</para></talk.start><para>The EMDG Scheme is administered by Austrade and provides financial assistance primarily to small and medium enterprises as an incentive to branch out into new export markets. The act currently allows the scheme to operate for the 1998-99 grant year, but not beyond that. This bill extends the grant years until the end of the 2000-01 financial year.</para><para>The EMDG Scheme repays part of the promotional expenses which enterprises incur 
 in pursuing exports where the products exported are of substantially Australian origin. The scheme provides up to 50 per cent reimbursement of eligible expenses where a person has spent over $20,000 per annum on eligible export promotion, although the first $15,000 of expenditure is deducted. First time applicants can combine two years expenses. A maximum of eight grants of up to $200,000 per grant is available, although additional grants may be claimed for expenses incurred in new markets.</para><para>The issue of transparency has been of concern to the Greens both in relation to this bill, the Export Market Development Grants Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 , and in a more general sense to do with export grants in the past. The Greens have regularly stated that this lack of accountability to parliament is of great concern. The government is not spending its own money. The very significant funding for programs such as the EMDG Scheme comes from public funds—that is, the taxpayers. Therefore, the parliament, which comprises the elected representatives of the people who pay the taxes and levies that comprise those public funds, does have the right to scrutinise the expenditure of public moneys.</para><para>It is worth while pointing out at this time that the varying levels of accountability that the government is keen to pursue depend on how public money is spent. I find it extraordinary that we have so much emphasis on assessment and accountability, focusing on the provision of social security and community service and much less so on these industry assistance programs. The dichotomy in relation to industry assistance is between what should be protected under the guise of commercial-in-confidence versus what kind of transparency should be associated with grants of public money of this kind.</para><para>The Greens are wary of the quite frequent use of the commercial-in-confidence claim by businesses dealing with the government and by the government in dealing with business. This has increased with the increase of outsourcing and contracting out by government departments, as well as with the moves towards commercialisation of government 
 business enterprises. The immense difficulty that the parliament has had in extracting information from Telstra, which is only partially privatised, is an excellent example in point.</para><para>I am aware that the ALP were keen to extend the information that was available on the public record in relation to approved export grants. They were interested in seeing the name of the company, the industry, the amount of the grant and the country that the recipient was exporting to. Both the Auditor-General and the Greens have previously made comments in this chamber about the inadequacy of the information and performance measures presented in relation to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme.</para><para>I would like to refer to a comment I made in 1995. Honourable senators may remember that my concern in previous years—I guess as soon as I was elected—was initially that many of the export market development grants were going to the defence industry. I said:</para><para>I stated in the context of the EMDG scheme that I hoped the government would consider improving the assessment of performance and the nature of the criteria used in that assessment.</para><para>I went on to say:</para><para>Performance measures are also difficult to assess and do not seem to be clear. While `return for dollar expended' gives some rough idea, it is a very rough idea indeed. There is no information about variation in this average. Do some dollars bring much greater returns? Do some bring little returns? Is there a breakdown of where and why good returns develop? Is information about where, how and why some expenditures give good returns, while others fail to do so, effectively passed on to applicants?</para><para>Other performance measures—such as numbers of grant applications, size, and distribution by industry—are good but not always easily available. Nor is there much information about things like why the number of grants declined from 1990-91, or what the increase in grants to companies providing financial or property services means. Is this about grants to insurance companies trying to expand? Is the increase in construction consultancy services due to grants for John Holland or Transfield to promote themselves in winning dam contracts? Is the community service increase due to grants for universities to promote educational services?  
</para><para>Before that, in 1994, I said in my speech on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill:</para><para>The lack of performance measures combined with Austrade's minimal annual reporting of its largest budget item leaves Parliament inadequately informed of the scheme's effectiveness given the high profile of the scheme and the frequency of legislative changes required.</para><para>The lack of performance measures is considered to be a function of the initial establishment of the scheme. If the scheme had been devised in such a way that its rationale was clearly stated so that its impact could be measured, considerable savings would have resulted from the ease with which the focus and impact of the scheme could have been monitored and regulated.</para><para>We were talking then about issues like equity in the promotion of undesirable goods and habits from the Greens (WA) point of view. In principle, the Greens are supportive of calls for greater transparency when it comes to dealing with public money. Indeed, we have asked for the same range of information in relation to other exports, particularly defence exports, in the past. I have mentioned that this particular scheme was certainly used, perhaps more in the past, for the promotion of defence exports, although it did not necessarily say so in its goals. We have found it quite difficult to gather this information. I have previously met brick walls under the guise of commercial-in-confidence when trying to find out information about exports in the past. As I said, this is particularly in relation to defence exports.</para><para>In a question on notice on 1 October 1997, I asked the Minister for Defence what were the top 200 defence export approvals by value in the 1996-97 financial year. I asked which companies, which countries and what was the nature of the equipment. The answer was that the names of exporters are not released due to the commercial-in-confidence nature of the information. As this particularly related to defence exports, I thought it was rather bizarre. When we know that there is public money going to assist those companies in many cases, it does seem extraordinary that, when it is something as important as defence 
 exports, we are unable to ask which companies are involved. I hope that the Senate will have the chance at some stage—when I am not here—to have a closer look at the basis for future grants when the review mentioned by the minister goes through.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>5583</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tax Package: Family Trusts</title><page.no>5583</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5583</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, and it concerns government backsliding on tax avoidance.

I understand that the commission has indicated to the bookshop that it might seek an injunction or bring an action for damages in relation to this matter. As I said, the commission is an independent statutory authority charged with the responsibility for enforcing the provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Section 52 prohibits conduct which is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. Under section 51A, where a corporation makes a representation with respect to any future matter and does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation, the representation shall be taken to be misleading. That is the advice, Senator, that I have. As to the commission's view, my advice is that, based upon its economic modelling, the price of books would, under a GST, increase by substantially less than the amount stated by Gleebooks.

It is very important to focus on some of the issues which are of 
 importance to all Australian women, and this government has been doing that.</para></talk.start><para>Today, at a forum that was sponsored by Senator Vanstone on perpetrator programs, I reaffirmed the federal government's commitment against domestic violence through the $50 million Partnerships Against Domestic Violence initiative. One of our priority areas is more work with domestic violence perpetrators. Other priorities include preventing long-term damage to children in violent families and the prevention of violence in indigenous communities. Domestic violence takes a huge toll on Australia's families and this government is determined to tackle it head-on. The provision of court mandated programs as part of a range of programs for the perpetrators of domestic violence can only have positive benefits.</para><para>In relation to enhancing the economic security of women, the coalition government will be introducing legislation to enable the splitting of superannuation assets after divorce, and this will help to redress the imbalance of superannuation wealth between the sexes. That imbalance is one that NATSEM data has shown exists between the sexes, and this legislation will be the single greatest move to redress that imbalance.</para><para>But it is only the latest of a number of coalition superannuation initiatives for women that are already in place, including retirement savings accounts that enable women to continue to contribute to their own fund, even when they are out of the work force, and an income tax rebate for spouses who are in the work force to contribute up to $3,000 a year to an at-home spouses superannuation fund. Other changes in superannuation which are available to women and which are beneficial include the extension of the age limit for people contributing to qualifying funds to help people wanting to continue to build up their retirement savings later in life, and the provision of superannuation choice.</para><para>The Howard government's commitment to working women was also affirmed in the recent budget, with the government announcing a $24.2 million return to work initiative aimed at women who have been out of the work force for two or more years for parent 
 ing or caring. These women will receive access to reskilling to meet the demands of today's work force. I am delighted to note that the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics average weekly earnings figures show the gap between men's and women's wages is closing. I am sure, Madam President, you would be pleased as well. The ABS figures show that women's full-time adult ordinary time earnings are now 84.8 per cent of men's; up from 83.5 per cent at the same time last year, and up from 83.1 per cent when Labor was in government in February 1996. There has been a continuing narrowing of the pay gap between the sexes under this government, and I, for one, am hugely pleased.</para><para>This latest good news comes on top of ABS work force statistics released on 13 May showing rising women's employment: 210,000 new jobs for women between April 1996 and April this year. In addition, the unemployment rate for women has fallen from 8.4 per cent in April 1996 to 7.3 per cent now. The participation rate for working age women—15 to 64—remains stable at 64.2 per cent, and the number of mothers who are employed continues to rise, increasing by 7,100 in March alone to reach 1,120,000 in April this year. Our government has been focused on the needs of all women, and they are freedom from domestic violence, retirement income and workplace opportunities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Budget Surplus</title><page.no>5588</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5588</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister.

I think it is worth remembering whenever we address this issue that the bombing was instituted because of the appalling human rights abuses that were occurring in Kosovo.

The belief of NATO was that there was no other alternative to answer those abuses, that the attempts of negotiation and dialogue had failed.</para><para>The question now is: what is the way forward? There are those who are arguing for a pause in the bombing as a step towards a negotiated settlement. It is obviously the view of NATO, if one reads the latest statements 
 coming out of NATO, that they believe that would simply be counterproductive, that it would be interpreted as weakness and it would not achieve the outcome that we are all seeking.</para><para>The conditions that NATO has set down—and I remind honourable senators—for a cease in bombing are: a verifiable stop to all military actions and the immediate ending to all violence and repression; withdrawal from Kosovo of the Yugoslav military, police and paramilitary forces; the stationing in Kosovo of an international military presence; the unconditional and safe return of all refugees and displaced persons; and a credible assurance of Milosevic's willingness to work on the basis of the Rambouillet accords towards a political solution for Kosovo in conformity with international law and the charter of the United Nations.</para><para>NATO has not varied from those five conditions.

So the scare campaign and the misinformation that was put about by the opposition about child care have simply deceived Australian families about the contribution made by their federal government.</para></talk.start><para>The important facts to remember are that, while the government does not control child-care fees, it did have a fee freeze in place until 1 April and that has now gone. In the meantime, the centres have put up their fees as they have done in the past. Currently, I think the average weekly fee for full-time care is $163 in long day care centres, $169 in community based centres and $162 in private centres. For family day care, the fees on average are $28 a week lower.</para><para>From 1991 to 1998, the centres have increased their weekly fees for full-time long day care on average by seven per cent, or $8 
 a week each year, representing a total increase of 56 per cent—well in excess of inflationary indicators, such as the consumer price index and the average weekly earnings. Over the same period, 1991 to 1998, government assistance has increased by 29 per cent, which is double the increase in the consumer price index. The government makes a very significant financial contribution to the child-care costs of low and middle income families through child-care assistance and the child-care rebate. Of course, families can be eligible for either or both of those. The interesting thing that people should really grab on to is that for low income families—for example, a sole parent earning around $30,000 a year with two children in full-time care—government assistance covers around 75 per cent of the average fee in centres and around 80 per cent of the average fee in family day care.</para><para>Those are some of the statistics that should be on the public record because, while the senator is talking about material from the Productivity Commission, I would hope that the opposition would make sure that they are very well informed about what is happening in child-care centres in terms of support from the government, the expectation made of the parents, contribution made by the taxpayer and what I think are extraordinarily high rises in child-care fees over the last eight or nine years that are quite out of kilter with the consumer price index and average weekly earnings, both of which should surely be indicators of what the true cost of child care should be.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5596</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

Further, is it not the case that the only improvement has been by virtue of the fact of taking account of population growth and that, in real terms, the Commonwealth government has cut the amount of money that it spends per hour on each child in child care?</para></talk.start></continue></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>5597</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The expenditure by the federal taxpayer on child care has increased each year that we have been in government by significant amounts—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—Per hour, Minister.

What we have here is the ACCC, the body that under legislation is required to monitor proper conduct by business in Aus 
 tralia, taking action to `persecute'—and I use that word deliberately—an Australian company. The ACCC is persecuting and hounding an Australian company—and why is it doing so?</para><para>This company is a book store. This company sells books, and there is no wholesale sales tax on books. What does this company do? On its receipts to its customers, it puts the words `books will cost 10 per cent more with a GST'. The government's watchdog on corporate crime and proper conduct in the business world is hounding an Australian company because it dares put on its bills to its consumers `books will cost 10 per cent more with a GST'.</para><para>If this is an act of political censorship—the government knows that public opinion is running against it; it knows that over 51 per cent, according to the Newspoll, and 54 per cent, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> poll, are opposed to a GST; and it has sooled its corporate watchdog onto an innocent Australian company, expressing its view about a law that will impact on its business—I have never seen a more naked example of it than what we are seeing today. The ACCC has indicated that one of the remedies which may be visited on this company—a remedy in the sense of penalising it—is that damages may be required to be paid to persons who have suffered loss. The people who will suffer a loss under a GST are all consumers in Australia. All this company is doing is alerting its customers that if this law passes—I again reiterate that the Labor Party is opposed it but if against our wishes this law passes—then all of those customers of that book store will be paying 10 per cent more because of a GST.</para><para> The actions of the ACCC are oppressive. They are an excessive use of force by the ACCC against an innocent company. They attack free speech. They appear—and I stress the word `appear'—to be politically motivated. It is an indication of how sensitive this government is to its waning fortunes on a GST that a corporate watchdog should be used in this way. The minister declined to instruct the ACCC to desist.</para><para>It is unfortunate that the Australian Democrats are not here for this debate, because 
 there is an important question here for both the government and the Australian Democrats who seem to be the new-found friends of the government in this tax. We put a proposal to this chamber in debating the GST legislation that on the docket a consumer receives at the check-out there should be the price paid for the goods that they have bought, the tax they have to pay under a GST and the total price. We put forward that amendment to the government's GST package because, if that law against our wishes were to be carried, we wanted Australians to know how much tax they are paying on the goods they buy under a GST.</para><para>Who voted it down? The Democrats and the government voted it down. Both of them joined forces to vote that amendment down. Thus, if this law passes, consumers in Australia will be denied the right to know how much tax they are actually paying on their purchases. Senator Woodley at least had the good grace to admit that the reason why they were voting it down was a political motivation—the tax would not stand if people knew how much they have to pay under a GST.</para><para> There is a question here of consumer rights, but there is also a question here of political censorship of industry. There ought not be any law against free speech in this country, a law which says that companies are bound not to say things the government dislikes. It is a fact that books will cost 10 per cent more under a GST. Because the government says it will not, it is a curb on the right of that company to say it. Senator Lees joined with the book industry earlier this month in putting out advertisements saying, `No GST on learning; no tax on knowledge; no GST on books.' I commend her for that. That is, in part, the Australian Labor Party's position. We want no GST on anything. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>5599</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Yet again we see the opposition desperately trying to continue its campaign against tax reform in Australia.

He says they will go up by 10 per cent because books currently do not have a wholesale sales tax on them, and therefore there is no tax to be removed before the GST is applied. What he ignores is the indirect or hidden effect of wholesale sales tax on the cost of books—as it has a hidden effect on many other goods. Even where there is no actual wholesale sales tax itself levied on an item, the wholesale sales tax still has a substantial effect on the cost of goods.</para></talk.start></continue><para> Let us take just as an example the wholesale sales taxes levied on the truck, on the fuel and on the tyres that deliver those books from the printer to the warehouse and from the warehouse to the retailer, which all add to the cost of the books. Transport in this country is one of the big input costs of all goods that are marketed in this country. Whether or not there is a direct wholesale sales tax on any particular good, there is a substantial 
 contribution from the wholesale sales tax with its impact on transport costs.</para><para>This really highlights the importance of and the need for tax reform, because the effect of the existing indirect wholesale sales taxes that we have is completely hidden. People are completely unaware of the indirect tax they are paying through the wholesale sales tax system. I thank Senator Cook for highlighting the fact that under our existing system we have so much hidden tax that people are unaware of. I thank him for giving us the opportunity to inform people that that indirect tax is there. Of course, it is this wholesale sales tax that will be abolished as a result of the government's tax reform program.</para><para>There is also a range of state indirect taxes that would similarly impact on the cost of books. They are taxes that will also be abolished when the government's tax reform package comes into place. Let us have none of this nonsense from Senator Cook or from this firm advertising the books that the cost of books will go up by 10 per cent, because it is quite plain that they will not. It is therefore quite plain that the advertising which this firm is undertaking is false in the extreme. Therefore, it is quite proper for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to be taking this action against them.</para><para>The action of the ACCC highlights the way in which the consumer will be protected when the tax reform package comes into operation. In the tax reform legislation there is provision for the ACCC to take action against people who provide goods and services if they do not price their goods or services properly in relation to the new tax package—in other words, if they do not take the wholesale sales tax that is being abolished off those goods before they apply the goods and services tax. A very important role of the ACCC under the tax reform package will be to prevent businesses profiteering at the expense of consumers out of the introduction of tax reform.</para><para>This whole issue reinforces the hotchpotch of a tax structure we currently have in place—Labor's tax structure that they want to keep going at all costs. They do not want tax reform. The issue reinforces the importance of tax reform and the desperate and urgent need 
 for it. That is what this government has been attempting to achieve. It is about time the Labor Party got on board and supported it and offered some constructive policies instead of opposition for opposition's sake at all costs. We have demonstrated problems with our existing tax system. Senator Cook, in raising this issue, simply reinforces and highlights the urgent need for tax reform.

The government likes to quote the ANTS document. The ANTS document uses second-year price effects, not first year price effects.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Chapman said `purported'. Let me read to you the letter from the ACCC. Let us see how purported, according to Senator Chapman, this letter is. On ACCC letterhead, the ACCC wrote to the proprietors of Gleebooks on 6 May 1999 and said:</para><para>Concerns have been raised over the accuracy of this statement—</para><para>that books will cost 10 per cent more with a GST—</para><para>particularly as details of the operation of the proposed GST are not yet final.</para><para>That is an interesting point for a start. How would the ACCC know what the outcome will be? How are they able to judge if, in their own words, they say, `The outcome is not yet final'? But let us not worry about that. They go on to say:</para><para>The GST, as currently proposed by the Federal Government, includes the withdrawal of several existing taxes, and an allowance for input tax credits for registered traders. Both these factors have the potential to impact the cost, and therefore the final price of new and second-hand goods, in addition to the imposition of a 10% GST. 
</para><para>The letter says `have the potential'. The ACCC cannot guarantee this. The ACCC absolutely cannot guarantee that the 10 per cent will not go up. They are motivated purely and simply by their desire to protect the government's position, because they know—and they have admitted it at the Senate estimates process—that they cannot protect consumers.</para><para>The ACCC exists because perfect competition does not exist in the real world. They went on to say:</para><para>It is considered that in many cases the introduction of a 10% GST will not result in a 10% increase in the price for a particular good or service.</para><para>They said `in many cases'. Books, which are currently almost not taxed in any form, may have to go up by 10 per cent. The ACCC cannot even definitively say there is no case. They say: `in many cases'. It is on that ground that they are prosecuting and threatening Gleebooks. They go on to say that they may take injunctions, and that they may offer damages to persons who have suffered loss and other ancillary orders against a bookshop.</para><para>Contrast that with what happened recently with the health rebate. We saw a $7 million advertising campaign by this government, using taxpayer money, which the ACCC noticed after it had finished was illegal. Following a request from Kelvin Thomson, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, they came up with the following response:</para><para>The Commission has carefully examined the Government advertising in question and is concerned that representations such as "Private health cover will now be 30% cheaper for all Australians" could potentially mislead the public.</para><para>No threats of injunctions; no damages against customers. They said:</para><para>The Commission was also concerned that the Government advertising may have had a "flow on" effect upon the advertising of the rebate by private health funds.</para><para>No threats at all to private health funds for their misrepresentations. They went on to say:</para><para>It should be noted that the Commission is of the preliminary view that the Trade Practices Act is unlikely to apply to Government advertisements of this kind. 
</para><para>They can go out there, attack a small Aussie battling business in Glebe and then turn around and say, `Oh dear, we can't possibly look at the government.' They said:</para><para>In light of the action taken by the Department outlined . . . the Commission does not intend to take further action in respect of this matter at this time.</para><para>One rule for the government when they are caught red-handed misleading the Australian public, but do you dare to mention that Treasury has misled this community on the costings of this package? If you accept all of Treasury's bodgie assumptions, you can come up with a second-year figure that Senator Kemp says is four per cent. But if you net it out for books, it is nearer to 10 per cent—and that is if you assume all of the government's positive assumptions. If you look at some more real-world assumptions in the package, the cost on books with a GST is a 10 per cent increase. The ACCC stand condemned and the minister stands condemned. It is an outrage. They are attacking an Australian small business while they are letting the government get away scot-free. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>5602</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If Labor Party senators, particularly Senator Conroy, had put as much energy into tax reform as they put into advancing their failed arguments, they might have been relevant today.

What is good for the goose ought to be good for the gander. They ought to be advocating that their ramshackle wholesale sales tax system be up front so that everyone understands it. Every parent who buys equipment for young people at school—pens, pencils, writing pads, notebooks, school 
 folders, erasers, rulers, geometry equipment, computers, software, discs, chalk, or art supplies—ought to be told that they are paying wholesale sales tax on all those items. Not only do they pay wholesale sales tax at the wholesale suppliers, but they also pay wholesale sales tax as it cascades through the production line. It is added on again and again—unlike the GST, which is taken off at each point and only added to the value added component of those goods or services.</para><para>Those opposite say that the GST ought to be indicated on price tags. Why didn't they do it with the wholesale sales tax? Why don't they tell people about this ramshackle system that they are supporting? Their policy was merely to take wholesale sales tax off orange juice and put it on caviar. It is still on babies bottles—they didn't take it off that—but they took it off orange juice and put it on caviar. That was the total sum of their tax reform. They made a few tax reforms on capital gains for pre-1985 goods, but they got rid of that two days after the election. They had a tax on Toorak tractors, but they got rid of that after the election.</para><para>Labor does not stand for anything we are putting forward—it is opposing that, unlike the Democrats who are negotiating with us. Labor has dealt itself out of the argument. The only tax reform it has is taking wholesale sales tax off orange juice and putting it on caviar. If that is the best Labor can do, no wonder it is in opposition—and it will be there for a very long time.</para><para>I move now to the issue of books. I bought a book the other day and on the receipt was a little note that said that the GST would add 10 per cent to the cost of books. I saw red. Perhaps I should have done more about it. Books will not increase by 10 per cent. When Senator Conroy was speaking, somebody interjected and said that there is no wholesale sales tax on books. There is wholesale sales tax on books—and it cascades through the production line. It is on transporting the raw product to the paper maker, on transporting the paper to the printer, on the printing machines, on the advertising, and on all parts of production of books.</para><para>It has been estimated that the price increase for publishing and recorded media—that includes publishing books—will be four per cent. We are compensating people for that increase through the pension system, the social security system and taxation cuts. In 1993, the Labor Party jacked up wholesale sales tax on gladwrap, dog food, sweets and all the things in the supermarket that have wholesale sales tax on them—row after row of items that are used by families every day. The wholesale sales tax went up to 22 per cent in 1993. Did the Labor Party tell people about the increase in wholesale sales tax? Did the Labor Party give compensation to pensioners? The answer is no.</para><para>On the other side of the chamber, people are carping at small parts of the tax reform package, but they have failed to come up with any tax reform themselves.

We have heard  a lot about the Stockholm syndrome that seems to be developing in this parliament—in fact, some have said that perhaps the whole enterprise should be renamed Colditz Castle, as the level of capture is so great at the moment—and the way in which former enemies of taxes on knowledge and taxes on books now seem to be suggesting that it is possible to negotiate around this question. I am reminded that it 
 was not so long ago that Senator Meg Lees, in a leaflet distributed by the Australian Publishers Association, said:</para><para>It is nonsense to suggest that education is GST-free when you are applying a GST to the single most substantial education resource that students should have at their disposal—books. Sadly, this example of a lack of understanding and forethought is far from isolated in the tax package.</para><para>Senator Meg Lees is on the public record as saying that. There are leaflets like this attached to the walls of this building. That suggests to me that that was the view of Senator Lees a little while ago.</para><para>It is important to highlight how important it is that books remain tax free. Everyone here would, I think, accept the critical role that books have played in history and as agents of democracy. We all understand how important it is for there to be knowledge, and the distribution of knowledge in our society is dependent upon books and accessibility to ideas for both writers and readers. It is one thing to fiddle with the cost of a meat pie or the price of diesel, but it is another thing again to fiddle with access to one of the most important inventions known to humankind—the printed word.</para><para>The gravity of what I am saying cannot be overplayed. What sort of political party, through its actions and its agreement with the conservative parties in this country, would see one family reduced in its capacity to have access to books? Any party that measured itself against that benchmark would have to say it was an abject political failure. I think we are entitled to think about the consequences of the Democrats signing up to the Tory campaign to restrict access to books by increasing the price of books by placing a tax on knowledge. We are entitled to think about the costs that homes without books will bring to this country and about children who are restricted in their access to books as a result of the tax policies of this government.</para><para>Senator Alston, who seems so keen to ensure that the ACCC takes an interest in the operations of a particular book company, has said himself just how important the book printing industry in this country really is and what a tremendous success it has been. What 
 sort of success would it be with a tax of up to 10 per cent on books?</para><para>I think we ought to remind ourselves of what the Democrats said in their report to this parliament just a few months ago. They said:</para><para>A tax on books is a tax on knowledge and the dissemination of knowledge. In terms of taxing school books, the GST is regressive because it will have the most significant impact on those who already have the greatest difficulty in purchasing school books.</para><para>The Democrats also said in their report to this Senate:</para><para>Books are the cornerstone of a literate and well informed society. According to the Australian Society of Authors, Australians are presently the biggest per capita buyers of books in the world.</para><para>They went on to say:</para><para>Research points to a strong correlation between the levels of educational attainment in children and the number of books in the home.</para><para>You are entitled to ask: what are the Democrats doing to support those words in action? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>5604</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There have been some pretty desperate statements made today, none more so than by Senator Carr just then.

He failed to point out—not that we would expect him ever to bring the true facts to this chamber—that educational books would be exempt under the GST. You failed to mention that first-up. You were trying to make a debating point, but the best points, Senator Carr, are those made when the facts are put on the table.

The comments of the former Premier of Victoria, Mr Cain, about Senator Carr are significant in this debate because of the destabilising, unfactual comments Senator Carr brings into this chamber. He did the same thing in Victoria. In fact they have shunted him off to here; they pensioned him off. But I must get in this quote from former Premier Cain:</para></talk.start></continue><para>(I was to tell Kim Carr in mid-1991 when I saw him in Parliament House by chance that he could take a lot of the credit for the destruction of Victoria's Labor government.

Exactly right. What sort of revelation is that? That is exactly why the ACCC is there. And to question its integrity is unbefitting of this debate. You can have this debate as much as you like but to drag in the ACCC is unbecoming; it is desperate stakes.</para><para>One thing we can say about the ACCC under Professor Fels is that they have always acted within the Trade Practices Act; they have never abused their position; and they show no fear or favour. Some big boys have fallen under Professor Fels—like the AMP Society which paid a record $50 million for a breach of the Trade Practices Act. I think they have had Coles Myer before them; they have had the oil companies before them. They show no fear or favour, so if they come down 
 with a particular judgment on some bookshop that has been undertaking misleading advertising they have my support.

He has dealt with the ACCC from both sides: making representations for the sugar industry and making representations for the changes in the Trade Practices Act with regard to section 50 mergers. He has dealt with Professor Fels and his crowd and he can only speak highly of their integrity. But you are willing to drag them into this tax debate, as you are dragging in the Democrats. The Democrats can take it; they are in the game. They are now negotiating with the government in the real game. But it is unbecoming for you to drag the ACCC into this debate.

 February this year to assist the Coroner and the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia in their inquiries into the event. A copy was also provided to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The Director of Meteorology advises me that to assist the Coroner's Office the Bureau of Meteorology is conducting further analysis of meteorological aspects of the storm which so affected the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. This completed analysis is expected to be provided to the Coroner's Office by about the end of July 1999.</para><para>At 1.00 PM on December 26 last year 115 yachts set sail in the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. Only 44 of those yachts reached their destination.</para><para>The destruction caused by a storm triggered a massive search and rescue operation, and ultimately led to six deaths and to the abandonment of several yachts.</para><para>The weather conditions at the commencement of the Race were favourable for a fast start, with northerly winds over all of southeastern Australia, including Sydney. Nevertheless, there was a cold front approaching the west coast of Tasmania, and on the morning of the 26th of December, race crews were briefed by the Bureau of Meteorology that gale force southwesterly winds could be expected when the front passed over the fleet as they approached Bass Strait.</para><para>Coincident with the start time for the race, at around 1 pm on the 26th of December, output from the Bureau of Meteorology's high resolution computer model became available which gave the first indication of possible storm force winds in the eastern Bass Strait region. Just after 2pm on the 26th of December the Bureau issued a Storm Warning for an area which included the course to be taken by the Sydney to Hobart fleet. This warning was issued some 18 hours before the lead vessels encountered storm force winds.</para><para>A Storm Warning is the highest category of warning issued to sailors outside of the tropics (where hurricane warnings are issued for severe tropical cyclones). Storm warnings are rarely issued by the Bureau of Meteorology for coastal waters, and are intended to warn of very dangerous weather and sea conditions.</para><para>Upon issue, the Bureau of Meteorology's Storm Warning was distributed by radio facsimile, satellite communication systems, telephone facsimile, pager systems, the Internet, coastal radio, and also provided directly to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the Eden Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol, and the Sydney to Hobart Race media centre. The Storm Warning was routinely updated until the storm force winds dissipated.</para><para>As required by the agreed international conventions the Bureau of Meteorology's Storm Warnings gave 
 forecasts of average wind speeds in knots and significant wave heights in metres.</para><para>Average wind speeds are an average of the wind speed over ten minutes and should not be confused with much briefer, but stronger, gusts. The significant wave height is the average height of the highest third of waves and should not be confused with the occasional rogue or king waves which may approach twice the significant wave height.</para><para>The Bureau of Meteorology's storm warnings were for winds to 55 knots and waves to 7 metres.</para><para>During the course of the race the Bureau only received one meteorological observation indicating conditions worse than those forecast. At 9am on Sunday the 27th of December at Wilsons Promontory the wind speed peaked at 79 knots. Because of the elevation of this observing station (around l00m above sea level) and because of other local effects (the observation is taken at the top of a sheer cliff), the Bureau of Meteorology does not consider this reading to describe accurately the conditions being experienced near the sea surface over the open ocean.</para><para>Since the race there have been reports of conditions more severe than indicated in the Bureau of Meteorology's Storm Warnings. These reports will be considered in the extended analysis now being prepared by the Director of Meteorology.</para><para>This Preliminary Report does however show that on the basis of the meteorological evidence available to the forecasters at around 1 pm on the 26th of December, the storm warning issued by the Bureau of Meteorology was an accurate and timely forecast of the severe conditions that were to emerge the next day.</para><para>Discussions since the event have shown that not all sailors fully understand the meanings of average, or mean wind speed, and significant wave height. Some would also appear to have a limited appreciation of the severity of conditions to be expected when a storm warning is issued. The Director of Meteorology has advised me that the Bureau of Meteorology will intensify its efforts to ensure that the sailing community has not only access to high quality meteorological information, but also a high level of understanding of the implications for them of that meteorological information.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>—I table the statement and the preliminary report by the Director of Meteorology on the Meteorological Aspects of the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race and seek leave to move a motion.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That the Senate take note of the documents.

It is designed to address a very real problem that Australia has, and that problem is the possibility that human rights abuses will occur because of equipment, training or weapons supplied by Australia. It is designed to hold accountable the recipients of any equipment and aid that come from us.</para></talk.start><para>Senator John Woodley initiated this bill in 1997 as a revision to the Defence Cooperation Control Amendment Bill introduced by Mr Garry Gibson in the House of Representatives. These bills were presented in response to a 1994 Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report which we believe gave an unbalanced weighting to the economic benefits of defence exports. I was a member of the committee that looked into those defence exports and along with Mr Gibson and, I think, another four members of the committee, including Senator Margetts and Senator Reynolds, I put in an additional report which gave more force to benefits other than the economic benefits of defence exports.</para><para>Senator Woodley gave a detailed review of some of the past Australian arms sales and defence cooperation activities when he launched his bill in 1997, but as that was quite some time ago I will give a brief summary of some of those points. In 1990 the then defence minister announced the sale of obsolete Mirage fighters and ancillary equipment for $36 million to Pakistan. That was despite the likelihood of ongoing hostilities between India and Pakistan. Trade relationships were not made any easier by that.</para><para>In 1989 Australia sold aircraft engine parts to Burma where the then SLORC—now the SPDC, the State Protection and Development Council—presided and still presides over notorious human rights abuses. Australia has also sold arms to desperately poor nations such as Namibia and Bangladesh. In addition, Australia sold 7,000 `non-military' rifles to Singapore in one year. This is a country with tough gun laws where no hunting is allowed. As Australia has distanced itself more from 
 the Bougainville conflict, PNG has started buying arms from Singapore.</para><para>Today I want to focus more on defence cooperation, that is, the training and the development that our armed forces provide to other nations. We have often heard the argument in favour of unconditional defence cooperation. It goes along these lines: we can educate other countries in our democratic ways through training and providing equipment for that country's military forces and through our training and influence they will come to a better understanding and practice of democracy and their human rights transgressions will fade away. Let us talk today about one of the biggest recipients of our defence cooperation, Indonesia, and then we can judge the merits of this argument for ourselves.</para><para>As early as 1970, Australia was targeting Indonesia for the largest amount of defence cooperation. Even then Australia was supplying Sabre jets and Army surveying teams to map its regions. I have recently read a report by Action in Solidarity with Indonesia and East Timor, ASIET, which gives a detailed history of Australian and Indonesian defence cooperation. I will point out from that report a few highlights of our history of defence cooperation with Indonesia. Since 1970 there has been only one short interruption—between 1986 and 1991—of that defence cooperation. After the November 1991 Dili massacre, the US Congress cancelled the US provided training programs in Indonesia. Fortunately for the Indonesian military, Australia was happy to take over from the US.</para><para>The Australian Special Air Services, SAS, and Kopassus, the special services of the Indonesian military, have held joint annual exercises since 1994. I think they have been suspended now—I hope so. Kopassus is the most highly trained part of the Indonesian military. They have benefited from training in rappelling from helicopters, special communications training and advanced shooting drills in Australia.</para><para>In 1995 the Shoalwater Bay training area played host to a land exercise involving Australia and Indonesia entitled Swift Canopy 
 95. Indonesian troops also participated in Kangaroo 95 that year.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">WOODLEY</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>—They should be ashamed of themselves.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name></talker><para>—They should indeed, Senator Woodley. The two air forces regularly hold joint exercises. Also in 1995, former Prime Minister Paul Keating and the then President Suharto signed the agreement on maintaining security. This agreement was to enable joint operations. It was followed up by a 10-year future directions agreement, the aim of which allows a further increase in training and exercises, logistics cooperation, intelligence exchanges, defence procurements, defence science and technology cooperation. It is also designed to increase the functionality of ABRI's own combat organisation and to enhance the ability of co-deployment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Australia also trains hundreds of Indonesian officers every year. Between 1991 and 1997, the number of Australian trained officers has grown from five in a year to 400 in a year. Last year, 16 of our Army's commissioned and non-commissioned officers went to Indonesia to conduct a `train the trainers' program.</para><para>Now let us have a look at some of the human rights abuses that have occurred in Indonesia whilst Australia was increasing its defence cooperation in the hope that its democratic ways would rub off. For the last 30 years ABRI, the military force benefiting from Australian training and equipment, has controlled `predetermined' elections. It has systematically tortured and intimidated people. If you look at Amnesty International's reports you will find that there is no question about that. In 1975, East Timor was invaded. During that invasion over 200,000 people were reported to have been killed. ABRI has carried out massacres in West Papua, Aceh, East Timor, South Sumatra and Jakarta. In May 1998, Kopassus troops were seen exhibiting their newly acquired rappelling skills: from a helicopter to gain access to a Jakarta university where unarmed students were peacefully protesting. As this was happening, our Australian forces were engaged in joint military war games off the coast of Indonesia. 
 These demonstrations led to the deaths of hundreds of people.</para><para>Some might point to the removal of President Suharto and a move towards a referendum on self-determination for East Timor as proof that we have influenced the Indonesians and convinced them of the merits of democracy. But before we think of that we should ask the people of East Timor, West Papua and Aceh whether their experiences of ABRI indicate any indoctrination of democratic values or human rights. We only have to look to events of the last few weeks to see how ABRI is looking after its own people. We have witnessed massacres in East Timor where ABRI has either been complicit in or, at best, not failed to stop armed militia groups intimidating and murdering East Timorese. The notion of a free vote under these circumstances where the Indonesian military knowingly is allowing massacres to occur is absolutely farcical.</para><para>Indiscriminate defence cooperation does not appear to educate and influence anyone to our ways, but it does lend legitimacy to corrupt or cruel regimes. Legitimacy is a very valuable commodity. It is not something that can be bought; it has to be earned. Australia has given legitimacy to Indonesia's ruling elite not only by giving it de jure recognition in 1978 but also by involvement in, and nurturing of, the Indonesian defence forces through defence cooperation. We must ask ourselves whether, in the process of legitimising Indonesia's military, we have tainted ourselves more than we have influenced their move to democracy and to human rights.</para><para>Successive Australian governments have a track record of providing military aid to repressive regimes. This legislation will ensure that they cannot do so in the future. There is a growing recognition around the world that providers of military hardware training and aid must take responsibility for knowing the outcomes of their transactions. The recipients must be accountable for the way that aid is used. But there must be a consistency in the conditionality otherwise economic and political interests will always hold sway. Defence cooperation will still be given to countries that provide economic 
 benefits to Australia and cut to countries whose trade with us is considered inconsequential. This bill provides the level of constant scrutiny required as well as ensuring ongoing monitoring. It ensures that all cooperative agreements are scrutinised, not just those with the poorer nations.</para><para>Another current feature of defence cooperation, that of secrecy, will also be removed under this bill. The complete lack of transparency in government deals means there is no control, monitoring or accountability. In fact, the Department of Defence produces a booklet specifying guidelines for arms transfers and indicates that all cooperation be dealt with as commercial-in-confidence. We have heard that before. This is in direct contravention to the UN conventional arms register which advocates transparency and to which Australia is committed.</para><para>In conclusion, let me summarise the legislative requirements of the legislation proposed by Senator Woodley, and also by Mr Gibson when he was in parliament. Before finalising a defence cooperation agreement or the transfer of military hardware, the government must cause a social impact statement to be made to allow for public discussion. This social impact statement should include, but should not be limited to, a report of the current status of human rights violations, whether by the armed forces or by other formations within the recipient nation; an estimate of the effect of the proposed agreement for defence cooperation on the level of human rights violations within the recipient nation; an estimate of the effect of the proposed agreement for defence cooperation on the level of international tension; the possible breaching of international agreements; and information on the level of health and welfare expenditures as opposed to military expenditures in the recipient country. If the minister is satisfied that all those conditions have been met, he can then provide a certificate.</para><para>The  Defence Cooperation Control Amendment Bill 1997 [1998]  provides a means of ensuring that any military aid and trade that Australia participates in does not contribute to human rights abuses, that the social impact of such trade on the recipient country is con 
 sidered and that recipient countries are subject to ongoing monitoring of human rights violations.</para><para>Finally, I note that Senator Woodley has already tabled a document titled `Discussion of legislative aims', and that is, in effect, the explanatory memorandum to this bill. I seek leave to table that document again in case honourable senators have not seen it and would like to have a look at it.</para><para>Leave granted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>5609</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking to the bill proposed by Senator Woodley, the <inline ref="s56">Defence Cooperation Control Amendment Bill 1997 [1998]</inline> , I indicate that we obviously have a degree of sympathy with the objectives that Senator Woodley has put into the bill. It in many ways reflects a bill that was introduced as a private member's bill back in 1995 by a former Labor member. But it is one thing to have an approach to ensure that human rights are considered utmost in dealing with the export of arms and the trade in arms and military weapons; it is also important that we do it in a way that brings about an outcome that succeeds but does not also work to the detriment of many of the countries that we would like to see progress. We have been very strong on those issues. Indeed, in 1998 we amended our national policy platform with regard to defence exports. The changes to the Labor Party's policy on defence exports say:</para></talk.start><para>Labor will ensure government control over the manufacture and export of arms and munitions. Labor supports the export of Australian defence equipment within strict guidelines. Labor will not permit defence exports to countries: (a) which have an adverse impact on Australia's security interests; (b) which contravene United Nations embargos; and (c) where there is a clear identifiable risk of the proposed export being used for the major suppression or violation of human rights or fundamental freedoms of their own citizens.</para><para>We also say:</para><para>Defence exports are important in maintaining local industry support for the ADF and in contributing to Australia's own defence capability. Accordingly, Labor will review the defence export facilitation program in consultation with industry to ensure maximum opportunities for Australian Defence Industry within the strict guidelines required for defence exports. 
</para><para>If you analyse how Senator Woodley's bill would be implemented, I have to say it does provide many difficulties. Indeed, it would not be unfair to say that the bill would probably preclude any trade in arms and, indeed, probably trade even in non-military type goods. Senator Woodley's bill expands some of the definitions of the Gibson bill of 1995. As I say, that then takes it to an area where it would be almost impossible to implement. In fact, we would probably have difficulty even if we were to do trade with ourselves within certain areas.</para><para>I listened to Senator Bourne, and I have read Senator Woodley's second reading speech given back in 1997. I think that that overlooks a lot of the practices that are already in place. Senator Woodley referred to a report that was done back in 1994 by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, named <inline font-style="italic">Implications of Australian defence exports</inline>. It made a number of recommendations with regard to trade in defence weaponry. The government responded—and it was the Labor government at that time—to the report and, of course, changes were made.</para><para>Senator Woodley also mentions that the Department of Defence has a booklet that sets down the criteria for the export of Australian defence weaponry. The guidelines are headed up `Department of Defence Australian export controls'. It is a general information guide for Australian industry, ensuring Australia's export responsibility. If I can go to the second page of that, it says:</para><para>In assessing applications for the export of defence and related goods, the following criteria are considered. Proposed exports may be denied if they are to countries against which the United Nations Security Council or the United Nations General Assembly has imposed a mandatory arms embargo; to countries with policies or interests which are hostile to the strategic interests of Australia or its friends and allies, such as countries developing weapons of mass destruction or supporting terrorism; to governments that seriously violate their citizens' rights, unless there is no reasonable risk that the goods might be used against those citizens in violation of their human rights . . . </para><para>Of course, having said that, it is quite obvious and it is true that there have been many instances where weapons have been sold and 
 purchased by countries from a whole host of countries that have very high moral applications with respect to trading in weapons and arms. Nevertheless, there have been circumstances that have arisen afterwards that have seen those weapons used against the citizens or some of the citizens of a particular country. The guidelines go on to say:</para><para>. . . where foreign and strategic policy interests outweigh export benefits. If the goods would be used country to an international agreement, be used in conflict, either internal or external; and if bilateral relations with regional countries could be damaged or if the export would be reasonably judged to adversely affect Australian military capability.</para><para>It then goes on to talk about what is control and lists the various categories. It then goes on to how export controls are administered. It says:</para><para>Controls on the export of defence and strategic goods are administered by the Strategic Trade Policy and Operations, STPO, section of the Department of Defence, whilst barrier control lies with the Australian Customs Service.</para><para>It also is implemented through both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade—and there is a group that is overseas—and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. At the end of the day, the final decision rests with the minister. These guidelines were further amended in July 1998. They set down some criteria for denial.</para><para>Applications to export military goods are considered in terms of Australia's broader interests and will be approved unless the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel refuses the application. Export of military goods will not be permitted: (a) to countries against which—</para><para>as I said earlier—</para><para>the United Nations Security Council or the United Nations General Assembly has imposed a mandatory arms embargo; (b) to countries with policies or interests which are inimical to the strategic interests of Australia or its friends or allies. Australia's broad national security interests remain a crucial consideration in assessing defence exports. Countries developing weapons . . . </para><para>And it goes through that. It also says that exports will not be permitted to:</para><para>governments that seriously violate their citizens' rights unless there is no reasonable risk that the goods might be used against those citizens. 
</para><para>When you look at that and put it alongside the bill that Senator Woodley is proposing, you will see that many things are already in place. From my point of view it then becomes, in part, an exercise of implementation. Many of the applications and the tests that need to be applied in the export of defence weapons, et cetera, are in place. It really is a matter of how it is implemented. As I said, the guidelines indicate that the minister has the final say.</para><para>Whilst this legislation is well intentioned—there is no denying that Senator Woodley has put this up in good faith and with the sole intention of bringing about a better world—there are circumstances we have to consider, particularly circumstances with our near neighbours. Senator Bourne mostly spoke about Indonesia throughout her speech, and there are some difficult things happening in Indonesia. Having defence relationships can be very important for the development of those nations. Certainly, no government in Australia has ever entered into a defence arrangement or agreement with the intent of acting to the detriment of a country. We have always sought to act in the best interests of any countries that we have entered into agreements with. Therefore, we have to consider the implications of Senator Woodley's bill along those lines as well. As I said at the outset, I think that, if this bill comes into effect, it would make it impossible for this country to take any course of action in trade in defence weaponry—even in non-military legal goods.</para><para>In the circumstances with which we are confronted, the Labor Party is also concerned and has always been concerned about human rights problems around the world. That is why we changed our policy in the way that we did. We know that there have been mistakes in the past, and we acknowledge them. Defence cooperation can not only bring important security benefits but also assist many developing countries. We have done that. During his second reading speech, Senator Woodley mentioned Bougainville and PNG. Whilst it did not start off too well, and whilst there have been claims that some Australian military equipment was used to attack citizens 
 in Bougainville, at the end of the day we had the intention of bringing about a satisfactory outcome.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—It did not come about through defence cooperation, I can tell you.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—You may say that, Senator Margetts, but I have to say to you that I think the circumstances could have been a lot worse if there had been no cooperation between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Likewise, with the circumstances that are happening in Timor and in Indonesia, it is important that Australia is involved rather than being not involved at all, simply because we feel that there are breaches of human rights—and there are, there is no denying that. What would the situation be if we were not involved at all? That is what I think Senator Woodley's bill would do. It would preclude us from being involved. From the definition of the bill and the application it would have, that is exactly what would happen.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Our position is that any defence cooperation arrangements must be designed to enhance national and regional security or to assist the suppression of violation of human rights or fundamental freedoms of citizens of the countries with which we have cooperative arrangements. It is essential that Australia closely monitors the human rights performances of those countries. And we do—although we may not do it to everybody's satisfaction—with every intention of ensuring the right outcomes.</para><para>It is probably worth mentioning that last October the current government suspended the joint exercise in cooperation between the ADF and the Indonesian special forces, Kopassus. The government avoided any direct mention of human rights issues, preferring to attribute the circumstances of the suspension of those exercises to economic conditions. We certainly supported that step and considered it an appropriate step. That shows how even existing circumstances can work.</para><para>Senator Woodley's bill, as I said, is clearly well intentioned but it does pose a range of difficulties. It is easy to put up a bill for the purposes of achieving certain outcomes, but I think it is far more difficult when you are in 
 government to actually implement these things. If you look at the range of criteria that is currently in place—and that is the point: a range of criteria is in place—if you think there is a problem, then it is a problem of implementation. Turning to some aspects of Senator Woodley's bill, section 6 states:</para><para>(1)	 The Government shall not enter into or continue any defence cooperation unless the following provisions are complied with:</para><para>(a)	 the Minister shall ascertain whether the Government of the State with which it is proposed to enter, or has entered, defence cooperation is using its armed forces or any paramilitary or other ancillary entity as a matter of deliberate policy to deny basic human rights to the people of that State or any other State;</para><para>In some instances that would be almost impossible to find out.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—As a deliberate policy.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—Senator Margetts interjects and says, `As a deliberate policy.' But it would still be almost impossible to find out. If this was the case, these people are not about to jump out of the box and say, `We have a deliberate policy.' We know that where these things happen they happen in a covert way. It would be impossible for the minister of the government of Australia to somehow find out or determine some of these things. But Senator Woodley's bill says:</para></talk.start></continue><para>(b)	 in carrying out the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Minister shall obtain advice in writing from the Department;</para><para>That is good. I am not quite sure what advice the department would provide. It goes on:</para><para>(c)	 before granting an application for an arms transfer or finalising a defence cooperation agreement, the Minister must cause a social impact statement to be made, with opportunity for public comment—the social impact statement must include but is not limited to the following matters:</para><para>	 (i)	 a report of the current status of human rights violations, whether by armed forces or other formations, within the recipient nation;</para><para>That would be very difficult to ascertain. Even if it happened, even if there had been some trade in arms, if we were able to ascertain it, it does not necessarily mean that if we 
 had already had some arrangement or agreement that we would be to blame for that. If you go through the clauses of Senator Woodley's bill, as I said, whilst very well intentioned—and we support all of the intention—it is something that would not be able to be implemented. It would not work and indeed may have a detrimental effect on some of the countries that we would like to see progress in the world. Therefore, as I said, whilst I support the intention of the bill, I cannot support it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>5612</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This afternoon we are debating the <inline ref="s56">Defence Cooperation Control Amendment Bill 1997 [1998]</inline> . This is the first time in five years in this chamber that I have been able to get up and say that I agree with a speech given by my fellow Tasmanian Senator Shane Murphy. I echo his comments that there is no doubt that this bill is well intentioned. As the title of the bill tells us, it is an amendment bill. Therefore, it stands to reason that there is currently legislation in place dealing with these very issues. The amendment bill that is before us is unfortunately far too prescriptive, overly prescriptive, and as a result it is unworkable.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Murphy in his contribution made some references to the legislation that is proposed in section 6, which is the main part of the bill, the operative part of the bill, and it really does have some very real difficulties in relation to implementation. The bill is premised on the view that Australia has the luxury of being able to make choices between the pure and the impure or between absolute evil and absolute good. At the last election when I faced my ballot-paper I had to allocate preferences. As a result, I had to make choices between what I considered to be the lesser of some evils. I had to make that choice. Senator Woodley would be pleased to know that I think I put the Democrats before the Greens.</para><para>Having said that, I invite Senator Woodley and indeed the whole Senate to reflect on the question: if this legislation had been enforced during World War II, would we have been allowed to support what I consider was the 
 evil empire of Stalin? The answer is no. But for good strategic reasons we agreed to support the evil empire of Stalin to overcome an even greater evil of national socialism that was a very real threat to world security at large. So Senator Woodley's legislation, in practical terms, would have meant we could not have supported the allies who were, in effect, supporting communist Russia under Stalin because there were clearly human rights abuses in that country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'CHEE</name><name role="display">Senator O'Chee</name></talker><para>—We couldn't even support the Americans.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>—Indeed, as Senator O'Chee says, at that time because of the situation regarding the civil liberties of black Americans, for example, we would not have even been able to assist the United States in the defence of Australia against the Japanese forces, even when they were in the Pacific bombing Darwin, sending submarines into Sydney Harbour. Just reflect on that for a moment, and I think the point is then well made: whilst this legislation may be well intentioned, its practical outworkings would mean that, if it were implemented in 1945, Australia today would not be the independent nation with a great democratic fabric that she is. We would be, chances are, a Japanese colony.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On balance, cooperating with the United States was for the ultimate good not only of the Australian people but of all the people throughout South-East Asia and the Pacific islands who were subjected to a lot greater evil than was being undertaken at the time in the United States in relation to the civil rights and liberties of black Americans. So just reflect on what would happen to this great country if—and I say this most genuinely—God forbid, we were ever again in the circumstances in which we found ourselves in World War II.</para><para>It is so very easy to come up with high sounding and, indeed, well-motivated proposals. But, at the end of the day, they have to be subjected to an acid test, and the acid test is: what are the practical implications if this legislation is introduced? As I said, the practical implications during the Second World War would have had horrendous consequences for 
 this great nation and for our friends in the region.</para><para>Further reflection ought be had in relation to even if the purest country in the world that had no human rights difficulties whatsoever—perfect in every respect—had to go to war to protect itself against a country that was trying to overtake it or another country in the same region. The fact of life is that, when countries are at war, as of necessity—and this is to be regretted, but it is a fact of life when countries are at war—basic civil liberties, unfortunately, sometimes need to be denied.</para><para>If this pure sort of country—this country that I am sure does not exist anywhere, that the Democrats would have us imagine—were at war, for the security of its people it might have to deny its very own people certain basic human rights—the right of movement, possibly the right to have an electric light glowing of a night. There might be blackouts insisted upon by the government. There might be control on the movement of their population for their own safety because this so-called pure nation is in a state of war. Then, of course, under this legislation, that pure country would not even be allowed to help itself.</para><para>So what I would like to inject into this debate this afternoon is reality of what the implications would be if this legislation were implemented. Very simply, the bottom line is that it cannot and will not work. I am heartened by the fact that the Australian Labor Party appears to have taken a similar approach to us in relation to this legislation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">WOODLEY</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>—You weren't surprised, were you?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>—I have to say to you, Senator Woodley, that my friends in the opposition since they have become an opposition have done huge backflips on tax reform, on privatisation and on other matters.

It is alarmist commentary but, if you pull out the trade figures of Australia and India from that date ever since, you see trade has nothing but blossomed between our two countries. It is a good thing to throw in a second reading speech, because most people out there in the community would not be armed with the facts of the trade figures and would just assume, `Gee, that is a pretty strong argument.' In fact, trade with India blossomed, so that argument falls by the wayside.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—What is the current situation between India and Pakistan?

Does that mean, therefore, that we should not supply them with food, iron ore, coal, paper or any other commodity? What happens if we sell the product to one country which then might on sell it elsewhere? So the sorts of restrictions that are being spoken of in the legislation being suggested by Senator Woodley and the Democrats are that restrictive that we would get into a situation where we would, quite frankly, be dealt out of the world scene and would not be able to make a reasonable and sensible contribution.</para><para>Senator Bourne made reference to Indonesia. If this legislation were in place, for example, we would not have had the Y2K—the year 2000—computer millennium bug conference that was held in Darwin earlier this year, where Indonesia was present. I had the pleasure and honour of opening that conference. You have to ask yourself the question: if the Indonesians are not assisted to overcome that problem, what sort of social mayhem may arise as a result of us not being willing to share with them our intelligence in relation to the Y2K problem? What you may find then is that the situation in Indonesia is even worse than the scenario that Senator Bourne painted for us during her contribution. This is not a debate about absolutes; it is about achieving what is reasonable and realistic in all the circumstances.</para><para>As some commentary was made by Senator Bourne in relation to Indonesia, it may be of interest to the Senate and those listening to consider what Australia's human rights policy is. We believe that megaphone diplomacy has no role in this debate. Human rights considerations are integral to the assistance the 
 government provides to the countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The government's commitment to advancing human rights through the aid program has been reinforced by a 30 per cent increase in funding in the 1999-2000 aid budget for the Human Rights Fund to expand our capacity to fund small, community based human rights activities. This was further to the fivefold increase in the Human Rights Fund in the 1998-99 budget compared with the previous year. I think that indicates where this government is coming from in relation to the human rights issue. Rather than using the megaphone, rather than trying to browbeat others, what we are seeking to do in a constructive way is to work and assist them and try to convince them that the values that we seek to uphold in this country are in fact more appropriate for their people.</para><para>In relation to Indonesia, the government recognises Indonesia as our most important strategic relationship in South-East Asia. It is our closest South-East Asian neighbour and its size and population mean it has a potentially significant role in the Asia-Pacific region. Our long-term objectives are to see Indonesia play a confident and constructive role in regional security and to foster understanding between Australia and Indonesia of our common long-term strategic interests.</para><para>Defence cooperation benefits both countries. So there are benefits to us and, indeed, to our friends in Indonesia—better mutual understanding of strategic perceptions, and opportunities to develop and improve professionalism of each other's armed forces. Our links are broad ranging and are developed at all levels, and I think honourable senators would be aware of them.</para><para>An increase in strategic-level dialogue is evidenced by the Australia-Indonesia Defence Forum held in March this year between the senior leadership of our respective defence organisations, focusing on the roles and responsibilities of the military in the 21st century. That demonstrates the high level of trust and respect embodied in the relationship. As a result of the forum, personnel from each country will need to undertake further work on topics of mutual concern. These include armed forces and the law, military education, 
 accountability in command, new trends in civil-military relations and communicating with the public.</para><para>Under this proposed legislation, those very good initiatives would be denied to the Indonesian defence forces; undoubtedly, those initiatives will be of assistance to them and, indeed, to us. The legislation before us is well intentioned but, in practical terms, not capable of implementation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>5615</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As is mentioned in Senator Woodley's second reading speech, part of the impetus for the Defence Cooperation Control Amendment Bill 1997 [1998] comes from a report that was put together by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Implications of Australian Defence Exports</inline> . I well remember this because I was a member of the committee that drafted this report.

It was very carefully thought through. The issues within that particular report were about the checks and balances in place in relation to Australia's defence exports.</para></talk.start></continue><para>A number of witnesses expressed particular concern at the inadequacy of the process as to whether or not Australia did inadvertently—and let us look at it kindly—export defence products to a country having involvement in human rights abuses; that process was not particularly satisfactory because the Minister for Defence and his department were able to 
 choose whether or not there would be a referral. So, when somebody made an application for Defence to export defence related equipment, the application was referred to a standing interdepartmental committee on defence exports for assessment only if Defence thought that was merited.</para><para>Being aware of the fact that they were looking at the issues of human rights abuses and possible misuse, we asked at the time—as did many other people: why do you give it only to Defence to decide whether or not there is a possible human rights abuse? We used the issue of the Mirage to Pakistan. Also, if I recall correctly, the potential export of grenades to Sri Lanka was stopped because of concerns that were expressed within the parliamentary process.</para><para>At the time we asked for there to be an automatic downloading between Defence and Foreign Affairs, so that someone in Foreign Affairs would also be able to provide advice. If I recall, that did not happen because we were told that somehow it was too difficult, that somehow there was a problem of communicating between the computers of Defence and those of Foreign Affairs. I thought perhaps that argument was a little contrived. But I did think it should be possible for someone in Foreign Affairs to have their eyeball on each of those applications as they were made, so that alarm bells, if necessary, could be rung before Defence picked it up. If Defence were to see it as a defence export or as a mechanical sort of thing, it would not be part of their role to look at what the other wide implications were—and that concern continues.</para><para>Unfortunately, the issue with Australian defence exports is not solved and, potentially, it will not be solved as a result of this piece of legislation. The legislation is narrow inasmuch as it deals with the country-to-country relationship between Australia's defence and the defence of another country. So, as is mentioned in the legislation, it does deal with things such as defence training and transfers; and the Australian Defence Force is involved in a great deal of these.</para><para>It has been of concern to a lot of people that Australia is involved in training the 
 military from other countries where there are particular individuals or forces who will use that training to be more effective in human rights abuse. Senator Abetz indicated that it is impossible to do anything about it. Quite frankly, there was a fairly large inquiry in the United States which resulted from, I think, a television expose of what was happening in the School of the Americas.</para><para>The School of the Americas had the role of training, largely, military from other parts of the wider Americas, middle America and South America. But the implications were that a number of people were eventually identified as having taken that training and using it to be more effectively involved with human rights abuse within their own countries. This included—would you believe, in the School of the Americas—specific training on how to get information from captive prisoners. It was pretty nasty stuff. But, in the case of the United States, the first step was to find out who was being trained.</para><para>Why is it impossible for us to find out who is being trained in Australia and overseas? I have discovered that people who are being trained in Australia or people overseas who are being trained by Australian military do not have to walk around with paper bags over their heads. They are allowed to communicate who they are between each other. But as parliamentarians and as a community we are not permitted to find out who is being trained. All we as a community need to know as to whether Australia is knowingly training people who are known to be involved in human rights abuse is who the people are that public money is being used to train.</para><para>If, as has been mentioned on a number of occasions, the SAS at Swanbourne in my own state are involved in training special forces like Kompassas from Indonesia which have a history of being involved with internal repression and human rights abuse, then questions will be asked. It is reasonable to ask whether or not the very situation that is occurring in Indonesia may not have been made worse by Australian taxpayers' money being used in this form of defence cooperation. This also applies to training carried out in military exercises. While there are lots of reasons for 
 military exercises, it is a question of whether or not some process is undertaken before training agreements are made as to what the outcome of that training will be.</para><para> I was involved with a committee which inquired into training within the military. The question was often put to committee members, `If we don't train those people who have been involved with human rights abuse, how will we ever expect them to mend their ways?' I asked the question: what portion of that training is actually involved in improving human rights performance? I could not find out. In the end, I could only assume there was a feeling that if people from Australia, New Zealand and other countries that we work closely with were in a room with people from countries which had a record of widespread human rights abuse, then a better human rights performance would spread by osmosis. This would happen just by being in the same room.</para><para>That is a really interesting theory. But if a better human rights performance is spread by osmosis, then it is very dangerous to put our high military officials in the same room as those people who are involved in human rights abuse, because it could be a two-way osmosis. It could be that our military officials might become human rights abusers by being in the same room. Apparently, osmosis was the only means of spreading a better human rights outcome for those people who were in the same room.</para><para>It is a question of accountability. For instance, is Australia doing the right thing if we use our defence budget or our aid budget to provide Black Hawk helicopters or to provide assistance and training for people to guard mines in countries where land is being degraded as a result of major environmental travesties? I would argue that is not the right thing for us to do. I would argue people in Australia would be very concerned if they knew that was what was happening to particular elements of our budget. In many cases it has been extremely difficult to find out the details of what is happening with Australian defence cooperation funding—whether it be in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Thailand or a whole range of countries where there have 
 been issues in relation to human rights abuse. It is also a question of whether or not Australia is potentially using its defence cooperation budget perhaps to further an economic interest of Australia at the expense of human rights.</para><para>Australia must bear some responsibility—not the whole responsibility—if, after giving assistance, a situation of major internal turmoil arises. If we blindly support regimes or, in the case of ABRI in Indonesia, if we support elements of the military who have systematically been involved in human rights abuse, then Australia must share some of the blame.</para><para>We have heard the argument that a country is innocent of human rights abuses because `our army is operating separately from our decision making'. But the army, which is using quite expensive equipment, might be arming the paramilitary, which is obviously going to cost several millions of dollars. You would have to suggest that the decision to arm the paramilitary to suppress basic human rights has come from fairly high up. Up until now we have turned a blind eye to the whole system in Indonesia by which ABRI has on a number of documented occasions—whether it is in East Timor, West Papua, Aceh or other parts of Indonesia—been used against the citizens of that country in a very specific and very dire way.</para><para>The intent of this bill is first of all to recognise that that situation is possible and then to suggest that Australia has a responsibility—and I believe it does—to consider what the implications are. There is not just a military implication: there are implications in respect of the signals this is giving to the countries that are involved and in respect of human rights. Unfortunately, a substantial number within the total program have not been open to the extent that it could be seen that Australia was not involved in human rights abuse.</para><para>I guess you do not have to wonder why there has been so much secrecy about who has been trained, to whom assistance has been given and what specific elements of equipment have been provided to which countries under what conditions. Whenever concern is expressed within this parliament about such 
 things as Black Hawk helicopters being used in Bougainville, there is a problem in getting ministers even to admit that this has happened. Once Australia commits itself to being helpful in its defence cooperation, we end with a minister who, by hook or by crook, defends the actions of the government in providing that defence cooperation.</para><para>I am very pleased that Senator Woodley has enabled us to debate this very complex issue, because it is one of those things that we hardly ever get to debate within this parliament. Foreign affairs is an issue on which there is often a consensus between the two parties. I remind the Senate again that, even within the ALP, there are thinking people who realise that there are issues in respect of defence exports that are wider than party solidarity—that human rights issues are important and ought to be carefully considered. I thank Senator Woodley for enabling this debate to take place.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>5618</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, I rise having heard you speak in the debate so eloquently, outlining clearly the position of the Labor Party on this issue. I say to Senator Woodley that, if this was meant to be a debate about human rights abuses in Indonesia, it would have been far more fitting not for the <inline ref="s56">Defence Cooperation Control Amendment Bill 1997 [1998]</inline>  to have been brought forward, but for a general business notice of motion to have been the subject of the debate.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—No, because you guys would have denied it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—You have had your chance. The fact is that we have a bill before us, and that is what this debate is about. I think the debate is substantially broader than the contribution that you have just made, Senator Margetts. My colleague, in describing the bill as being unworkable, was quite correct. Senator Woodley, it may have helped the whole conduct of the debate on this bill if there had been some form of explanatory memorandum so that we could get some insight as to how the bill would work. All I was able to obtain was your second reading speech. Whilst I am grateful for that, I found, 
 when reading the proposal in the bill, that it was basically an impractical bill.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Having said that, I share with a great degree of empathy the intention behind your bill, as did my colleague and as was expressed by Senator Abetz. Whilst Senator Abetz found himself in the most unusual position of agreeing with my colleague Senator Murphy, it goes to show that one of the things about defence is that invariably it is a bipartisan issue, and it has been treated in a bipartisan way by both of the major political parties in this country.</para><para>Senator Woodley, if one looks at the intent of your piece of legislation, one could not disagree with it. The intent is admirable; the intent is fine. But the legislation as it is constructed undoubtedly would achieve nothing more than to box in a government and leave it with no room to move, whether that government be one of the current flavour or a Labor government. That is a position that no government could accept. So, whilst I accept the good intentions of what you have put forward, I believe, as my colleague has already expressed, that the legislation itself is basically unworkable.</para><para>There is a real need for concern about the issue of human rights, and I will turn to that in a moment. When one looks at the definition that you rely upon, one can see the first problem that we will run into with this bill. As my colleague Senator Murphy rightly pointed out, Labor has quite deliberately tightened its policy on the issues of human rights, our defence cooperation and our defence exports. I think that was a responsible position for the Labor Party to have taken. It has seen what has happened in the past, it knew that it needed to tighten its policy, and it took that action. By the same token, Labor has recognised that there is a need for a balance on the issue of human rights—which does not mean that you allow human rights to be abused—balance in terms of security of needs, and balance in the ability to assess what is happening in a security environment. It is no use being on the outside and being unable to assess what is happening on the inside. </para><para>Even though one can clearly see that there are human rights abuses in Indonesia—which are rightly being condemned—one of the advantages at this stage is that at least we have not been excluded from the processes that are taking place within Indonesia. But I do not want this debate to degenerate into the issue of simply Indonesia, because it has broader implications. Purely and simply, I believe that the Australian public has a right to know the intent of this legislation.</para><para>I believe that we should be about obtaining a balance. I am very grateful to Senator Margetts for mentioning the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report <inline font-style="italic">Implications of Australian Defence Exports</inline>, which was the genesis of the legislation before us today. I was glad that Senator Margetts mentioned that there was a majority report which was signed off by the chairman of the committee, Senator Stephen Loosley from Labor. Senator Margetts also acknowledged that there was a minority report which was signed off by Senator Margetts, Senator Bourne, Senator Reynolds, Mr Laurie Ferguson, Mr Gibson and Mr Langmore. It would have been interesting had Senator Margetts continued and told us about the government's response to the report.</para><para>There are government responses to reports—although the current government is a bit tardy in getting them out, and we are aware of that. However, there was a government response to that report. That government response came from the then Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon. Robert Ray—a very honourable person indeed. Senator the Hon. Robert Ray was recognised far and wide for the acumen he brought to his role as defence minister. Without going into the then government's response, it is fair to say that the response of the government of the day, which was signed off by Senator Robert Ray, basically agreed with the recommendations in the majority report and, to all intents and purposes, disagreed with the recommendations in the minority report. That is the best way to characterise it without going into it in minute detail.</para><para>It is interesting to look at some of the specific recommendations in the minority 
 report that were disagreed with by the then Labor government of the day. I think they get to the nub of the problem that is facing this legislation that the Democrats have presented here today through Senator Woodley. Recommendation 4.38 of the minority report said:</para><para>. . . military intelligence work closely with UN arms register and other intelligence organisations, customs and police organisations to assure that there is a truly international and open system for monitoring all aspects of defence trade from manufacture to disposal or use.</para><para>The response by the then Labor government to that recommendation was:</para><para>Not agreed. Australia's intelligence cooperation with other countries is a complex and sensitive matter.</para><para>I am sure those words were chosen wisely and sum up the difficulty of dealing with other nations, agencies and international military forces when in government. The response continues:</para><para>The Australian intelligence community works closely with intelligence organisations and government agencies of friendly countries in monitoring arms transfers of potential significance to Australia, but the sensitivity of intelligence sources means that much of this information cannot be made public.</para><para>We are dealing with a very sensitive area where much of the information cannot be made public.</para><para>Recommendation 4.73 of the minority report involved a recommendation in respect of the Standing Inter-Departmental Committee on Defence Exports and the Inter-Departmental Committee on Defence Materiel Cooperation and Exports. It said:</para><para>SIDCDE and IDCDMCE—</para><para>they believe in acronyms in Defence—</para><para>have so far failed to guarantee the international, political and human rights implications will be considered and adequately incorporated into decisions under the guidelines.</para><para>That is clearly the minority view. In its response, the then Labor government of the day said:</para><para>Not agreed. The government does not accept the premise of this recommendation that the Defence Exports Committee's system fails to guarantee that international, political and human rights are considered and adequately incorporated into decisions. 
 The wide range of departments involved in the process ensures that all aspects are comprehensively considered, both in informal discussions and within the committees.</para><para>The then government's response continues after that. Quite clearly, that has not changed even from that day—or so I am well informed and led to believe. Those two recommendations go to show that, whilst I have no doubt there was good intent on the part of those who signed the minority report, the simple fact remains that we are dealing with a very sensitive and delicate area. As was outlined, that led to the Gibson bill of 1995, and Senator Woodley has subsequently taken up the cudgel.</para><para>I turn now to the legislation. A number of clauses help in understanding a piece of legislation and, in this case, one such clause is the interpretation clause—clause 3. The definition under the clause is very important because it has application throughout the legislation. The definition that is being relied upon here is that `basic human rights' means:</para><para>. . . those rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and formulated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</para><para>That is the definition which is being relied upon. A substantial number of articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights go to the issue of human rights. Let us go through some of them. They say:</para><para>No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</para><para>That is article 5. I agree. Tick.</para><para>Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.</para><para>I agree. Tick.</para><para>All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.</para><para>And so it goes on and on. But as Senator Abetz said, this is the definition that is being relied upon and, if there is a place on earth that is abiding by all of these articles, then please lead me to it; we have found utopia. On that basis, we would not have defence cooperation, we would not have defence relations with anyone because, as my col 
 league Senator Murphy pointed out, clause 6 says:</para><para>(a) the Minister shall ascertain whether the Government of the State with which it is proposed to enter, or has entered, defence cooperation is using its armed forces or any paramilitary or other ancillary entity as a matter of deliberate policy to deny basic human rights . . . </para><para>As I say, the basic human rights are covered by a raft of articles for the people of that state or any other state. So while the intent of the legislation is admirable—one could not disagree that the intent is fine—the fact is that the practicality of applying the legislation leaves a lot to be desired. That is why I expressed my concern when there was no explanatory memorandum which may well have taken us around the difficulties that seem to have been created by the bill before the parliament.</para><para>Let us look at some of the examples of defence cooperation. In the Defence portfolio budget statement that is issued each year with the budget there is an outline of our defence cooperation and our Australian Defence Force exercise program, including our programs with Tonga in terms of personnel projects, training and studies; Samoa; Kiribati; Fiji; Tuvalu; Malaysia; Indonesia; Thailand; Singapore; Vietnam; Indochina. The programs are clearly outlined and clearly subject to scrutiny at the estimates process. I understand from Senator Margetts's proposition that the only thing she cannot get from that process is the name, address and age of all the people from overseas who might be involved in the process. Again, I can understand that there are sensitivities in the divulgence of that information. However, I would be absolutely surprised if the Australians, in their defence cooperation or in their Defence Force exercise programs, were involved in encouraging, inciting or bringing about an abuse of human rights in those nations. One might argue that the program might lead somehow, maybe, to that  happening. But that is not the case. Some four pages of joint exercises are proposed to be held over the next 12 months under the auspices of the Australian Defence Force. They are clearly out in the open and subject to the scrutiny of this parliament through the estimates process.</para><para>At the end of the day, those programs, which are subject to scrutiny and which can be challenged by individual senators, do go ahead and, if there have been abuses out of those programs, then they have certainly not been drawn to the attention of the Senate in my three years in this place. There is no doubt that those programs are important in terms of regional security, Australia's security, and of course in terms of our long-term defence relationships in this region. I want to make a brief statement—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MACDONALD</name><name role="display">Senator Sandy Macdonald</name></talker><para>—It will have to be brief.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—I know it will. I want to make a statement on the human rights issue in Indonesia and the estimates process. At the last estimates I spent up to an hour and a half of the estimates time challenging officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade about the relationship between the military, the paramilitary and the pro-integrationists in Indonesia and the abuse of human rights in that place. It was a very worthwhile exercise, but one of the things that was noted was the fact that I was the only one doing it; there was no-one else there concerned. So people who do have problems with the way Foreign Affairs are dealing with these issues should turn up to Defence estimates.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>5621</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am always interested to follow Senator Hogg in debate and certainly in this debate. As always he takes a sensible view and a considered approach to human rights. I remember that in his maiden speech he spoke about the dignity of the human being, and he has presented that argument in many of the debates in which he has taken part. He made some interesting points about the <inline ref="s56">Defence Cooperation Control Amendment Bill 1997 [1998]</inline> , which is under consideration, pointing out many of the reasons why it would be impossible to implement. I have to agree with him that the subject of human rights abuse is much more complex than Senator Margetts's contribution would have us believe. In the time that I have been in the Senate, Senator Margetts, who purports to have an interest in defence and foreign affairs matters, has wasted literally 
 hundreds of hours talking in the Senate on both subjects. Every word, I suggest, has disappeared without trace.</para></talk.start><para>Worse, she has wasted simply thousands of hours of time of hardworking Defence and Foreign Affairs officials seeking answers to questions on notice that I would swear she never reads. How do I know this? In my time here I have never seen her follow up any of these endless questions that she has asked.</para><para>I make these very brief comments about Indonesia in connection with Senator Margetts's contribution. Indonesia is our enormous neighbour. It is going through very difficult times of change. We may not agree with everything Indonesia is doing or has done, but we want to be their friend and we want to cooperate in their future for their benefit and for ours. I suggest that Senator Margetts would prefer us to cut off all contact and see them behave in a way that perhaps we might consider totally appropriate but in a situation where we would cease to have any influence whatsoever.</para><para>Defence cooperation is vital to Australia's strategic and economic wellbeing. Australia's direct security depends to a very large measure on the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. If this region is in conflict, if trade flows are disruptive, if countries engage in arms races—in short, if the efforts to promote growth and stability fail—then Australia's security and prosperity will suffer. It is as simple as that.</para><para>The government recognises the magnitude of the challenges of maintaining peace in our region—a region not just of fast growing economies but also of complex rivalries and uncertain futures. That means that the government is giving high priority to promoting regional defence engagement with a range of partners. Cooperation is the key to success—not hectoring and antagonism towards those with whom we might appear to have a difference.</para><para>The government strongly supports the continued strategic engagement of the United States in our region because it believes that the United States will continue to be the most effective force of stability in the Asia-Pacific region. That will be the case for many 
 years—on the Korean Peninsula, in the relationship between Taiwan and mainland China and in the role the United States will play in the emerging strategic role that Japan will have to play in the next few decades. That is the assessment with which Australia's neighbours in the region agree.</para><para>The closer defence relations initiative with New Zealand continues to develop and was highlighted by the launch of New Zealand's second Anzac frigate in May last year. Defence continues to build and expand its network of bilateral and multilateral relationships with countries throughout Asia and the Pacific in support of these efforts, and the Australian Defence Force undertakes many bilateral and multilateral deployments around the region every year. These deployments ensure that the ADF does its part to build transparency, trust and confidence and that it is seen and recognised throughout the region as an important force for peace and stability.</para><para>The government recognises that countries of North Asia are becoming more and more important to security in the whole of the region. Defence is expanding its relationships with China, Japan and South Korea, focusing on strategic dialogue and the exchange of information. On China, Defence's policy is to build a solid relationship encouraging Beijing to contribute constructively to regional security.</para><para>The prospects for increasing regional engagement with Australia's closest neighbours in South-East Asia are very good and they have continued to be good since we came into government. We continue to cement the growing maturity of our bilateral ties with Indonesia and the mutual commitment to managing the differences. The Indonesians are having their election on Monday week and I am lucky enough to have been appointed an observer to see that election take place. Clearly the Australian government is concerned not so much with the outcome of the election but with the process, and that process is being partly overseen by officers of the Australian Electoral Commission, a number of civilian observers and a range of politicians from this place and the House of Representatives. </para><para>Defence relations with Thailand continue to be productive. Relations with the Philippines are increasingly important. The training relationship is now quite substantial and is still growing. We continue our commitment to further strengthening ties with our close and longstanding friends Malaysia and Singapore under the auspices of the five power defence arrangements.</para><para>In the South Pacific the Defence Cooperation Program continues to strengthen the ability of Pacific island countries to contribute to their own security in such areas as sovereignty and resource protection. Papua New Guinea is obviously a major focus of our policy of regional defence engagement. The relationship has had its ups and downs in the last few years, especially during the Sandline events and the political crisis that ensued in 1996-97. Following the formation of the new PNG government at that time, our government has endeavoured to ensure that the defence relationship remains on a firm footing. This cooperation extended to the very significant commitment we made during the severe drought affecting Papua New Guinea last year. I will speak more about Papua New Guinea shortly.</para><para>Our task in defence of our Commonwealth is hard. We have a continent to defend, and interests well beyond it. Our strategic environment is becoming more demanding, our military capabilities constantly need to keep improving. The costs of high technology and high capabilities are rising constantly. Our resources will always be limited and we must find ways to deliver more capability for every dollar that we spend. We need to get the biggest bang for our dollar, so to speak.</para><para>We have a proud military tradition, highly respected military capabilities and one of the best defence organisations in the world. Our past achievements and present capabilities are not enough to ensure Australia's security into the future. We will need to do much better if we want to provide Australia with the forces that we need.</para><para>To do better we will need to change. That is nothing new. Over the past 10 years no part of the organisation has been untouched as we become more focused and efficient at almost 
 everything we do. To do better still we will need to do more than that. We will have to change how Defence works to tap into the potential and maximise the contribution of every one of us.</para><para>That is the fundamental challenge for defence today. A country of Australia's size can defend itself only if we deliver more capability than anyone else does for every dollar we spend and for every person we employ. We can do that only by using our brains better. Defence today is a knowledge and technology business. The edge we seek is the knowledge edge in the broadest sense. Our critical assets are the knowledge, the skill and the innovative drive of the people who defend Australia. Australia's future security depends on our ability to expand those skills and knowledge, it depends on our capacity to learn and it depends on our capacity to talk to our neighbours.</para><para>I turn now to our defence relations with the South Pacific, particularly PNG. Our close geography and ties provide the basis for our strategic interest in PNG. Australia remains committed to a defence relationship with PNG that meets the strategic interests of both countries. The focus of our defence relationship is on assisting PNG to provide for its own security and on development of the PNGDF's capacity to support PNG government policy. These objectives are pursued through the Defence Cooperation Program with Papua New Guinea. The Defence Cooperation Program is progressed in a number of different ways. It is progressed through attache staff; regular dialogue at all levels; defence cooperation-funded ADF advisers posted to PNG; an extensive training program funded by defence cooperation; combined ADF-PNGDF exercises funded by defence cooperation; and regular ADF ship and aircraft visits.</para><para>The Australian and Papua New Guinean defence ministers announced the establishment of a new defence partnership in a joint ministerial statement in October 1997. Since then, our cooperative defence activities with Papua New Guinea have been structured to support the principles set out in this statement. Our cooperative defence activities are 
 now undertaken within 12 major program areas, each covering a major defence function focusing on strategic planning, defence management and fundamental military skills. The major programs are: strategic planning, force development planning, financial management, career management, training management, base services, command and control, border security, maritime security, internal security, operational support and constructive relations. Each of these major programs has long-term objectives which are progressed through defence cooperation projects and activities such as training, exercises or attachments.</para><para>Within this framework of defence cooperation with Papua New Guinea recent and forthcoming significant events include the inaugural meeting of the commander PNGDF and the CDF held in Brisbane in April this year; the working level discussions held in PNG in April this year to discuss the status of joint projects and activities; high-level talks planned to be held in Canberra in late May or early June 1999—these talks are designed to facilitate high-level discussions on defence  related matters of mutual interest—and a study visit for the mobility capability project to be conducted with PNG in May 1999 to examine current capability and proposed feasible options for implementation by the PNGDF. A study visit for the training management project is planned for June 1999 with the aim of developing a human resource policy framework and training management system. Ex Paradise, which is a combined RAN-PNGDF maritime element exercise, is scheduled to take place in June-July 1999 in PNG. Coordination group talks are scheduled to be held in Canberra in July. These policy level talks establish the priorities for projects and cooperative activities. Working group talks are planned for September in PNG to discuss training projects and detail. Very clearly, there is very close ADF-PNGDF cooperation at the highest level, and it extends far beyond that in terms of the service that is provided by a whole range of Australian firms to keep the PNGDF force operating.</para><para>Defence cooperation projects, operations and exercises to date include the resumption of exercise Wantok Warrior, a combined 
 ADF-PNGDF land element exercise focused on joint minor civic action tasks, long-range reconnaissance and area familiarisation; the completion of a number of initial study visits for agreed joint projects, including career management, junior officer development and financial management; and an ongoing combined exercise program which currently comprises, as I mentioned, the Paradise series, involving Navy boats, Longreach, a planning exercise on dealing with natural disasters and Wantok Warrier land exercises which have been going on for some time.</para><para>I turn now to the Bougainville problem. Australia's involvement in the peace process has been quite substantial, and those who have taken an interest in Bougainville can be very proud of the role that the peace monitoring group has played on Bougainville. It is a most difficult situation. I see my colleague Senator Quirke here. We had the opportunity to go and visit the peace monitoring group in Bougainville, and I think that we all came away very proud of the role that Australia has played in pursuing the peace process there. It is a very complex and very difficult situation which is, of course, still going on this very day.</para><para>To give a little of the history of the problems of Bougainville, the PNG cabinet met on 1 January 1999 to suspend the application of new provincial government legislation—affecting all other PNG provinces—to Bougainville, paving the way for the formation of a Bougainville reconciliation government. This special treatment for Bougainville has not proceeded without tensions or complications, with the PNG opposition mounting a challenge to the constitutional validity of the suspension. Despite this impasse, momentum in the process has continued.</para><para>Very recently—on 22 April—the Matakana and Okataina understanding was signed in New Zealand by the PNG government and most key Bougainvillean leaders. Parties to that agreement recommitted themselves to the previous Lincoln agreement and set out some additional practical steps for reaching a negotiated settlement.</para><para>Minister Downer released a statement to the media to welcome this milestone in the 
 Bougainville peace process. Many challenges remain, however, and making substantive progress on issues such as disarmament and resolving political differences will require a sustained commitment from all parties. The operation of the Bougainville People's Congress was scheduled to take place yesterday, on 26 May. The peace process continues to make some limited progress, although it still faces significant challenges. The inauguration, as I said, of the Bougainville People's Congress, the BPC, the body formed from the combination of election and selection, took place yesterday. The BPC will represent Bougainville in the negotiations with the government of PNG as outlined in the agreement signed in New Zealand on 22 April.</para><para>I mentioned the Peace Monitoring Group's presence, which continues to ensure a benign security environment for the various activities associated with the peace process and which has allowed Bougainvilleans to resume substantially their normal activities. The few occasions when its presence has not been welcomed have resulted from the actions of disgruntled individuals rather than organised opposition on the island. Around 260 Australians—240 ADF; 20 civilians, some of whom are Foreign Affairs officials, some of whom are Australian Federal Police—are currently deployed to Bougainville with the Peace Monitoring Group. New Zealand has approximately 30 persons participating, and Fiji and Vanuatu a combined total of about 20. The UN has established a small political mission on Bougainville, which operates independently of the Peace Monitoring Group.</para><para>I would like to give a little of the history of the Peace Monitoring Group. Australia's involvement in the current peace process in Bougainville commenced in late 1997 when parties to the dispute signed the historic Burnham Truce in New Zealand. It was agreed at that time that a neutral unarmed multinational Truce Monitoring Group, to be led by New Zealand, would be formed to monitor observance of the Burnham Truce. Approximately 100 Australians deployed to Bougainville at that time as part of the operation, and the original Truce Monitoring Group was, in fact, led by New Zealand.</para><para>The Lincoln Agreement, negotiated by parties in New Zealand in January 1998, determined that a permanent and irrevocable cease-fire would enter into force at midnight on 30 April, to be observed by a Peace Monitoring Group. In transition to the Peace Monitoring Group, Australia took over leadership from New Zealand and took full responsibility for the provision of logistic support to the operation, including equipment, land, air and sea transport and engineering and medical services—a role it previously shared with New Zealand.</para><para>Further to Bougainville, I want to make some comments about our other defence relationships and cooperation in the South Pacific. Within the South Pacific, defence relationships have been developed with Fiji, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Tonga, Samoa, Cook Islands, Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The policy objective for the South Pacific is to strengthen and support sustainable regional and national capabilities which protect the sovereignty of the Pacific island countries. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>5625</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate this evening. There are several aspects in relation to the <inline ref="s56">Defence Cooperation Control Amendment Bill 1997 [1998]</inline>  that I wish to cover. I initially note that it is a timely discussion, particularly given the imminent departure of members of the Australian Federal Police to Indonesia next week. In this field Australia is highly respected. We have a proud record of participation in peacekeeping across the world. We are not ever seen to be positioned in a threatening role. We have been welcomed, done very valuable work and generated extensive feelings of goodwill. I know that our reputation will only be enhanced by the contribution our representatives will make in this very difficult period in the coming weeks and months.</para></talk.start><para>I want to examine a couple of aspects of both the intentions and concerns that formed the basis for this bill. I was interested, in preparing for this contribution this afternoon, to look at a debate that occurred in, I think, 
 1995 in the other place in the first incarnation of this bill, the Defence Cooperation Control Bill. I think the contributions of the members who spoke that afternoon were very informative, as they have been today. Mr Gibson, the then member for Moreton, who proposed the bill, referred to Australia's reputation as:</para><para>. . . good `international citizens' who have consistently pursued peace, freedom, democracy and the observance of human rights for the whole period of our nationhood.</para><para>He correctly made reference at the time to the large number of Australian citizens who lost their lives in those very pursuits.</para><para>I recognise the ethical concerns that led to the introduction of this bill, concerns that relate to the fact that Australia is and should continue to be a good international citizen, a view that Australia's international relations, and in this case specifically our defence relations, should be conducted on grounds which take into consideration the human rights or social impact of their agreements.</para><para>In many ways it is really a debate about Australia's role in our region and, in fact, the world at large. The bill cites the need for Australia to consider the social effects of any defence agreement into which we enter—and, I assume, therefore, to not enter into some proposed agreements on the basis that some countries are not suitable. But I do not think it is possible to look at defence cooperation in isolation; it is, in fact, part of a much larger picture of Australia's role—of, in fact, any country's role—in international interaction. What about the social and cultural effects of not engaging in such cooperation? What about the equal and opposite reaction that equates with every action?</para><para>It is very important to look at the broad picture, not the narrow, in this context. We do not operate in a vacuum. To paraphrase the words of John Donne, in fact we are not `an island' in this context. Other countries will take up any space that we vacate. I think it is much more important for Australia to be part of the process, rather than outside of it. In recognising the importance of the interplay of nations in this regard, in recognising the importance of human rights, it is about in fact pursuing a dialogue, not a monologue—not a 
 single story consistently presented, but one which has communication through which we can change views, through which we can ameliorate inappropriate treatment.</para><para>There is clearly a role for Australia to play in taking a leadership position in our region and more broadly across the world, but there is an appropriate mechanism through which to do that, and I do not think that this bill in its current form does that. In fact, having listened to some of the speeches this afternoon, it would almost be possible to assume that Australia does nothing else in international relations; that defence cooperation is apparently the only thing we are all about. Those who have spoken in favour of the bill have paid no heed or credit to other efforts that we are making in our relationships to address both social and human rights issues. I want to look briefly at some of those.</para><para>In December 1997, Australia signed what has become known as the Ottawa Convention—one of over 120 countries to do so. The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction was ratified by Australia earlier this year, in January, and comes into force on 1 July. Australia was a participant in the first meeting of states parties to the Ottawa convention held in Mozambique in May. My lower house colleague the Hon. Kathy Sullivan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, represented the government at this meeting.</para><para>It is worthwhile noting that Mrs Sullivan was appointed as Australia's special representative on demining in March last year. Her brief is to play a key role in ensuring that Australia's demining efforts are coordinated to maximise their effect in the international field.	She is also working to encourage the most effective global organisation of international donor resources to demining, victim assistance projects and landmine awareness education. This is a clear demonstration of our ongoing commitment and longstanding contribution to international efforts to help mine-affected countries.</para><para>The Ottawa convention directs most of its assistance to Cambodia, Laos, Angola, 
 Mozambique and Afghanistan—areas where the effects of landmines are particularly severe. These efforts rely heavily on the expertise and technology of Australia in demining these regions. Australian personnel are involved in training people in most of the major landmine clearance projects around the world. In fact, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade web site notes that by 2005 the Australian government will have spent more than $100 million on demining and related programs. It is important to consider these sorts of programs in context, in the same discussion in which we consider a bill such as the one before us today—the Defence Cooperation Control Amendment Bill.</para><para>In addition, Australia takes its role in providing foreign aid to nations in need very seriously. Again, that is part of the broad picture to which I have referred. Total official development assistance for 1999-2000 will be $1.5 billion, which is a $22 million increase over the 1998-99 budget. This comprises increased aid to East Asia and the Pacific to assist our aid partners in responding to the East Asian financial crisis and support their longer term development needs. That brings total assistance to East Asia and the Pacific to almost $890 million. The increase to East Asia includes doubling the Asia Crisis Fund to $12 million and increasing country program assistance to Indonesia by $6 million.</para><para>The budget includes a package of assistance which is aimed at poverty alleviation and sustainable development at the grassroots level—including, again, increases for demining, the Human Rights Fund, micro-finance and assistance provided directly by Australian missions overseas.</para><para>In relation to micro-finance, this is a very important aspect of the program for women in developing nations in particular, as they often benefit most from these programs. On a recent visit to Bangladesh, Wendy McCarthy and Imelda Roche, examining the operation of micro-finance, came back very convinced of its efficacy. The Sydney Peace Foundation gave its inaugural prize to Professor Muhammad Yunus from the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, who pioneered micro-credit in that regard, and has found it extra 
 ordinarily helpful in assisting with the poverty levels of women in particular.</para><para>On the health front, the budget provides for increased assistance for both polio and iodine deficiency eradication, in support of the global target for eradicating both by 2000. There is a seven per cent increase in funding for the core NGO program, bringing the total increase in the AusAID NGO Cooperation Program since the government was elected in 1996 to over 60 per cent.</para><para>I want to refer briefly to some regional specifics of this aspect of the Commonwealth's commitment, because it is important to consider these in looking at the broad picture, when considering all the contributions that Australia makes in our region and more broadly. In regard to Papua New Guinea and the Pacific—my colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald referred extensively to his recent experiences in Papua New Guinea in relation to Bougainville—in 1999-2000, $264.8 million in country program assistance and $35.5 million in budget support will be provided to PNG, in line with our commitment in the treaty on development cooperation. That is the last year that Australia will provide direct budget support to Papua New Guinea. The majority of our aid is now provided as projects—and projects in the priority sectors of education and training, health and infrastructure.</para><para>Our aid program to the Pacific will increase by about $2 million, the additional funds being directed towards the Solomon Islands, in particular recognition of and support for their economic reform program. In Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, the bilateral aid budget will be maintained in real terms, with assistance to the Palestinian Territories by way of an increase of $900,000. We also provide more assistance to these regions through NGOs and emergency and humanitarian programs.</para><para>There have been previous debates on this bill in its other incarnation. It is important this afternoon to make reference to a number of those. When Mr Atkinson, the former member for Isaacs, addressed this issue, he made a point that I think we would all support about 
 our commitment to the pursuit of human rights. He said:</para><para>With human rights, I think it is important that we have dialogue. Dialogue is one of the greatest areas on which we can rely through which we can achieve a change in people's views. In fact, if there had been more dialogue in connection with Yugoslavia, maybe there would not be some of the difficulties in trying to reach peace solutions that there are today.</para><para>It is more than ironic that he made those comments in October 1996, given the current situation gripping that part of the world. As he said—and I would endorse—dialogue is the key to achieving significant international gains in the pursuit of human rights.</para><para>There are economic aspects of this debate which include the contribution that defence exports make to our overall economic strength. Most critically I would note that there are appropriate channels through which to pursue issues such as the protection of human rights with regard to world trade of arms and national defence. This particular piece of legislation does not in fact fall into that category. What this does is to provide for undue restrictions on Australia's trade dealings where often issues of speed and efficiency will be crucial. The process that is required by this bill ignores existing protocols and would hinder that speed and efficiency.</para><para>The bill calls for the application of a process of certification to be applied to future and current dealings. In terms of the practical cooperation of this process, it could be said that you may as well make it retrospective for all the difficulty that its application in the current structure will cause. If it applies to this particular section of our international relations—defence—why wouldn't you apply it to all our other dealings, the sorts of things I mentioned this afternoon? Why wouldn't you apply it to agricultural goods or manufactured goods? The reality is that this would be hugely impractical and would significantly impair the capacity of our country to operate in an increasingly international world.</para><para>I note that in section 7 in relation to change of circumstances the bill provides for a mechanism to withdraw a certificate if there is a change of circumstances in the nation with which an agreement or deal is made. It 
 does not specify, for example, as far as I can see, what would happen to ongoing dealings or agreements. It does not specify what happens to the participants in that process if the circumstances change.</para><para>In terms of how one actually proceeds down this road, I think it is more about having an approach to defence matters that is informed by information gathered by Foreign Affairs—a whole approach, a comprehensive approach—not with decisions made in isolation and not, as I said, with this sort of legislation to make it happen. I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence in his comments this afternoon said that the prescription within this bill is too restrictive, that it is overprescriptive, unworkable and impractical. There are considerations to be made which are not able to be made in isolation of the consideration of this bill.</para><para>The bill draws largely upon traditional criticisms from the Democrats and from non-government organisations of defence exports and the Defence Cooperation Program in particular. As I have said, it gives no real recognition to this government's or for that matter previous governments' commitments to advancing human rights, particularly in this region. It gives very little recognition to the policies and procedures that are already in place to ensure that defence exports and cooperation are consistent with both our national interests and human rights concerns. These are procedures which ensure that the export of military goods is assessed against relevant criteria which include the human rights situation in the countries of destination. This bill's proposal for public scrutiny of export applications is, as I have said, impractical and unworkable. It ignores the fact that in reality there is both oversight and public scrutiny of such programs.</para><para>What are our objectives in regional engagement? Essentially they are to promote regional security and stability. They are to develop the capacity to work with regional countries to confront future security challenges, either diplomatically or militarily. The strictures that are proposed on Australia's Defence Cooperation Program here are inappropriate and I think in many ways would compromise the 
 ability of responsible ministers to devise and implement the government's regional engagement policy. There is a number of ways in which parliamentary oversight of the sorts of activities that are referred to here already occur, whether we are talking about joint standing committees, Senate legislative committees, debate within the chamber or other matters. The bill's idea, one suspects, of creating a new international body to report on and evaluate transfers of arms sales is unlikely to attract wide international support.</para><para>The Wassenar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms for Dual-Use Goods and Technologies, of which Australia is a founding member, is one of several multilateral organisations already in place to promote responsible export practices. In addition, the government provides data on an annual basis to the United Nations Conventional Arms Register, which encourages transparency in the movement of major armaments. In making these points I seek to talk again about the broad picture. It is not possible, in my view, to sensibly discuss defence cooperation in isolation. It is important to look at the broad picture both internationally and domestically.</para><para>In terms of human rights policies—and several speakers have referred to that this afternoon—this nation has, as I have said before, a long tradition of supporting human rights in our position and globally. We as a government view human rights as an inseparable part of Australia's overall foreign policy approach both because the treatment of human beings is fundamentally a matter of concern to all Australians and because promoting and protecting human rights underpins Australia's broader security and economic interests.</para><para>We have in fact a very simple starting point when it comes to the promotion of human rights. Whatever we do it should be effective. Occasionally, support for human rights will create difficulties in our bilateral relationships, but the best means of managing those difficulties is to focus on practical measures and to address human rights concerns in the context of a sound bilateral relationship. Essentially I think that amounts to cooperation—and 
 cooperation on a range of fronts—rather than confrontation. Some of the examples I provided this afternoon would be within that range. Rather than recourse always to loud public criticism, we believe in offering practical assistance to countries that improve the human rights situation on the ground.</para><para>In this region, the economic and accompanying social crises have focused attention on fundamental rights and freedoms and the necessity for effective democracy and good governance to focus their realisation. That focus is on advancing Australia's national interests by assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development, which is consistent with a strong emphasis on human rights. The sort of aid and the sorts of projects I referred to before are part of that process. We have to be realistic about assessing what we can and cannot achieve in pursuing particular human rights issues.</para><para>The white paper `In the National Interest' notes that the objective of human rights policy should be to make a difference, not just to posture, and I think that is where this bill fails to deliver. It seeks to add further layers of bureaucracy which have enormous potential to discourage exports and investment and risk damaging our policy of regional engagement instead of recognising the steps already taken and the achievements made under the approach currently pursued.</para><para>In promoting human rights, the government's priority is that practical efforts will more likely directly improve human rights situations on the ground. They can include development cooperation programs. They can include assisting in the establishment of national human rights machinery. They can include encouraging bilateral, regional and multilateral discussion of human rights issues and working to both develop and strengthen the effectiveness of regional and international human rights institutions and instruments.</para><para>I referred very briefly in my earlier remarks to the government's commitment to advancing human rights through the Human Rights Fund. That has been reinforced by a 30 per cent increase in funding in the current aid budget to expand our capacity as a nation to 
 fund small community based human rights activities, and this was in fact in addition to a further increase in the budget of the previous year. This is a reinforcement of our commitment to take our aid program into the next century and, when considered with all the other steps we have taken, confirms that human rights considerations are integral to the assistance the government provides to countries in the Asia-Pacific region.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>5629</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="s56">Defence Cooperation Control Amendment Bill 1997 [1998]</inline>  was first introduced into the Senate by Senator Woodley in February 1997. Senator Woodley's stated purpose is to ensure that human rights considerations are given full and appropriate consideration in relation to Australia's defence exports and defence cooperation relationships, and this is a concern that is wholeheartedly shared by the Australian Labor Party.</para></talk.start><para>It was in January 1998 at our national conference where Labor moved to significantly increase the emphasis on human rights issues in our approach to international relations. This has been very clear in Labor's contributions to debates on policy towards East Timor, Indonesia, and countries like Burma. In this regard, the very effective contribution by our shadow foreign minister, Mr Brereton, should be acknowledged.</para><para>In the course of reviewing our approach on these important issues, Labor's national conference specifically adopted a strengthened policy in respect of the relationship between defence exports, defence cooperation and human rights. With regard to defence exports, Labor supports the export of Australian defence equipment within strict guidelines.</para><para>In saying this, I note as an aside that Australia is, by comparison, not a major exporter of defence equipment. But defence exports are important for the development of our defence industries which support the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force and our national security. In this context, it is interesting to note that, if the proposed criteria in Senator Woodley's bill were adopted with regard to imports of military hardware and technology, there would probably be a good argument for 
 not importing from most countries of the world.</para><para>Putting aside the military considerations, if such a policy were adopted, one such country where military hardware would be imported from is Sweden. I raise the example of Sweden because it is interesting. Per capita, Sweden is one of the major foreign aid donors in the world. It has an impeccable human rights record, and it has played an impeccable role in the United Nations and various world organisations. Yet Sweden, comparable in terms of its economic size to Australia, is one of the world's major arms exporters. In fact, it is a country with an active industry policy which includes arms manufacture and export. I raise this because it is not easy to balance economic military arms production and export with issues relating to human rights, and Sweden is an interesting example in this case.</para><para>Labor does not support, and in government would not allow, defence exports to countries which have had an adverse impact on Australia's security interests, which have contravened United Nations embargoes or where there is a clear identifiable risk of the proposed export or violation of human rights or fundamental freedoms of their own citizens. Applied with appropriate rigour and transparency, this would be a good human rights benchmark to apply to our defence exports. Labor acknowledges the important role that defence cooperation—including joint exercises, training and personnel exchanges—plays in building regional security and greater understanding with and among the defence establishments of Australia's neighbours.</para><para>As an aside, it was interesting to read in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Defence Force Journal</inline> of 1998 an article by Commander Michelle Costantino of the Italian Navy, who wrote of the shrinking defence budgets around the world—and personally I do not think that is a bad thing—and growing commitments in the new `world order' which will force, in this case, Western navies into close cooperation, that multinational Navy integration is the way ahead. This is an inevitable trend in regional defence cooperation.</para><para>At the same time, any defence cooperation arrangements must be designed to ensure 
 national and regional security are enhanced and not used to assist the suppression or violation of human rights or fundamental freedom of the citizens of the countries with which we have such cooperative arrangements. Accordingly, it is essential that Australia closely monitor the human rights performances of these countries with whom we engage in defence cooperation.</para><para>I would like to touch on Indonesia relatively briefly. In Australia, as we would all be well aware, there is a clear distinction between military and civilian authority, with ultimate power resting with the government. This is in sharp contrast with Indonesia where the armed forces are the central institution in politics, in administration and in many aspects of the economy. If we look at why that has occurred in the historical context, we need to understand that the military in Indonesia led the fight for independence against the Dutch. They fought a war of independence and they won that war.</para><para>The end of the Suharto regime in May 1998 rightly unleashed a substantial debate about the role of the military in Indonesian society and a reduced role for the military. That approach is a consistent policy of the opposition parties, who, I am pleased to say, have a good chance of winning government when the elections are held in Indonesia.</para><para>I would say to the Senate: does Australia have absolutely no impact on the future role of the military in Indonesian society—and, I would hope, a much diminished role—by simply saying, `We don't want to have any involvement. We want to withdraw totally from the desirable impact of a reduced role of the military in Indonesian society'? I would argue we should, as an ethical consideration, be very active in that debate with a certain level of cooperation with the Indonesian armed forces. I say that in the context of an individual who has a very strong and passionate concern about what has happened in respect of East Timor. I do not necessarily think the appalling record of the Indonesian armed forces in not just East Timor—although that is the most obvious example—but in other areas of Indonesia and the concern about that is incompatible with Australia's 
 links and relationship with the Indonesian military.</para><para>In this regard, Labor welcomed the suspension last October of joint exercises and cooperation between the Australian defence forces and the Indonesian special forces, known as Kopassus. Although the government avoided any direct mention of human rights issues, preferring to attribute the deferral of exercises to Indonesian economic considerations, I would certainly contend that, in light of the revelations of Kopassus's involvement in human rights abuse, including the disappearance of political dissidents in Indonesia and specifically in East Timor and Aceh, this was an appropriate policy response. Since October last year, Kopassus intelligence units have been widely identified as playing a key role in organising, arming and effectively controlling the pro-integrationist militias which have been responsible for the recent reign of terror in East Timor—and I am certainly sure that is not an overstatement—and appear intent on thwarting the conduct of a free and fair ballot on 8 August.</para><para>Clearly, defence cooperation can bring important security benefits for Australia in terms of potentially influencing and enhancing our knowledge and understanding of regional military forces. But these relationships must always be kept under close scrutiny, especially in times of political turmoil and conflict such as is occurring in Indonesia today. There must be an ongoing process of review—something which is ultimately the responsibility of the relevant ministers and the government of the day—to ensure that our defence cooperation both enhances our security and is fully consistent with and supportive of the key human right principles Australia expects should be applied in our international relationships.</para><para>In this regard, Senator Woodley's bill is clearly well intended, but it does pose real difficulties in that it would establish a black and white, rigid framework in which ministers and governments would be obliged to make public judgments on human rights situations in neighbouring countries with equally black and white implications for defence cooperation. I have heard it often said that lawyers 
 have a great capacity to turn black into white or white into black, but international relations, and particularly our relations with countries like Indonesia, are not black and white.</para><para>Labor considers that high standards should be applied with appropriate transparency. Often, however, policy making in these sensitive areas involves very complex judgments about the best and most effective means to advance both our national security interests and our human rights objectives. The framework proposed by Senator Woodley would pose considerable potential difficulties for sensitive bilateral relationships and our ability to advance our human rights objectives.</para><para>Australia does have obligations under the law of armed conflict. Australia does have obligations under international human rights law and, unfortunately, this is not often acknowledged. The United Nations has affirmed on many occasions that international human rights law does apply. In undertaking and planning both exercises and operations, the Australian defence forces must bear in mind all aspects of international law. Australia, as a nation, has not been reluctant to formally bind itself to various international conventions in this regard. We became party to most of The Hague conventions in 1909. The four Geneva conventions were ratified by Australia in 1959, and the additional protocols were ratified in 1991. These are but a few examples that do serve to illustrate that Australia does have obligations and, unfortunately, these are not often recognised in the debate.</para><para>I noticed that one of Senator Woodley's examples in his second reading speech on this legislation referred to the Pacific patrol boat project, and he made some criticisms of that. That particular project—which is the supply of patrol boats to a number of Pacific Islands—is very definitely in their interest, because these Pacific islands face a threat to their fishing resources. They have vast international waters to police. It is an extremely difficult task, and we have rapacious fishing fleets from countries such as Japan and Taiwan flouting international law and agreements. I would argue that this is a good 
 example of very effective cooperation between Australia and the Pacific Island nations.</para><para>Also of interest—and time does not allow me to go into it today—is the recent policy of the newly elected British Labour Party in this regard and the criteria it has put into effect based on its manifesto commitment that the British Labour Party `will not permit the sale of arms to regimes that might use them for internal repression or internal aggression'. With its focus on the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Woodley's bill also fails to recognise the collective responsibility of ministers in relation to these issues.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>5632</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator O'Brien)</name></talker><para>—Order!

It contains a lot of material, a lot of detail about grants that have been given to various community organisations. On the face of it, you would have to say, `Well, this looks like a worthwhile initiative of the government.' But then I turned to page 101, `Program Performance Reports National'. This particular section deals with the Air Pollution in Major Cities Program. A statement on page 101 reads:</para><para>The Natural Heritage Trust also addresses areas requiring a national focus for effective solutions rather than a local, regional, catchment or jurisdictional approach.</para><para>So I thought: terrific, air pollution in major cities; this will make worthwhile reading. I found that the program's goal is to reduce the impact of air pollution on urban areas and, in doing so, contribute to the development of sustainable urban environments. There are a number of worthy objectives: national standards in relation to air quality, national strategies to assist the states and territories, im 
 proved monitoring to better target management, air quality research to improve the basis for policy and decision making, and community education on air quality issues.</para><para>Then there are sections on national standards, national strategies, research and community education. I even found reference to an `Inquiry into urban air pollution in Australia'. Under that heading it is stated:</para><para>Air pollution is consistently identified by Australian Bureau of Statistics' surveys as the major public environmental concern.</para><para>It goes on to state that an independent inquiry into urban air pollution in Australia has been conducted by the Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering. That inquiry examined the causes, scale, trends, effects and costs of air pollution. It also made a series of recommendations which were released as long ago as November 1997 in a major report called <inline font-style="italic">Urban air pollution in Australia</inline> .

And what is one of the two fundamental issues that are being discussed? The diesel fuel rebate. What is the point of all this window-dressing—and that is the best I can describe it as—when the government was originally prepared to give it all away in terms of the diesel fuel rebate?</para><para>I would like to quote from a report by Margo Kingston in today's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> headed `Minister feels heat of diesel debate'.

 the chamber the minister would refer to this report—while over there, bunkered down, it still tries to manoeuvre its way to having greater impact on the environment and air pollution in wanting trucks of 3.5 tonne to have access to the rebate with an extra 300,000 vehicles consequently being brought into the scheme. So far the Democrats have flatly rejected softening their main demand that only trucks above 20 tonnes be able to claim the 25c a litre diesel rebate, and I certainly hope that they will hold firm to protecting the environment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>5633</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Reynolds has gone to the heart of the issue in respect of which this report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Natural Heritage Trust Annual Report—Helping communities helping Australia</inline>  has been produced.

This article is about the disappearance of the Tasmanian tiger. As you would know, the last of the Tasmanian tigers was taken in the mid 1930s. A cousin of mine, John Cooney, who adorns—I use that word advisedly—the north-west part of Tasmania, saw it being taken out and brought into Waratah.

At the outset, the opposition wishes to state in clear and unequivocal terms that we continue to maintain our position of opposition to the partial or full privatisation of Telstra and, as a consequence, will oppose, as we have indicated, the <inline ref="r637">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>We put on the record that we oppose this bill because it seeks to achieve outcomes not in the interest of Australian taxpayers. Those outcomes, as we all know, are the sale of 16 per cent of Telstra forthwith and the sale of the outstanding 51 per cent of Telstra in a most shoddy and bogus manner. This aspect, in particular, Labor finds remarkable. If it were not so serious, it could be described as a farce that the government could seek to dispose of a $50 billion asset without further parliamentary scrutiny. This package authorises the sale of the final 51 per cent of Telstra worth something between $50 billion and $60 billion, dependent on the price of shares on the market.

As I was saying, witnesses to the recent Senate inquiry into this package of bills almost universally condemned the model proposed by the government for an inquiry into the service levels of Telstra. As you are aware, Madam Chair, this bill does address in its form the service levels of Telstra. Witnesses variously condemned the limited time frame of six months, the proposal for the inquiry to be conducted in secret, the fact that the public would not be asked to make submissions, the refusal of the government to release any terms of reference for an inquiry prior to Senate consideration, the fact that the eventual terms of reference would be set by regulation and not legislation—despite repeated government denials—and the limited nature of the inquiry in that it only addresses Telstra service levels and not the adequacy or sufficiency of competition within the Telecom market.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If the disposal of $50 to $60 billion of taxpayers' money without any parliamentary scrutiny at all is a disgraceful political act, equally bad are the priorities of the government in the eyes of the opposition. Minister Alston has made repeated references to the social bonus involved in the sale of Telstra. The minister has not been so keen to discuss the obscene amount of transaction fees proposed to be allocated to brokers and bankers. </para><para>The social bonus can accurately be characterised as relatively modest. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> and documents circulated by the government break up the social bonus as follows: an additional $250 million to the Natural Heritage Trust; $70 million over five years to be 
 expended from the rural transactions centres reserve for modern communications services in rural areas; $150 million over three years to be expended from untimed local calls access reserve to allow or improve untimed local calls access; an additional $81 million for regional communication needs over five years; and $120 million over five years to be expended from the TV fund reserved for improved ABC or SBS reception. This is a total of $671 million over five years for a series of at best relatively modest TV, telephony and communications services. Put another way, an average $134 million over five years is the social bonus to be paid to 18 million Australians. Put plainly, the social bonus is an average of $7.40 per year for five years for every Australian.</para><para>This can be compared with the fees to be paid by the Commonwealth for the sale of shares. The ALP minority report explains these fees disbursements in some detail. At page 60, para 2, it says:</para><para>The Department of Finance and Administration gave evidence to this inquiry that the current value of the Commonwealth's remaining shares in Telstra is $55.4 billion. According to the Explanatory Memorandum to the <inline font-style="italic">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998</inline> , fees for the sale of these shares are expected to amount to between 1.5 and 2 per cent of sale proceeds. On this basis, the Government will pay bankers and lawyers between $800 million and $1.1 billion for the sale.</para><para>So while the bankers and lawyers collect in excess of $1 billion, the people of rural and regional Australia stand to reap just $671 million in compensation for the sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra.</para><para>Assume there are 1,000, which is exceptionally high, persons involved in the sale of the remainder of Telstra. Lawyers, accountants, financial advisers, brokers, agents and consultants will receive an average fee between $800,000 and $1.1 million. This is properly characterised as obscene greed and virtual theft. It is simply outrageous.</para><para>So we have two sets of rules. Firstly, specific amounts are allocated to be spent over a five-year period for modest improvements in select Telecom services. We should note carefully that percentage figures are not allocated. Specific amounts only are allocated. 
 Secondly, when it comes to fees for bankers and lawyers, the fees are set at between 1.5 and two per cent of sale proceeds.</para><para>When the bill was tabled in the House last November, the share price of Telstra was around $6. It is now somewhere between $7.50 and $8. Every time the share price goes up, bankers, lawyers and brokers cream off hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money for private gain. There is no extra work, there are no additional requirements, no extra staff are hired and no extra computing or support staff are required. It is simply a transfer of heroic proportions to a select group of professionals because there is no cap on fees or no fixed fee. Any percentage based on the aggregate sale proceeds of a booming telco in a booming stock market is simply greed and waste. Each Australian who funded the growth of Telstra receives in compensation a lousy $7.40 a year for five years. On this point, page 60 of the opposition senators' report continues:</para><para>Opposition Senators condemn the Government for its pitiful attempt at bribery. The residents of rural and regional Australia, far from feeling placated by additional funding, should feel outraged that their telecommunication needs are worth less than the services supplied by the myriad of bankers and lawyers fortunate enough to be aboard the Telstra sale gravy train.</para><para>Turning now to Labor's rationale for continuing opposition to Telstra privatisation—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Are you going to relate this in some way to the amendment?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>—Yes, I am coming to the amendment before the chair, Madam Chair.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Thank you.

Those reasons are, firstly, the service levels in less profitable areas of Australia. That is the exact point that is being addressed by Senator Allison's amendment. Secondly, remittances or dividends to government—again a point addressed by Senator Allison's amendment. Offshore remittances and maintenance of 
 Australia's telecommunications infrastructure are also comprehended by Senator Allison's amendment. Finally, there is investment by Telstra in research and development and loss of jobs.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Addressing each of these points in turn, it is clear that, since the sale of the first one-third of Telstra, service levels in the less profitable areas of Australia have declined. By keeping Telstra in public hands the federal government will retain the right to direct Telstra to ensure that adequate service levels and access to up-to-date technology are delivered to all Australians, particularly in rural, remote and regional Australia. You could not ask for a point more on the thrust of the amendment that is going to be discussed by Senator Allison for the Democrats in a few moments.</para><para>Secondly, the money that Telstra generates each year and pays to the government directly benefits taxpayers. As the level of government ownership in Telstra decreases, so does the dividend to government at the end of each financial year. By keeping Telstra in public hands, the federal government will continue to receive these funds, funds which will grow and grow each year into the future. Thirdly, 35 per cent of the profits of a fully privatised Telstra will go offshore. Fourthly, investment in, and maintenance of, Australia's national telecommunications infrastructure will decline as more of Telstra is sold.</para><para>Australia's telecommunications infrastructure is too crucial an element of the economic, industrial and social framework of the nation to allow any further dilution of government control and ownership. Fifthly, the level of investments by Telstra in research and development for the public good has already begun to decline. Instead of selling Telstra, the government should be ensuring that Telstra continues to invest time, resources and expertise in the innovations and technical infrastructure necessary to take Australian industry into the new millennium.</para><para>Finally, privatisation gives rise to an environment where the emphasis is on reducing staff and staffing costs. This means fewer workers and degraded workplace conditions for those lucky enough to keep their jobs. 
 Telstra has shed nearly 25 per cent of its total work force in less than two years, with further job cuts scheduled for both the current and subsequent financial years. As more and more of Telstra is sold, the pressures on the Telstra board to make decisions based solely on economic and logistical imperatives will increase. Profit for shareholders will become the primary and, eventually, under a fully privatised Telstra, only concern.</para><para>Bitter experience since the sale of the first third has shown that as more and more of Telstra is sold service levels will decline, particularly in rural and regional Australia. Investment in research and development for the national good will cease. Levels of foreign ownership will increase with more of Telstra's profits going overseas. More jobs will be lost in regional Australia. Investment in maintenance of the telecommunications infrastructure in rural and regional areas will decrease. Any notion that Telstra has a social and not just a legislative obligation to provide services to the sick, the disabled, the elderly and the isolated in the Australian community will vanish completely.</para><para>As chapter 3 of the ALP minority report identifies, it is clear that the current pro-competitive regulatory framework regime for telecommunications is still in its infancy. However, it is possible to identify failings in the regime's operations. Witnesses to the Senate hearings—industry participants, consumer and community organisations—repeatedly asserted that there was not as yet a fully operative competitive environment in telecommunications in Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>5637</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are just a couple of other things I want to add to my remarks earlier about this amendment. As we know, earlier this evening the government amendment giving all Australians digital data capability, in theory, was agreed to—anyone will be able to call Telstra and say that they want an ISDN line connected to their house or their business. But the issue here is that well over 90 per cent of Australians have been able to obtain ISDN for a number of years but very few have taken up that technology. Some estimates have suggest 
 ed that only 65 ISDN lines have been connected to residential premises. It is fairly obvious to the Democrats that the reason for this is the prohibitive cost. So I again ask the question: what is the point in having this capability available to all Australians when it is priced out of their reach?</para></talk.start><para>It is arguable that ISDN is of much greater significance to those people in rural and regional areas than it is to those in the cities. The reason is that standard telephone lines in the cities are capable of quite high speed data transfer. Most city dwellers can connect a modem to their standard telephone line, dial their Internet service provider and transmit and receive information at quite high speed. Consequently, they do not have any real need for ISDN technology. But it is quite a different story in rural and remote communities. Their telephone lines quite often are not capable of carrying data at high speeds and so access to the Internet is prohibitively slow. And, of course, the slower it is the more expensive it is for those people using it.</para><para>It is those people in rural and remote areas who can potentially benefit the most from access to an ISDN line. But with the government proposing to simply allow Telstra to charge standard commercial rates for ISDN, those people will simply not be able to afford the service. Many of those people would have had ISDN available for quite some time but would not have been able to afford it. The government's amendments will simply mean nothing to those people. Those people want the government to make ISDN available at an affordable price.</para><para>To use an analogy here, it is like the government approving the use of a drug to combat an illness. If that drug is simply not affordable and the government will not take action to reduce the price of the drug, the approval of the drug for use becomes completely pointless. So, too, the availability of ISDN to Australians is pointless if they cannot afford to subscribe to the service.</para><para>Our amendment has two parts to it. The first part is to make ISDN available to all Australians. It achieves the same result as the government's amendment that we have just agreed to. But the second part is very signifi 
 cant. It refers to the supply of the capability at a price to be determined by the Telecommunications Review Committee. That new committee must determine what is an affordable price for access to ISDN. In doing so, the committee will be able to invite public submissions and call witnesses to give evidence at a public hearing or hearings—there may be the need for more than one. Then the price will be reviewed by the committee at least every two years.</para><para>We know that ISDN has the potential to provide enormous benefits to people in rural and remote Australia, and the Australian Democrats would like to see those people being able to access those benefits. The minister commented during the debate on the previous amendment that ISDN is a premium service. That may be the case, but it should not be priced as a premium service. It should be available for those people who are very keen to have it but at this stage simply cannot afford the purchase price.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>5638</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Can I just indicate that the reason why the government believes that this Democrats' amendment should not be supported under any circumstances is that, for a start, the Senate has just put in place a new digital data USO regime. So this would, in effect, put a second one on top of it—but not one that would be consistent with the embedded approach. The actual wording of the Democrats' amendment talks about `the designated basic ISDN'. That is not a defined term. Telstra offers a basic rate ISDN, but there is a number of basic ISDN products. So there would be confusion from the outset about what precisely was meant. It certainly does not indicate that an asymmetric rather than a symmetric service is required—in other words, if you are to have the same bit speed both ways it is much more expensive than to simply have it dial up and then have 64 kilobits down.</para></talk.start><para>The whole concept of the USO is a minimum standard of service. If you are going to allow people as a matter of automatic entitlement to have a high-speed uplink, you are effectively treating them as small 
 businesses and giving them a regime that is designed entirely for households and residential consumers. So it is vague in that respect. There is nothing here to require the ISDN comparable service to be made available as widely as possible—unlike our amendments, which have to be available to at least 96 per cent of the population. So, once again, it would fail the test of universality. There is no provision in the proposed amendment to enable the implementation of the government's commitment to establish a scheme subsidising the cost of the customer equipment. That is a critical issue of affordability. As Senator Allison rightly indicates, most of these services are price sensitive.</para><para>But it is also very important to remember what I did say earlier on, and that is that ISDN has already been made a declared service by the ACCC, which means that for the first time other carriers will be able to obtain a commercially negotiated price—or, if necessary, an arbitrated ACCC price. That will then be able to be passed on to retail customers. That is what has been missing to date. You have not had the competition in the marketplace. Telstra has, therefore, treated it as a premium product, irrespective of the underlying cost to Telstra. It having been made a declared service, the cost will, one would assume, come down very significantly. That will provide the opportunity for real competition in the marketplace. By adopting the funding methodology used for the rest of the USO, the Democrats' amendment would enable carriers who either are now supplying such services commercially or have indicated that they intend to do so in the future to claim losses from the rest of the industry that they should bear themselves.</para><para>Finally, this amendment proceeds on the basis of price controls, which are in every other area not only an anathema but in some respects unconstitutional, because the Commonwealth does not have the power to fix prices—as those of us who have been the around long enough to remember referendums on the subject in Mr Whitlam's time can attest. So it does have a whole raft of very serious problems. Democrats' amendment No. 2 sets the composition and structure of the 
 review committee that would be established and charged with simply setting an affordable price, which would presumably have no regard to the interests of other than consumers—in other words, if you have enough consumers saying, `We want this on a giveaway basis,' that amendment would effectively require that to be the case. `Affordable' is as long as your arm. There has got to be some element of commerciality, and the USO normally provides a subsidy to the extent that uncommerciality is required. So, for whole range of reasons, can I say that—the government amendment having been passed by the Senate—it would be quite incongruous and highly confusing, apart from not really even achieving the aims claimed for it, if this bunch of amendments were to succeed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>5639</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in support of the Democrats' amendment. For all the minister has said, in reality what he has not really looked after is that other four per cent of Australians for whom there was still, presumably, a commitment made by the government at the last election to provide a 64 kilobit service. Having been at various hearings in relation to the previous sale of Telstra effort, this was shoved down the necks of anybody who complained about their concerns about not getting a decent service—that that was the government's promise, and didn't they know it. So the government has put forward their amendment—and, of course, we have dealt with that—to require that service be made available in accordance with that commitment. What the government did not do was make that technology affordable. The minister, in fact, has argued the same thing about the Democrats' amendment. But this actually requires that the price is to be determined by the Telecommunications Review Committee which is to be established if we agree to Democrats' amendment No. 2. The minister cannot have it both ways, and we are prepared to support this as a move in the right direction.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>5639</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If I could just ask the minister a couple of questions arising out of his comments.

There should be competition in the marketplace to provide the incentives for price reductions, and there has not been that to date. The next best option is for carriers to interconnect with Telstra's ISDN system; in other words, ideally they would roll out their own. They would be offering a competing, stand-alone ISDN product. They have not done that because they have not got the networks to do it, particularly in non-metropolitan Australia. So 
 the next best thing is to get access to Telstra's ISDN network.</para></talk.start><para>Until something is a declared service, you simply ask Telstra and they can say no or they can charge you an arm and a leg, and you are left lamenting. But under the new competition regime—part XIB and XIC of the Trade Practices Act—you are entitled to approach a carrier, seek to negotiate on fair and reasonable terms and get an `affordable' price, in your terminology. If you do not get that or you are not satisfied, you then apply to the ACCC and the ACCC declares it as a service, which means you can then, in the absence of commercial agreement, have the matter arbitrated. So for the first time the ACCC will be able to set a wholesale price for interconnect access to Telstra's network in terms of ISDN availability. That means other carriers will be able to offer competing ISDN products on a much lower cost base than if they simply had to take whatever price Telstra gave them. So that is a very significant step forward.</para><para>I am not sure that anyone has yet sought to have the matter arbitrated. But there is nothing particularly surprising about that: the threshold issue is to make it a declared service; once it is, then everyone knows that unless you do a deal you will find yourself in arbitration. So I think it is inevitable that there will be, either by agreement or by determination of the ACCC, a much more affordable and attractive wholesale rate which will then enable real competition to occur in the marketplace.</para><para>What might that be? In some respects ISDN is an interim technology—64 kilobits is not bad these days but you can probably do a lot better. If you have direct satellite downlinks, you may not need ISDN on the fixed line anymore. As you are probably aware, Telstra and other carriers around the world are investigating what is called a suite of DSL technologies, which enable you to use the existing copper pairs. That may well prove to be much more cost effective than ISDN, which is, I suppose, in some part why we only mandated capability rather than availability. So all I can say to you is all the signs are propitious. One way or another there is going to be increasing 
 demand and there is going to be an increasing number of suppliers wanting to meet that demand. Telstra has bottleneck capacity in a number of areas. We have, I think, a world leading regime to tackle that and therefore I would expect that ISDN or equivalent services are going to be widely available and affordable in the not too distant future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>5640</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have a couple of questions for the minister arising out of the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats.

I should put on the record a few comments about the extension of the USO to include provision of digital data at the 64 kilobits level or equivalent on demand. It is at this early stage very worth while to repeat a bit of history about this issue because it is of interest, but it is also a bit of a fraud being perpetrated by the government. The government is proposing to implement the election commitment it went to the people with in October 1998. The government is also hoping that no-one will remember its 1996 election commitment. When it made the 1996 election commitment, it promised all Australians that the 64 kilobits would apply across the entire continent without exception and to all units in Australia. There were to be no exceptions.</para></talk.start><para>In those days we were in government and we had advised the then opposition that their promise to the Australian people was simply not possible to be achieved. It was possible then, because we knew it could be provided on a cost-effective basis, to provide it to 95 or 96 per cent of the Australian population. We so advised the opposition of the day that, once you went past that critical figure of 95 or 96 per cent into the outlying areas, to the far reaches of our continent, then the cost would blow out of all proportion. It would 
 blow out to the figure of around $2 billion. The then opposition said, `The ALP is lying. They have been reluctant to do it. They wouldn't spend the necessary sums on rural and regional Australia.' They simply refused to acknowledge the veracity of what we had advised them.</para><para>On the third or fourth day after the government came into office the heads of all departments came to see Senator Alston. One of the issues that Senator Alston wanted to discuss with them was how the new government was going to honour its election commitment. Mr Shaw said to Senator Alston, `Minister, there's a problem.' Senator Alston said, `What's that, Mr Shaw?'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOSWELL</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—Were you in the room?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>—I was not in the room, but I have heard it. He said, `There's a problem, Senator.' Senator Alston said, `What's the problem, Mr Shaw?' He said, `If you want to go past 95 or 96 per cent penetration rate, it is going to cost you $1.8 billion.' Senator Alston said, `What are you talking about, man? What are you talking about? We've promised to deliver this service to all Australians. We've been out of government for 13 years. We're the new breed. We come in and speak the truth. You just go and get that 100 per cent and don't worry about the $1.8 billion.' Mr Shaw was an intelligent and respected public servant. He knew the minister had to know the truth, so he pressed again. He said, `But, Minister, with respect, the figure really is $1.8 billion. What you were advised by the previous government was not a pack of lies; that was the truth. It might have been a little bit rough on the edges. We didn't do the final figures. It might have been $50 million here or $75 million there, but in all those private meetings you had—none of them were on the record—what the then government said was correct.' Senator Alston said, `My goodness. What are we going to do?'</para></talk.start></continue><para>They adjourned for a while and Senator Alston had some consultations with his colleagues and he explained to them what Mr Shaw said. Most of the boys knew Mr Shaw. They had been watching him in estimates hearings for years. They had made an assess 
 ment of his worth, of his credibility, of his character. They had come to the view that he might have had some dealings with those rats in the ALP but he was not a bad sort of bloke. He basically spoke the truth. Senator Alston had to advise all the boys, and probably some of the girls too these days, that it was going to cost $1.8 billion.</para><para>Mr Costello, the Treasurer, heard about that. Mr Howard heard about it. They said, `Senator Alston, you had better come and talk to us.' They said, `What did we go to the election with? What was our plan? Truth and truth in government. Truth in delivery. What was the second most important point? No wastage of public funds. No wastage of taxpayers' money. Senator Alston, you can't spend $1.8 billion building a few phone lines in the bush. That's not on. You'd better go away and have an inquiry. We've heard about that Mr Shaw. He's not a bad bloke either. We've watched him in estimates. We've heard reports. We've had a few boys in the ranks and they've been telling us a few things over the years. He's not a bad public servant. So you just send off that Mr Shaw and have an inquiry.'</para><para>So Mr Shaw was called into Senator Alston's office. Senator Alston said, `Here's the deal, mate. This is what I want you to do. I am not allowed to spend the $1.8 billion. Mr Howard and Mr Costello are the leaders, and we had a couple of promises. We're going to be a truthful and honest government. We're going to deliver, but we can't spend that $1.8 billion. But why don't you go off and have an inquiry, make it a private inquiry—not a lot of people are real interested in this area—get some submissions in and see what they've got to say.' So they went off and had this inquiry.</para><para>Mr Shaw did not have to do a lot of work, to be truthful. He said, `Yes, Minister, I'll do that,' and raced out of the room. He opened up his laptop, pressed a few buttons and, heavens above, there was the figure. It was still $1.8 billion! So he pumped it out, dressed it up in a nice package, had a few copies printed off and said to the minister, `We can't do it.' The minister thought about that for a while. He now had formal advice 
 from all organs of the department. It was not possible to do it. He had authority, the imprimatur, of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister—they were not about to waste the money. He had some private talks with the Nats. They are not silly people. They understand the value of the $1.8 billion. They understood it could be spent elsewhere. There were going to be a few give-aways. The boys were back in town after 13 years. There were a few things to be given away and they could spend it elsewhere.</para><para>This took a while to work through the system. There were a lot of meetings. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer were busy. They really did not want to be bothered that much with all these issues, but they knew they did not want to spend the $1.8 billion. So, come the 1998 election, Senator Alston is still the minister for communications, they still have not delivered on their 1996 election promises, but they know it is going to be close.</para><para>They were going to people with a hard item. They had to sell a 10 per cent tax to everyone. No-one wants to pay a 10 per cent tax. They knew that a few of the members who came in in the previous election were going to lose. They had to be sacrificed—20, 25, 30 of those new members. Some of them had the potential to have long and successful careers in politics, a few of them might have made the front bench, but the decision was made and they were going to go to the people on the GST. There would be casualties, but they had to have a sound communications policy, and that was Senator Alston's job. He had to fix the problem.</para><para>They knew they could not repeat what they had said in 1996. They could not repeat that, so they thought up a new proposition. Their policy was they agreed to an extension of the USO because it conformed with previous principles. Their solution was to get the four per cent equivalent data service. Wonderful word `equivalent'. It changes the whole ball game. We go from total, universal, accessible coverage in the four corners of our land—the whole continent was to be covered in 1996. Well, we are going to cop the 96 per cent coverage. It isn't bad—no-one really argues 
 with that. On the opposition side, we do not say 96 per cent is a bad effort—but we still had to cover the other four per cent. So what they did was they went with the equivalent data service. They said they would pay half the cost of installation and equipment, and the expected cost was between $1,200 and $1,800.</para><para>But the real problem we have is that the 64 kilobit ISDN equivalent is only one way via the satellite. It does not work both ways. So, when you ring up, want to send a fax or want to transmit some data, you dial the number, it zaps up the satellite and zaps down again in record time—no problems at all. But when you want to receive, when you want to get a lot of information in, you are still locked into the old landline system. At best, after three years, the government was able to deliver a half service via the satellite system.</para><para>All those people in small businesses in rural townships, five kilometres outside the exchange, have been given a halfway house. All they are going to get is the upload but not the download. So the government has half delivered. It has gone back on its 1996 promise. It has not delivered in 1998. It has a 96 per cent coverage. It has the satellite up there, downloading at a good rate, but it does not have it uploading.</para><para>So, if you are a consumer, if you are a business, if you want to relocate out of the big cities, if you want to go bush, if you want to go up into the Kimberley, if you want to go into the Northern Territory, if you want to go into the far north of Queensland, if you want to take your family, some capital and open up a small business in one of these wonderful towns in the country areas, you can do that. You thought you might be able to do your business from your new home, from the new country town, but your problem is and remains with the service to be put into place by the government—you only have a halfway house of a system. You can upload but not download. You can send information quickly, you can respond quickly, but, when people want to contact you, when they want to send you documents or a lot of information, when they want to send you reams of information, you are at the same disadvantage that you 
 have been at for the last 100 years. It cannot be received quickly.</para><para>The government are spending between $1,200 and $1,800 per consumer, and that is probably going to apply to something in the order of 300,000 or 400,000 outlets. That is a good beginning; it is a fine development. What the opposition is critical of is that it is a come down; it is a fall back on the 1996 election promise. What happened in October 1998 is that all of the promises that the government had been elected on in 1996 that had not been delivered all of a sudden became not only non-core promises but non-promises. They were finished; they were gone. The government revisited the policy books and developed a whole heap of new promises, and this promise that they are implementing here tonight is a second-rate promise. It provides an excellent service one way to consumers in the bush. But in reverse, the back way, when you want to send material back, you have the same old slow, inefficient system.</para><para>That is really not good enough. The amendment by the Democrats, unfortunately, if successful, would mandate the service both ways. But the cost is out of all proportion; it is just too high. The cost is $1.8 billion. That figure of $1.8 billion is what we said to the government it was prior to the 1996 election. It is what Mr Shaw advised the previous ALP government; it is what Mr Shaw advised the current government. There is no secret about it. It is simply at this stage, no matter how desirable, not cost effective to implement that system. The damage that is being done is to the fabric of trust that is built up in the community, because the government went to the people and promised a particular outcome. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>—We now move to opposition amendments 1 to 20 on sheet 1247.

The bill is about the customer service guarantee, the USO service standards. They are principles which the ALP hold dearly, and they go close to the issues of universality, affordability and accessibility of Telco services. Until recently, and even now, the telephone service was basically a phone in the home, the public phone and, more recently, the odd fax machine. It is now clear that there are an array of potential services all driven by digital technology—for example, Internet connections and data feed—and people, naturally enough, are interested in access to those. So at the minimum, the ALP believes in those three principles—universality, affordability and accessibility. They are reflected in our national platform.</para><para>These three principles cut to the heart of ALP amendments 1 to 20 and go to two key factors. The first is that access to information re the USO be released by the ACA in the 
 public interest, and that is a change from the heavy onus of commercial-in-confidence to public interest. The second is that we seek that information be available and be released by the ACA at the beginning of the process and not at the conclusion. So there are two clear principles that drive these amendments: firstly, that access to information re the USO be released by the ACA in the public interest and not as commercial-in-confidence—and, as I said, that is a change from the heavy onus—and, secondly, that information be available and be released by the ACA at the beginning of the process and not at the conclusion of the process.</para><para>I think people who have observed developments in the various Senate inquiries and public hearings over the last six months well understand that the cost of the USO—including whether that information should be released—has been a very topical issue under discussion. Indeed, over the two or three days of Senate inquiry into the Telstra privatisation bills, that and competitive tendering for USO provision in regional areas emerged as the two key issues under discussion. A range of interested industry groups, consumer associations and competitors of Telstra came along to that inquiry. They made the point that, every time there is an inquiry, or there needs to be access to information, or there needs to be an exchange of information, Telstra draws the line in the sand. In nearly every matter of consequence, Telstra says that important documents are commercial-in-confidence.</para><para>In an organisation that has cashflows of up to $50 billion or $60 billion a year, it is fair comment that many contracts would be commercial-in-confidence and Telstra should not have to release—and we would not seek the release of—the detail of a lot of those agreements to competitors. But it gets to the stage where, every time a consumer issue arises, Telstra appears able to price gouge in the market to deny the operation of effective competitive forces, and alternate carriers, competitors, have no other process by which to complain but to go through lengthy complaint procedures to the ACA.</para><para>As soon as such procedures are initiated, Telstra have developed the habit of taking 
 points of law to the Federal Court and activating various appeal mechanisms. As a consequence, what was intended to be a relatively quick process to ensure competition, and allow reduction in price for product to consumers via competition, is getting mired in a Telstra-devised strategy of always saying, `The information you want is commercial-in-confidence; we would like to give it to you, but we cannot.' As a consequence, lawyers are getting rich, the court system is doing well, but effective competition in the consumer and business market is not being achieved.</para><para>The opposition listened closely to the submissions of a number of the relevant companies, industry groups and consumer associations which came to speak to us privately. They made the same comments in private that they had made in the public forum, and we came to the view that it was no longer appropriate for Telstra to have the legal right to say, `Everything is commercial-in-confidence.' It has reached the stage where we have had deregulation for almost two years and there has not been sufficient change in the method of the system. People—and by `people' I mean Telstra and its competitor carriers—are still locked into the old-fashioned way of thinking via the regulatory and legal framework. The people who are losing are consumers and business users of Telecom services. We came to the view that a test of a much lower standard had to be applied, and that test was `in the public interest'. So the amendment goes to that.</para><para>The second point relates more particularly to the costings of the USO. We are all aware that, for many years now, the USO was agreed by the various carriers to be in the order of $230 million, indexed to CPI for the last three or four years, and the figure that we put through in a bill yesterday was in the order of $253 million.</para><para>But, lo and behold, earlier this year Telstra decided to release the equivalent of a nuclear bomb: it released documents to the effect that the figure for USO provision in country Australia was not the $253 million; it was $1.8 billion. Because of that figure, Telstra sought to receive from competitor carriers 
 their share of the cost of delivery of the USO—in the order of seven times.</para><para>We are of the view that, having learnt from that process with the costing of the $1.8 billion, it probably would have been better if it had been out in the open from the beginning—not just a document tipped out by Telstra and provided to the ACA and, because the ACA had it then under review, not available to its competitors to comment on. On that basis, we are of the view that it would be much better if that material, that information, were released at the beginning of the USO process. So the thrust of these two amendments goes to those two issues.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>5646</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—These amendments, as Senator Bishop has indicated, do two things. Firstly, they extend the range of people who may have access to information related to calculating the universal service obligation cost. The Greens are supportive of amendments Nos 5 to 10, 12, 14, 18 and 19. We believe that it is useful for all the public to have access to this information. We will be supporting this aspect of the ALP's amendments. As we have certain concerns with the other amendments in this block, we will be asking for these amendments to be moved separately.</para></talk.start><para>The second aspect of the amendments changed the balance in judging whether there is a reasonable claim to assessing information held by the Australian Communications Authority. We, the Greens, have put our concerns about how companies can abuse commercial-in-confidence claims to obfuscate transparency and accountability, especially in situations of outsourcing of government services and where public moneys are involved. We have argued this on numerous occasions. As Telstra is still majority publicly owned, these issues are very relevant.</para><para>Certainly, major issues have been raised by other carriers about Telstra's unwillingness to divulge information. During the casualties of Telstra, or CoTs, cases similar claims relating to Telstra's reticence have been made—and those cases related to information about people's telephone bills and those kinds of things. The CoTs cases provided further evidence that Telstra is prepared to use delay 
 tactics to increase the expense for other people, and it has used legal professional privilege to prevent access to documentation when there was no real reason for doing so.</para><para>So, while the Greens are supportive in principle of the ALP's attempts with these amendments, we do have some concerns. There are a number of situations in which there is a balancing issue between various parties' rights to access information or to keep it private and personal. For instance, balancing considerations enshrine into legislation what information can be publicly accessed, accessed in certain circumstances, accessed by certain people, or not accessed at all. Examples are freedom of information legislation or legal professional privilege.</para><para>In this instance, when thinking of some of the circumstances surrounding Telstra's reticence to divulge information, strong provisions, such as those suggested in the ALP's amendments, may seem quite reasonable. However, the ALP's amendments were available to us—and I realise we are all rushed in these instances—only on Tuesday and we have not been able to do enough research into how they will affect various parties and what the scope of the public interest might be.</para><para>Consequently, I would like to ask the opposition a few clarifying questions. A number of amendments change the conditions under which the Australian Communications Authority must or must not give out information or documents. Reference to the phrase `information causing substantial damage to the USO provider' has been deleted and replaced with `in the ACA's opinion, it would be contrary to public interest'. First of all I would like to ask: what are the parameters of the term `public interest' here?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>5646</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Whilst Senator Bishop is talking to advisers and taking some advice—I say welcome to the shadow minister—it may be appropriate for him to know what our feelings are on the opposition's amendments so that perhaps he can answer both the Democrats and the WA Greens at the same time. In certain circumstances eligible persons can request the ACA to provide information to 
 them about the universal service cost claim. The ACA is empowered to provide that information but must decide that making the information available cannot reasonably be expected to cause substantial damage to the other person's commercial or other interest.</para></talk.start><para>Amendments Nos 1, 4, 11, 16 and 20 propose to change the test from `reasonable expectation of causing damage' to `whether the disclosure is contrary to the public interest'. Senator Bishop, you might like to note that we do not—subject to any further remarks you might make—propose to support those amendments. Amendments Nos 5 to 10, 12, 14, 18 and 19 allow any person to request the information rather than just eligible persons who are essentially telecommunications carriers. The Democrats do propose to support those amendments.</para><para>Amendments Nos 2, 3, 13 and 17 allow any person to obtain information about how the universal service cost claim has been calculated. The Democrats do propose to support those amendments. Amendment No. 15, we regret we do not understand. If you can tell us about it, we may end up being able to go with you; we may not. Senator Margetts has already made the point—which everyone here is labouring under—that these amendments which are quite difficult have only recently been circulated, and no-one is at fault for that. That has made it a little difficult for us, particularly when we are dealing with issues like changing the disclosure tests from `substantial damage to commercial interest' to `contrary to public interest'.</para><para> I will enlarge on those amendments we have objections to. We are concerned about the ramification of removing the specific test of `substantial damage to commercial interest' and moving to `contrary to public interest'. Clearly, the former of these tests involves a consideration of the specific interests of the carrier concerned and a decision as to whether disclosure of the information will be detrimental to that carrier. We are a little uncertain as to how a decision will be made as to whether the disclosure of certain information is contrary to the public interest, when what we are really concerned about is avoiding 
 harm to the carrier that originally provided the information to the ACA.</para><para>We cannot see any circumstances in which disclosure could be said to be contrary to the public interest when the information will almost invariably relate to only one organisation. To try to use an analogy, would it be contrary to the public interest to disclose the current balance of my bank account? It just does not make much sense. I ask Senator Bishop if he could give me an example of the type of information the carrier could supply to the ACA, the disclosure of which could be found to be contrary to the public interest. We cannot envisage a circumstance in which that could happen.</para><para> The public interest test is commonly used in the context of freedom of information applications. For example, internal working documents of government do not have to be disclosed under the FOI act if disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. We all have at least a reasonable idea of the sorts of considerations that might be involved in making that sort of decision, and we can all think of at least one or two examples of internal government documents that it would be contrary to the public interest to disclose. But the application to test information which relates to a private company is conceptually difficult.</para><para> With regard to those amendments we are supporting, amendments Nos 5 to 10, 12, 14, 18 and 19, we like the fact that those amendments broaden the range of persons who can seek access to USO cost information lodged by carriers with the ACA and we support the amendments for that reason. We can see no legitimate reason for restricting access to this information to the carriers. In general terms, it is all telecommunications consumers who pay the cost of the USO through increased charges levied by the carriers. To that extent, all telecommunications users should be able to access USO cost information.</para><para> Amendments Nos 2, 3, 13 and 17, which we also support, allow any member of the public to obtain information about how the universal service provider has calculated its universal cost claim and the basis on which a carrier has proposed the declaration of a net 
 cost area. For the same reason as we support the disclosure of USO information to the public, we support those amendments. So I am left with amendment No. 15 which perhaps you can explain to us.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>5648</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The simple response to the points that Senator Murray and Senator Margetts raised is this: arising out of the inquiries, we became aware and concerned that Telstra was having a total regard to its own commercial interests—there was no balance, no independent assessment and no input from any other carrier or interested party. We were of the view, because of the material supplied to that inquiry, that Telstra was not doing that in an objective manner but was almost using it as a first port of call. `Commercial-in-confidence' became a standard response to any request for information.</para></talk.start><para>Many of the requests for information were obviously a try-on—trying to access legitimate commercial secrets that should not have been disclosed—but we came to the view that Telstra was going beyond the bounds of proper behaviour, and commercial-in-confidence had become almost a first port of call.</para><para>The reason we go to the public interest is that we want to have a non-partisan body being able to look at these sorts of claims and to make a decision—an arbitration, if you like. It would do that in the public interest. It would do that necessarily, looking at the interests of Telstra, looking at the interests of other carriers and, perhaps most importantly, looking at the interests of home consumers and business consumers. We want there to be that degree of transparency, independence and impartial assessment. We believe the lessons of the last two years have shown that relying on the simple proposition of the major corporation that something is commercial-in-confidence is not adequate.</para><para>Having said that, we do not believe that the ACA, as part of that process of having regard to the public interest, should participate in or countenance in any way degradation of the national USO provider—limit its options or impose unreasonable or unfair commercial obligations on Telstra. Those are my com 
 ments in respect of the difference between commercial-in-confidence and the USO.</para><para>In respect of amendment No. 15, essentially the public interest test would examine the relative costs and benefits of the disclosure or otherwise of the information in question. Damage to the USO provider, when determining the public interest as significant damage, would be contrary to the public interest. So the essential thrust of the amendment in total is to allow for scrutiny of the methodology and figures used by the universal service provider to come to a particular figure for the USO costs.</para><para>As a universal service provider is unable to put forward a USO figure for the purpose of recovering a proportion of those costs, it is reasonable to expect that the methodology and the figures be released for scrutiny. So that, Senator Murray, is the answer to your broad question. In respect of amendment No. 15, USO calculations by other persons that are forwarded to the ACA—for example a potential future regional universal service provider—can also be subject to such scrutiny.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>5648</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not much the wiser in relation to that interpretation of amendment No. 15.

I guess anybody in the universal service provider would say that anything that damages them is contrary to the public interest, but is that the argument?</para></talk.start><para>I asked the question earlier about the parameters of the term `public interest'. Perhaps I will clarify that further. Has the opposition had any legal advice as to how these words would be interpreted? Would commercial-in-confidence form part of public interest? If not, when would it be possible for the Australian Communication Authority to decide that something was not in the public interest? If not, what are the other elements? If so, should individual commercial interests relate meaningfully to any reasonable concept of the public interest, and what other elements should be included?</para><para>We are wondering whether it would be more useful to give the ACA the power to 
 decide whether to give access to information, based on certain considerations. For instance, considerations could be public interest, whether substantial damage will be caused to the USO provider, and the benefit to the person requesting the information—that is, separating them and not lumping them all together.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>5649</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Whether commercial-in-confidence would be part of the public interest would be one of the matters we would expect the ACA to have regard to.

If we go to the new regime `in the public interest', commercial-in-confidence would be one of many factors we would expect the ACA to have regard to.</para></talk.start><para>In terms of the USO, the thing that drives this is that it is a public obligation; it is taxpayers' funds that are being used to provide the service. We do not regard it as unreasonable, if a figure allegedly quantifies the delivery of those services, that it be out there in the public domain, that it be open to scrutiny and that interested parties can agree with it, disagree with it or criticise it.</para><para>With respect to degradation of the carrier, if the carrier in a competitive market should lose market share or whatever through open competition, that is entirely the market operating and we would have no comment on that.

Telstra was essentially hiding behind it. We thought that that was not achieving the purposes of the act in terms of effective competition. That is why we wanted the ACA to have regard to the public interest. One of the matters that we think Telstra would have regard to in assessing the public interest would be matters identified by Telstra as commercial-in-confidence.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>5649</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I certainly agree with Senator Bishop that there is a problem.

Obviously, people giving evidence to the inquiry were saying that public interest ought to be the basis of the test. However, where is the push coming from for this solution? Is it soundly based?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>5649</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the public hearings and in discussions we had with them thereafter, a range of the competitor carriers to Telstra put a number of points to us. Firstly, they said that they do not believe that the figure of $1.8 billion put out in the public domain by Telstra was accurate. They say that the figure is a gross and deliberate exaggeration. Secondly, they said, `When we went to the ACA to try to look at the methodology used by Telstra to cost that figure of $1.8 billion, access was denied by the ACA on the basis that it had been provided to the ACA by Telstra on a commercial-in-confidence basis.' It almost became a round robin: you could not chal 
 lenge the veracity of the figure because it was commercial-in-confidence, and it was commercial-in-confidence because Telstra said it was.</para></talk.start><para>We are talking about taxpayers' funds. Telstra is still a corporation which is two-thirds owned by the Commonwealth and mandated by parliament to provide particular services to all Australians. Also, where the alternative carriers provided those services to certain parts of Australia they had to pay their share of the USO to Telstra on the basis of market share. On this basis, the carriers suggested that it was quite irregular—at best—for them to receive a bill in the mail for tens of millions of dollars and have to sign off on a cheque without being able to establish the methodology.</para><para> The suggestion of public interest came from a range of industry carriers which are competitors to Telstra. They said, `Put it out in the public domain. Let it be assessed by the ACA. Let us look at it before it comes to a conclusion.

I have absolutely no doubt that Senator Bishop is right. I would be very surprised if the commercial carriers did not want to remove all commercial-in-confidence considerations from Telstra, but I am also absolutely sure that they would not be putting their hands up to remove all the commercial-in-confidence considerations from themselves, even though it is a public service as well.</para></talk.start><para>My concern is that, whilst it might theoretically be what they want, it would not necessarily be the provision that they would like to see all elements of government involved in. I am not in any way, shape, or form arguing from the point of view of protecting corporations. You have heard me arguing on many occasions here that the way commercial-in-confidence is used to hide legitimate public information is outrageous. There are very narrow bands of areas where it is legitimate 
 for commercial-in-confidence to be used to restrict information.</para><para>I am worried that we may have moved to a position which is untenable, in effect, for a telco like Telstra, in as much as there is not then this balance between `public interest' and `damage and benefits to the community'. Whilst I understand the thrust of your amendments, I am not sure that we may not be assuming more than it is actually possible to assume by way of public interest. We might inadvertently inflict a damage if we were to support those particular elements of your amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>5650</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think the answer to the concern you raise, Senator Margetts, is that you have to find an answer that balances the competing considerations. The first position of all the carriers was not a public interest test. Their first position—and their second and third positions—was to say, `Telstra is a public corporation. It is using market power to lock out new competitors. Both the opposition and the current government have mandated a deregulatory regime. They seek to achieve lower prices via competition. We are being prevented from engaging in effective competition by the government's own agency, Telstra. There should be no restrictions. Documents that are put out that impose a cost on us for partial delivery of the USO should be out in the public domain. Everyone should have access to them. We should be able to have that without any restrictions.' That was their first, second and third position. Only when we said to them, `Listen, that is unreasonable. Telstra does have legitimate commercial-in-confidence matters that it needs to consider,' did we resolve around a test of `in the public interest'.</para></talk.start><para>`In the public interest' may not be perfect but we are of the view that it is better than the current regime; that it allows some independent or impartial assessment; that it allows figures amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars to be at least challenged and subject to accounting and financial assessment. Many administrative/judicial entities act in the public interest. There is no doubt in my mind that the Federal Court or the High Court over 
 time have litigated the meaning of `public interest' and there is a clear meaning out there in the law reports. A number of tribunals I have worked before over the years have had as part of their charter to act in the public interest. In our view, the test of public interest allows independent assessment by the government body, having regard to a range of considerations, one of which is commercial-in-confidence but not the sole consideration. We regard that in a competitive market as a significant improvement—albeit not perfect—on the current regime.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>5651</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Perhaps I could just indicate the government's point of view. We understand the concerns of the opposition and others and also the sense of frustration expressed on a fairly regular basis by would-be monopolists or new entrants into the marketplace who espouse the virtues of competition at that stage of the cycle. But one of our concerns really is that this is likely to go too far, because we do have a regime we are proposing that would impose fairly strict limitations on the ACA's capacity to release information. In particular, it would not be able to make available information under this section, the making available of which could reasonably be expected to cause substantial damage.</para></talk.start><para>Once you take out something like that and then you replace it with amendment (16) which effectively says that the ACA must release material even where the interests of a particular carrier outweigh the public interest, then you have gone from a position of trying to avoid substantial damage to a particular party to saying, `Well, we really don't care. As long as one carrier feels it is in its interests, the ACA has no choice but to release that information even though it judges that it is not in the public interest.' So the public interest becomes a fairly important test. I know it is used liberally and frequently and then simply left up to the courts, but this would be an open invitation to ensure endless litigation—the very sort of thing that Senator Bishop quite rightly decries. If there are too many incentives in legislation for those with 
 deep pockets to resort to litigation, then they will do it on a regular basis. And to insert something as broad as the public interest as the determinant of access would be, I think, an irresistible temptation to all concerned.</para><para>We do have a very extensive review of the USO funding arrangements coming up later this year. I would urge the Senate that that is really the most appropriate time to consider these matters, particularly, for example, when one hears the contributions of Senator Margetts and Senator Murray. It is very dangerous to try and do these things on the run. We all understand that we are not wanting to overly favour any one party. If anything, I suppose the sympathies lie with new entrants, but you also have to be sure that you are not trampling on people's rights. And the best way to ensure you are not just responding in an ad hoc manner is to have all of these ideas and particularly these proposed amendments carefully considered in the course of a review process.</para><para>So I would urge the Senate to say that it is not appropriate at this stage to proceed to introduce an entirely different approach which may well lead to substantial damage to carriers' interests and in fact, despite that, require the ACA to release that information. That is not a good way to go. I think there may well be improvements that can be devised which would meet the concerns that I think all of us have. But I do not believe that this approach is likely to advance the cause. If anything, if it is tested in the early stages and you find that the ACA is required to act against the public interest, which is what amendment (16) says, then I think you will find that everyone will be very critical of that system. So I think we should try and get it right by all means. I think there is probably room for improvement but not on the run.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>5651</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was wondering if I might make a helpful suggestion, and I have another question for Senator Bishop at the same time.

The areas which have been indicated by both the Greens (WA) and the Democrats as being supportable with more work—as in some tick-tacking on behalf of the various parties—are Nos (1), (4), (11), (16) and (20). I think the government may never agree to those amendments and the minister would like to throw the whole lot out, but I am suggesting that we vote on those where there is a greater clarity and agreement. Those where there might be possibility of support are (1), (4), (11)—and I include (15) as there is still some lack of clarity there—(16) and (20). I am suggesting that we might defer consideration of those until we have a chance to get together and work out an acceptable compromise wording.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>5652</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Could Senator Mark Bishop provide some clarification on his amendment No. 15.

The new part is intended to address community concerns that telephone sex lines are too easily accessed by children. Part 9A prohibits the supply of telephone sex services where the telephone company bills the customer for the service, except where the telephone customer has given prior written agreement to telephone sex services being accessed using their 
 telephone service. A personal identification number is used to limit access and the service is supplied using the separate 1901 number range.</para><para>This new part also provides for the making of regulations in relation to the supply of telephone sex services. It is intended that the regulations will deal with telephone sex services supplied from overseas and the 0011 sex lines and will also be able to deal with the content and placement of sex line advertisements in the print and electronic media. These arrangements should prevent most children from accessing these services. The arrangements do not have the purpose of closing down the telephone sex industry or preventing adults from using these services. The sex services will still be able to be supplied where telephone customers have opted in or where the customer pays for the service by another means, for example using a credit card.</para><para>I indicate that there is an opposition amendment that would seek to allow electronic communication of advice rather than written. We take the view that it is very important that the carrier is in no doubt as to who has authorised the service. We think it is consistent with the written requirement that you be able to communicate that advice by fax, but we do not believe emails have sufficient built-in verification arrangements to ensure that degree of security. Therefore, we will be opposing that amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>5657</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to make a few comments about this issue. At the outset, the opposition supports the provision of opt-in services. When it comes to a vote, we will not be supporting the alternative model circulated by the Australian Democrats which simply is an opt-out model.</para></talk.start><para>The government, as Senator Allison outlined, does have its own particular model. We are not entirely comfortable with that model. We do think it is a little too narrow or restrictive in this modern age, and so we will be pressing ahead with our amendments. We believe that in this day and age communication is expanding at such huge rates and communication by electronic medium is 
 becoming much more commonplace and normal. Indeed, even in the commercial world—in the banking world and in the finance world—a lot of business communication is done by electronic medium and done via email. A large number of major corporations which have a range of wholesalers and manufacturers who supply to them now do all of their business by e-commerce or email. In the final analysis, access to phone services is a relationship of a commercial nature. Accordingly, whilst the written contract is fine and the minister has indicated he thinks that it extends to correspondence by fax, we believe it should be extended to communication by email.</para><para>I indicate for the record that the opposition is in favour of the opt-in model. A Senate select committee reported on this matter back in November 1992. The minister of the day—it was, I think, a Mr Collins—accepted the recommendations of the then Senate select committee circa late 1992. We were happy to support those recommendations in government. We have reconsidered the situation in recent weeks and months. Insufficient reason has been advanced to us in opposition to change the position that the opposition has held on this issue for many years. Accordingly, we support the opt-in model. We urge the government to reconsider what we would categorise as a somewhat narrow approach to the electronic medium. As I indicated at the outset to Senator Allison, we will not be supporting the alternative opt-out model provided by the Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>5657</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to indicate what it is that concerns us about being satisfied by electronic notification.

But we are not there at this stage. The fact remains that it is all too much a temptation for a carrier to consider that it is satisfied that it is actually the subscriber making the application because the mere name is attached to the end of the email, when in practice of course that is wide open to abuse because anyone understanding the rules of the game—and, presumably, if you ring up you are then told—could send in an email as quick as a flash. So it would take young kids about five minutes to dash off an email. It is an entirely different proposition to say that a signature effectively has to be forged. We think that is a very important distinction.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>5658</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister raises the problem of children improperly accessing services. Consequent on that, presumably, their parents being financially embarrassed is the issue, and the carrier possibly being financially embarrassed. Our response to that is that to any 12-, 14-, 16- or 18 year-old boy—and that is probably the market we are talking about here—who chooses to use email to access phone sex services in the name of his parents can equally, if he is so minded, write a letter with a forged signature. If the intent is there and the ability to communicate is there, it strikes us that the medium by which the intent is carried out becomes somewhat irrelevant.</para></talk.start><para>We have been speaking in code a bit, but I think we are talking about the ones I so characterised. So that is our response to your comment, Minister. If people want to engage in illegal or improper activity and they are able to do so, our experience is that if they are keen enough they will do so. To send an email off under the name of your father and for him certainly to get a bill for your activities three months later, means there is going to be, I suspect, temporary pleasure in what you are engaging in. The other matter we draw to your attention, of course, is the wording of (ea), which says:</para><para>(ea)	 the carriage service provider is satisfied as to the identity of the relevant customer . . .  
</para><para>That places both an obligation and an onus on the carriage service provider—to demonstrate that it is satisfied in a court of law when it tried to litigate damages for a false contract—to demonstrate, in my view, that it has established some policy guidelines within its own organisation whereby correspondence or emails once received can be checked as to the veracity of the signature on the bottom line. So that is our response there, Minister.</para><para>I did not address the 12-month issue in my preliminary remarks. The government's position is for the carriers to have six months grace, if you like, to implement these changes—to get the technology and to implement the systems to manage the change. We have been approached by a large number of carriers who have advised us that, one, they do not particularly want to go down this road but that, if it is mandated by the parliament, they will. But, more importantly, they advise us that they will simply be physically unable to comply with the law as mandated within the period of six months.</para><para>There are some systems problems, some technology problems and some access problems that each of the companies has identified to the opposition. They advise us that they will need up to 12 months to give effect to the bill once passed by the parliament. That being the case, if the opposition and the government are both supporting a form of the opt-in model seeking to essentially control this activity I would have thought that a period of grace of 12 months is not significantly a burden upon the government in lieu of a period of six months, particularly when a carrier has advised that they are simply unable to comply with the law. So we would also urge consideration of that amendment by the government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>5658</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If one applies a strict interpretation of the opposition's amendment 39—although I assume it is intended that the carrier should satisfy itself that the email or the written notification actually comes from the subscriber—the way it is worded the only obligation on the carrier is to satisfy itself that there is such a subscriber as the person 
 claimed to be. In other words, if they received something from M. Bishop, they do not have to satisfy themselves that M.

I might say that we are very disappointed at the haste with which this is being done; I think we received the government's amendments on Tuesday this week. Whilst there are a number of supportable amendments in the government's package, there are still glaring inadequacies concerning the regulation of telephone sex services and I have a number of questions that I will put to the minister before we get too much further.</para></talk.start><para>From the outset I want to say what the Democrats' policy position is on this. We do support the classification of material that the community quite rightly sees as being in a category that should be restricted. We do not support the untrammelled access of children to telephone sex services but we do support the freedom of access of adult-aged people to non-violent material at their own discretion. To us this is an issue of individual liberty at its most intimate, a position that the party has held for many years. The Australian Democrats simply do not support censorship of this sort.</para><para>I note for the record that Senator Harradine took up his seat here in 1976 and the following year the Democrats emerged as a third force in Australian politics. I mention this in passing because, for as long as both the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine have been in this chamber, there has been a robust exchange of views on the matter of censorship and not always from opposing points of view. Almost 15 years ago, my colleague former Democrat senator Jack 
 Evans said during the debate on the censorship of video material:</para><para>I wish to make it very clear at the outset that I am averse to censorship in any form. I believe that people should have material available to them. They should be free to read, see and hear that material.</para><para>I think those words are as true now as they were then. In 1992, during the debate on the Regulation of Video Material Bill 1992, my colleague and leader, Senator Lees, said:</para><para>The community will no longer tolerate sexual violence particularly on television but also on film and video. . . . there is sexually explicit but non-violent material. This sort of material is the subject of a great deal of hysteria and moral judgment dressed up as argument.</para><para>So, some 20 years since the arrival of the Democrats and some seven years since Senator Lees said that in this chamber, these amendments appear to be moral judgment dressed up as argument. In fact, I strongly suspect that what these amendments are designed to do is actually impose some people's ideas of morality on the populace at large. For quite a long time now people who wished to trammel the freedom of expression of citizens have used—and I emphasise that word `used'—the excuse of protecting children, frequently without much substantiation.</para><para>I moved a motion on Wednesday this week to send these amendments to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, which could have explored in further detail the implications and looked at the community safety aspects of telephone sex lines, as well as at the veracity of the claims which are being made. But that motion was defeated by the coalition and by Labor so I think we need to ask the question: seeing that the progress of this legislation would not have been delayed, what exactly was it that they did not want us to know? Could it be that there in fact is not any demonstrable harm? Is it likely that there are, in fact, alternatives which could have been explored, compared to this regime? Is it possible that in fact the legislation breaches section 51 of the Constitution? These are questions that need to be raised.</para><para>It has to be said that in many areas there is demonstrable harm to children that does warrant legislative intervention. The key 
 phrase here is `demonstrable harm', not harm that is perceived, not harm that is contrived, not harm that is imagined and not harm that is imputed but harm that is actual. Even the general law principle requires that harm be demonstrated before an entitlement to compensation is permitted. That is why in the past and to this day the Democrats support a classification system that excludes violence and precludes young people from access to material that is not appropriate for their age. Not so long ago my colleague Senator Stott Despoja said:</para><para>Before the minister makes another rhetorical reference to opponents of this regime as pornographers and friends of paedophiles, I want to make it clear that the Democrats are not in favour of inappropriate materials being available to minors. This legislation—</para><para>and she was referring to the online services bill—</para><para>is not the answer. It is a bad law and it will not be not be successful in controlling content.</para><para>I think there are parallels here as well.</para><para>The Democrat amendments support the freedom of expression of Australian citizens. They allow for the education of telephone account holders so that they can choose what they and their households may access. These amendments protect access choice rights to telecommunications consumers. But it is not a free for all we are proposing here. The minister would, if our amendments are successful, have the capacity to designate certain prefixes which would have a designated content profile. For example, material that could be rightly classified in an X category or an R category would have, for instance, a 1900 plus one or a 1900 plus two number attached. Consumers would be informed of their capacity on how to bar those numbers. That technology already exists. We can already STD or ISD bar our phones now. This would allow people to implement the same discretion and choice over what they access on their phones as presently exists for video or printed material and now, after yesterday's vote, the Internet.</para><para>I realise that senators will not have had the Democrat amendments for long. They are, however, a variant of the government's with 
 the exception that they preserve and do not destroy access choice rights. I think that, in the end, the true hallmark of a democracy and indeed freedom of speech that we rightly see as instrumental to democracy is not a defence of all things for all people; it is about defending the right of freedom of expression for citizens of this country even when that expression is distasteful to some.</para><para>Minister, there are a number of questions which I want to put. I would be obliged, since we did not have any sort of committee process, any inquiry process, if you could answer those. First, what we found difficult in this whole approach was not knowing who is saying what about this amendment. Minister, did you have any representations from telecommunications carriers? Were there any concerns expressed to the government, particularly perhaps the monitoring of the content and associated advertising lines? Perhaps you can outline for the chamber correspondence which you have had on this subject or conversations or representations made to you from telecommunications carriers in particular.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>5661</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was minding my own business when Senator Allison brought my name into it for some reason or other that escapes me. All I can say is that this is a matter that was considered by a committee of this parliament and the committee made certain recommendations in respect of these lines—0055 and 0051. One of those recommendations, for example, was barring. Though the Labor minister at the time accepted the recommendations, Telstra did not. That is a very black mark against Telstra. It is all very well for them to make money hand over fist, particularly when they just transcribed the 0055 to 1900. But under 0055 and 0051 you can have a barring system and under 1900 you cannot or they do not.</para></talk.start><para>Apart from all of that, you have had case after case. Never mind about Senator Allison saying, `Ask the telcos about it.' They would say, `Yes, we're making money.' Ask the people about it. Look at the letters that have come in. I have had letter after letter in regard to the running up of phone bills by young people accessing these phone lines and talking to pimps and prostitutes. They are prostitutes 
 talking to our kids. That is what we need to overcome. One particular letter I received was about a phone bill of over $700 that was rung up in three days by a 16-year-old boy. Another one was about somebody who lost their mobile phone and the person who found it ran up $2,500 over a weekend.</para><para>I think there is very little difference between the government's response and the opposition's except for the fact that the point Minister Alston made is a valid point: you really do need to have a deliberate opt-in situation in such a way that there is no possibility of there being any chance at all that that could not be absolutely verified before the access was provided. I am not going to respond to the statements made by Senator Allison because, frankly, they were non sequiturs. I am happy at some other time, when we have a bit of time, to deal with the matter. I indicate that I support the government's proposition as being one which reflects the views of those who have made a study of the situation and will effectively protect children or those who have been exposed and exploited by pimps and prostitutes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>5661</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have to confess that I have not had a single letter to my office on phone sex. I wonder whether those people concerned with that issue might be more likely to write to Senator Harradine than they might be to write to me. I am not sure. I am not trying to trivialise this, but I wonder how broad is the problem and whether we are taking a very blunt object to a problem when we can sort it out in a different way.</para></talk.start><para>The government's amendment to insert paragraphs 158A(a) and (b) requires agreement in writing and a PIN or equivalent from the customer. It is the sex service provider and the carrier who are both deemed to have engaged in unacceptable conduct if written agreement and so on is not obtained. This seems, prima facie, to be unfair. After all, the call is initiated by the customer, who supposedly knows what they are going to get. The call numbers are generally advertised in restricted magazines and with an appropriate 
 classification system, and the advertising of the numbers could also be restricted.</para><para>A further problem with clause 158G is that the onus of proof under the law is on the carrier and provider to prove that the written agreement, et cetera, was obtained. The onus should be on a prosecutor to prove an offence, not on a defendant to prove innocence. It seems that we have reversed the normal onus of proof within the law under this section.</para><para>Clause 158C seems to be a little silly, and perhaps the minister might provide us with some other examples to deal with what may be a nonexistent problem. It says you cannot tie supply of goods and services to supply of telephone sex services. I am not sure when I have seen—I do not read those magazines—or heard of 10 per cent off a new Nokia if you sign up to a telephone sex shop advert. If the minister can give me some real examples, I would be happy to hear them.</para><para>Subclause 158J(2) excludes therapeutic services from the definition of sex services but only if done by a doctor or psychologist. What about the vast majority of phone counselling services which are provided by trained volunteers, qualified sex therapists, gay counsellors and so on? Is it such a problem to begin with? The government's rationale for this is that children can access unsuitable material. How much of a problem is that? It may be an issue for a parent who gets hit with a big bill, and Senator Harradine talked about that. Is the issue the bill—and that obviously is an issue for parents; there are lots of things that children do that can create bills for parents, it is one of those things—or is it that the parent can take appropriate action to stop it happening again?</para><para>I am not sure if it is such a serious problem as far as corrupting the morals of minors is concerned.

At the moment it is a $150 million a year industry with 1.4 million calls a month. Most callers are spontaneous, and some may be compulsive. Any requirement for them to sign up in writing in advance could mean they would not do it, and maybe that is what the government wants. While the government explicitly says in the explanatory memorandum that these arrangements are not supposed to be for the purpose of closing down the telephone sex industry, this of course is what the industry believes will be the effect. The industry may go underground or offshore as a result of these changes—the present aboveboard nature of the industry means its phone services have clear paper trails and it pays its full share of tax.</para><para>We believe there is a better way. A better approach would be to classify services and provide a simple way for people to block the use of their phone for accessing certain classifications. A note on the next phone bill saying, `If you don't want to have these services available, pick up your phone and enter these numbers,' would suffice. This can be done, probably without legislation. Such an opt-out system would provide parents with the ability to protect their children from being exposed to rude things over the phone, and probably the phone bills that go with them.</para><para>An opt-in scheme would require a premeditated intent on the part of each individual and for each service they sought to access. For example, someone who wanted to try out the range of services available would have to write to each and every service provider and then wait a week or two before they received their service. Quite frankly, I am not sure that actually indicates an understanding of why people access the services.</para><para>Senator Allison's motion which attempted to refer these amendments to a committee noted that the amendments might be an acquisition of property under section 51 of the Constitution. I cannot make a position of judgment considering the government's amendments have been available only in the last few days, but certainly that would have been worth considering. In the meantime, the Democrats have proposed an opt-out provision, something that would be simple to access. Certainly, for those people who were worried about their young people hearing rude things over the phone, that would be the provision. Is it that we are worried about the phone bills? There is a way of dealing with that. Is it that we are worried that young people might hear rude things? That is an issue of censorship.</para><para>Here we have a situation where it seems like a whole range of people may not have been consulted. Perhaps to assist us, the minister might tell me whether the government has considered what the impact on the community may be if it is difficult to access the services that are currently used but are not necessarily provided by doctors or psychologists. As subclause 158J(2) excludes therapeutic services from the definition of sex services but only if done by a doctor or psychologist, has the government considered or consulted the vast range of phone counselling services that are provided by trained volunteers, qualified sex therapists, gay or transgender counsellors and so on?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>5663</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The intention of the legislation is not to interfere with the capacity of counsellors and others to provide useful public services. It is to deal with what is, by most standards, thoroughly unacceptable material with very little redeeming social merit. I am amazed at Senator Margetts's coyness on this subject. I do not know whether it derives from utter ignorance of what is actually on these lines or whether it is simply a determination to use euphemisms to somehow make it out to be pretty harmless stuff. If you want to go on and talk about rude things and naughty words, you are really 
 sending yourself up because you are not addressing the subject matter of these services.</para></talk.start><para>We are not concerned about kids saying a few naughty words or things that might pass as fairly robust. We are talking about material that has much worse than a salacious intent, and I must say that any redeeming social grace escapes me. There might be those who can demonstrate it, and I would like to hear it. Usually the argument is couched in terms of, `I don't actually want to deal with the subject matter. I just believe everyone has the right to see whatever they like.' That does not address the underlying concern about the subject or the material. Senator Allison says, `That would be judgmental,' but we make judgments all the time. We outlaw murder because we do not like it. We do not say, `I'm morally neutral on that but it's a matter for you. Personally, I wouldn't do it but, if you want to, go for it.' We say no. We have a moral view on these issues and we take action accordingly.</para><para>Another matter of very significant concern which Senator Harradine addressed is that, under the current regime of opt out, you are able to have people running up extraordinary phone bills in other people's names. That is not a satisfactory situation. Obviously, the commercial incentives for carriers to persist in that conduct are quite considerable, but it is not at all in the public interest that people find themselves suddenly strictly liable because their phone happened to be used for services of which they had no knowledge or approval. What does Senator Margetts say? `Better luck next time but now you know. It cost you $2,500 over the weekend. Cough up but, from now on, get on to Telstra and tell them.' Then you suddenly discover that it is Optus, and you have to go through another rigmarole.</para><para>The fact is that there ought to be informed consent at both ends and that informed consent should extend to not being effectively forced to consent by bundling arrangements. So if a carrier offers you access to sporting lines, it cannot say, `We need your authorisation in writing and this will apply to a whole range of other services, including sex ser 
 vices.' That is not a proper approach to take. There ought to be a specific addressing of the particular issue, and you cannot tie or bundle services in that way, just as you cannot in a whole range of other areas in the Trade Practices Act. Bundling may be justified in certain circumstances, I suppose, in terms of internal cross subsidies but, when it becomes an occasion of simply requiring people to consent to something they would not directly consent to, I think the anti-social nature of that is obvious.</para><para>Senator Allison asked me whether we had had any representations from the carriers. Senator Harradine actually spelt out the history of this quite succinctly. The fact is that, following that 1992 inquiry, the carriers did agree to a regime that was under control. A few years ago, it was basically thrown out the window. No-one particularly noticed that the carriers were no longer adhering to their obligations, and this is in large part simply a reversion to the arrangements they had freely agreed to some years ago. So, yes, we have had discussions with carriers. I think those discussions were more in terms of refinements, because they acknowledge that there was a strong community view and nothing has changed that would have justified them unilaterally changing those arrangements. They have been more concerned about some practical elements rather than the philosophy behind the approach, which I do not think any of them argue against in public.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>5664</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Perhaps the minister could clarify this, because he did not quite clarify it in his response.

People offering these services presumably will want to advertise them so that people will utilise them, and the form of words will be a pretty big give away as to the true nature of the service. If you are interested in a sex line service and there are ads to that effect, you are hardly likely to ring up a counselling service, and vice versa: if you are genuinely interested in counselling, why would you ring a sex line service? So I think there will be a high degree of self-selection.</para></talk.start><para>Where it comes to an obligation on carriers, it is only right and reasonable that carriers should have to make the initial judgment. It is not terribly difficult at the present time. No carrier has said to us, `We have enormous difficulty in determining genuine from purported sex counselling services.' The argument is simply whether or not it is onerous to require them to have certain obligations and what the impact of that regime might be. But 
 I do not think anyone has seriously argued that you cannot tell the difference. Senator Margetts might not. Maybe they use naughty words and talk about rude things on counselling lines and, therefore, as far as she is concerned, there is no difference between counselling and sexual gratification. But I would have thought most carriers would be able to understand the difference quite readily.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>5666</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That just does not make any sense, Minister. Are we saying here then that the telecommunications carriers do not have to monitor, are not allowed to monitor, or there is no requirement to monitor, but that they just check out the ads? If that is the case, to avoid this kind of action, why wouldn't a sex line put their first ad into the paper saying something innocuous like, `We do counselling'? Subsequent ads might turn out to be a different matter altogether; they may be sex lines.</para></talk.start><para>For instance, is Telstra required to comb through all of the advertising that goes on in every paper or magazine ad infinitum? There is quite a lot at stake here. As Senator Margetts has said, this is an industry which is currently worth $150 million. There is a lot at stake. Why wouldn't an organisation initially pretend to be about counselling and then go on with its real business at some later stage?</para><para> Senator ALSTON (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts) (10.07 p.m.)—I do not know what later stage that is. If they are in the business of making a quid, then presumably they are in the business of making sure that people have no misapprehension about the nature of the business. If you are seriously trying to make money out of sex lines, why on earth would you get out there and offer a counselling service?</para><para>The practical result will be that there is an obligation on those providing these services. They will know overwhelmingly what type of service they are providing and what type of business they are in. If they are telephone sex lines, as we understand the definition in the act, then they will have certain obligations attached to them. If somehow they pass 
 themselves off in the way you suggest and the carrier has no reason to believe that they are not other than a genuine counselling service, and then it transpires or it is brought to the notice of the carrier that they are offering sex services without the requisite PIN, then the carrier would be expected to take action accordingly. So it is not a matter of monitoring every call; it is a matter of simply satisfying yourself that this is what it purports to be.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>5666</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—How does the telecommunications carrier satisfy themselves?

You seem to think that a carrier is incapable of dialling up a service or reading an advertisement in the newspaper and that, by definition, if a carrier listens to what is played on a publicly available line—one that is promoted—somehow it is eavesdropping but it is merely accessing the service if a citizen does it. It is just a nonsense proposition.</para></talk.start><para>Interception of private lines between two persons is a different proposition.

You will not get much business passing yourself off as a counselling service if you are really in the sex lines business. There is no question here of interception or tapping or some sort of Big Brother intervention; it is simply a matter of an operator or a service provider having a number and making a service available, and the carrier, like any other member of the public, being able to access it and assess the quality of the material and the way in which it is promoted. You can do that as well as the carrier. Are you tapping it because you ring up that number? Of course you are not. Why should the carrier be regarded as intercepting by simply ringing up that number?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>5668</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to follow on from Senator Allison's line of questioning. I first of all point out to the minister that it is not an unreal scenario we are talking about. Depending on the state you live in, we have all experienced situations where sex services are advertised as massage services. I do not know whether people get a massage necessarily if they go to those services, but the reality is that escort services or massage services are often euphemisms for prostitutes or brothels. Basically it has been the case for a long time in Australia that the industry itself found ways of getting around restrictions in advertising and other legal problems. The situation may well be that people will understand very quickly what those euphemisms mean, so I think the minister is being very naive to suggest that the euphemisms will not develop very quickly.</para></talk.start><para>Perhaps the minister can tell us whether there will be a line on the budget. I know we have had various lines of inquiry in Senate estimates as to whether the use of government credit cards is acceptable for phoning phone sex lines. I wonder whether telcos will have acceptable budget lines, and whether we will find when we get to Senate estimates that 
 Telstra, for instance, will have a budget line—if we ever see this—that says that there is a budget set aside for operators from Telstra to phone in and sample each of the potential or suspected phone sex services. How long will they have to be on the line, if it is a reactive line, to find out what kind of service it really is—whether it is one that is not acceptable or is acceptable?  Considering the number of potential services that operate in Australia, what kind of budget would you be looking at to regularly phone through, put a PIN through and pay for a telephone service to find out whether it is in fact a phone sex line that ought to be restricted?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>5668</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As a starting point, Telstra does not get any appropriation from the budget. Maybe you want to argue that it should, but it does not, so we will not have that problem. Carriers who are offering these services are doing so for commercial gain; they therefore have inbuilt capacity to afford to test the services that are available. It is just another cost of doing business; there is nothing particularly unusual about that. If you want to argue that they should have pure profit from every cent they earn, the fact is that they have overheads and other costs of doing business and this just happens to be one of them.</para></talk.start><para>I cannot for a moment see that that is a particularly onerous obligation to place on them. I would have thought that overwhelmingly those offering sex line services would want to describe them as that, and that there would be very little passing off in the way that you described. Taking your analogy of massage parlours—we reverted to calling them brothels in Victoria some years ago—if there is a law against brothels but not against a genuine massage parlour and you expect the law to be enforced, you simply go around and inspect the services available. It is not a very difficult matter.</para><para>If you are telling me that you cannot tell the difference between massage and prostitution, then I suppose you have a problem, but in most instances the police who visit these places do not have any doubt at all about 
 what is going on. So you do not have to take the advertisement at face value; you go and test the content—you inspect the goods. And that is what will happen here. It will happen at minimum cost to the carriers. They will still have the opportunity to derive very significant profits, but at least everyone will know what they are getting. I think we will have no difficulty at all in distinguishing between genuine counselling services and other fly-by-night operators.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>5669</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I ask the minister what sort of advice he has had from the Office of Film and Literature Classification over this legislation.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>5669</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not think we have had any advice.

There was little time for the debate yesterday or today, mainly because all the hard work had been done outside the chamber, consulting with the people who had a constituent interest in the legislation. One amendment concerning the appointment of a trustee for non-identified shareholders was proposed by the government and accepted by the opposition and the Democrats.	 It was vital that the legislation was passed today, because the existing arrangements for Wool International expire on 1 July.</para></talk.start><para>This is legislation for the future. The past history of what led us into the present disaster for wool is of little importance now. The time for bone pointing has passed, and the lesson is not to repeat the mistakes but to get on and effectively manage a valuable asset which comprises the remainder of the stockpile. The aim of WoolStock is to maximise the value of stockpile wool and to do so in a way that is in the best interests of growers and gives them effective control of their future.</para><para>In October 1998 we announced our intention to privatise Wool International and to return ownership and control of the wool stockpile to the unit holders. The main outcome of the privatisation process is the conversion of Wool International from a statutory corporation into a company incorporated under the Corporations Law and the imposition of all of the Corporations Law on that new commercialised company. The new company will be known, as all growers know, as WoolStock Australia Ltd, and is expected to be established on 1 July 1999, replacing the statutory corporation, Wool International.</para><para>WoolStock's principal activities will be limited by its constitution to selling the stockpile—currently equivalent to 1.055 million bales of greasy wool—repaying the debt at around $230 million and returning any surplus to shareholders. WoolStock is not authorised to initiate alternative new business ventures. WoolStock's activities have been narrowly defined in order to ensure that it does not enter into new or riskier ventures that may erode its value for shareholders.</para><para>As part of the privatisation process, growers will receive one share in WoolStock for every unit they currently own in Wool International. The shares and units will be stapled together such that both shares and units must be sold together. The shares will be allotted to growers on 1 July and will place ownership and control of WoolStock and the wool stockpile in their hands. Some unit holders have used some or all of their units as security for loans. Any charges given over those units prior to 1 July will automatically attach to the same number of stapled shares. After 1 July growers will still be able to use their shares and units as security when borrowing money.</para><para>In addition to existing rights of shareholders, shareholders in WoolStock will receive new rights similar to those of shareholders in a public company. These include the right to be paid any dividends which may be declared by the company from time to time and the right to attend general meetings of the company to propose resolutions and to vote at those meetings, including in the election of directors or on changes to the company's constitution. </para><para>WoolStock has been structured to minimise the taxation obligations, and growers as shareholders will be very pleased with the result of the negotiations that have taken place, because the issue of shares in WoolStock will not impose a capital gains tax liability on the unit holders. WoolStock will be exempted from corporate taxation in relation to the disposal of the wool stockpile and income derived from investing the proceeds of the stockpile sales. Unit holders who are original wool taxpayers will continue to receive the unit distributions as primary producer income—a very big advantage to those primary producers.</para><para>The ability of some unit holders to claim small business rollover relief when selling their units will not be affected by the privatisation, provided that the unit holder's circumstances have not otherwise changed—another big advantage for primary producers. The small business capital gains tax rollover relief will not apply to WoolStock shares and the disposal of shares in WoolStock will be subject to the capital gains tax regime, which again can be of assistance to primary producers. Importantly, the privatisation process has been structured to protect the interests—as far as has been humanly possible—of the growers who are the unit holders.</para><para>WoolStock's activities will be limited to selling the stockpile and returning any surplus to stakeholders. WoolStock is not authorised to initiate alternative new business ventures. However, if shareholders want WoolStock to expand its objects they can vote to change the constitution under both the constitution of WoolStock and the Corporations Law itself. WoolStock's constitution allocates $3 million to investigate the possibility of establishing a wool marketing or processing company. Should any new venture prove viable, it will be financed separately. WoolStock will not commit or contribute financial resources to any new venture. However, WoolStock shareholders would be given the opportunity to subscribe to shares in any new venture, subject to the issue of a prospectus, as is normally the case in new venture capital.</para><para>For WoolStock the most important advantage to flow from privatisation is the commer 
 cial flexibility to respond quickly to changes in market conditions. At this stage, WoolStock plans to commence sales from the stockpile immediately following the privatisation on 1 July, but I would suggest that those sales will be extremely modest and that the Commonwealth guarantee of the existing debt will continue for some time.</para><para>The board of WoolStock will seek to capitalise on the opportunities associated with the added flexibility which flows from privatisation. For instance, in the event of a wool price spike the board will not be constrained by a legislated selling program. Instead it will be able to evaluate this opportunity and respond in a way which maximises shareholder value.</para><para>WoolStock can only alter its objects and the restrictions on it by passing a special resolution at a meeting of shareholders. That requires a 75 per cent approval of a resolution and that is only after a postal ballot in which shareholders holding at least 50 per cent of all votes agree to a proposal. The restrictions on WoolStock changing its principal activities are very considerable indeed. It is very unlikely that it will happen. It provides the flexibility to look at alternative ventures that WoolStock might be involved in, but there is no way that WoolStock is going to be a company that is going to go off and risk its shareholders' money without showing cause and an appropriate appreciation of the risks involved.</para><para>The end of this very long process in the way that Wool International has operated since 1993 is that WoolStock has been broadly accepted by all the principal stakeholders. As I said, the legislation was debated today and yesterday and it was non-controversial in the main. The Labor Party have some problems with it—some is misguided and inappropriate—but at the end of this debate we will have the appointment of a responsible board, half of which has already been appointed; we have a board with powers to act only within the constitution of WoolStock and the Corporations Law in the best interests of shareholders; we have shareholders' rights that are clearly set out and enhanced by both the constitution and the Corporations Law; there 
 is no requirement to fire sale the stockpile; and we have taxation arrangements that are as advantageous as is possible for growers. We can move on from here.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bruce Stadium, Australian Capital Territory</title><page.no>5673</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>5673</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to talk about a matter that involves both my electorate of the Australian Capital Territory and my federal shadow portfolio responsibility for sport. In December last year the ACT Liberal government decided on a full redevelopment of Canberra's Bruce Stadium so that Canberra could host Olympic soccer fixtures. At the time, Chief Minister Kate Carnell had projected that Bruce would hold 40,000 people and the agreement with SOCOG was based on this estimate. ACT Labor leader, Mr Andrew Whitecross, pointed out the fallacy of this estimation based on figures available after the Atlanta Games detailing soccer attendances for fixtures held outside Atlanta. Nevertheless, the redevelopment of Bruce proceeded on the basis of Mrs Carnell's optimistic estimates of the number of people who would attend Olympic soccer here in Canberra.</para></talk.start><para>Now we find that the financial situation regarding the redevelopment of Canberra's Bruce Stadium has been something of a movable feast. For starters, the redeveloped Bruce Stadium will only hold 25,000 people—15,000 fewer than the Carnell government originally estimated when they were determining the financial returns.</para><para>As my colleagues in the ACT Legislative Assembly found out during their estimates hearings, nobody seems to be able to work out just how much money is being spent and whether the ACT Liberal government has been transparent and up-front in this matter. When the ACT government decided to upgrade Bruce Stadium, the cabinet submission estimated that it would cost $27.3 million, of which $12.3 million would be funded from the government's capital works program. The remaining $15 million would be forthcoming from the private sector. Thus, the total cost ACT taxpayers would have to wear would be no more than $12.3 million. However, it seems that this amount was part of the 
 Liberal's movable feast of financial disclosure. The $27 million soon blew out to $30 million. The question is: how much of this money will ACT taxpayers wear?</para><para>The central issue is whether Kate Carnell has breached the Financial Management Act by spending $16 million that had not been approved through the budget process. The Auditor-General apparently wrote to the Chief Minister stating, `strong anticipation by the government that the additional private sector funding would become available during the year, however this did not eventuate.' In short, because the ACT government received approval to spend only $12.5 million and the private sector part of the plan did not eventuate, the government went ahead with spending extra money without proper approval.</para><para>In her defence Mrs Carnell has argued that it does not matter how much public money you spend within a financial year, just so long as the books balance on 30 June. This is a very cynical excuse. To make the books balance she borrowed the balance of the money on 30 June and paid it back on 1 July. Consequently, Mrs Carnell appears to have spent money on Bruce Stadium that was not properly appropriated, and justified this by alleging that private sector funding will be forthcoming and therefore this money will be paid back. The ACT Liberal government does not seem to understand that you cannot just borrow money to facilitate your agenda without the proper approval of and due process in the Legislative Assembly.</para><para>During the ACT estimates hearings it was also revealed that the costs associated with the Bruce Stadium redevelopment seemed to be fluctuating on a daily basis. I understand that the Under Treasurer, Mr Lilley, originally stated that the cost of each seat at Bruce would be $1,600. Given that there are 25,000 seats at Bruce this would make the cost of the redevelopment around $40 million—a far cry from the $27 million we were told it would cost. However, literally overnight Mr Lilley revised his seat costing to $1,310 each, which—surprise, surprise—equates to $32 million, just $5 million over budget. It is therefore extremely difficult to ascertain the exact projections of revenue for Bruce and 
 even the exact costs associated with the redevelopment. The ACT government agreed to the terms and conditions of hosting Olympic soccer in a cavalier manner without revealing the true social and economic costs to ACT taxpayers.</para><para>Furthermore, the conditions for hosting Olympic events in the ACT may impact on our local rugby league and rugby union competitions. At least four enclosed grounds are required to facilitate Olympic training preparations, and the grounds currently under consideration will need improvements before they meet the agreed standards. This may well result in a loss of facilities for the various football codes which will be close to semifinals in August next year. The ACT government has not satisfactorily dealt with this issue and there remains a great deal of anxiety about the potential loss of playing fields and the disruptions this will cause.</para><para>I welcome Canberra's role in the Sydney Olympics, and I fully support, and always have, the staging of soccer fixtures at Bruce Stadium. However, I am very concerned about the manner in which the ACT government has proceeded and their lack of transparency in revealing the true economic and social costs to the community. Mrs Carnell cannot continue to hide behind commercial-in-confidence rhetoric. She needs to detail the full costs associated with Bruce Stadium to the taxpayers of the ACT. This story is not yet over and I watch with interest as the Chief Minister is finally called to account.</para><para>One final comment: it is such a shame when this initiative is so positive and has so much to offer to a city like Canberra, to this place. It gave us a much coveted role to play in the Olympics. At the time Canberra secured these soccer rounds, it was seen as a great bonus. This great bonus has now been tainted by the actions of the ACT Liberal government in their treatment of this issue. I think it will reflect badly on them in the lead-up to the Olympics, and it will take a little of the gloss off what was a very positive and exciting initiative for Canberra.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Greenwich University </title><page.no>5674</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>5674</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to talk briefly about the issue of Greenwich University.

 ment itself has now launched into this degree mill. Might I say that some weeks ago, as Senator Tierney pointed out, I did draw the Senate's attention to the strange science of ornithology that does seem to exist in regard to Greenwich University. I, of course, was able to point out specifically the case of a number of galahs that seem to be so firmly entrenched in this particular episode. I was, of course, referring specifically to the galahs that have been creating havoc in Australia's most valuable higher education sector. The people I referred to in this context in particular were the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Macdonald.</para></talk.start><para>The issue involved the establishment of this virtual university known as `Greenwich' by an act of parliament of Norfolk Island. Of course, we all understand that galahs are the vandals of the bird world. As anyone who has kept one as a pet will know, their beaks are rapacious, they are instruments of destruction. So if two galahs make trouble, I ask you to think about just what sort of a problem a whole flock of them is making for Australia's higher education sector system.</para><para>Of course, this is the situation we now face. I say that the question of the operations of a number of universities are worthy of serious consideration by the Senate. I have drawn attention to the activities of the University of Asia, St Clements University and the Australasian Institute. I say that cyberspace is fast filling up with entities which are trying to pass themselves off as Australian universities. They are trying to hitch a free ride on our international reputation for excellence in education which has made our export industry in education worth some $3 billion a year.</para><para>This is an industry that is now to be compared with the size of tourism, wheat and mining as one of our great export earners. Now, of course, we have seen that these somewhat highbrow hitchhikers, these wanna-be Australian universities and institutes, have managed to get their own hold on what they regard as their version of `The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Cyberspace Galaxy'. What does it say? It makes it very simple: that Australia 
 leaves itself wide open, in a virtual sense, to crooks and shysters who want to come in here and freeload on our high quality education system. `Go to Australia,' the guidebook advises. `Get yourself an Australian post office box or a room at the back of a grog shop and set yourself up as a university and hoodwink unsuspecting students from all over the world.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">TIERNEY</name><name role="display">Senator Tierney</name></talker><para>—Madam President, I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance.

You can hitch a ride with a touring Australian education exhibition and trick the students in Islamabad or Timbuktu.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have seen today in the papers about one of these shysters, the Business Institute of Victoria—so-called. This thing is not registered as an education provider for overseas students under CRICOS, the official listing maintained by DETYA. Nonetheless, it took part in an Australian education exhibition in Pakistan and snared a number of students, who subsequently paid their $15,000 each and went off to study at this outfit's premises in Vanuatu—a back room in an obscure office block in downtown Port Vila. Yes, I said Port Vila—on another Pacific Island; not Norfolk Island this time. The advantage of Vanuatu is that the strict Australian student visa provisions do not apply in Vanuatu and, of course, an unaccredited outfit like this one can operate with impunity.</para><para>Of course, the other set of restrictions, the provisions applying to international education providers here in Australia—under the ESOS Act—are also lacking in Vanuatu. These are 
 the financial safeguards that require the student  fees to be placed in a trust. The prospect of that is that it is aimed to protect students when a provider goes under. So these poor Pakistanis, Vietnamese and the other students that participate in this so-called Australian university college at Vanuatu, the Business Institute of Victoria, have all lost their money. As for their tuition, we do not expect anything other than for them to be left stranded on the beach by the actions of people like this. What does this do to our fine international reputation? No good whatsoever.</para><para>We have seen here that Australian companies have set themselves up to take advantage of the relaxed immigration laws of a Pacific island state to exploit, in turn, Australia's international reputation in educational export. This is what happens in the case of operating out of Vanuatu, beyond our ironclad laws and safeguards designed to protect student interests. In the case of Greenwich University, that so-called laughable entity was legally established in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island with the clear and obvious purpose of passing itself off as a real Australian university. It has blatantly used the naivety on matters of higher education of the nine-member Norfolk Island Assembly.</para><para>What did Norfolk Island get out of it? Let me quote from a recent press statement that was made. They said they got `increased publicity'—terrific. They got tourism: `half a dozen local jobs and postage'—what an achievement! This is how their legislators have put it. They have increased publicity all right, and they have become the laughing-stock of cyberspace. And don't doubt this: there are more Norfolk Islands and there are more Greenwiches around—many more. What I am particularly concerned about in the case of Greenwich is the naivety of the nine yeomen of Norfolk, who have allowed themselves to be placed in a situation as a result of the lackadaisical irresponsibility of the galahs that have become responsible for the administration and protection of Australia's international educational reputation. Of course, they are the Australian ministers for education and for territories, not to mention their various legions of bureaucrats who are 
 supposed to undertake the role on a day-to-day basis.</para><para>It transpires that the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, has admitted that the department of territories did in fact consult DEETYA before advising their own ministers that there was no impediment to him signing off on the Greenwich University bill of Norfolk Island. This minister thought, as he said at estimates just last month, this was `not a major issue'. He says it was a matter of concern only to the people of Norfolk Island. But it seems that the contact between the two departments and in turn the principals of Greenwich University occurred at a junior level, according to DEETYA's own answers to questions asked of them through estimates.</para><para>Of course, I would ask: when did the secretary to the department express concern about these matters? Was it only after the Senate estimates hearing? Was it only after questions were raised by the opposition? I would ask: why was such a cavalier attitude taken to the unusual request from an obscure American institution about seeking to set up a university on Norfolk Island of all places? It was apparent that the alarm bells did not ring until the opposition raised these concerns through the estimates.</para><para>Madam President, I am sure you would be aware that the Sir Humphrey Appleby or the <inline font-style="italic">Yes, Minister</inline> tapes are being used as training vehicles for various public servants right throughout this great Commonwealth. What I find quite amazing is that we have now seen the whole full circle where public servants are coming along to the estimates committee to actually find out what is going on—because that is exactly what has occurred in this case. We have seen that the savage budget cuts meted out to DEETYA have rendered the department a shadow of its former self. This is why the department was only able to learn about these events through the opposition.</para><para>It is a very simple matter. How did the department find out about Greenwich's attempts to get into Australia through New Zealand? Through the estimates. What about the shoddy record of Greenwich University in the United States, how it has been chased 
 from state to state throughout the United States and had its registration—for its various attempts to set up shonky programs—removed by the governments in the United States? How did that come out? Through the estimates.</para><para>What about the iffy qualifications of some of its staff, in particular the so-called Duke of Branagh or whatever he styles himself on as the great inheritor of the Russian imperial throne? What about the process that occurs where departmental officers appear to come to estimates to establish these simple questions. What about the worldwide resources of DEETYA? Why is it that the resources of one Labor senator seem to be able to establish these facts when the department cannot? I put a very simple proposition that this departmental blunder is probably one of the most monumental we have seen in many years. It is certainly bigger than the Wright family. It is certainly bigger than what we have seen with the ship of fools. We are entitled to ask ourselves about the ineptitude and the neglect of government ministers.</para><para>I say this to Senator Tierney: let people write to the Prime Minister and seek an apology because there will only be one apology—that will be the apology from the Australian Prime Minister about the incompetence, the neglect and the abysmal failure of government ministers in this government which has laid open the defences of Australia's higher education institutions to a group of people about whom the Californian government indicated that `Diploma mills that manufacture degrees based on the ability to write a cheque rather than the ability to master curriculum will no longer make the grade'.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Carr, Senator Kim</title><page.no>5679</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>5679</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the very brief moments available, I will seek to read into the record another one of the letters that Senator Carr refused to give permission to have incorporated in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  because they expose him for the sort of merchant that he is in trying to peddle defamatory material in parliament.

It should be noted that moving to accrual accounting has been taken to mean operating and reporting on an accrual basis, including establishing accrual budgets and policies.</para><para>Minor modifications to the existing Financial Management Information System (FMIS) were undertaken. This was partly because the current FMIS is an accrual system that was previously modified to operate in a cash environment, and a new FMIS (QSP) has been selected and is due to be operational 1 July 1998, on a full accrual basis.</para><para>In addition, one of the largest parts of the Department, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service has been operating on an accrual basis since becoming a Trust Account in 1993. As has a smaller Trust Account operation the National Residue Survey.</para><para>(2) For the reasons outlined above the Department forecast a very minor amount in this area, in 1997-98.</para><para>(3) (a) For 1997-98 no firms or individuals were engaged.</para><para>The main reasons for external assistance have been due to:</para><para>*	 system modifications, as explained above; and that</para><para>*	 additional resources were required to establish an accrual budget and associated work in 98-99. This was because there are only a limited number of staff with appropriate skills and experience and a number were already undertaking other related activities eg. the FMIS implementation, external financial reporting etc.  
</para><para>(b) In the second situation when additional resources were required, a contractor from Acumen Alliance was used on a part-time basis to work on the accrual estimates project. In addition, an individual contractor working for WallRyan Investments has been engaged on a full-time medium term basis.</para><para>(4) (a) The total number of days that the contractor from Acumen Alliance was engaged to provide advice or services was 23, the individual contractor has been working with the Department from the beginning of November 1998 until present.</para><para>(b) The cost per day of the Acumen Alliance was $1,200, the individual contractor is $640.</para><para>(c) The total cost of Acumen Alliance' services was $27,600, the total cost for the individual contractor in relation to accrual accounting issues is expected to be approximately $51,200.</para><para>(5) (a) As mentioned above approximately $78,800 is expected to be expended on contractors for the accrual budget exercise.</para><para></para><para>(b) $63,400 has been spent to date in 98-99.</para><para>(6) The estimated total expenditure on preparing for accrual accounting for the 98-99 financial year is again difficult to determine, apart from the above costs the only expenditure was associated with internal staff costs. There will also be an exercise to update the Department's accrual reporting/accounting policies during this financial year, which will cost approximately $25,000. Negotiations with firms are currently under way.</para><para>To illustrate the scale of expenditure for in-house staff costs, for the 98-99 year approximately $90,000 has been expended in direct salary cost in creating the first accrual budget and work associated with establishing Opening Accrual Balances in the FMIS. There are few full-time resources able to be devoted to such reforms. However, to ensure that these reforms are covered off, other mechanisms of obtaining resources have been utilised ie. part-time team members or temporary teams, from within other areas of the Department who quickly return to their original area when the project is finished.</para><para></para><para>Question on Noice—Accrual Accounting</para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid"
