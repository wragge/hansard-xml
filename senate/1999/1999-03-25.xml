After losing the 1993 election, the Coalition chose to blame the ABC, and they have made more and more allegations of bias against it ever since.</para><para>This fervent attack has even been made against individual ABC employees.</para><para>Until the lead-up to the election in 1996, it was the ABC who moderated the pre-election debates between leaders of the Labor Party and the Coalition. In the debates for the 1996 election, the Coalition refused to accept the ABC's moderator, saying they preferred one from a commercial network. The Coalition then felt free to pronounce that they won the 1996 election despite the ABC.</para><para>For most of us, of course, these perceptions of bias are absolutely ridiculous, but for the Government, they are very real.</para><para>The last year has been particularly dreadful. Since April 1998 the ABC has been subjected to relentless allegations of bias.</para><para>The Minister for Communications alleged that the ABC has not adequately addressed left wing bias. He has tried to force the ABC to change the way in which it handles complaints, without any due regard for its editorial policies. More seriously, the Minister's actions threaten the independence of the ABC as an independent statutory authority.</para><para>The ABC has lost a total of $66 million in funding since the Coalition won office in 1996. It probably would have lost even more had it not been for fears of a backlash in rural and regional areas, some of which rely solely on the ABC's broadcasting services.</para><para>But in more practical ways, the ABC has suffered even more than the 66 million dollar budget cuts it has been forced to endure. 
</para><para>The ABC has received only a tiny proportion of the funding it requires to meet the costs of digital conversion. The Corporation has been promised about $20 million over four years, when they require at least $167 million. The Government has promised to underwrite a further $24 million.</para><para>The estimates of the cost of digitisation of the ABC were, of course, carefully checked by independent auditors, Arthur Andersen, and were found to be accurate.</para><para>They even agreed that the sale of real estate to fund the costs of digital conversion was not in the best interests of the ABC.</para><para>What makes the costs of funding the ABC seem so large?</para><para>Simply, the ABC is a national television and radio broadcaster.</para><para>The ABC runs one national television station (metropolitan, rural and regional) and six national networks. The ABC is not just a television broadcaster operating only in capital cities.</para><para>A technological conversion of this degree will be expensive and the Government has a duty to fund the ABC properly for this conversion, particularly when there is no option. Under the law, the ABC must convert to digital technology.</para><para>The Coalition's agenda on the ABC is clear.</para><para>It now has very strong friends and allies on the ABC Board, but it wants more.</para><para>These are not accidental occurrences. The Government is very careful about who it choses to place on the Board, including, of course, a former Victorian President of the Liberal Party. Such appointments do not lead to a public perception that the ABC Board is independent from government.</para><para>Interestingly, this is exactly the type of behaviour the Minister accused the former Labor Government of in 1994. Let me remind the Senate what Senator Alston said at the time:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">"[It will be] a great disappointment to all those who are looking to the Government to take this opportunity to make appointments to the board on the basis of merit and to boost the community standing and reputation of the ABC. . . This blatant board stacking exercise endangers the independence and integrity of the ABC and has the potential to do grave danger to Australia's international reputation" (Hansard, 30.06.94)</inline></para><para>He also said, three days earlier that:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">"It is absolutely critical that the ABC is not compromised in its work and that it does has a genuine and impartial board" (Hansard, 27.06.94)</inline></para><para>The Prime Minister is also in record for stating that:   
</para><para><inline font-style="italic">"More than ever before Australia needs an independent, fearless, professional Australian Broadcasting Corporation". . . and that. . . "in appointing new commissioners to the ABC, they will in fact be people who will act without fear or favour, that they will in fact be people who will be completely dispassionate so far as political comment is concerned" (Hansard, 05.05.83).</inline></para><para>The Democrats know that the majority of Australians appreciate what the ABC is, and what it does. It is one of Australia's most valued cultural institutions, and has a proud record of offering high quality programs across a wide range of areas including news and current affairs, the arts, drama, children's programming, sport and comedy.</para><para>Australians have taken a very dim view of the cuts to the ABC budget.</para><para>They have taken a very dim view of the changes to programming which have resulted from these cuts.</para><para>And they have taken a very dim view of the Government's party-political appointments to the Board. They know that all this erodes the ABC's independence.</para><para>We all remember the Government's promises in the lead up to the 1996 election—that they would not politicise the ABC Board, and that they would not cut the ABC's budget.</para><para>We are left, though, with painful reality. The Minister is making appointments to the ABC Board which are clearly biased, and clearly designed to cement support for the Coalition's policy agenda.</para><para>The Government, with the Minister leading the charge, has sought to override the ABC's independence by attempting to direct the ABC's program choice and type, most notably on television. Cricket matches, the NSW Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, lectures by former Prime Ministers, interviews with Aboriginal leaders and the coverage of the Waterfront dispute have been among his favourite targets.</para><para>And he wants the Board to agree with him.</para><para>The Minister's attempts to prove the ABC was inefficient through the Mansfield review failed, and Coalition allegations of bias have also failed to convince a deeply sceptical Australian community.</para><para>Unhappily for the ABC and its audiences, though, the threat against the ABC of further Board stacking and further budget cuts are still very real.</para><para>That is why I am tabling this very important bill today.</para><para>This bill—to amend the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act—will ensure that the Government's ideologically driven hate for the ABC is at least curtailed. It will ensure transparency of ABC Board appointments. 
</para><para>It will ensure that the Parliament has a proper say in the funding appropriated to this very important public institution.</para><para>This is especially important in the context of conversion from analogue to digital technology and the increasing use of online services.</para><para>The bill establishes a Joint Committee on the ABC who will approve and recommend appointments to the ABC Board. The Committee is established to ensure the Minister no longer has sole discretion in recommending Board appointments to the Governor-General.</para><para>The Committee will have 10 members, with five members each from the House of Representatives and the Senate. Appointments will be made in the same manner as for joint select committees, so that minor parties can be involved. Neither the Minister, president nor deputy president, speaker, nor deputy speaker can be members of the Committee.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">ABC Funding</inline></para><para>The Committee will examine the annual report of the Corporation and undertake to have parliament investigate issues arising therein, should the need arise. It will review the ABC's annual appropriation and make its own recommendation on the level of appropriation the ABC.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Appointments to the Board</inline></para><para>The Committee may also approve or reject a recommendation for appointment to the Board, and has up to 44 sitting days in which to do so. The Committee may ask an applicant to appear before it to answer questions for the purposes of clarification.</para><para>The person chosen by the Committee for a position on the ABC Board should be appropriately qualified, having had experience in communications, the provision of broadcasting services or management. They may have expertise in financial or technical matters, cultural or other interests in relation to the provision of public and or broadcasting services. This is not changed from the ABC Acts' current requirements.</para><para>In instances where the Committee does not endorse the Minister's recommendation for appointment, or where the Minister does not accept the Committee's decision, a report will be presented to both Houses of Parliament.</para><para>We believe this is the fairest and most appropriate method for making ABC Board appointments. The Joint Committee will be multi-partisan, with members from all parties and from both houses of Parliament.</para><para>Of course there is more the Democrats would like to do for the ABC. There is more we would like to do to support the tireless campaigners for a free and independent ABC—like the various states' Friends of the ABC who have continued over the 
 last three years, to raise public awareness of the effects the Government's polices are having on the Corporation.</para><para>We would like to see:</para><para>.	 The ABC's annual funding restored to at least pre-1996 levels.</para><para>.	 Provision of adequate additional funding to enable the Corporation to convert to digital technology for radio and television. Only with the provision of this funding will the ABC be able to meet its Charter obligations.</para><para>.	 Proper levels of funding to allow the ABC to effectively plan its broadcasting schedules, and maintain and expand its in-house program and documentary making capacity, and to meet targets for Australian and local content.</para><para>.	 Independent operation so it can continue to simultaneously complement and be a real alternative to, commercial free-to-air broadcasters without fear of government interference.</para><para>.	 Reopening of the Cox Peninsula Short Wave radio transmission facility. It would take just $1.6 million for the people of the Asia Pacific—our neighbours—to receive independent news and information in their own languages.</para><para>We call on the Government to make these commitments in the lead up to the May Budget.</para><para>In tabling this bill today, the Democrats believe it represents a step in the right direction to ensuring the maintenance of a truly independent Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>3225</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Socio-Economic Consequences of the National Competition Policy Committee </title><page.no>3225</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline> at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Quirke</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the Select Committee on the Socio-Economic Consequences of the National Competition Policy be authorised to hold a public meeting during the sitting of the Senate on 30 March 1999, from 7.30 pm, to take evidence for the committee's inquiry.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><title>Discharge of Order of the Day</title><page.no>3225</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Woodley</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That general business order of the day no. 27, relating to the Restitution of Property to King Island Dairy Products Pty Ltd Bill 1996 [1998], be discharged from the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> .

The last is necessary 
 because of the abolition of the Anti-Dumping Authority by the Customs Legislation (Anti-dumping Amendments) Act 1998.</para><para>The amendments to the normal value provisions in section 269TAC of the Customs Act 1901 ("the Customs Act") provide for a case by case approach to be taken by the Minister in inquiries into the alleged dumping of products from countries that are in the process of transition to a market economy. Under the proposed amendments, if the Minister is satisfied that the exporter's domestic selling prices of the product under investigation are subject to government control or substantial government control, normal values may be ascertained by reference to other relevant information, which may include the selling prices of like goods in a "surrogate" country.</para><para>Section 269TAC of the Customs Act provides for the assessment of the `normal value' of imported goods, for the purpose of determining whether the goods have been exported to Australia at less than that value (thereby dumped). The structure of the section has been described as establishing a hierarchy of methodologies by which normal values are determined. Investigating authorities must progressively work through each of the prescribed methodologies until a point is reached at which a normal value can be determined.</para><para>Until the latter part of last year subsection 269TAC(4) was utilised by investigating authorities to ascertain normal values for goods exported from command economies by reference to information obtained in a "surrogate" country. In November of last year legal advice was obtained as to the scope of subsection 269TAC(4). That advice confirmed that the section was severely limited in its application. Its stringent tests require that the Government of the country of export has at least a substantial monopoly of all of the trade of the country—not just in terms of the goods under investigation, AND must also substantially influence the domestic price of all goods in that country.</para><para>Although the governments of economies which are in a state of transition from a command economy to a market economy may still maintain controls over the domestic selling prices of a significant number of sensitive products, it cannot be said that the extent of the control falls within the ambit of subsection 269TAC(4). Clearly, in such economies the government has moved from a position in which it maintained a substantial monopoly over all of the trade of the country.</para><para>As subsection 269TAC(4) can have no further application to economies which are considered to be in transition from a command economy to a market economy, the determination of the normal values for exports from such economies, as a matter of law, must be made in accordance with the remaining provisions of section 269TAC. These 
 provisions do not distinguish between "market economies" and those which are considered to be "in transition". Therefore, normal values for exports from economies which are considered to be in transition from a command economy to a market economy must be ascertained by the application of the same methodologies that are required to be applied in the ascertainment of normal values for exports from countries such as the United States of America and Germany. That is, there is presently no flexibility available for investigating authorities to treat exports from economies which are in transition differently from exports from other countries.</para><para>Investigating authorities require the flexibility to proceed to a methodology similar to that provided in s. 269TAC(6) (ie have regard to all relevant information) as soon as they are satisfied that the domestic selling prices of the goods under consideration are subject to government control. The proposed amendments therefore aim to confer such flexibility upon Customs.</para><para>The provisions contained within the bill will operate in the following manner. If it is identified that the domestic selling price of the goods under consideration is subject to a price control situation the normal value of the goods exported to Australia is to be determined having regard to all relevant information which may include information obtained from a surrogate country.</para><para>Absent any such price control situation, the proposed amendments will allow the Minister to proceed to examine the cost of production of the goods exported to Australia. If the Minister is satisfied that a raw material accounts for more than 10 per cent of the costs of producing or manufacturing the exported goods (and is thereby considered to be significant) and that the raw material is supplied by an enterprise which is wholly owned by a government of the exporting country the cost of the particular item could be ignored and, for normal value purposes, its cost could be estimated by the Minister by reference to other relevant information which could, but need not necessarily, include the cost of that item in a surrogate country.</para><para>To ensure that Australia is not in breach of its obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the amendment provides for regulations to be made which will provide that the new methodology for calculating normal values will not apply in respect of specified countries.</para><para>The bill also contains amendments which, in combination with those in the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998, clarify the operation of the provisions of the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Act 1975 which relate to the manner in which interim dumping and countervailing duties are collected. The amendments make it 
 clear that such interim duties can be imposed, pending final assessment of any dumping or countervailing duties, notwithstanding that the actual export price and normal value, or the fact that a countervailable subsidy has been received, have not yet been ascertained.</para><para>Although these amendments are to be taken to have commenced on 1 January 1993, the date on which the interim dumping and countervailing duties were introduced, they will not require importers to pay an amount of dumping duty beyond that which has previously been demanded. The amendments merely seek to ensure that approximately $12 million in interim duties collected since 1 January 1993 is not subject to legal challenge.</para><para>This bill also contains amendments which will replace the terms "preliminary finding" and "Anti-Dumping Act" with the terms "preliminary affirmative determination" and "Dumping Duty Act" (respectively). These amendments will ensure consistency with the amendments to the Customs Act implemented by the Customs Legislation (Anti-dumping Amendments) Act 1998.</para><para>CUSTOMS TARIFF (ANTI-DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</para><para>This bill amends the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 to clarify, in combination with the amendments to the Customs Act 1901 proposed in the Customs (Anti-dumping Amendments) Bill 1998, provisions of these acts which relate to the manner in which interim dumping and countervailing duties are collected.</para><para>The amendments make it clear that such interim duties can be imposed pending final assessment of any dumping or countervailing duties, notwithstanding that the actual export price and normal value, or the fact that a countervailable subsidy has been received, have not yet been ascertained.</para><para>These amendments have a retrospective commencement of 1 January 1993, the date on which interim dumping and countervailing duties were introduced, to ensure that approximately $12 million collected in interim duties since 1 January 1993 is not subject to legal challenge.</para><para>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1998-99</para><para>In Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1998-99, appropriations totalling $1,129,000 additional to those made in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1998-99 are sought for recurrent and capital expenditures of the Parliamentary Departments. This amount is partly 
 offset by savings of $570,000 in the appropriations for the running costs of the Parliamentary Library and the Joint House Department made by Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1998-99.</para><para>The increases sought relate to primarily to increases in the running costs for the Departments of the Senate, the House of Representatives and the Parliamentary Reporting Staff of $90,000, $539,00 and $341,000 respectively. These increases in running costs are largely as a result of a higher carryover of unspent funds from 1997-98 than anticipated at the time of the Budget.</para><para>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1998-99</para><para>This is a historic occasion for the Parliament. It is the last time on which cash based annual appropriations will be presented for the Parliament's consideration.</para><para>The next Budget that is to be brought down in May 1999 will be prepared on an accrual basis consistent with the recommendation of the National Committee of Audit. Under that framework, the focus in the Appropriation Bills will be on</para><para>.	 achieving agency outcomes, rather than the current input focus; and</para><para>.	 funding for the full price of agency outputs or expenses estimated to be incurred, rather than merely estimates of cash payments to be made.</para><para>Taken together, these changes will disclose to the Parliament the full costs of the Government's activities and allow a greater focus by the Parliament on performance of agencies.</para><para>Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1998-99, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the Additional Estimates for 1998-99.</para><para>In the bills, the Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1998-99 under Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act.</para><para>The additional appropriations in these three bills total some $1,638 million; $1,382 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), $255 million in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and about a million dollars in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2).</para><para>These amounts are partly offset by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1998-99. Reflecting the Government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs, these savings, 
 amounting to some $379 million in gross terms, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document "Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations", which has been distributed to honourable senators.</para><para>After allowing for prospective savings, the total appropriations sought represent a net increase of $1,260 million in appropriations for 1998-99, an increase of about three and a half per cent on the amounts made available through the annual appropriations at the time of the 1998-99 Budget.</para><para>Honourable senators should note, however, that this increase does not translate to a similar increase in estimated outlays as:</para><para>(a)	 the appropriations include amounts which are functionally classified as net advances or financing transactions; and</para><para>(b)	 the figures relate only to expenditures financed by annual appropriations, which comprise about 25 per cent of Budget headline outlays. The figures do not include variations to estimates of expenditures from special appropriations, transactions of the Reserved Money, Commercial Activities or Loan Funds; nor do they incorporate any revisions to receipt items which are offset within outlays.</para><para>I turn now to the main areas for which the Government seeks additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1998-99 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the Government.</para><para>Running costs appropriations provide for the recurrent and minor capital costs of agencies in providing Government services. The total gross supplementation for running costs for all departments and of $609 million. After allowing for estimated savings in running cost appropriations of $16 million, the net increase in the provision for running costs of $593 million represents an increase of about five per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No. 1).</para><para>Principal factors contributing to this increase are:</para><para>.	 higher than anticipated carryovers of unspent moneys from 1997-98 of some $136 million;</para><para>.	 borrowings against the forward estimates of $152 million; and</para><para>.	 for the Department of Defence, a $119 million reallocation, within the Defence global budget, from programme appropriations to running costs to meet changing priorities.</para><para>In gross terms, some $209 million additional estimates are sought for the Defence Portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). In addition to the supplementation of Defence running costs I have already mentioned, this figure includes:</para><para>.	 $22 million for compensation and legal expenses in respect of the Military Compensation Scheme; 
</para><para>.	 $8 million for defence production for new capability and production payments for High Explosives facilities at the Mulwala site; and</para><para>.	 $58 million for defence housing to allow the Defence Housing Authority to reposition itself in the market.</para><para>The gross supplementation for Defence have been partly offset by reductions of $148 million in other Defence annual appropriations, giving a net increase in funding from that source of some $61 million.</para><para>In addition, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) includes provision for:</para><para>.	 $83 million for labour market training and assistance largely attributable to carryovers of funds from 1997-98 and supplementary funding for enhancement of Job Network Services announced in August 1998;</para><para>.	 $65 million for payment to the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency (Centrelink) for the delivery of income support services reflecting changes to welfare payment cycle, supplementation for IT leasing and additional funding for medical assessments to determine eligibility for the disability support pension;</para><para>.	 $32 million for child care assistance reflecting a reduction in expected savings due to a delay in the implementation of the childcare smartcard and therefore a change in the timing of childcare payments to families from two weeks in advance to fortnightly in arrears;</para><para>.	 $10 million to the Australian Electoral Commission for the costs of conducting elections, referendums and industrial ballots, largely attributable to the Commission's costs associated with the recent Federal election and the delayed election in Newcastle following the death of one of the candidates;</para><para>.	 $39 million for contestable hearing services through a voucher system as a result of higher than expected demand for voucher services and increases in services and device fees negotiated for new contract arrangements with service providers and manufacturers on 1 November 1998;</para><para>.	 $47 million for capital assistance for residential care facilities for older people largely reflecting commitments for additional funding the Government made during the last Parliament together with a rollover from 1997-98 of capital funding for industry restructure;</para><para>.	 $19 million for bounty payments under the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 to cover an anticipated backlog of outstanding claims as manufacturers lodge claims prior to the expiry of this assistance programme in 1998; and 
</para><para>.	 $248 million for the servicing the debt of the Australian National Railways Commission principally as a result of the decision that, consequent upon the sale of ANR, the Commonwealth would assume future responsibility for its debt.</para><para>The balance of some $140 million in the amount included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) is made up of minor variations across a range of programs in most departments and agencies.</para><para>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1998-99</para><para>In Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1998-99, appropriations totalling $255 million—additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1998-99—are sought for capital works and services; payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory; advances and loans; and for other services. The proposed appropriations are required to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in the Budget appropriation measures.</para><para>The additions are necessitated by certain cost and price increases that have occurred since the Budget, together with other commitments that have been made by the Government. Areas where significant increases are sought over amounts provided in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1998-99 includes:</para><para>.	 $16 million for rural adjustment largely as a result of a carryover of unspent funds from 1997-98 to 1998-99 and the declaration of exceptional circumstances in Duaringa, Cobar, Monaro C, Wilcannia and Wentworth;</para><para>.	 $3 million for assistance to the sugar industry with funding allocated over four years for research into increasing the sugar content levels of sugar cane and related research;</para><para>.	 $6 million for assistance to specialist pigmeat processors in the pork industry through the pigmeat processing grants programme;</para><para>.	 $15 million for computer equipment for the Department of Family and Community Services;</para><para>.	 $100 million to assist people and small businesses who were adversely affected by the interruption to the Victorian gas supply;</para><para>.	 $11 million for a grant and $4 million for a loan to IIF Investments Pty Ltd for the Innovative Investment Fund program;</para><para>.	 $20 million for payment to South Australia for the runway extension at Adelaide Airport reflecting a carryover of unspent funds from 1997-98;</para><para>.	 $10 million for payment to the Northern Territory for continuation of the Northern Territory Health Indigenous Infrastructure Programme to 
 improve living conditions and health standards for indigenous people; and</para><para>.	 $19 million for a community education and information programme on reform to the Australian tax system.</para><para>The remaining $51 million included in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) comprises minor increases in a number of programs across a range of portfolios.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the  Customs (Anti-dumping Amendments) Bill 1998  and  Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  be listed together on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as a separate order of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3230</page.no><id.no>r743</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>ASSISTANCE FOR CARERS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r727</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>3230</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3230</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the Senate that these bills are being introduced together.

The Convention supported the adoption of a republic based on a `bipartisan appointment of the President model' and recommended that the model, and other related changes supported by the Convention, be put to the people at a constitutional referendum.</para><para>The Convention also recommended that, prior to the referendum being put to the people, the Government undertake a public education programme directed to the constitutional and other issues relevant to the referendum on the republic.</para><para>The Government has confirmed that it will put the Convention's preferred model to a referendum in 1999 and that it will support public information activities in relation to the referendum. The Government has made it clear that the republic question is one for the Australian people to decide. In order to make an informed decision, the Australian people must have access to relevant information about our system of government and the proposal for change. The Government believes that public funding should be made available to support a vigorous and engaging public presentation of the arguments for and against change.</para><para>The public information activities associated with the referendum will involve three phases.</para><para>The first phase, timed to coincide with the consideration of the referendum legislation in the Parliament, is to consist of wide distribution of a `plain English' public education kit explaining the existing system of government, the Convention's preferred republic model and the referendum process together with an advertising campaign to publicise its availability. It is intended that the information be available in other formats tailored to particular audiences, including in translation (up to 16 languages), on the internet, and in alternative formats for the sight impaired. An expert group will be established to clear the information prior to publication to ensure balance, fairness and accuracy. The advertising campaign will provide a reminder of the forthcoming referendum and promote the availability of the information. The aim of this phase is to ensure that balanced, factual 
 information is made widely available to assist electors to understand the issues before they vote in the referendum.</para><para>The second, or `campaign' phase will occur in the 3-4 week period leading to the referendum voting day. The Government will make available $15m for national campaigns to promote the arguments for and against the republic model put at the referendum.</para><para>Two committees have been appointed by the Government to manage the campaigns both drawn from delegates to the 1998 Constitutional Convention. One includes delegates who support change in line with the Convention's preferred model and the other delegates who oppose it. The Government is conscious that the republic issue should not be one for politicians alone. The Convention delegates are a broadly representative group with a high public standing on the republic issue.</para><para>Each committee will plan its own campaign and manage expenditure of up to $7.5m. The committee will develop advertisements to be run through media outlets of their choice in the three to four weeks before the referendum, which is likely to be held in November. The advertisements will be placed through Government processes, but the Government's checks will be limited to ensuring that the proposed advertisements do not infringe statutory requirements or accepted standards for advertising.</para><para>Public funding for the committees will allow robust public debate on the arguments for and against change. As with the provision of public funding in election campaigns, the purpose is to ensure that the alternative views can be presented directly to the voters.</para><para>The Australian Electoral Commission will have responsibility for the conduct of the referendum process after the Constitution Alteration Bills have been passed by the Parliament, including any advertising associated with the process of voting (for example, to inform voters about enrolment deadlines and particular voting arrangements). The Commission will be responsible for the third phase of public information activities, the physical distribution of the official `yes' and `no' cases to all voters as provided for by the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 (the Referendum Act).</para><para>Clause 4 of the Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill (the bill) would amend the operation of subsection 11(4) of the Referendum Act. Subsection 11(4) imposes restrictions on expenditure by the Commonwealth in relation to constitutional referenda. It provides that:</para><para>(4)	 The Commonwealth shall not expend money in respect of the presentation of the argument 
 in favour of, or the argument against, a proposed law except in relation to:</para><para>(a)	 the preparation, printing and distribution of the pamphlets referred to in this section, or the preparation and distribution of translations into other languages of material contained in those pamphlets;</para><para>(aa)	 the preparation and distribution of presentations of that material in forms suitable for the visually impaired;</para><para>(b)	 the provision by the Electoral Commission of other information relating to, or relating to the effect of, the proposed law or</para><para>(c)	 the salaries and allowances of members of the Parliament, of members of the staff of members of the Parliament or of persons who are officers or employees within the meaning of the Public Service Act 1922.</para><para>Subsection (4) was inserted in what became section 11 of the Referendum Act by means of an amendment in the Senate at the time of the passage of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Bill. The subsection arose out of a concern at the time to establish a statutory prohibition against the government of the day funding partisan involvement in campaigns surrounding a referendum proposal. Specifically, the concern was that a government might support one case only.</para><para>Clause 4 of the bill is not an attempt on the part of the Government to tip the balance in favour of either side of the debate on the republic.</para><para>Clause 4 is intended to ensure simply that Commonwealth expenditure on the Government's three-phase programme of public information activities for the 1999 referendum does not result in a technical breach of subsection 11(4) of the Referendum Act.</para><para>The Government's intention is to give the Australian people who will be required to vote on a republic the best chance possible to understand the issues at stake and the arguments for and against change.</para><para>The Attorney-General's Department has indicated that subsection 11(4) of the Referendum Act as it stands may prevent public funding for the campaign phase of the information activities. The Department has also said that the subsection arguably prevents Commonwealth expenditure on educational material which may be said to include any argument for or against the proposed law. Many kinds of educational material could conceivably come within the scope of such a prohibition. The class of educational material that may be regarded—in one sense or another—as an argument for or against change is potentially too broad.</para><para>Clause 4 of the bill would facilitate expenditure by the Commonwealth on public information activities 
 by temporarily over-riding the operation of subsection 11(4) of the Referendum Act.</para><para>Clause 4 of the bill would over-ride the operation of subsection 11(4) only in relation to expenditure in respect of things done in 1999 in connection with:</para><para>(a)	 a referendum on a proposed law for the establishment of a Australian republic; or</para><para>(b)	 a referendum on a proposed law to insert a preamble in the Constitution.</para><para>The reference in clause 4 to a referendum on a proposed law to insert a preamble in the Constitution is necessary in order to ensure that `incidental' references to the preamble proposal cannot of themselves result in a breach of the act.</para><para>The reference is intended to ensure that expenditure in connection with information activities relating to the republic issue, and particularly in connection with the phase two advertising campaigns, cannot breach the Referendum Act simply because it also incidentally touches on the preamble issue. The Government's commitment is to undertake a public education programme directed to the republic proposal and to fund campaigns on that proposal. That commitment does not extend to the preamble proposal.</para><para>Clause 4 would have a very limited effect. Indeed, it would not alter the text of the Referendum Act. Clause 4 would operate as a provision of the Referendum Legislation Amendment Act 1999 and cover the 1999 referenda. Otherwise, clause 4 is not intended to affect existing statutory arrangements.

Further, for each of the referendums, the ballot-papers are to be of different colours, to be chosen by the Electoral Commissioner.</para><para>.	 allow for a wider distribution of the Yes/No case pamphlets than is currently provided for in the legislation, including publication on the Internet.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para></para><para>ASSISTANCE FOR CARERS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</para><para>This bill gives effect to a number of measures from the 1997-98 and 1998-99 Budgets and the "Staying at Home" package announced on 2 April 1998 that aim to improve assistance to carers of those with a disability and the elderly.</para><para>As part of its 1997-98 Budget, the Government announced that it would extend carer payment to a new category of people. The new category will be people who are caring for an adult with a level of disability that is not sufficient to qualify their carer for income support. From 1 July 1999, carer payment will be payable to that carer if the adult, because of his or her disability, is unable to look after his or her own child or has a child with a disability for whom he or she is unable to care for because of the child's disability, and, as a result, the carer is also looking after the child. The aim is to provide help for people who are not caring full-time only for the adult with a disability, but are in fact engaged in full-time care because they are required to look after the child as well.</para><para>In the "Staying at Home" package, the Government reinforced its commitment to carers by announcing that it would introduce a simpler and more consistent system of income supplements for carers. This initiative involves the introduction of a new payment called carer allowance, which will be available to carers from July 1999.</para><para>Carer allowance brings together two payments—child disability allowance and domiciliary nursing care benefit—to provide a single income supplement for carers of adults and children. The qualification rules for carer allowance will mean that it will be more easily available to carers of adults with disabilities than is presently the case for domiciliary nursing care benefit. Carers will be able to claim carer allowance from any Centrelink office. It is expected that 14,000 carers of adult relatives will qualify for assistance for the first time.</para><para>The Government announced in the 1998-99 Budget that it will expand the scope of carer payment and carer allowance to increase assistance that is available to carers. Where the person for whom a carer is caring is hospitalised and the carer is involved in the person's treatment plan, the carer will now be able to claim and receive carer allowance. Previously, carers could not claim child disability allowance, domiciliary nursing care benefit or carer payment when the person they were caring for was hospitalised. From 1 July 1999, in cases where the person cared for has a terminal illness or is expected to return home after hospital treatment, the carer will continue to qualify for carer payment or carer allowance for a period of hospitalisation for up to 63 days in a calendar year. 
</para><para>The current assessment of an adult's disability for the payment of domiciliary nursing care benefit has been criticised as being subjective and unduly restrictive. As part of its "Staying at Home" package, the Government announced that, from 1 July 1999, it would introduce a simpler and more objective assessment mechanism, the Adult Disability Assessment Tool. It will be much easier for many carers to qualify for carer allowance, particularly those caring for people with intellectual, psychiatric and neurological disabilities. Fewer medical assessments will be needed for recipients with severe and permanent disabilities.</para><para>The Adult Disability Assessment Tool will also be used to decide qualification for an existing social security payment, carer payment.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the resumption of debate on the bills be made an order of the day for a later hour this day.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3233</page.no><id.no>r721</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r738</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>3233</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3233</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the Senate that these bills are being introduced together.

In the first year of operation of the 1997 act, all grant recipients received a full 100 cents in the dollar of their entitlement, attesting to the accurate matching of the scheme to eligible exporters for that year.</para><para>Furthermore, over 200 new small and medium exporters entered the scheme because of the lowering of the minimum expenditure threshold from $30,000 to $20,000.</para><para>In total, 2,933 exporters were assisted by the scheme in 1997/98, and those exporters received an average grant of $52,626.</para><para>However, as might be expected with a completely new act, usage has revealed areas where some fine-tuning is now required.</para><para>In addition to extending the scheme for a further two years, the bill therefore introduces twelve amendments of a housekeeping nature that restore or clarify the original intention of the 1997 act, and assist the smooth administration of the scheme.

It has been a long time in gestation, the reference being given to the committee in May 1998 and public hearings being held in July and August last year, with an anticipated reporting date in August. However, Madam Acting Deputy President, you would be aware 
 that the sitting pattern was somewhat changed last year with the calling of an early election and that the parliament did not meet again until November last year, when new committees and committee chairs were put in place.</para><para>The chairman's draft report was given to the committee on 7 December last year, shortly before the Senate adjourned for the Christmas break. There has been what could be seen as a response to the report, even before the report was brought down. The Attorney-General, in a major statement in January this year, brought down a revised version of the National Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal Information. I am very pleased that the Attorney did so but, had he done so earlier, perhaps in July last year, it would have saved the committee quite a deal of work. But at least it does prove that the Attorney and the Attorney-General's Department are listening to what the community is saying. We do await the hard copy of what the Attorney said the government is going to do in that statement delivered in January this year.</para><para>Before I speak briefly on the body of the report, I also pay tribute to the secretariat that assisted the committee in the development of the report. Dr Pauline Moore, as the secretary of the committee, was ably assisted by Mr Jonathan Curtis, Mr Gavin Denton and Ms Alison Carson. I thank them for their assistance and advice in the development of the report. I also have to thank my colleagues, in particular the former deputy chair of the committee who ably assisted me during the inquiry, Senator Abetz, and, of course, a previous member of the committee, Senator George Campbell. I must also thank my friend and colleague the learned Senator Cooney from Victoria, who was a constant source of advice and counsel during the inquiry. He also assisted immeasurably during the construction of the report which is now presented to the Senate.</para><para>The terms of reference of the inquiry asked the committee to consider measures contained in the Privacy Amendment Bill 1998, which proposed to extend the operation of the Privacy Act 1998 to business performing work outsourced by the Commonwealth, 
 together with existing privacy protection in Australia's private sector, taking into account Australia's international obligations and the need for legislative backing for privacy protection. The report addresses those needs in the private sector, the extent to which the current protection is offered and the effectiveness of a self-regulatory system. Although the 1998 bill is not yet back on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, the inquiry is broader than what was proposed within that legislation.</para><para>Since the inquiry commenced, the Stockdale bill has been introduced in Victoria, prompting the federal government to change its policy and accept the need for at least some legislative protection of privacy in the private sector. The committee has not considered the developments since December last year. To do so would have meant that we would have restarted the inquiry, and of course we have not yet seen the colour of the content of what the Attorney-General is proposing. He has stated what they are going to do, but what is going to be proposed is not yet public. We await that with bated breath.</para><para>The international and national debates over privacy protection have resulted in an emergence of an expanding body of law and standards. A privacy protection scheme covering the private sector must include core information protection principles and an enforcement system. These must create enforceable rights and obligations that provide minimum standards of an individual's privacy right. The privacy protection principles should reflect international best practice, such as the European Union Directive on Data Protection. A failure to ensure high standards could damage Australia's trade interests in two ways: by inhibiting the ability of trade partners to exchange information and by limiting the confidence of the Australian public in emerging technologies.</para><para>The committee concludes that existing protection is inadequate. Australia's existing legal frameworks are partial in their coverage and vary across jurisdictions. Access to remedies and enforcement is uncertain. Inadequacy of federal law is prompting legislative responses at a state and territory level, making a fragmented national approach increasingly 
 likely. Self-regulation by itself does not provide an adequate system for privacy protection. Without an adequate enforcement mechanism, the national principles for the fair handling of privacy information lack force and cannot provide the basis for an effective national privacy scheme.</para><para>The national principles do not meet the requirements of the European Union Directive on Data Protection. In comparison, they provide a weak and piecemeal approach to the collection and protection of data. The Privacy Amendment Bill 1998 is an inadequate response to the need for privacy legislation. The desire to minimise the application of the bill would have had the effect of increasing the complexity of Australia's privacy laws. This is ironic, considering industry's pleas for simplified, uniform and consistent privacy laws.</para><para>The committee recommends the creation of uniform national legislation covering both the public and the private sectors. The preferred solution is a coregulatory system based on a model developed by the Attorney-General's Department. This comprises flexible industry codes developed in cooperation with the Privacy Commissioner and backed by a legislative scheme. Responses received to the 1996 discussion paper <inline font-style="italic">Privacy Protection in the Private Sector</inline> reveal an overwhelming support within industry for the proposed coregulatory model. Minimising the regulatory burden and compliance costs to industry is important. However, costs depend upon the exact nature of the scheme in question. It cannot be assumed that a legislative system will necessarily entail high compliance costs. The coregulatory model adopted in New Zealand has cost very little.</para><para>There is a wide constitutional basis for the Commonwealth parliament to enact comprehensive privacy legislation, although there may be some doubt as to the complete coverage of such legislation across all areas. However, this  problem could be solved by the enactment of uniform model legislation in all jurisdictions by Commonwealth, state and territory governments. I commend the report to the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>3237</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is a vital report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee in the discussion about what privacy laws we ought to have in this country and, indeed, what we ought to have around the world. I say `around the world' because a lot of the impetus for this report came from the European directive of which Senator McKiernan has spoken. Senator McKiernan chaired this committee and, in his usual able way, has led the committee to make a very significant contribution to the area that we are discussing.</para></talk.start><para>The whole issue of privacy is one that is going to trouble us for some time because it goes to the issue of what information should be made available to the public generally and what should not. Of course, in this era of technology it is very hard for people to keep secure to themselves what they might wish to. The answer to this problem of how information is to be controlled might end up being resolved by making information more available. That is a very interesting concept. Instead of trying to shut off the access that other people have to information about ourselves, if we made that information available to everybody on the basis that everybody made information about themselves available to the world, then an interesting situation would arise. That would mean that we would no longer have problems with the concept of commercial-in-confidence, for example. If a company did not want compulsory regulation of privacy matters but left it up to the goodwill of others and information that would tell us how that company was acting became available, then so be it.</para><para>That sort of approach might indicate that if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear. What I have been talking about might indicate that that phrase is not as easily applied as it might first appear because if that were the case it would mean that these commercial-in-confidence issues and other similar issues would become available to the public. We have instances in this chamber which arise—one arose yesterday—as to what documents should be made available in the Senate. What proper role does the executive have and what proper role does the parliament have in 
 this question of what information should be made available?</para><para>In the area of policing, what documents should be kept away from the police and what documents should the police be able to preserve when they have them? In matters of national security there are great issues. What information should be made available about Pine Gap and what should not be made available? There is a whole area in which privacy has yet to be discussed, but the fundamental issue is the same: what should we, as a matter of right, be able to keep to ourselves, whether we are a government, a party, a military organisation, a police force or whether we are a company trading in commodities or anything else? That is what this issue goes to. Therefore, it is a very important issue.</para><para>As we see things, if people find out supposed information about us then the issue arises as to what sort of interpretation they are going to put upon that information. Let me explain further. People say that if you have nothing to fear you have nothing to hide. But that presumes that what is revealed about us or about our company, our country or our party will be interpreted by others in a fair way. One of the great problems in this area is the interpretation that is given to information that becomes available about anything or anybody. That information is often very badly interpreted. So you get information put out to the public which is incorrect, which is given a twist or a spin, as they say, and then comes back in a very unfair way on the person about whom the information has been made available.</para><para>I would like to have heard many people in this chamber discuss this document because it is, as I say, a very central issue in our society. It is a matter that affects all of us because there are all sorts of things which we do not want people to know about our own lives—our medical records, for instance. Even in dealings within one political party some people might say, `We will keep those sorts of deals secret.' That does not happen on our side of politics because whatever we do we reveal and it is plain for all to see. But in other places, people do deals which they want 
 to keep secret. It would be a terrible shock to our side to think that that sort of thing happened.</para><para>The issue of privacy comes in at every level and in all areas. I am glad that Senator McKiernan had the perspicacity to see that it ought to be developed. I should mention the rest of the committee—Senator Payne, who has recently come to this committee and is quite outstanding, Senator Coonan, Senator Hutchins and  Senator Stott-Despoja. In closing, I thank the staff in the secretariat who did the work. Senator McKiernan has already thanked them, but I would also like to mention Dr Pauline Moore, Mr Jonathan Curtis, Mr Gavin Denton and Ms Alison Carson.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Information Technologies Committee</title><page.no>3238</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Appointment</title><page.no>3238</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>)—as amended, by leave—proposed:</para><para>	 (1)	 That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Information Technologies, be appointed to inquire into and report on such matters as may be referred to it by the Senate.</para><para>	 (2)	 That the committee consist of 8 senators, 4 to be nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, 2 to be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, 1 to be nominated by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, and 1 to be nominated by an independent senator or a Green senator.</para><para>	 (3)	 That the committee may proceed to the dispatch of business notwithstanding that not all members have been duly nominated and appointed and notwithstanding any vacancy.</para><para>	 (4)	 That the chair be elected from the government members of the committee.</para><para>	 (5)	 That the deputy chair be elected from the non-government members immediately after the election of the chair.</para><para>	 (6)	 That the deputy chair act as chair when there is no chair or the chair is not present at a meeting.</para><para>	 (7)	 That, in the event of the votes on any question before the committee being equally divided, the chair, or deputy chair when acting as chair, have a casting vote.

The central problem with this motion is that the proposed committee has no terms of reference.	 The matter of information technology is a critical one to everybody in our community. The Greens in particular, representing very strongly the interests of young Australians, are concerned to see that information technology is facilitated, not restricted. We are particularly concerned that, if a committee like this is established, it look at such matters as foreign ownership and cross- 
 media ownership, noting the comments by Messrs Packer in the last 24 hours about the convergence of computer and communications technology which, in their view—and this is a revised view—makes the attempt to limit foreign ownership of the media, in the widest sense of that word, obsolete.</para></talk.start><para>We are also concerned about equity of access to information technology so that there is equal opportunity for students in Australia's schools, for people in the bush vis-a-vis those in the city and for community groups. Add to that those people who find information technology difficult—older people, people with physical handicaps or impediments and people who are not literate or who do not have English as their first language. I would like to see a committee like this look at positive action to ensure that those Australians who find information technology is outside their reach have it brought within their reach. We see continuing analysis of the penetration of computers into, for example, households in Australia, noting it is probably higher than in almost any other country, and yet 10, 20 or 30 per cent of households in Australia have never seen a computer cross the threshold. So we see there a difficulty for many Australians. I would also like to see an analysis of the impact of information technology on the regulation of commerce, on taxation and on the way in which Australians go about their everyday lives.</para><para>I note that there is already an Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. We already have a committee which could handle the work that we presume the government intends for the committee now before the Senate. Why have two committees dealing with information technology? Why not expand the terms of reference of an established committee dealing with information technology? This is confusing, it is unusual. It will, I presume, if we are to be expeditious, require demarcation as to what matters those two committees—the established committee and the one to be established—are going to look at with regard to information technology.</para><para>Above all, we have to allay the concern there is in the community that this is going to 
 be the anti-porn crusade committee; that at times unspecified in the future we are going to see the issue of censorship at the top of the agenda of this committee looking into information technology. I do not want to see that happen. I do not believe that the most important thing regarding information technology in this country and the problems it presents for the average citizen is the truncation of the liberties of Australians to see, read or hear what they wish to.</para><para>Obviously, all of us have concerns about the excesses which can be engaged in here; concerns which are going to be a huge problem not just for people in this country but for people right around the world because, as we all know, the control of information technology does not start or finish at the borders of this or any other country. The regulation of what can be seen or heard by Australians needs to be constantly looked at. But if this committee is being designed—and there is every appearance that it is being designed—to further the interests of Senator Harradine and members of the government in cracking down on what Australians can see or read about, then that is a matter of great concern. If that is the case, let it be said. Let us be open and straight about it now. I reiterate: there are hugely important matters to do with information technology which the Senate should be looking at. They can be looked at by an established committee. Why create another one and, in particular, why bring another one with no terms of reference before the Senate for consideration?</para><para>What is going on here? Why has the government suddenly, at this time, brought this committee up for consideration by the Senate with no terms of reference? I suggest it is to foster the interests of Senator Harradine. I suggest it is to have available a means of looking at material on the Internet which Senator Harradine is concerned about. I note that this matter is up for consideration, whereas other matters that Senator Harradine has not had time to deal with are put off until next week. I might be wrong about this, but let us have a debate about it. There is, I can tell you, a very wide concern out in the community that we are entering a new age of 
 censorship, that we are entering a new age of government interference in the liberties of Australians—time-honoured and time-held liberties. If that is the case, let us call a spade a spade. Let the government tell this Senate what it is up to.</para><para>In the absence of proper terms of reference, the government is simply fostering the concern there is in the community that agenda number one here is to facilitate Senator Harradine's concern for censorship, while at the same time the government facilitates its concern to get through the sale of more of Telstra, to get through its GST legislation, to get through its anti-environmental laws, to get through its anti-forest protection laws and so on. I am not going to support the appointment of a committee that has no terms of reference. The two things should be here together. We should have the agenda on the table. It is not on the table and, until it is on the table, I will be opposing it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Will you run for membership if it gets set up without the terms of reference?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—I am coming right to that, Senator Campbell.

 establishing a committee that does not have at this stage—of course it might have soon—matters to report into. I am concerned that in this circumstance we might determine the membership and even establish the chair of the committee—the chair may even be being paid a salary of office—but we might not actually have any formal work for the committee to undertake. I think that is a significant issue for the Senate and we need to be careful about it. Paragraph (1) of this motion refers to appointing a committee `to inquire into and report on such matters as may be referred to it by the Senate'. And the technical issue is: no matters at this stage have been referred to it by the Senate. I do not know whether they will be or not.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">HARRADINE</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>—They have been, and this is the report.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—Where is that in the motion, Brian? I am listening to the interjection from Senator Harradine, because I am interested in what he says on this. I have carefully read the motion, all 12 paragraphs of the motion before us, and the 13th, which the Manager of Government Business has by leave incorporated in the motion. That is something that is supported by the opposition, because in fact it was the opposition's idea. It was the opposition that went to the government and said, `Well, you now have a proposition before the Senate involving the establishment of a select committee, but there is no report back date.' So that was a matter of concern, as I am sure all senators would appreciate. At the initiative of the opposition we now have incorporated in the motion—in my view, properly—a proposition that `the committee shall present its final report on any matters referred to it on or before . . . the last day of sitting in the year 2000.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>That was another weakness in the motion before us, and I think that has been rectified. We do not have a situation at the moment where there is anything formal for the committee to inquire into. There is no way that you can read the now 13-part motion and suggest that that is not the case. We have a situation at the moment where the motion before us is far more appropriate for a standing committee than for a select committee. 
 That is a pretty fair and objective analysis of the situation that we have.</para><para>I have to say to the Senate that it is not the opposition's intention to oppose this motion, but it is the opposition's intention to try and ensure that the Senate acts properly in relation to the establishment of select committees. I point out—and I do not know if others in the Senate have given any consideration to this fact—that we have a matter before the chair proposing an eight-person select committee and that two of the members of the select committee will be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. In other words, two out of eight of the committee—one-quarter of the committee—will be Labor senators.</para><para>We could mount a persuasive case—a very persuasive case indeed—to argue for greater representation. I am not going to do that. I am not going to propose an amendment, but I point out to the Senate yet another flaw. In other words, if on the basis of representation in the Senate you are entitled to three out of eight committee members, perhaps someone should argue why on this particular occasion the government has not taken account of that issue.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">RAY</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>—It's another gerrymander.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—It is a gerrymander.

We have a select committee on the new tax system, a select committee on the socioeconomic consequences of the national competition policy and now this proposal before us for a select committee on information technologies. Again, the point needs to be made that the select committee on the new tax system was an initiative of the Australian Democrats; the select committee on the socioeconomic consequences of national competition policy was the initiative of Senator Margetts, representing the Western Australian Greens. Now we have a select committee on information technologies that is the initiative of the government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I make the point at this stage that the opposition has not been successful in propos 
 ing the establishment of a select committee, and I hope that the Senate shows equal generosity when the opposition does bring forward a proposition for the establishment of such a committee. We think there is certainly an entitlement as far as the opposition is concerned in this regard.</para><para>So there are some flaws of a technical nature in the motion as it currently stands, which make this quite an unusual motion to be placed before the Senate, and that is really the nature of the concerns that the opposition has with the motion. I am not going to the issues that Senator Brown has gone to in relation to what he believes might be debated, dealt with and referred to this select committee. I do not know what those issues are going to be. If important matters, such as some of those that he was referring to, do come before the select committee, obviously they will be treated as serious ones by the opposition, because we do believe that there are very important public policy implications in the sorts of issues that Senator Brown and others might raise. But at this time I am not in a position—and I do not think too many senators are in a position—to second-guess what those issues might be, and that is a flaw in the motion that is before the Senate at this time.</para><para>Regardless of that, these are important issues for the government to address; and I hope it does. We do not want to see a chair of a select committee being paid when the committee actually has no work to do. I do not think any senator would want to see that occur. It is important, if we are to have a select committee, that its actually has something to inquire into. I do not think that is unreasonable. There are serious flaws in the motion at the moment. As I have indicated, the motion before us is more in the nature of a motion relating to a standing committee. Perhaps these things will be addressed quickly; I assume that they will be.

I think in the last count of committees, the total we got to was 47. Our concern is not to stop avenues of exploration in this chamber but merely that, if you create so many committees that senators cannot give them their proper and full attention, they never reflect the proper views of senators. You end up devolving the writing of reports to consultants and committee secretaries and the involvement of senators becomes less and less.</para></talk.start><para>We are also being very conscious of the funding decision made by the Department of Finance and Administration and the Senate to put into the base funding of the Senate funding for select committees. You might remember, Senator Harradine, that we had seven select committees in 1995 and that was putting enormous pressure on the resources of 
 this particular chamber. I think that mostly through the drive of the Labor members on the staffing appropriation committee, but certainly assisted by the President, we were able to come up with a formula with DOFA that put funding into our base funding. We have always been careful not to go beyond that and put pressure on other areas of Senate funding.</para><para>Therefore we take the view that select committees must have a specific purpose to serve. They are not there just as a convenient substitute for reference committees because someone wants to change the composition of the numbers or get more publicity. We believe most of these references—I stress `most'—should go to the references committees, but there are exceptions. Some specific issues are better served by select committees—and the areas that are dealt with by Senator Ferris's committee may well fall within that category—but we have been careful and cautious about just how may select committees we set up. One of the easiest political stunts in the world, when you are under a bit of political pressure over a specific issue, is to go back to the particular constituency and say, `I've got it fixed. I'm going to move for the establishment of a select committee.' I would suggest that one or two of the committees that existed in the eighties had their genesis in that.</para><para>Senator Faulkner has made the valid point that when you are considering setting up select committees, who around the chamber has a fair chop at it. We know that this committee is being set up by the government at the government's initiative,  and I think the government is entitled to a select committee every now and then. We know that the GST committee was set up by the Democrats and we know that the competition policy one was set up by the Greens. That just leaves one set of dancers on the floor without a chair—the Australian Labor Party. So we just forewarn people and humbly submit that we would expect—unless it is totally outrageous—that if we come up with a reasonable suggestion for a select committee, maybe when the GST committee has finished its work, we would 
 get some consideration, constituting more than a third of the Senate.</para><para>In this case, this committee is being set up with a government chair, and I have to say I think that is reasonable. It is not a matter we would criticise because in terms of select committees there has been a reasonable rotation between government and opposition of select committees, so we have no objection to the government chairing this committee. We have some puzzlement as to why we were allocated two out of eight, rather than three out of eight. That is not usual in these procedures, but we will put two such powerful intellects on this committee that we will easily match the four government ones.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">FERRIS</name><name role="display">Senator Ferris</name></talker><para>—Who?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—We have not made that decision yet, Senator Ferris.

I must say I have not been encouraging people to set up this committee in the view of limiting things. Frankly, I had no idea until Senator Harradine got to his feet today that he had a report ready to go—which I suppose is a testament to the fact that Labor members of the committee do not discuss the internal workings of the committee with us and that they have kept their confidence about it. But I did not know that. Clearly, had I known, Senator Harradine, that you had a report ready to go, I would have encouraged the setting up of this committee again in November at least to transact that business and to complete it. I did not know that and therefore that was one of the reasons I have not been enthused about setting the committee up.</para><para>When it comes to the question of terms of reference, this is the first time a select committee has ever been moved without terms of reference. That was the nub of our problems with it. This is easily resolved. I encourage Senator Harradine or Senator Ferris to go to the clerks at some stage this morning and develop a reference to finish this last reference. We as the opposition will give you 
 leave not to give a notice of motion but to move an immediate reference to the committee so you can proceed and finish that work. So you can have the reference today, as far as we are concerned, if you can get the terms ready that relate to that previous report.</para><para>Senator Faulkner raised the point that that would obviate this problem of having a chair elected and being paid to do nothing. The last time that came up was when Senator Harradine indicated that I was paid to do nothing. Funnily enough, I was the only one to agree with him—he thought he had hurt my feelings—because at that stage the Privileges Committee had no work. But anyone looking at the number of reports that were brought into the chamber subsequently would realise that, if it had been my intention to take a chair with no work, I was amply punished by this chamber with the many references they sent to the committee.</para><para>I agree with the moving by Senator Campbell of a reporting date; every select committee should have a reporting date. But it really is putting the cart before the horse. What we should do is move the next reference to this committee—obviously there is going to be one—and then move a reporting date, not put in a reporting date before we know what the next reference is.</para><para>Senator Harradine has suggested that a good reference would be the question of Internet porn—to use the abbreviated term. That is an area that needs examination, but I have to say that it needs an examination when people's views in this chamber are not grossly distorted by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. We must enter into it with a reasonable reference, not with the sort of biased views he put in an answer to a question this week when, by inference, he said that the Labor Party did not care about porn on the Internet. That is a total distortion of the Labor Party view that there are immense technical difficulties. The Senator Alstons of this world, for cheap political points, then make the jump—because you have said there are technical difficulties—that in some way you are soft on this issue or that you encourage Internet porn. Nothing could be further from the truth about the Labor 
 Party's position. So if we do have a reference on this particular matter, let it be an objective reference and not a polluted one from the minister for communications in this government.</para><para>I have seen coalition members in this chamber—Senator Alston and Senator Parer in particular—absolutely race to put down the private conversations you might have during a division or in the lobby here. They have done it twice to me—both times distorting my view. Wouldn't I love to reveal in this chamber some of the discussions between the coalition and the Labor Party in the last three months about this committee, whether it should exist and what its reporting date should be. Senator Campbell would be highly embarrassed if I did, but I am not going to lower myself to that level. But, clearly, coalition senators have told Senator Harradine only part of the story and omitted all the other parts.</para><para>What we have come to here is an improved motion with a reporting date—that is the first improvement. The second improvement we could make is to develop terms of reference today that at least go as far as resolving the previous matters under consideration by the committee. We in the Labor Party will not use any device in the chamber to prevent that reference being made today. As such, you have then set up a select committee and you have the terms of reference. We will then await future terms of reference to this select committee, which we hope will actually try to come to grips with and solve what is going to be an increasing problem, and not make political brownie points or adopt the distorted, knock down the straw man approach of Senator Alston.</para><para>The Labor Party when in government was never censorship free. We did have ratings for films and they were enforceable because of the very nature of cinemas. We then had to struggle with videos because of their wider accessibility to under-age people. But the Internet is a far more worrying area in terms of access. I do not believe in unfettered access but equally I do not believe in censoring generally—unless it has implications for other people—what adults view.</para><para>Trying to draw those distinctions is going to be very difficult, especially when you are involved in technology that a seven-year-old knows a lot more about than I do, and always will. I do not know about other people in this chamber, but when I want my video recorder programmed it is the niece and nephew who do it, not me. That is the difficulty. That is why this is a unique area. It is not a classic conservative versus liberal view on Internet porn; it is not that, it is a completely different issue. I do not want Senator Alston trying to melt it down to that simplistic level and then abusing people around the edges of it like he did the other day.</para><para>The opposition will not oppose this motion. We hope that with a bit of goodwill we can knock it into shape, get it through and get on with the next item of government business as quickly as possible.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>3246</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats support the re-establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies. People have identified the problems with the motion before us. I was going to suggest an amendment along the lines that Senator Ray has foreshadowed, but I understand that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has undertaken to come up with a form of words. My suggested amendment would have been to section (1) of that motion and would basically add on `in addition the committee shall look at the receipt and consideration of outstanding reports'—reports from the former committee—as well as the two relevant terms of reference from the committee in its former life, and they are:</para></talk.start><para>(b) evaluate the development of self-regulatory codes in the information industries; and,</para><para>(c) monitor the personal, social and economic impact of continuing technological change created by industries and services utilising information technologies.</para><para>I understand the minister has a more succinct form of words in relation to those terms of reference that will solve the problem before us today.</para><para>Certainly the Democrats concede that there has been a process difficulty today—the government has come before us with the motion to continue the work of this committee but has failed to highlight the specific nature of that work, hence the concerns in the chamber that that could lend itself to a committee with no terms of reference, a paid chair with no work to do and the opportunity to broaden those terms of reference or to deal with matters that may not be directly relevant or appropriate.</para><para>Senator Ray is correct, as was Senator Harradine: there is an outstanding report from this committee. One of the matters discussed, certainly in the Democrats party room, was whether or not this committee should be continued for the very reason that there was an outstanding report. I certainly informed my colleagues of that fact, without necessarily explaining to them in any particular detail or specificity the nature of the report or what the evidence before us was; nor did I even refer to the chair's draft. So I find it a bit extraordinary that other members or parties in this place were unaware that a committee report was in the process of being finalised.</para><para>One of the final reports presented to the last parliament by the chair of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies at that time, Senator Ferris, was on the need for the committee in the 39th parliament. The recommendation from the chair on behalf of the committee was the re-establishment of the Senate select committee in this parliament. That was a fairly basic recommendation. Among the reasons given for that—and I think there were something like 10 points—was for the committee to monitor and complete outstanding reports.</para><para>The Democrats support in principle the notion of a separate committee that deals with information technology issues, and those issues alone. I take on board comments from Senator Brown that indeed there is currently a Senate committee that is examining information technologies as one component of its work. However, the Democrats believe that a committee on IT on its own is appropriate. That is why in August 1997, when we had this debate the last time, we were very keen 
 to see terms of reference that specifically highlighted these emerging technologies and their impact on society, our economy, our education system, et cetera.</para><para>I and my party had direct involvement in the terms of reference that were finalised for that committee. They are not exactly what we wanted; obviously the finished version was a compromise. Nevertheless, we still maintain that these issues are not being examined in the appropriate level of detail by the Senate or indeed by this federal parliament. So we will continue to push for information technology issues to be considered higher on the agenda.</para><para>People have mentioned possible references and possible areas of ongoing or new work for this committee. I will not get into the debate about censorship or civil liberties; my views are already on record both in the form of this committee's work and that of the former committee—that is, the community standards committee on utilisation of technologies. My concerns are very much on record in relation to issues of censorship.</para><para>Of course members of this committee or members of this chamber are not always going to agree with the terms of reference or some of the areas under discussion. The chair, Senator Ferris, will acknowledge that I have written to her on occasion or spoken to her about some of my concerns with the work pursued by the committee, not for some of the reasons that may have been suggested here today but for very different reasons. The last area that the committee was examining, on self-regulation in relation to privacy, was something I was concerned we were duplicating in terms of the work of another committee, namely the Legal and Constitutional Committee of the Senate.</para><para>I also suspect that, on occasions, we have missed the correct definition of information technologies in this place. For the purposes of that committee, which I note is still outstanding, we defined information technology as being the media. So we were looking at privacy in relation to the media. It was not a decision that I necessarily strongly supported. That is not to say that it was not an important committee inquiry, but again we have to be 
 very wary that this committee does not lose the opportunity to address issues directly related to information technology.</para><para>I have put on record before, and will again in the debate this morning, some of the areas that the Democrats believe this committee should be looking into. Certainly the terms of reference give us the scope to examine areas when it comes to self-regulation, bearing in mind that is one of the suggested terms of reference. Those areas include the detriments of self-regulation and how governments should undertake development of regulation or self-regulation in these industries. In terms of encryption, the areas include the need for uniform standards, the impacts of encryption on consumer confidence, international encryption standards and the benefits of encryption for the development of future technologies, for example the online transmission of sound recordings.</para><para>The international electronic community is another area that we have not begun to even touch on in the context of this committee. What is it? How do we define it and understand what is the electronic economy? What are Australia's various roles in this economy? What are the opportunities for Australia to increase its role in the beneficial aspects of this economy and the educational, employment and entertainment aspects of this economy? Is the information society being dominated? That is a fairly obvious question. How can this domination be addressed to ensure Australian culture is sustained, developed and promoted? What measures should Australia adopt to ensure Australia's participation in the international information society?</para><para>Then there is another aspect that we must ensure is not lacking not only in our interpretation of the terms of reference but also in the committee reports and inquiries that we pursue. I am referring to the issue of equity and justice, something that Senator Brown touched upon. That involves access to the information society for Australians, the relative justice for different sectors of the Australian community, the role of government in fostering technology equity and justice, barriers in the information society to access 
 equity and justice, and the role of education in the information society.</para><para>A key component of this whole debate must be an examination of our intellectual property laws. That would involve evaluating recent decisions that perhaps identified flaws or outstanding problems in our IP laws, the role of international agreements in Australia's intellectual property laws, the adequacy of existing IP laws in Australia and Australia's international interests. It would also involve looking at the adverse impacts of the introduction of new technology into our community, for example restructuring work, the casualisation of the work force, reinventive competitiveness and redefining work, as well as an examination of information poverty.</para><para>So clearly there are broader issues for debate in the context of this committee, and the terms of reference that operated last time do allow for this broader debate. Certainly the Democrats more than anyone want to see this committee not hijacked in a way that focuses on issues that are not directly relevant to IT issues. That is the single qualifying factor we have about supporting this IT committee and its future, that is, that it is not hijacked by interests that are in some way unrelated to information technologies, the information economy and information society.</para><para>We are happy with the terms of reference that currently exist. We support this committee's re-establishment on the grounds that they are the terms of reference that will be ongoing. If Senator Campbell is not moving his motion, I will seek leave to move my amendment, but I suspect that the minister's will suffice at this stage. We were concerned with one of the areas of examination in the last committee and, as I say, the Democrats' concerns are on record. But I acknowledge the will of the committee, supported by the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and Senator Harradine.</para><para>The Democrats just feel that we have perhaps lost a vital opportunity to actually examine IT issues and not issues that were currently under examination by, say, another committee or not necessarily directly related to the IT industry. We are just hoping that this committee will embark upon some of 
 those more adventurous and interesting areas of information technology, like e-commerce, vilification and defamation laws and intellectual property, as they relate to IT. It is with this thought in mind that we support the re-establishment of this committee. It is on the proviso that Senator Campbell moves an amendment that takes into account the terms of reference from the last committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>3249</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On the basis of information that has come before us, because of the arguments that had been raised by Senator Faulkner and Senator Harradine here, I think it is appropriate that we now adjourn this debate until a later hour this day.

The creation of the new class of approved facilities has been done in a way that benefits only privately insured patients. Public patients sent by hospitals to an approved facility would incur a potentially large gap payment. However, the justification is that the procedures and approved facilities are more economic because the overheads for office based procedures are much less than doing the same thing at a hospital. If this is true, the benefit should be equally great for the public system as for the private. Thus, if procedures are relocated from a public hospital to an approved facility, there should be savings to the public purse because the facilities fee is much lower than the cost of a public hospital stay.</para><para>To solve this problem, it is proposed that a Medicare rebate be required for any procedure for which there is a facilities fee set which can be covered by private health insurance. The government's argument, as I understand it, is that this would amount to a cost shifting, as the states would save on hospital spending 
 and increase costs to Medicare. However, if there is a long-term trend towards approved facilities, the imbalance could be corrected in the next hospital funding agreement. To not offer this option would exclude public patients and impose large gap payments for them to use what would be essentially private facilities.</para><para>This is obviously a request to the House of Representatives, but the opposition thinks it is an important addition to the policy contained in this bill because it provides that the measures that the government thinks are beneficial in the private sector ought to apply equally to the public sector and that, if we are talking about the development of a trend and an advance in the way we handle procedures, it ought to be equally true for the public system. The opposition thinks this request should be supported because it is an important part of adding balance to the government's proposal, and that the measures contained in the bill regarding approved facilities should also apply in the public sector.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>3250</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Effectively, if we do not support this amendment we will generally see only private patients using these new facilities. Those who are public patients will be staying in hospitals—continuing, I presume, to use day surgery facilities as they have made those choices—but I think it is most unfair that the minister should again look at the whole issue of cost shifting and blame it back on federal-state relations, saying, `We have to do this because the states might push some more people out of the hospital system.' It is an unfortunate fact that in this country we have a major problem with the way our health system is structured and funded and that there is so much buck-passing and cost-shifting between state and federal governments, but I do not think we can let it get in the way of this.</para></talk.start><para>If necessary, in the future there may need to be some renegotiation between state and federal governments if these new facilities are so overwhelmingly successful that there is a financial cost to the Commonwealth because the states are pushing people out of hospitals,

This does concern me considerably. I know the government's argument is that raising the MBS to 85 per cent will only encourage state governments to push some hospital procedures into approved facilities that the Commonwealth, rather than the state, pays for—that sort of cost shifting. The parliament should be concerned about that, too, if there will be no net increase in the amount of money that will go to health in this country.</para></talk.start><para>I would certainly like to hear the government's response to this issue. It seems to me that raising the MBS to 85 per cent further increases the Commonwealth's expenditure on private health services without necessarily adding any substantial funding. I can understand the point that the government makes on this but, as Senator Lees just said, we do get into this bind so frequently in this overlapping area of state and Commonwealth responsibilities. I must say that I am concerned that leaving the Medicare Benefits Schedule at 75 per cent may set a precedent for other areas of out-of-hospital care to be reduced to 75 per cent from the current 85 per cent.</para><para>I would like to get some guarantee from the government that the 75 per cent rebate will apply only to certain procedures, and that the Commonwealth will guarantee that it will not apply more broadly in the future. In other words, are we really setting a precedent? I ask the government, through the parliamentary secretary, to give some guarantees and assurances on that particular issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>3251</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In order to understand what the government is trying to achieve in relation to approved procedures facilities, it is important to understand the current situation. Currently, when a person is admitted as a private patient to a hospital or day hospital, the Commonwealth, through Medicare, pays 75 per cent of the Medicare Benefits Schedule fee. However, if the patient is insured, any accommodation fees charged by the hospital are the responsibility of the fund. Where a patient is not insured, accommodation charges are the patient's responsibility. Thus, as the <inline ref="r655">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999</inline>  currently stands, because the services that will be provided in an approved procedures facility are only those services that would have been provided in a hospital or day hospital, the government has maintained the level of Medicare rebate at 75 per cent of the Medicare Benefits Schedule fee.</para></talk.start><para>However, in recognition of the costs required to establish and run an approved procedures facility—and such costs could broadly be equated with the overheads of a hospital or a day hospital—the government will allow funds to pay a facility benefit to doctors in recognition of such costs. Furthermore, under the Australian health care agreements, state governments are already able to provide treatment outside of a hospital in a doctor's rooms. Given the additional funding that has been provided under these agreements to the states by the Commonwealth, there is every reason to think that many public patients will have access to similar services in the public sector.</para><para>Thus, in this context, it is apparent that the opposition's proposed amendment is misguided in two ways. Firstly, the opposition amendment misses the key point on the approved procedures facility provisions. The procedures undertaken in approved procedures facilities are those that would otherwise have taken place in a hospital or day hospital facility. As such, the rebate a patient would have expected to receive in a hospital or a day hospital facility is 75 per cent—exactly 
 what they will receive in an approved procedures facility. Furthermore, by increasing the Medicare rebate to 85 per cent of the schedule fee for such services, one could speculate that there is an increased incentive for states and territories to cost shift some services that would otherwise have been provided in the public sector to the Commonwealth via Medicare.</para><para>Secondly, the opposition appears to be insisting that the Commonwealth pay a minimum facility benefit, determined by the minister under these provisions. This would be a radical departure from the status quo. In effect, the opposition is asking the Commonwealth to pay a private patients accommodation charge, and the government strongly opposes any such move. For these reasons, the government is unwilling to support the amendment moved by the opposition.</para><para>Senator Harradine raises an important question with regard to precedent and whether or not this is intended in any way to create a further precedent in that area. I can certainly advise Senator Harradine that there is no intention to create a precedent by this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>3251</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the parliamentary secretary for that information, but there is something further that I want to clarify.

What we have here is a government argument that the provision of approved facilities will be helpful in providing more efficient and cost-effective health care by taking some procedures which currently occur in hospitals and day hospitals out of that environment and doing them, effectively, in doctor's surgeries, in what are called approved procedures facilities.</para></talk.start><para>What we are arguing about here is how one attempts to provide equal treatment for people. The government has concentrated its efforts on those with private health insurance—the 30 per cent, or maybe less now, who are in private health insurance. The Labor opposition is saying that, if this is good policy, it is good policy for everybody, not just the 30 per cent who have private health insurance. What we are seeking to achieve by this request is to make the government address what it says is good policy to those in public health as well.</para><para>The government's proposition, as I understand it, means that if a person chooses to go—for reasons of convenience, trust in their local GP or, perhaps, quicker service rather than waiting to get into a day or public hospital—to the doctor's surgery, the approved procedures facility, and they are a private patient, they will be insured and the 75 per cent treatment will apply. But the public patient, in accessing this alternative, will be faced with the cost of the 25 per cent left over from the Medicare subsidy. They will be paying the full facilities fee and they 
 will be paying any gap in the doctor's fee that exists above the schedule fee. So it will be a very expensive proposition for those persons.</para><para>If we are saying that it is good public policy for us to encourage people to use these approved procedures facilities, surely it is good public policy for the 70 per cent of Australians who are not in private health insurance. What we are seeking to do is to say that if these approved facilities offer some cost benefits, surely we must seek to protect the interests of the public patients as well by making those benefits at least relatively accessible to them. We believe that by this procedure we will make them relatively accessible. They will still have a gap payment to make; it will still not be available to all Australians because the cost will prevent that, but it seems reasonable that we provide this level of support to those who seek to use approved facilities but who do not enjoy private health insurance.</para><para>I think it is a question of providing a proper balance between the needs of those with private health insurance and the 70 per cent of Australians who do not. As I say, if it is good public policy to have this system of approved facilities, and to have these procedures taken out of hospitals and moved into this arena, surely it is good for those without private health insurance as well.

We may or may not make the right decision in terms of total health outcomes here, but it seems to me that we should be doing this in the context of having had a proper inquiry into health funding—into what is the most effective way of providing health services and getting our community as healthy as possible within the budget that we have.</para></talk.start><para>We really have not done that. We are moving further along, if you like, a policy position—let's call it the `Richo position'—of concentrating on benefiting or encouraging private health funding, and not necessarily looking at it in the context of the overall benefits. I am in two minds about this issue—it is a very difficult one—but, if push comes to shove, I may have to think about what is going to bring the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people. At this stage, those numbers of people are really on the side of the people not in health insurance.</para><para>I am getting advice showing me different ways of looking at this but, until we have done that inquiry, we are still left in the situation of having to take some kind of ethical or moral judgment on the impacts on people and the impacts on health. It is very difficult for us to make decisions as to whether or not this will bring the greatest benefit to the private insurers when, if anything, the evidence that came through from the various inquiries is that we have no guarantee that specifically benefiting the private health insurers is going to bring the greatest outcomes in Australia's health and in Australia's hospital systems. So until we do that I am afraid that, on this issue, I may have to look at what will be of the greatest benefit for the greatest number of patients in Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>3253</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is important in considering the issues raised by Senator Evans to ask the question: is the opposition saying that the medical profession discriminates against patients getting the best care in the best setting because of their insurance status? The cheaper overheads should mean less gap for all patients. It is important to state that the procedures that will be available are available to all Australians through the provision of this legislation. It is about the most appropriate care for a patient in the most appropriate facilities. The Australian health care agreements cover public patients and allow for greater use of out-of-hospital care, and that is the intent of this legislation. </para></talk.start><para>The amendment that is being proposed by Senator Evans provides an incentive for an inappropriate shift of services from hospital or day hospital. Changing the fee to 85 per cent will provide a perverse incentive to shift inappropriate procedures to office based surgeries, despite the setting of rigorous standards and guidelines by the Commonwealth. The setting of the fee at 85 per cent will create divisions within the medical community as to the most appropriate location for the delivery of specific services. This will be in direct contrast to the setting of procedure lists for day surgeries, which was accomplished with the broad medical consensus under the auspices of the Day Surgery Council. I would hope that senators would see the merit in opposing Senator Evans's amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>3253</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, are you suggesting that hospital administrators would push people out of hospital into inappropriate settings?

We are, after all, talking about an intermediate facility, a facility not as expensive and not, I guess—as far as equipment and resources available—staffed and serviced as well as a day hospital or a hospital, but a step up from 
 an ordinary consulting room in a doctor's surgery.</para></talk.start><para>I suspect that many of these facilities are, in fact, almost already available in those multipractice facilities—nine-, 10-, 15-doctor facilities—that we have in our capital cities, where they are already doing minor operations.

Indeed, in Adelaide casualty services often send people even with broken limbs back to some of these clinics. These facilities will be upgraded to the sort of service that you are looking at.</para><para>Our concern is that some people may actually not be able to use these new facilities because of the additional cost. It may be that, rather than go to a public hospital, it would be much better for this procedure to be done in this facility, but when they are faced with a 25 per cent gap they are going to say, `No, I'll wait and I will use the public hospital,' which is by far, for the community purse, the most expensive option. The problem is whether the actual purse that is opened is the public section belonging to the state government or the part belonging to the federal government. This is where I can see the minister's concerns—he does not want to see cost shifting happening.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>3254</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me give the assurance that patients will be treated under the public health system, but it is, as I have said previously, a matter of making sure—whether it is in hospital or in the approved facility—it is the most appropriate that is available.</para></talk.start><para>I did say earlier that we are concerned that changing the fee to 85 per cent could provide a perverse incentive to shift inappropriately.

I share some of the concern that this might be used by the Commonwealth, or by Commonwealth funding mechanisms, that more people who ought to be in hospital get shoved out into the intermediate facilities.

I understand there is some concern about cost shifting, but I want to address it from the point of view of the patient and providing some equity. It is still the case that it will be far more expensive for a public patient to go to an approved facility, 
 from the patient's point of view. Our proposition suggests we will pick up 85 per cent of the doctor's fee and the facility's fee, but there will still be an extra cost in terms of the facility's fee and the gap for the patient going to an approved facility.</para></talk.start><para>We are trying to provide some equality of treatment to allow public patients to access what is considered by the government to be potentially a more efficient and cost-effective method of treating some procedures. It is the case that the government will still approve what procedures are performed in these approved facilities. They will still have control over that sort of thing. So I think the minister's argument about people being pushed out of public hospitals is not the case. It will still not be attractive for a person who cannot afford it to go to an approved facility as a public patient. This at least will provide some assistance for those who want to do that. It might well alleviate some of the pressure on public hospitals and their waiting lists. We think it will at least provide some equity of treatment and that the government ought to be encouraging both public and private patients to utilise and access measures which it thinks are beneficial. So this is the balancing measure.</para><para>I do not want to labour the point, but we do want to note that the minister will retain control over approving which procedures occur. I do not think people will be forced out of hospitals, as the minister suggests. The question for a lot of patients will be that they will not be able to afford to take advantage of procedures at approved facilities, but it will at least provide some support for those who want to take advantage of that option and who remain public patients.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>3255</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am a little more inclined, after this debate, to be supporting Senator Chris Evans. If you have a situation where somebody wants to have a mole removed and they go to a GP who suggests that the person can wait and go into a public hospital to have the job done, then, being uninsured, that person would not be up for any costs at the public hospital. But if the doctor says it can be done quicker in 
 the community approved facility, that person, being uninsured, would be up for a cost. Is that correct?

This is Labor amendment No. 6, which seeks to oppose that schedule. It is identical to Senator Harradine's amendment No. 3, as I understand it. Item 9 of schedule 2 will be opposed because it creates a precedent in that policies may be offered for approved facilities procedures which exclude coverage of palliative care, psychiatric care and rehabilitation. It would be against the interests of older persons if this provision were to be rolled back into hospital tables. We have a concern that this might well represent the thin end of the wedge and we believe that the full range of services ought to be offered.

I cannot understand why the funds would not want that option so that instead of taking people out to a private hospital or a day facility, procedures could be done on site, even if it is rehabilitative rather than anything else. In supporting this amendment, I cannot understand why the government has done this in the first place and why the funds want it.

In telecommunications, health care, primary industry and energy—you name it—the ACCC has become the guru or the person who decides whether what we have is good or bad, but in a very narrow sense—whether it is competitive or anticompetitive.

 continue to say, `We have an ongoing inquiry; the ACCC is looking at it.'

The opposition does support this legislation. This bill amends the referendum machinery provisions of 1984 to provide for the funding and distribution of material for the purposes of the referenda on the republic and on the preamble. The bill permits expenditure on matters otherwise inconsistent with subsection 11(4) of the act for the duration of 1999 for the purposes of those referenda only. The effect of this amendment is to allow the provision of $7.5 million to each of the yes and no campaign committees appointed by the Prime Minister for the promotion of their respective cases. The explanatory memorandum to the bill explains that the government will also spend $4.5 million on a neutral education campaign.</para></talk.start><para>More substantively, the bill amends subsection 11(4) of the act to allow the Australian Electoral Commission to spend money on a wider distribution of the yes and no campaign material than is currently provided for. The amendment will allow the distribution of this material by post or other means, for instance over the counter, to persons other than electors, and also via the Internet.</para><para>The bill also amends subsection 25(3) of the act and, in doing so, provides for multiple ballot papers of different colours where two or more referenda are held on the same day, as will be the case for the referenda on both the republic and the preamble. Finally, the bill corrects a reference in paragraph 36A(3)(b) of the act to appropriately protect the secrecy of a voter's ballot.</para><para>It is interesting to note in this context that the government does intend to retain subsection 11(1) of the act, which provides for the writing of the formal yes and no cases. The government has indicated that selected members and senators from within its ranks will be permitted to vote no to the republic bill so that an official no case can be prepared in accordance with that subsection. It is not clear whether a no vote will occur on the preamble bill, but I think it is becoming a bit more evident that there will probably be a body of opinion in this community that will be campaigning and voting no in respect of that preamble.</para><para>One cannot talk about this legislation without talking about some of the objects of the legislation and some of the subjects of the referenda. One comes directly to the question of the preamble. In that context, it has probably been a disappointing 48 hours or so for this nation to have seen its Prime Minister sitting down with a coterie of very selective and selected mates and putting together a form of words which have basically been thrust upon this country as the only option for a preamble for a constitution that may embody and reflect the independent status that Australia has achieved over the last 97 years, since we adopted the initial constitution.</para><para>It is somewhat of an authoritarian and arrogant position to have been taken by the Prime Minister. There was much to be gained by him in coming up with a preamble which would embody and reflect the spirit of the country and do everything that preambles should do. At the same time, opportunities lost in politics can quite often lead to very negative impacts on those who lose those opportunities. I think the Prime Minister has turned an opportunity to create a broad and 
 inspirational preamble into a loss for himself personally and for his government as well.</para><para>In the last 24 hours we have seen the preamble—the Prime Minister's personal preamble—described as an inspirational blancmange or a shambles. In fact, there has hardly been a commentator in the country who has not had fundamental problems with the preamble, apart from the usual suspects who are always there to back up the Prime Minister: Geoff Blainey and Paddy McGuinness. Apart from those very isolated and sectional characters, the broader community has basically said that the Prime Minister has dropped the ball.</para><para>What the Prime Minister should have done in framing a preamble was to adopt a broader approach. He should have looked at some of the precedents of nations of the world—nations which, in their preambles, quite often espouse the aspirations of liberty, equality, truth and justice. They are preambles which reflect the essence of a country's history; preambles which reflect not just where countries have been, but their present and their future. He got it wrong in terms of substance and he got it wrong in terms of style. One only has to read the press over the last 48 hours to see how fundamentally wrong he got it.</para><para>We have a preamble that is now being forced on the Australian public by a Prime Minister who says, `I worked it out and you have to cop it. If you do not like it, you are not going to get an alternative.' For me and for most Australians, that is the height of political arrogance.</para><para>The starting point should have been the Constitutional Convention of some 12 to 15 months ago. The Prime Minister promised to adopt the recommendations of that convention. The convention came up with 10 core ideas on what should be reflected in a preamble. That convention began with the fundamental starting point that the proper function of a preamble was to offer the context through which the actual legislation should be read, interpreted and seen, not just by the courts but by the people of the country.</para><para>That convention also said that, if we are going to go down the road to becoming a 
 republic, then we need a preamble to reflect that direction. The Prime Minister chooses to disconnect the preamble from the republic and the propositions for a republic. He thinks we can do one without the other. But it is the view of many in this country that, if Australia is to become a republic, then there should be a preamble which fits the bill. I think that was almost the unanimous view of the Constitutional Convention last year. They said that we should have a preamble which offers context for the bill and offers context for a republic in Australia.</para><para>The Constitutional Convention also said that there should be at least 10 core ideas reflected in the preamble. They included rule of law, representative democracy, recognition of original occupiers and custodians, and cultural diversity. A preamble should reflect not just our starting point of history as a post-Federation nation of 1901 but also how we have developed and how we aspire to develop.</para><para>Those developments—the composition of our people and the development of Australia into an independent sovereign nation; probably the most fundamental of those developments over the last 97 years—should have been given a much more substantive recognition in the words of the Prime Minister. Reference to God is something I have no problem with. It is already in the constitution. I regret that to a certain extent the reference to God has been politicised over recent weeks by a Prime Minister who has chosen to do so. One can look at other constitutions and see all the things that have been important to mankind and womankind—the Prime Minister has chosen to take another course. Instead of noble words and aspirations, we have reflected in our proposed constitutional preamble the concerns and prejudices of one man over some 30 years.</para><para>That is obviously a problem for us and it is going to be a problem for the nation. It is a problem not just because it reflects the concerns of John Howard but because it reflects the concerns of a very small group of people. In doing so, what does it do? Take, for instance, the Aboriginal issue and Aboriginal 
 occupation or custodianship. We have a Prime Minister who wants us just to refer to occupation. But in doing so does he not attempt to wind back the development of the common law in this country? Does he not attempt to wind back the cases of Mabo and Wik, but particularly Mabo? That is a court judgment which he himself is on record as saying he supports. The common law of this country recognises more than just occupation. Why is it not appropriate to recognise that in the constitutional preamble?</para><para>It is no wonder that leading journalists like Paul Kelly have described this preamble as a shambles. It is also no wonder, given the other factors in the suggested preamble, that people like Paul Kelly reflect on the fact that the Prime Minister's preamble seems to `wander about like a tipsy journalist' and to delve into `issues of prejudice, fashion, ideology . . . and mateship.'</para><para>His preamble is also legally flawed. He talks about equal sovereignty of all citizens. One has got to try and work out what it means and one has got to try and work out why we put in the preamble the concept of citizenship when we do not have it in the Constitution. But, as Jack Waterford in the editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> said quite elegantly the other day, what we have got to recognise is that our Constitution basically rests sovereignty in the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives. He says:</para><para>In this Westminster model the Queen and the Parliament are sovereign, not the people.</para><para>The Prime Minister has a proposed preamble which is inconsistent with the rest of the body of the Constitution.</para><para>As I say, there is concern about the content of what has been proposed, but I think there should be another concern as well. That concern should be the small number of people who have been involved in drafting this particular preamble. They were a select few. There is the Prime Minister. There is Les Murray, who was chosen essentially, I suppose, because of his long-stated antagonism to political correctness. Let me say that Les Murray was chosen to draft a citizenship oath by the previous Labor government. He was 
 chosen by Senator Michael Tate, but it was my view when I took over the portfolio and the view of the Senate that the citizenship oath that he had recommended to government and to the parliament was inappropriate, and the Senate chose to change it. He has had one outing in this area and he was rejected.</para><para>The other person who was chosen was the Prime Minister's soul mate in matters of culture and race. That is, of course, Professor Geoffrey Blainey. You could probably not get two less inclusive people, two people less representative of the way Australia has developed over the last 50 years at least, if not the last 90, than Professor Blainey and Les Murray. When you toss in the Prime Minister as well, it is no wonder that we have a preamble which really has been laughed at across the country. We have the voices and the souls of darkness drafting the preamble for the Australian people.</para><para>When one looks at Professor Blainey's performance in the public debate over the last 15 years or so, one cannot ignore the fact that it was Blainey who in 1984 first ignited the so-called race debate. It was he who loudly agitated against Australia becoming, as he called it, Asianised. He railed against the so-called Asianisation of Australia and he argued for a racially discriminatory immigration policy. Not content with that odious contribution to our public life, Blainey kept on agitating against multiculturalism, claiming that such a policy led to a tribalisation of Australia, a cluster of tribes. It was again Blainey in 1993 who railed against the Mabo judgment, denigrating the High Court and warning of two half-nations.</para><para>Blainey has never recanted on these views. On the contrary, he continues to affirm his thinking about Asian migration and continues to contend his belief that the Native Title Act is racist legislation. It is no surprise that Blainey is the hero of the extreme right-wing fringe in Australian politics. Unfortunately for Australia, he is also the hero of this Prime Minister. That is Blainey's contribution to the debate. That, for me, rules him out as someone who is best suited to advise the government as to what an appropriate preamble 
 should be for a diverse, multicultural society like ours.</para><para>The other person is Les Murray. With respect to Murray, it is probably best to put him in the bundle that Dr Mark McKenna of the ANU put him in this morning in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. McKenna refers to Les Murray's published <inline font-style="italic">Subhuman Redneck Poems</inline> and cites a poem titled `A Brief History' where Murray rails against fashionable ideology and expresses concern about those who want to declare Australia Asian. McKenna says:</para><para>For Murray, Howard and Blainey, the real victim of the historical revisionism and political realignment of the '80s and '90s was the mythology of traditional white Australia. Howard's preamble is the ultimate article of faith for the Right of Australian politics angered by the identity politics of the Hawke-Keating era. Cast in this light, the wording of the preamble makes more sense. The days of black armband history are over—we are now "free" to be proud of our heritage.</para><para>That is what the Prime Minister says. That is what his mates say. That is what the people who drafted this preamble say. As I say, the dark voices of public debate in Australia find their channel through this Prime Minister.</para><para>What are we supposed to do? The Prime Minister said:</para><para>We refer to Aboriginals and indigenous Australians in our preamble, and we honour them for their ancient and continuing cultures.</para><para>This, he says, is what really happened; it is an historical fact that we have honoured them `for their ancient and continuing cultures'. Forget about what we have done to them in terms of stolen generations. Forget about dispossession. Forget about all the other atrocities that have been committed and continue to be committed by way of racist legislation from this government in respect of indigenous Australians. The Prime Minister says, `What we have to believe in the future is that white Australians have actually honoured indigenous Australians for their ancient and continuing culture.' Isn't that the black armband view of history? Doesn't this Prime Minister now want to entrench that black armband view of history, espoused by Professor Blainey, in our Constitution?</para><para>We have a Prime Minister who rails against political correctness. He is a Prime Minister who rails against those who believe that people should be treated with dignity and be protected against racial vilification, racial discrimination and the language and other actions of sexual discrimination. The Prime Minister rails against people who believe in political correctness as a concept to deliver a fair go and to respect decency and the dignity of individuals. This is a Prime Minister who rejects all those concepts of a fair go, dignity and decency when it comes to protecting the victims of discrimination, but it is a Prime Minister who wants to entrench his own political correctness in the Australian Constitution and arrogantly says to the rest of us, `You've got no say in it.' That is not on.</para><para>I think the Australian people, in increasing numbers, will reject this degree of arrogance by the Prime Minister. It is important for us in this place and for those in the House of Representatives to think about how we can play ourselves into the production—into the game to produce a new preamble. One concept that probably would be appropriate for us to look at in the next few weeks would be the idea of a parliamentary committee—be it a Senate committee or a joint committee—setting up and commissioning a panel of people more broadly representative than the one selected by the Prime Minister and with more inspirational views of Australia and the aspirations of Australians.</para><para>Perhaps a parliamentary committee could commission a group of people to come up with an alternative preamble. It is a much more democratic way to go and, at the end of the day, I am sure it would come up with a much better product than that of the dark minds and souls that produced this preamble. I said at the start that we support this legislation but, at the same time, we have enormous problems with the proposal that has been put up by the Prime Minister in respect of the preamble.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>3266</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If it had gotten any closer to 12.45 p.m. I would have asked whether it was worthwhile starting. However, as there are five minutes before we start on our lunchtime 
 legislation, I guess it does give me time to work up a head of steam—and I have a head of steam in relation to this legislation. The very fact that it was meant to be coughed through or asked to be considered as cough-through legislation—as non-controversial—I think is quite extraordinary. Senator Bolkus has indicated that some elements of the legislation and some elements of the move towards the referendum are obviously controversial, but I would like to add a few more.</para></talk.start><para>The Greens (WA) have been concerned about the process that has led up to this  Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 . I would reiterate that the whole element of the election of delegates to the Constitutional Convention was problematical because only half of those people were elected; the other half were appointed. It was, to a large extent, a set-up job by the government, which was hoping to get as tightly controlled a constitutional convention as possible. The system of voluntary voting was of concern to many people and was of concern to the Greens (WA). In this process, although there were many different opinions, the funding for only two very narrow lines—the no case and the minimal change case—meant that, right from the beginning, a whole range of people in the community were cut out of the process. As I said, the nomination of a proportion of the delegates was very indicative of the role the government wanted to play in trying to keep a lid on whatever outcomes there were as a result of this Constitutional Convention.</para><para>There was a lack of proper community consultation—whether it was for the preamble, whether it was for the Constitutional Convention—about how we should put it together and the process by which we should continue. The government has never thought it necessary—and, unfortunately, it is not getting a lot of gingering from the opposition—that it should at some stage go to the people of Australia, not just in a referendum, and ask, `We are actually interested in what you have to say. Why don't you write submissions?'</para><para>I have mentioned before that in Western Australia, in relation to the Commission on Government, the government went to the 
 people of Western Australia and asked, `Are you interested in issues of the Constitution?' They said yes. They held a number of different fora throughout Western Australia which were well attended. There was a lot of interest, and there were lots and lots of submissions. It was a very important process. It is still ongoing, and these kinds of things cannot happen overnight. Writing a Constitutional preamble is a nonsense—because the government insists that the preamble has no legal standing—without any concept of what the people of Australia think is important and without any concept of any changes that may happen to the Constitution itself or to what it might be in the future.</para><para>There does, in my opinion, need to be broader constitutional reform, and I refer to the work of the only elected Greens representative on the Constitutional Convention, Cath Moore. Christine Milne was also one of the selected representatives on the Constitutional Convention, and they were the two Greens representatives. At the Constitutional Convention, they both mentioned that there did need to be broader constitutional change. This was in response to a motion by the Reverend Tim Costello—and I will get to that in a moment—who wanted to look at the process for further constitutional consultation.</para><para>Christine Milne said:</para><para>I have great pleasure in seconding this motion. When I came to the Convention I expressed my disappointment that the agenda was so narrow—</para><para>as I did too when we looked at the bill in the first place. She goes on:</para><para>When you talk to people in the community—in saleyards, in church halls or wherever people are—and start asking them what becoming a republic means to them they talk about far more than just the head of state. They talk about the fact that this is a very special moment of redefinition for Australia, that it coincides, by historical convenience, if you like, with the beginning of a new millennium. It is a sign of hope for ordinary Australians that Australia's coming to a republic might also address wider issues of the Constitution, broader issues of reform, that it would address seriously the issue of granting constitutional recognition and rights to indigenous people and to all Australians. They want to talk about how people can get more involved in the political process.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Murphy)</name></talker><para>—Order!

Whilst my colleague Senator Conroy was very brief and has indicated our support, I think it is important to put on the record a little about the bounty itself so that people realise the importance of it to the industry. It is a fast-growing industry indeed, and it is one that supports a lot of Australians in jobs.</para></talk.start><para>The bounty was originally introduced back in the 1940s. In 1947 it went to 25 per cent of the construction costs of vessels; in 1975 it was on the selling price and was there to encourage the construction of vessels of less than 6,000 tonnes; in 1980 it went to a percentage of the construction costs for vessels greater than 150 tonnes and for fishing vessels greater than 21 metres. In 1988 the bounty went to two rates: 20 per cent for prescribed vessels—that is, tugs, bulk carriers and the like—and 15 per cent for others. In 1989 there was a rejigging of the bounty to 15 per cent, phasing it down to five per cent over a period of time. It was changed again in 1993, when it was extended to nine per cent for 1993-94. It was decreased to seven per cent for 1995-96 and to five per cent for 1996-97. In their first budget in August 1996, the government terminated the bounty and, of course, this brought a great deal of reaction—so much so that the government were forced to reinstate it in December 1996 at a level of five per cent. In 1997, again under further pressure, it was extended to 1999.</para><para>The reason for traversing that very quickly is the fact that it does show the importance of the bounty, and it does show that the bounty has been rejigged over a period of time to support an industry that is important to Australia and to our export earning capacity. Undoubtedly, the industry over that period of time has had its highs and lows. The bounty, though, has been essential because it has provided our industry with the capacity to have a level playing field, and of course this was the very reason for its reinstatement at the end of 1996—after pressure was exerted by the shipbuilding industry to have it continue because of the inability of the OECD to put its shipbuilding agreement in place.</para><para>Whilst we support the bill, we say that it really does not go far enough. That can be seen when you look at the industry in places like Western Australia and Tasmania. I am told that in Western Australia last year the bounty amounted to nearly $9.4 million and in Tasmania almost $9 million. In Queensland the bounty was $6.3 million and in South Australia $0.38 million. In those states and my own state of Queensland it is not as significant an amount but it is, nonetheless, very important to the industries in those states. The industry itself provides a substantial number of jobs, and I have been told that in the order of 7,000 people are currently employed in the industry alone.</para><para>The bounty has allowed innovative design and building techniques to be developed to enable us to compete on the world stage. Of course, the only problem with the removal of the bounty is the fact that the OECD shipbuilding agreement cannot be put in place. That agreement covers 80 per cent of the shipbuilding capacity throughout the world. The reason it cannot be put in place is that the US will not ratify it, hence the need for the bounty to be kept in place for Australian industry—to protect it.</para><para>The Australian shipbuilding industry needs the guarantee of a level playing field. It is interesting to note that 80 per cent to 90 per cent of bountiable ships are exported from this nation. They cover vessels such as fast ferries, luxury cruisers and yachts, many of which show the cutting edge of technology 
 and design that has been developed successfully by Australian manufacturers. They have been able to do this with the certainty and support of the bounty.</para><para>Turning to my own state of Queensland, and this is why I wanted to speak to this bill for a few moments, an announcement was made last year of a major shipbuilding precinct in the Gold Coast area, on the Coomera River. One company alone will establish its building industry there, creating 300 jobs and $20 million worth of investment and, for the totality of the precinct, it is thought there will be something in the order of 3,000 jobs. If the level playing field is not there, the fledgling industry in this area will, of course, suffer in the longer term. It may be that there is a need for the continuation of the bounty long beyond the expectations of this government to protect Australian jobs and Australian industry when we cannot secure the agreement of the OECD shipbuilding agreement on a worldwide basis.</para><para>There are currently two companies that attract the bounty in Queensland. Brisbane Ship Constructions at Bulimba benefited to the tune of $349,000 last year. They have 400 employees, and I understand they recently won a contract to make the patrol boats for Vietnam. NQEA at Cairns, whilst they are registered under the act, received no bounty last year but undoubtedly have benefited from the bounty over a period of time. The industry itself has gone from a turnover of $5 million in 1983 to a current turnover of $926 million. So one can see that it is a very important industry in terms of employment and in terms of export growth and export earnings. Whilst the government is pitching the bounty at three per cent, we believe the bounty would be better pitched at five per cent for the remaining period and beyond until the certainty has been given to the industry that the level playing field is there.</para><para>In essence, the bill is supported, as indicated by my colleague Senator Conroy. It is to be commended, and one would undoubtedly believe that, if the level playing field cannot be achieved over a longer period of time, the Australian Shipbuilders Association will continue to press for support for an industry that is successful and will provide meaningful 
 export income to this nation and meaningful jobs to people in the Australian community. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>3269</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to begin my remarks on the <inline ref="r723">Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1999</inline>  by quoting from the Department of the Parliamentary Library Information and Research Services <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>  No. 128. On page 2, they say:</para></talk.start><para>In the 1996-97 Budget, the Government announced that the bounty would be removed from 20 August 1996 and that transitional provisions would apply where contracts had been exchanged before this date or where work would be completed before this date but the bounty not claimed. Following representations from shipbuilders, the Australian Shipbuilders Association, and the Governments of Western Australia and Tasmania in particular, the former Minister for Industry, Hon John Moore announced that the bounty would be extended until 31 December 1997. He stated that while the 1996/97 Budget had sought to scrap the bounty as a cost-cutting measure, it had since become clear to the Government that the world shipbuilding industry was not a `level playing field' and that the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement was stalling. On 7 May 1997 it was announced that the Government was extending the bounty to 30 June 1999 for commitments entered into by 31 December 1997. To be eligible, vessels must be at least 50 per cent complete by 30 June 1999. Pro rata payments will apply for vessels between 50 and 100% complete. In September 1998 the Prime Minister announced that the bounty would be further extended until 31 December 2000 at a rate of 3%.</para><para>The Labor Party has stated that the shipbuilding bounty should be extended at 5 per cent indefinitely, until the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement, or a similar agreement, is ratified. They estimate that this would cost $86 million over three years to 2001-02.</para><para>That is the quote from the library. It is fine as far as it goes but, although this bill is described here as non-controversial, this issue has been one of the most controversial the Senate has faced in the time of this government. When the coalition government came into power in 1996, it embarked on some astonishingly stupid policies in the field of industry development and assistance, and this was one of them—when it sought to get rid of the bounty. I think the Library sometimes misses the point. They say:</para><para>Following representations from shipbuilders, the Australian Shipbuilders Association, and the Governments of Western Australia and Tasmania in particular, the former Minister for Industry, Hon John Moore announced that the bounty would be extended . . .</para><para>In fact, this was one of the great victories of the Senate. It was the Senate which insisted that this matter be properly reviewed. It was the Senate which held up the legislation. It was the Labor Party—in particular, Senator Cook—who did an outstanding job in terms of aggravating and activating on this issue. It was the Australian Democrats who vigorously supported the Labor Party in that activity and raised merry hell about this issue. Whilst I would not seek to underplay the contributions of those others mentioned in the Library's <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> , the Library, frankly, missed the passion and intensity of that very controversial political debate.</para><para>Underpinning this entire issue is hopefully a turnaround from the government from a policy where it sought to ideologically withdraw industry assistance from industries which are unable to compete on the world market unless they have appropriate strategic and financial assistance. This is not about protection. This is actually about being able to compete. It is about marketing and about getting our industries and our jobs up and running. Senator Hogg has just outlined some of the figures. This industry is valued at nearly $1 billion. If the government had had its way when it was in its period of stupidity in 1996, this industry would have been crushed by the economic consequences of that policy.</para><para>Yes, I do welcome the continuation; yes, the Australian Democrats do support this bill. But the Labor Party is right: the bounty should be higher and the certainty and presence of that bounty should be guaranteed for as long as the United States and the countries in Europe continue to put our shipbuilding industry at a disadvantage.</para><para>We must put this into perspective: the Senate was the victor in this issue. The Labor Party, in particular, deserves great credit for holding its ground against an ideological push by the government. The government deserves credit for eventually accepting not only the 
 reality but also the good sense of the arguments that were being put to it. And it is the Australian Democrats who continue to argue for the proper retention of tariffs, bounties or subsidies where they are appropriate for the industry concerned, where they in fact preserve Australian jobs and the competitiveness of Australian industry versus other countries who in turn are subsidising, assisting or providing bounties to their industry in that manner. You have to fight fire with fire. There is no virtue in bounties or tariffs or subsidies on their own, but there is virtue when the whole purpose and intention is to keep us competitive and keep this nation able to sell its goods and to perform appropriately on the world trade stage. Accordingly, I record not only the Australian Democrats' gratitude that the bounty continue but also our view that it should be improved further.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3270</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just want to say a few words. I do not want to go over many of the points that have been made with regard to application of the bounty and when it was introduced. It is a very important bounty in terms of my state and a shipbuilder known as Incat in Tasmania. With the greatest respect to Senator Murray and the Western Australian shipbuilders, through Incat we are leading the way in terms of fast ferry technology. Incat has just delivered its 27th fast ferry to Europe. Indeed, it has built almost 50 per cent of the high-speed passenger ferries operating around the world. It employs almost 1,000 Tasmanians. Its export value last year was around $212 million. It is very important to us; it is the state's largest employer. That is why we, as Labor senators and as opposition members, have fought very hard for the retention of this bounty.</para></talk.start><para>As Senator Murray said, it was always the intention—and the intention of Labor in government as well—that the bounty continue until the OECD agreement was ratified. That is the very important point. I think it is worth noting that since the coalition won government there has actually been a decline in the number of developments in terms of shipbuilding. The government now have a proposal not only to phase out the bounty but also 
 to link it to research and development, which will lead to a significant decline in the amount of money the shipbuilders will actually get. That is having an impact.</para><para>I agree with Senator Murray that we should be endeavouring to improve this bounty while supporting the maintenance of it. In the face of the types of assistance that are being paid to European shipbuilders, we should not be proposing a further decline in the bounty. We must maintain this very important industry. I know that a lot of it is in my state, but it is important. We should ensure that we maintain a shipbuilding industry in this country by making sure that there is, to at least some degree, a level playing field.</para><para>As I said, there has been some decline in shipbuilding but the money that was earned for this country in export dollars was almost $1 billion—it was $926 million—in the last financial year. This bill proposes to introduce what is known as the SIS which will see the bounty being paid on eligible research and development expenditure at a rate of 50 per cent for innovation expenditure, up to a total of two per cent of the eligible construction costs of a bountiable vessel. That is a significant decline compared with where we were with regard to five per cent—or, indeed, I think it is only going to be three per cent through to June 1999.</para><para>I was able to obtain some information from the Australian Shipbuilders Association that shows the investment decline that has occurred since 1996 under the coalition government. That is a very sad thing, and it is something we should look at very seriously with a view to turning it around. Like other senators, I do welcome the fact that we at least have got some half-hearted attempt to continue this bounty. I just wish that the government could see its way clear to actually improving it and enhancing the opportunities, or at least making sure that some degree of level playing field continues, for Australian shipbuilders in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>3270</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like my colleagues from the Labor Party and Senator Murray, we rise to support the <inline ref="r723">Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1999</inline> , though we do not think it goes any 
 where near far enough in having any vision for the future of shipbuilding in this country. As my other colleagues and Senator Murray have said, if it was not for the very active campaign the Labor Party and the Democrats carried out in 1996 there would be no ship bounty. The ship industry—especially fast ships—as we know it in Australia would have probably been destroyed or reduced to an inconsequential level by a bumbling, incompetent government in 1996 who did not understand the needs of the shipbuilding industry. At the time, the Australian Shipbuilders Association expressed their horror at the way they were being treated by a government that did not have any understanding.</para></talk.start><para>In government—and I was the minister responsible for shipbuilding for two years in the Keating government—we made it clear that we would agree to phase out the bounty once everybody else in the OECD had signed off on getting rid of all their subsidies so that there would be a so-called level playing field. This government wanted to get rid of the ship bounty without the commitment from other countries. We would have been shooting off one leg—not just a foot but a whole leg and half of the body—of the Australian shipbuilding industry by that naive attitude taken by the then minister, Mr Moore. What we have to understand is not just the bounties and tariffs that other countries have to assist their shipbuilding; it is the non-tariff support mechanisms they put in place.</para><para>I led a shipbuilding delegation to Japan in 1995 and discovered it was not an issue of bounties or tariffs that was making it difficult for our shipbuilders to sell fast ferries into Japan—even though they were better quality, cheaper and technologically more advanced than anything built in Japan—but that the Japanese bureaucracy were going to make it absolutely impossible to have any proper penetration of the Japanese market. That was made clear to us. Under licences and so-called safety regulations and design regulations, it was going to be impossible for us to sell into a market that potentially has the need for 3,000 ferries operating around the coast of Japan and the inland sea. It was clear to me that you would never remove our assistance 
 until a market like Japan demonstrably and genuinely opened up its passenger ferry business to genuine competition.</para><para>They told us, `You can actually, as a foreigner, apply to get concessional funding for a ferry that is going to be built overseas but purchased by a Japanese ferry operator.' It turned out that, no matter how many applications were put in, no-one ever got access to that money. Informally we were told that the bureaucrats made it clear: they saw it as their duty never to grant an overseas ferry builder access to those concessional funds. This was although it was said under the rules internationally, `This is open; this is transparent.' But the bureaucrat made sure you never got it.</para><para>It was the same on design. I give this example: Austral Ships did crack one ferry sale in 1994-95 from Western Australia into Japan. They had to pay to have a Japanese safety expert from their marine department on the site in Western Australia, from the very first bolt or weld that was done until when the ship was delivered, so that all the so-called safety and design rules for Japan could be met under the so-called guarantee to consumers and ferry users in Japan that they were getting a safe ferry. It had already been demonstrated around the world that our ferries were the best, the safest, the most technologically advanced and the most comfortable for passengers. So that condition was met at considerable extra expense.</para><para>When the ferry was about to be delivered to Japan, guess what happened? It had to be completely resurveyed before it went to Japan and when it got to Japan. This was an additional cost. After it was built there was a risk that a Japanese official could then say, `We find this unsafe. You can't deliver it to Japan.' This makes trying to get into the Japanese market a very risky business. These are the non-tariff measures that you have to beat in the shipbuilding industry worldwide. This is something that we understood. We were not going to remove the bounty until these things were opened up. When it was explained to the then Minister Moore, it was beyond his comprehension.

They will clean us up. In the example I gave, as a minister leading a shipbuilding delegation to Japan, it was clear to me that there are 50 other devices countries will use to stop us getting into their markets and to protect their own. Until all of those non-tariff, non-bounty issues are dealt with, Australia must continue to support industry through bounties and to have an active interventionist government willing to do its bit to support this industry that employs several thousand people and earns, as Senator Hogg said, close to $1 billion a year in export earnings.</para><para>Unfortunately, this government has never woken up to the fact that if you want to get the current account deficit down in this country on the trade side, you have to support high value added industry such as our shipbuilding industry.

The bill arose out of a number of issues raised by Labor Party senators in Senate estimates over the past 12 to 18 months. They drew attention to the fact that a number of companies had been serious 
 ly disadvantaged by the rigid application of the then terms of the bill to a number of companies. One stark example that we had before us was a particular company which had sent its application for a tax concession to the tax office and that application laid in the tax office for four or five months before it was discovered and passed on to the Department of Industry, Science and Technology, as it then was. These types of absurdities, at the end of the day, prevented six companies from being considered for the tax concession by the Industrial Research and Development Board. I welcome this bill and the fact that these companies will now be able to have their applications considered by the board. I just hope that the proposals from these companies are still around and that they warrant consideration and the granting by the board of their concessions.</para></talk.start><para>I also draw attention to the comments in the explanatory memorandum. In the first paragraph it says that the bill is aimed at reducing the compliance cost for companies. When I was travelling around the country over the past six months or so for a Senate inquiry, the question of the R&amp;D START program was raised on a number of occasions by representatives of some companies who gave evidence to the inquiry. They said that they had not bothered applying for R&amp;D under the current program because of the rigid, restrictive and very complex administrative provisions that are applied to that program. So, hopefully, the reduction of the compliance cost for companies will open up the opportunity, particularly for small companies, to get access to R&amp;D, because R&amp;D is a critical issue in terms of the development of our industrial base.</para><para>We have been trying to promote innovation amongst Australian companies for a considerable time. Over the years, there have been a variety of programs put in place by various successive governments to try to encourage investment in R&amp;D by Australian companies. The reality is that, in the last financial year, we have seen our expenditure on the R&amp;D START program underspent by $50 million. We have also seen that, in terms of the ABS statistics for the year 1996-97, business 
 expenditure on research and development fell by five per cent on the previous year.</para><para>Whilst we advocate and praise and encourage innovation, what we are seeing is a fall off in the overall expenditure in R&amp;D by companies in this country. It was argued at the last Senate estimates committee hearing that this was partly because of the huge blow-out that occurred under the scheme introduced by the previous government. This indicates a change in the level of out-take was taking place. I suppose we will have to wait and see at the outcome of the budget whether or not that is factual or whether there is a continuing trend in the reduction of expenditure on R&amp;D in this country. There is certainly a lot of anecdotal evidence around to suggest that companies are not spending anywhere near what they were previously on R&amp;D programs within their corporations. It is a continuing concern to ensure that we are continuously monitoring what is occurring in that area and have the continuous ability to finetune government programs to ensure that R&amp;D expenditure is maximised on behalf of companies in this country and, more importantly, to ensure that we get the sorts of innovations and developments that will allow our industries to grow and to be competitive and successful in the international marketplace.</para><para>The second issue I want to briefly address is R&amp;D funds themselves. As a result of the Ralph review of business taxation, there has been a lot of speculation in the media in the past two or three weeks that R&amp;D expenditure could be traded off against a 30 per cent company tax. It has been mentioned in a number of articles in newspapers in recent weeks. One in particular was in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of 22 March 1999 and it said:</para><para>Mr Ralph said the R&amp;D incentive, which allows companies to claim 125 per cent of their R&amp;D expenditure as a tax deduction, could be sacrificed along with accelerated depreciation.</para><para>"It's certainly part of the tax incentives and it could go either way," Mr Ralph said at a public seminar in Sydney on Friday.</para><para>I want to raise that issue, because I attended the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association dinner last night at which the minister for industry was the guest speaker. I understood him to say that that was off the 
 agenda and that there would be no trade-off of R&amp;D expenditure in respect of anything that comes out of the Ralph review of business taxation. I wanted to put that on the record because, if that is not what the minister said, if that is the wrong interpretation of what he said, I invite him to come into this chamber and tell the Australian people that that is the case.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Or tell Mr Costello.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—Or tell Mr Costello. I certainly understood him to say and to make it clear that that was not on the agenda, that there would be no trade-off of funds available for R&amp;D investment expenditure against a lower company tax rate. If that is the case, I think we have to welcome that statement.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I said in my initial remarks, this bill that we have before us is supported by the Australian Labor Party. It does address what were very blatant administrative restrictions in the bill that worked to the disadvantage of a number of companies. Hopefully, the bill will now institute provisions that will allow those companies applications to be properly addressed by the IR&amp;D board. As I said, hopefully those companies are still around and will be able to take advantage of the new provisions that will be provided for by this amendment bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>3274</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will support the <inline ref="r673">Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1998</inline>  but we, too, wish to use this opportunity to briefly make some remarks about research and development. As I have already mentioned, 1996 was a very stupid year for industry policy, and research and development was particularly targeted in that era of stupidity. I recall in an estimates session asking the secretary concerned whether they had done a cost-benefit analysis as to what the effect of their changes to research and development would be. The answer was that no, they had not. So I asked, `When would you expect to see what the effects of those changes would be?' and the answer was, `In about three years time.'</para></talk.start><para>Here we are, three years later, and the effect of that stupid policy decision is that our 
 research and development has declined. Our world ranking position within the OECD has dropped. It never was all that high, I might say, but under the policies that were prevailing at the time it was being lifted and it was improving, and we were going up the rankings, which is where we should be as a country.</para><para>What they have done is reverse a progressive direction which was in the interest of Australia and I, for one, regret that enormously. One of the major issues at that time was reducing a general industry facilitator, which was the R&amp;D tax concession, from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, and they took that action without regard to the consequences. I asked the question, `Have you done a cost benefit analysis?' They said, `No, we just know how much it costs us, and this is how much we are going to take out of the budget.' But they had absolutely no idea about how much it actually gives back to the community, to industry, to the economy, to the wealth of Australia and to jobs. We had an idea, and we were right because three years later we can see the figures.	There is a clear lesson that when you combine ideology with inexperience and rank obstinate stupidity, the consequences for people are the loss of jobs, the loss of competitiveness and the loss of a market position for the manufacturing industry, in particular, which is to be greatly regretted.</para><para>Having got that off my chest, let me return to the bill at hand. The people who write to parliamentarians play a great role in provoking thought on issues to which we might not otherwise be alerted. All senators know that the number of representations you get can encourage you to decide whether a bill is non-controversial or not. We were undecided on this bill. We did, in fact, get only one communication that I can recall, and in the end we were undecided about that communication. But I want to put it on record—I notice that the advisers to the minister are present, and they should pay heed to it—because, if this person was right, it needs to be corrected; if they were not right, then it does not need to be corrected, but we will keep an eye on it.</para><para>I will give you a summary of what was said. They said that the apparently innocent provision—which is actually item 22—of the Industry Research and Development Board in relation to the exploitation of the results of R&amp;D projects could have serious ramifications. They state:</para><para>Previously, the Board had the power to issue certificates stating that the results of R&amp;D activities had been exploited `otherwise than in a manner that is for the benefit of the Australian economy'. As would be expected, the effect of such a certificate is to disallow all claims for the R&amp;D activities, whether undertaken before or after the certificate is issued. Clause 22 of the bill will add to this power by allowing the Board to issue the certificate if:</para><para>"It would have been reasonable to expect that there has been some exploitation, after the commencement of this paragraph, of the results of those research and development activities but no such exploitation has occurred."</para><para>They go on:</para><para>There are two major problems with this.</para><para>1. It is effectively retrospective because it applies to R&amp;D projects which may have started a number of years ago under a different set of rules. The only time limit is that the reasonable expectation must arise after the Bill is passed—the power is not restricted to activities which commence after the Bill is passed.</para><para>It is very clear that this provision is aimed squarely at R&amp;D syndicates. Whatever your view may be on syndicate investors, they should be entitled to have their R&amp;D projects reviewed under the provisions that were in effect when the syndicate transactions were entered into.</para><para>2. The second problem is that the provision is not restricted to syndicates. It is a broadly stated, discretionary power that strikes at the market driven nature of the concession. The IR&amp;D Board will have the power to second-guess companies about whether particular results should be exploited, and how and when they should be exploited. It will be the board that determines if the R&amp;D is successful, when it is reasonable to expect exploitation, and to some extent what form of exploitation is sufficient.</para><para>Many companies conduct a range of R&amp;D activities with the same basic aim, and choose to exploit the one (if there is the one) which is the most successful and the most economically advantageous. This is something we should be encouraging, not discouraging.</para><para>The proposed new provision can only add further uncertainty to the R&amp;D tax concession. The existing power to disallow claims if the results 
 have been exploited in a manner that is not to the benefit of the Australian economy is more than adequate and should not be extended in a manner that gives the Board power to dictate to companies what they should do with R&amp;D results.</para><para>I have deliberately read that to you as they presented it to me, because it appeared to be a fairly cogent expression of their opinion. I will say, particularly to the advisers to the minister, that, frankly, the Australian Democrats were undecided about this and whether there was a real issue to hand, and I would appreciate it from our side if you could keep an eye on it and advise us in due course if in fact these kinds of problems emerge—and you would obviously do that through your representative minister. Accordingly, the Australian Democrats will support the bill in full.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>3276</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition, as Senator George Campbell has already indicated, will support the <inline ref="r673">Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1998</inline> , and we note that the Democrats are supporting it.

There are people out there who are abusing it, and it is not creating any impetus for Australian industry.' Mr Costello and the industry minister fell for the three-card trick and dropped it to 125 per cent. I understand that at one stage it was probably going to be knocked off completely, but someone had enough sense to say that that might be bit much. Industry complained bitterly when they got whiff of it, so it went to 125 per cent.</para><para>I have no doubt that, in the budget coming up in a month's time—in the first year of a new government after it has been re-elected—Treasury will put up as a savings option to the government knocking off the remaining 125 per cent of the tax deduction.

It is very simple.

We manufacture low value added commodities.</para><para>All the countries of the Western world of any consequence in the OECD have trade surplus because they export high value added manufactures and services. That is the lesson. And how do they develop high value added manufactures and services? They have an absolute commitment to put R&amp;D up front, both in the public and the private sector. They realise that, out of that R&amp;D, you get the innovation, the ideas and the new products that the rest of the world is willing to buy at a very high price because they are the best products available.</para><para>But, no, not our Treasury; they never accept this view—not our Treasury officials and not our finance department officials.

They see this as a legitimate approach to encourage innovative R&amp;D in their countries. We would hope that in this coming battle—as I suspect it will be—the Treasury again hopefully will be defeated.

The opposition is relaxed about four of the changes proposed. However, we have an amendment to the fifth change that we understand the government will not oppose. There are some matters that do need to be put on the record, and I will be as brief as possible.</para></talk.start><para>The first change I wish to mention extends the regulatory mechanism for activities around airports to include non-structural activities that may intrude into airport operations. The existing mechanism is designed to ensure that developments around airports do not affect safety, efficiency or the regularity of aviation operations.</para><para>The amendment provided by this bill will broaden the definition of controlled activities to include non-structural activities such as operating lights that are capable of interfering with aviation or operating equipment, or a facility which reflects light that may interfere with aviation; any activity resulting in air turbulence that could affect normal flight; and any activity emitting smoke, dust or gas that affects the ability of an aircraft operating under visual flight rules. The bill does not interfere with ordinary or domestic activities. It also gives the Commonwealth the power to make regulations setting out the standards for activities covered by the broadened definition.</para><para>The second change I will cover, and which the Labor Party supports, clarifies the situation regarding the excision of land from an 
 airport site. If excision takes place there will be no requirement to surrender the entire airport lease. Airport owners, we understand, have requested this amendment in order to allow the acquisition of minor parcels of land or the disposal of land on the boundaries of airports.</para><para>The third change clarifies the act to make it clear that it does not apply to military air operations at airports that are jointly used by civil and military operators. The fourth change that Labor supports makes it clear that the granting of rights to use land on a leased property, such as an easement, does not constitute an acquisition of an airport lease. Thus, the first amendment is a sensible broadening of the scope of the application of the act to ensure the maintenance of safety in aviation, and the next three are designed to clarify issues in the principal act.</para><para>The fifth change relates to an extension of time for phase 2 airport owners to have access undertakings to airport services approved by the ACCC. The current act gives airport owners 12 months to negotiate access arrangements with airport users. The following services are covered: firstly, services that are necessary for the purposes of operating and/or maintaining civil aviation services at the airport; secondly, services provided by means of significant facilities at the airport, being facilities that cannot be economically duplicated.</para><para>The ACCC has identified the following groups of services that meet both these criteria. They are: airport facilities, including aircraft movement, areas such as runways, taxiways, aircraft parking areas, safety devices, lighting and vehicle access to these facilities; passenger processing areas, including departure and holding lounges, immigration and customs service areas, check-in desks and baggage handling; sites for providing refuelling facilities; ground service and freight equipment storage sites; light and emergency maintenance facilities; and land side vehicle access but not car rental facilities or car parks. The ACCC said it was unlikely the following services met both criteria: administrative office space; flight catering facilities; commercial and retail facilities; cargo terminal 
 facilities; waste disposal facilities; and heavy and planned maintenance facilities.</para><para>Airport operators can submit access undertakings for qualifying services to the ACCC. This must specify the terms on which airport services will be made available to airlines and other users of airport services, or the undertaking must establish a process for negotiation of terms and conditions to access including dispute resolution procedures. The ACCC is required to conduct public consultation before the undertakings for access are approved.</para><para>The aim of this mechanism is apparently to:</para><para>provide a means by which the owner or operator of a facility can obtain certainty about access arrangements before a third party seeks access.</para><para>That is from the second reading speech accompanying the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995. If the ACCC has not approved an undertaking within the time period of 12 months, a ministerial determination is made that subsection 192(2) of the Airports Act applies at the airport. When the act is declared to apply, any airport service for which an access undertaking has not been approved by the ACCC will be declared for the purposes of part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The latter act provides a comprehensive access regime.</para><para>Under the Trade Practices Act, current airport users and potential airport users have the right to negotiate terms and conditions of access with the airport operator first and, if negotiations prove to be unsuccessful, there is the opportunity for the matter to be arbitrated by the ACCC. Aircraft owners prefer access undertakings to declared services because undertakings set out the `generic' basis for provision of services, whereas declared services give airport users the right to request and negotiate specific terms and conditions of access and have disputes arbitrated by the ACCC. As I indicated, the current act gives airport owners the time period of 12 months. In the bill we have before us, it is proposed that this time be extended to 24 months.</para><para>The opposition does not agree to the government's original proposal to grant all airport owners a 12-month extension. Therefore, we oppose schedule 1, item 1, page 3, 
 lines 5 and 6, and schedule 1, item 17, page 7, lines 6 and 7. We also propose that at schedule 1, item 18, lines 8 and 9 be omitted and the words as circulated in the chamber be substituted. The effect of this amendment will be that airport owners can seek a one-off 12-month extension of the period during which an access undertaking may be lodged with the ACCC by applying to the ACCC for such an extension. This is a more satisfactory method, in our view, of dealing with the issues before us. We believe that airport owners should apply and justify their application rather than simply benefit from a blanket extension. The amendment is a reasonable compromise for the interests of both owners and users.</para><para>I would like to thank the government and the other parties for their support of this amendment and for recognising that the blanket extension was not the best path to go down. I commend the amendments to the Senate and, given my understanding that they will be passed, I commend the amended bill to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>3279</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I simply record, on behalf of Senator Woodley, the transport spokesperson, that the Australian Democrats support the Labor amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>3279</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased that both the opposition and the Democrats support the bill.

We welcome the bill and the many beneficial measures that are contained in it. Carers provide an unstinting and highly valuable role in our society, often at great personal and economic cost. It is important that the parliament and Australia generally recognises their contribution and provides as much assistance as we can to their efforts. It has been estimated that up to $16 billion is saved per year by the unfunded efforts of carers.</para></talk.start><para>Madam Acting Deputy President, I am not keen to hold up this bill. I am very keen for it to be passed today. But I do want to put on record our concern that the adult disability assessment tool that is at the centre of a lot of the measures contained in the bill is not yet available. The opposition is concerned that we have not been able to see that assessment tool. As Mr Swan, the member for Lilley, made the point in the House of Representatives the other day, we are quite nervous about agreeing to this bill without the ability to assess that assessment tool.</para><para>We do, however, understand it is a disallowable instrument but, of course, that is a very blunt measure for the Senate to use to respond to concerns about an issue such as this. We would urge the government to ensure that there is proper consultation and negotiation with interested parties before that adult disability assessment tool is finalised, so that we are not faced with a disallowance type debate in the Senate, but rather we have a tool that, I think, everyone can agree to support.</para><para>Our concern about this is based on the growing concern about the child disability assessment tool, particularly in its treatment of cystic fibrosis sufferers. I do not want to delay the Senate but I congratulate Mr Sid Sidebottom, the member for Braddon, for his 
 advocacy on behalf of these groups and note that the opposition will continue to advocate their concerns with that particular assessment tool.</para><para>I would like to have had more time today, but I think it is important that we carry the bill. So I will conclude my remarks and indicate that we will be supporting the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>3280</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Likewise I will attempt to keep my comments brief and the brevity of them in no way reflects on the importance of this matter. The Democrats believe that the role of carers is an essential one in the Australian community, both in a social sense, of course, and in an economic sense.</para></talk.start><para>As Senator Evans indicated, carers save the taxpayer an enormous amount of money in performing a role that would otherwise have to be performed by organisations in a more commercial sense—whether that is government organisations or private organisations—and almost inevitably involving significant extra government expense as opposed to the cost of caring for people usually in the home. For that, as well, of course, for the social role that they play, carers need to be acknowledged in very positive terms.</para><para>The Democrats also share similar concerns to those expressed by the previous speaker in terms of the non-finalisation of the adult disability assessment tool. It is a problem that unfortunately does arise not infrequently. Legislation which has a delegated instrument hanging off it that is not available at the time the legislation is passed, in effect means that the parliament is, to a degree, passing legislation that it is not able to ascertain the full impact of. That obviously is not an ideal situation. Delegated legislation and disallowable instruments are fairly blunt instruments in terms of parliamentary scrutiny and amendment and are, of course, becoming far more frequent these days than they used to be. Nonetheless, we do recognise that overall the bill will be introducing a number of positive measures and obviously we will be looking at the disability assessment tool closely when it does become available.</para><para>I would like to mention another issue briefly. My understanding is that one of the 
 other amendments that this act makes will impact on a small number of parenting payment recipients and prevent a sole parent from qualifying for a parenting payment on the basis that they are receiving a child disability allowance for a child who is over 16 years of age.</para><para>That will obviously impact on some people who will have to apply for a different payment such as the Newstart allowance, which is paid at a lower rate and has a tighter income and assets test. Whilst we would not want to hold up the bill solely because of that measure, I do express the Democrats' concern about the impact that that will have. I think it is an example of the growing problem of the increasing gap between the level of payment for allowances and the level of payment available to pensions—not just the payment level but also the various conditions, income tests, et cetera, that attach to it.</para><para>The gap is there and it is potentially getting worse. The old rationale for the differentiation between pensions and allowances—or what used to be called benefits—that one was a permanent payment and the other was a temporary one we would all acknowledge has become much less clear in recent times, with long-term employment rates being much higher than any of us would like as well as people being on other allowances potentially for longer periods of time. That gap between pension levels and allowance levels is one that the Democrats believe does need closer attention, not just at payment levels but perhaps even more importantly in terms of income test changes, taper rates, et cetera.</para><para>I do express our concern about that. I am not sure precisely how many people will be affected by that measure, but obviously any measure that does potentially impact on people's basic level of income support is one that the Democrats are concerned about. Nonetheless, as I said, it is broadly a positive bill and it would be desirable to ensure that the positive measures contained within it are put through. I shall cease my remarks there.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>3281</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r727">Assistance for Carers Legislation

Senator Evans raised the issue of the adult disability tool, and I have been advised that the development of that tool has been discussed very broadly with the shadow minister and other senators who have been interested. But I have also been advised that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel will not accept orders for the drafting of the tool until the passage of this bill. I have been advised that Senator Newman has made a commitment that after a year of operation that tool will be reviewed.</para></talk.start><para>Regarding the other issue that Senator Bartlett raised, there is a small group of single parents who can qualify for parenting payment on the basis of having a student CDA child. This is a very small group, and it is expected that most of them will be transferred to more appropriate payments by 1 July 1999.

It is true that the new tax system that we are seeking to introduce in this country will give back to Australian taxpayers $13 billion in taxation reductions, and it is not surprising that the Labor Party opposes tax cuts of $13 billion to the Australian people. Why is it not surprising? Because they have form on this issue. Labor stands for high taxes; the coalition stands for lower taxes. Labor in government promises tax cuts but does not deliver. No Australian will forget what happened to the l-a-w tax cuts promised by the Labor government. They were never delivered.

Senator Kemp's total failure in that area is obvious to everyone in the industry and the media and there is no need to address that issue, but Senator Kemp totally failed to adequately answer the questions relating to the black economy.</para><para>One of the constantly touted themes of the Liberal government in respect of a goods and services tax is that it will crack down on the black economy. Senator Kemp said, `One of the ways to tackle the cash economy is to tackle tax reform.' Of course, we all know what that means: the introduction of a goods and services tax.</para><para>The question from my colleague Senator Bishop went specifically to the problems in the housing construction industry in New Zealand and Canada, where after the introduction of their goods and services taxes there was  significant evasion—in fact, a significant increase in the black economy as a result of the equivalent of a goods and services tax.</para><para>Why does this happen? The great problem in the housing industry and other industries as well is that the goods and services tax is a tax primarily on the labour content of that service provision. In the housing industry, the considerable majority of the price that is charged relates to the cost of labour, and this is the area where all the evidence internationally points to the most significant level of evasion of a goods and services tax.</para><para>Mr Damien Walshe, who is a partner of Arthur Andersen, referred to `evasion with a GST VAT, especially in a labour-intensive job'. He said:</para><para>When you have relatively low levels of goods being inputed to a service provision, the opportunity for the service provider not to declare income is where the real problem lies.</para><para>And this is one of the problems with a GST, and in particular with the housing industry. A study in Canada by the Ontario state government found that their GST led to `widespread participation in the underground economy', causing lost revenue of $Can2.3 billion. So the central argument advanced by this government, that a GST will crack down and reduce the black economy, is false. There is no evidence that that is the case, and in fact there is evidence to the contrary from Canada, New Zealand, Europe and the United Kingdom that the black market, as it is known, will increase.</para><para>There was an interesting article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> of August 1998. The Henley Centre, a consumer consultancy which interviewed 1,000 adults, carried out what is called a sensitivity sample, and they found that Britain's black economy is booming. This was also confirmed by European Union economists, who estimated that the black economy in Europe—bearing in mind that every country in Europe has a VAT or a GST of varying levels—was expanding and could 
 now account for 16 per cent of the European Union's gross domestic product.</para><para>In respect of question 6, there are some effective ways at present under the Tax Administration Act of 1953 to identify people who are engaged in the black economy, and this section will be used in respect of the implementation of a goods and services tax. Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, said very firmly:</para><para>The answer is yes. They will be used appropriately. We have section 8U of the Tax Act of 1953 to crack down on the black economy.</para><para>Then, what do we hear from the Treasurer, Mr Costello, on Triple J radio last Thursday? He advised a young person who rang in and who was working cash-in-hand to effectively ignore that section of the tax act. The Treasurer is telling the nation, `We are going to crack down on the black economy,' but he effectively advised the person who rang in not to worry about it—not to worry about section 8U of the tax act. So what hope have we got, if a GST comes in, of effectively cracking down on the black economy? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3296</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Sherry gives the game away when he commences his answer and says, `Tax reform means the introduction of a GST.' Senator Schacht in his question referred to a submission to the GST inquiry, and that is where the Labor Party has got it totally wrong.

The black economy is one of those areas where this government is totally committed. So the sooner the Labor Party, in all their discussions about what is happening in relation to tax reform, of which one part is the introduction of a GST, come to their senses and realise that what we are introducing is a total overhaul of the taxation system for the benefit of 
 the nation, perhaps the arguments they are trying to put forward might appear to be more sound to those people who are trying to promote them.</para><para>We have done an enormous amount in the last three years in making sure that people who are cheating the system, who are avoiding the system, are in fact being caught. The social security system is just one area. Something like $40 million a week, I think, is being saved from social security fraud alone. So do not say that this government is soft on tax minimisation and tax avoidance because it has done all it can in those three years to make sure that people who are not paying their proper dues by way of taxation will have to in the future.</para><para>Some of the actions that have already been implemented are, for instance, the closing of the abuse of the research and development tax concession. We got tremendous opposition from the Labor Party when we were trying to make changes in the area of R&amp;D, but in fact we closed the research and development tax concession syndication arrangement because they had been focused on tax minimisation rather than on genuine research and development, and so the definition of a concession was also tightened.</para><para>So do not talk about this government going soft on tax minimisation or tax avoidance.

So don't you talk about this government being soft on tax minimisation or other measures of tax avoidance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are a number of measures that are currently in place, including things like 
 extending the general anti-avoidance provisions of the taxation system to combat withholding tax avoidance, to prevent the trafficking in trust losses. There was no mention or any credit from the opposition about the measures this government has taken in order to try to catch people who are not paying their fair share of taxation. All we have is people like Senator Sherry coming in here and saying, `We have some reports of the black economy in other countries of the world increasing with the introduction of a goods and services tax.' Let me tell you: goods and services taxes has been in place in many of those countries for in excess of 30 years, and many in excess of 25 years.</para><para>If you would like to go through the list of all of those countries, you will find that there are very few countries that will complain that the black economy is greater after you have a goods and services tax. There is a whole range of other measures and a whole range of other reasons as to why people will try to avoid tax through the black economy. But, as I said, do not let the Labor Party talk about this government being soft on tax avoidance because, ever since we came to government, we have tried to close some of those loopholes which the Labor Party left in place for a period of 13 years without trying to do anything to close them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>3297</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I heard that they had missed out presenting one of the awards at the academy awards process earlier this week.

There was no response from the Treasurer on the radio on the one hand which would indicate there is any seriousness about the issue, and there is no way that you could interpret Senator Kemp's non-answer as the answer of a minister who takes seriously the question of dealing with the black economy.</para><para>Frankly, what you would have to say about this government, and the Prime Minister in particular, is that over the years there has been no consistent pursuit of an enforcement of the tax system. This Prime Minister, in fact, was responsible in his previous period as Treasurer under the Fraser government for leaving massive tax avoidance schemes in place for years—hundreds of millions of dollars of tax revenue was being lost—and now we have seen him dragged kicking and screaming into the tax reform process. But what does he say is the solution? A GST.</para><para>We heard Senator Ferguson today say that the GST is somehow the solution to the black economy. He talked about the countries, particularly in Europe, that have a goods and services type tax and how that was somehow going to be the solution to the black economy.

Today we saw Senator Kemp completely disregard comments from organisations like the Housing Industry Association of Australia—who I think have some reputation in relation to their public policy statements—who are saying that the GST will in fact increase the black economy in the home construction industry. I suggest that the Australian public—judging on the performance of this minister today—are much more likely to believe reputable organisations such as the Housing Industry Association of Australia on the question of what this GST is going to do to the black economy than they are this minister, Senator Kemp, or certainly the Treasurer, Mr Costello, who show a total disregard for the application of the laws of this parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>3298</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name><name.id>BX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on this matter of taxation and the questions that were asked in the Senate here today. I agree with my colleague Senator Ferguson that the Labor Party is obsessed with the GST and is avoiding the fact that we have put a total package before the Australian community—our new tax system. Why is the Labor Party avoiding everything else? Because it wants to avoid talking about the fact that people are going to get substantial income tax cuts—$13 billion of income tax cuts.</para></talk.start><para>Why is the government doing this? The government is doing this because it identified—in fact I chaired a committee that looked at this last year and part of the year before—that one of the key impediments in the Australian economy for ordinary folk was that the marginal tax rates were too high. This applies to lots of people and lots of small businesses. Marginal tax rates were just too high and people would not do the overtime, they would not work at weekends and they 
 did not want to do the extra yards. Hence our proposal to reduce the marginal tax rates so that, with our new tax scales, 80 per cent of taxpayers will face a marginal tax rate of 30 cents in the dollar—a huge difference from the 43c and 34c which currently applies in those rates.</para><para>But again I return to the Labor Party.

As the budget documents make plain, the federal indirect tax take of the economy is coming down. Estimates prepared by Access Economics clearly show that the average for federal indirect taxes for the last 10 years has been 5.64 per cent, coming down from about 6½ per cent about 10 years ago. Access Economics have done projections of the economy for the next 10 years. Their estimate is that, with those existing tax rates, the federal income tax take of indirect taxes will drop to 4.8 per cent—so 5.64 per cent down to 4.8 per cent—which leaves a deficiency in dollar terms of over $5 billion. That $5 billion is one-third of the wholesale sales tax of about $15 billion. So the Labor Party, by implication, is in favour of increasing wholesale sales taxes by 30 per cent—by one-third. We all remember what happened in the 1993-94 budget when the Labor Party put up taxes—both excise and indirect taxes with the wholesale sales tax—and increased the tax take from the Australian community by 30 per cent over those Keating years.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We are in favour of tax reform which gives incentive to people to work, to save and to invest.

 revenue from the wholesale sales tax was something in the order of 9.1 per cent.</para></talk.start><para>Having addressed that point, what do we know about the black economy in Australia? We know it is variously estimated at being around $15 billion, $18 billion, or indeed up to $20 billion. We know the tax take of a GST on a revenue flow of figures of that type would be something around $1.5 to $2 billion. We know that because various officials from the Australian Taxation Office have advised the Senate committee of that in recent weeks.</para><para>We also know that any government take from the GST on the black economy is at best speculative. The government has suggested somewhere between $1½ billion and $2 billion, but that is at best problematic. It may be higher, but in all probability it may be significantly lower. What do we know about current changes that are working their way through the Australian economy? We know that there is an orgy of privatisation going on—outsourcing and deregulation. We know that there is a shift in the employment base of this nation from direct employment to contractors and self-employed persons. We know that a whole lot of industry sectors are moving, or have moved, to contract employment and in particular, self-employment. Examples of those are the home building industry, construction and subconstruction, personal service industries, taxi driving, chauffeur hire, limousine driving and a range of professional employment practices—lawyers, accountants, consultants and architects, to name a few.</para><para>We know that in all of those industries the tax at the moment on labour is currently optional and increasingly regarded as more and more optional by a range of persons working within those industries. Indeed, Dr Silberberg, from the Housing Industry Association, told the Senate committee:</para><para>We attribute the incidence of the black economy in the building area to the so-called owner-builder sector, where there are less than scrupulous players who seek to circumvent particularly the requirements of state legislation, such as builder registration and compulsory home warranty, and who flirt with householders for householders to take out a building permit. That is not to say that there is not a segment of the population which genuinely is owner building. 
</para><para>He went on to say:</para><para>It is going to be exceptionally difficult for anyone to avoid a GST on building materials. They are readily visible . . . Our contention is that there is a significant incentive for people to operate outside of the GST by having no GST on their own labour or labour services.</para><para>Another industry talks about incentives to avoid the GST. I refer here to the Australian Taxi Industry Association. During questioning from Senator Bartlett, Mr Gunning from that organisation talked about the nature of the taxi industry—how it is organised, how the remittance process has been put in place, how there are 70,000 people employed in driving taxis around Australia. He addressed the necessity to license each individual cab driver, not just the owner. He said:</para><para>We, obviously, as a national association, have worried about our standing in the community, essentially, partly because of the experience that you referred to earlier with tax compliance. We know that at least late last year some problems started to emerge in New Zealand in a way that was not expected by the authorities. To summarise it, some taxidrivers managed to position themselves so that they could opt out. So we have potentially a situation in New Zealand at the moment where customers are paying GST but definitionally that GST is not being past on to the tax office. We think that would be a fairly debilitating thing to happen in our industry, not the sort of image we would like to project and not the sort of image that really encourages the kind of professionalism we are looking for.</para><para>There you have the Taxi Industry Association—employing something in the order of 70,000 drivers around Australia—saying that they have been to New Zealand and their observations are that even if the GST is charged in that country, the taxidrivers are not remitting that on to the New Zealand government. So the submissions and the evidence specifically addressed the black economy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>3300</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This week the opposition really is becoming a cracked record. For the fourth day in a row we have heard them focusing questions on the GST. They have not laid one blow on the government or on the Assistant Treasurer in their attempts to do so. Today what have we heard them raise? The issue of the black or the cash economy. Again, by 
 focusing on the GST they are ignoring, as Senator Ferguson said, the fact that we are for total tax reform. We are introducing a new tax system, not just changing one tax.</para></talk.start><para>Senator O'Brien quoted an Austrian professor regarding the extent of the cash economy in some European countries. Well, come in spinner! Certainly those countries have a GST as part of their tax system but they do not have a world's best practice tax system and they do not have a world's best practice GST as will be part of the new tax system that this government is introducing. We are introducing a world's best practice tax system. In particular, those European countries applied differential rates and exemptions to food items. That is, of course, what some people and groups in Australia—drawing succour from the Labor Party's opposition to tax reform—want to have as part of our tax system. They want food exempted from the GST.</para><para>I remind the Senate that only yesterday none other than Mr Carmody, the Australian Commissioner for Taxation, emphasised the folly of eliminating food from the GST—of zero rating food. Mr Carmody is an expert in tax collection. He is an expert in dealing with compliance and with tax avoidance. He said only yesterday that not having a GST on food would be an absolute disaster; indeed, that eliminating a GST on food would result in widespread tax avoidance. That is why the black economy remains significant in those European countries that Senator O'Brien talked about—because they have a different rate for food, and they have zero rating for other items of food. As I said, that will not be part of this government's new tax system. The GST component of our new tax system will include food as an essential part of the GST package. So let us have none of this nonsense of quoting what happens in European countries as far as the cash economy is concerned.</para><para>The significant part of the new tax system is that businesses with turnovers in excess of $50,000 per year will have to register to obtain refund of the goods and services tax on their inputs, on those goods that they use as part of the process of their business.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—What about New Zealand?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name></talker><para>—Senator Sherry quoted New Zealand in his remarks earlier.

What we have said is that it would make substantial inroads into the cash economy. And that is exactly what it will do—it will bring into the legitimate economy those businesses that are currently in the cash economy, because they will have to register. Even those few business operators that choose to remain outside the legitimate economy will be paying tax on their consumption. When they earn dollars, when they earn their income, when they consume, they will be paying tax on that consumption which they are currently avoiding. That is a second area where the cash economy will be eliminated. Those opposite ignore that as well. So there are two areas: firstly, those businesses that will be drawn into the legitimate economy that are currently in the cash economy and, secondly, even those that stay outside the legitimate economy will be taxed on their consumption.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government has taken many initiatives already to deal with those who cheat on taxation. Apart from the overall package of tax reform, further initiatives against tax cheats are an important part of the reform process. An anti-avoidance measure will be introduced to apply pending the introduction of the entity tax regime. We will be modernising and broadening the general anti-avoidance measures to deal with existing and emerging risks, and reviewing specific anti-avoidance provisions.

I just want to place on the record a few comments about the process that has occurred to date. This morning the motion was discussed at length for about an hour and a half, and a range of problems were identified by senators Faulkner and Ray, among others. Consequently, the government withdrew the substantive motion for discussion, and the government's motion is now before us. </para></talk.start><para>It is normal practice for notices of motion creating Senate committees to be circulated for many days beforehand for there to be discussion amongst the parties—and, indeed, often discussion at the relevant Senate committee—to identify the importance, if any, of the suggested draft, to discuss likely consequences and to pick up amendments from other interested parties. That has not, that I am aware of, occurred in this case, and we ask ourselves why, because the issues behind the Select Committee on Information Technology are not unimportant matters. There has been a lot of discussion in the press lately relating to Internet pornography and the effect of this on children and families. We in the Labor Party regard those as serious issues for discussion and review. Hopefully, some policy guidance will come out of the committee as it addresses those matters in due course.</para><para>We think they are worthwhile subjects for discussion in isolation, and we are somewhat concerned that somehow a nexus has been created with other bills and legislation in this place. Not three weeks ago there was a lengthy debate in this chamber when the government was heavily critical of ALP senators' alleged deliberate delays and alleged obstructionism in the processes of review in the Senate committee on the Telstra bills. They said it was an absolute matter of urgency, that we were holding up the program, and delaying for the sake of delay. And yet, in respect of the Telstra bills dealing with a company worth somewhere between $50 billion and $100 billion—depending on how much is privatised, if any—the speeches on the second reading concluded on Monday evening and there has been no further development of the committee stage.</para><para>I think it is likely that the committee stage will take in the order of four to seven hours, but the government for its own reasons has chosen not to bring on the Telstra bills. And we squarely ask the question: what is the connection, what is the relationship, what is the nexus between this Select Committee on Information Technologies and the passage of the Telstra bills? It seems to the opposition that the Telstra bills are being sullied by 
 trade-offs in other areas; that a certain amount of sleaze is starting to develop.</para><para>We say that the Telstra bills are important matters. They address matters of national significance and there is a range of issues that need to be resolved quickly. We have been ready all of this week to discuss the worth or otherwise of the government's proposals on the Telstra bills; yet we see that somehow or other they are becoming secondary and being involved in trade-offs or giveaways or concessions made concerning the appointment or creation of this Select Committee on Information Technologies.</para><para>As I said at the outset, the terms of reference of the Select Committee on Information Technologies are worthwhile matters. We do not have any problem with going through reviews of bills that address those matters; we think there is serious difference of opinion in the community on the matters raised in those terms of reference, and we are happy to participate in those debates. But we see them as separate matters, not related to the passage of the Telstra bills, and we are concerned that the Telstra bills are being delayed and that a degree of sleaze or sulliedness or dirtiness—however you describe it—is starting to enter into the government and its deliberations on these matters. So it is only proper to express our concerns and to put those on the record.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>3303</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise also to make comment on this very interesting proposition before the Senate. As you have heard, Labor intends to support the amendment and the proposition. We do so on the basis that, as my senatorial colleagues have stated, the issue of information technology is one that is quite central to a whole range of social, economic and indeed personal considerations of Australian citizens. However, like my colleagues, I am gravely concerned that this issue has been brought forward at a time that actually compromises the stated intent of this committee. We are in the midst of a Telstra debate that has now being delayed. Surprisingly, the reference of this committee has cropped up at quite a critical time.</para></talk.start><para>The previous expansion of the environment, recreation, communications and the arts Senate committee to the environment, communications, information technology and the arts committee reflected a change in the way that the government chose to manage their portfolio structures following the last election and the formation of the new parliament. There is certainly plenty of scope within the new ECITA committee to explore the critical issues that the Senate finds now forming part of the terms of reference of this select committee. My colleagues have previously traversed at some length the plethora of quite inordinate discrepancies in this proposition facing the Senate this morning which led to its adjournment and its subsequent revisiting this afternoon.</para><para>I would like to turn briefly to the issue that appears to be at the core of the provocation of the motion from the government—and that is the current issue relating to Internet content. We have seen over the last week or so a range of comments from the minister and from interested parties in relation to the management of Internet content, particularly with respect to pornography and the ability of citizens to protect themselves from material that they consider offensive to themselves. Senator Alston's announcement last Friday—that it was the government's intent to regulate this issue and take forward some of the concepts that had been developed by an industry code of practice proposal into a more formal legislative process—caught the sector by surprise. The fact that Minister Alston did this, having followed a process of what the industry presumed to be sincere consultation in preparation for a workable and realistic framework to take on the very difficult challenge of providing security and protection for Australian citizens with respect to offensive material on the Internet, was quite devastating for the parties involved. It became very clear that the manoeuvre that Senator Alston engaged himself in on Friday had motivations outside the process that he was locked into at that time.</para><para>I believe that this shows the Australian community two things. First of all—and I look forward to the minister's assurances 
 otherwise—it has perhaps compromised what was a number of years work, in fact dating back to 1995, in preparation of an industry code of practice, an Internet code of practice, that put forward the best and most achievable framework in which Australians could move forward with some confidence of protection from offensive material. I believe that if this has been put at risk by the minister's action he must in some way retrieve that position to allow those negotiations and that progress to proceed. He must do this without further tainting the process by allowing the reference to this committee to undermine the progress that has been made in those areas.</para><para>The other issue is one of substance of the minister's proposals. I do not believe this is the appropriate time to engage in debate about the substance of the proposals. Suffice it to say that they were certainly outside of what is considered—very broadly within the community—as realistic and achievable outcomes. It is no surprise that this specific issue arises under point (c) of the amendment. The part of the terms of reference referring to this issue is:</para><para>(c)	 examine the Government's decision to establish a regulatory framework relating to illegal or offensive material published and transmitted through online services such as the Internet;</para><para>It is my hope that the Select Committee on Information Technologies has ample and broad opportunity to explore this issue at some length, that all of the interested parties have the opportunity to express their views and that the parliament emerges from that process far better informed to make sensible decisions about how best to approach this issue on behalf of the Australian community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>3304</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank other senators who have contributed to this debate. Clearly the opposition senators would be expected to criticise the government on this matter and try and draw a connection between this and the Telstra debate. But there were a number of key issues that were raised by opposition senators. Senator Faulkner and some others have raised the problem, 
 perceived in their minds, of the committee being created without a specific reference. In the intervening period since this debate was adjourned we have sought, with the cooperation of all honourable senators, to see those references placed by way of the amendment which I have just moved by leave.</para></talk.start><para>I might just say, even though I am probably defending the motion in its original form, that the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies is a committee that was formed originally back in 1991 and re-formed in 1997. In that respect it is not that different from other select committees that have been reappointed since the new parliament has commenced. Indeed, only a few Senate sitting days ago we re-established the Select Committee on the Socio-Economic Consequences of the National Competition Policy. No-one from this side got up and said, `This is some sort of conspiracy between the left of Australian politics'—that it is Labor and the Greens desperately getting together to create some international conspiracy to bring down competition as we know it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Capitalists.

I am not a conspiracy theorist. I have lived on this planet for only a short time. My view—having been out of government, in government, in business and having various experiences—is that, if you have got the choice between a conspiracy and a stuff-up in parliament, in government, in opposition or in business, stuff-ups are usually the way of human endeavour in many areas. When we start with good intentions and we achieve those good outcomes it is usually the result of a bit of good luck along the way.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So I would not dare suggest that Senator Margetts's motion to establish a select committee was part of some left-wing conspiracy to undo the Telstra debate. It is very unkind of senators opposite to suggest it about the establishment of a select committee on an area of the Australian economy—and indeed the world economy—that is so dynamic and so critical to our future. I think 
 the latest figures showed it was a $69 billion industry and there are something like 7,500 companies in IT—probably rising at the rate of 10 or even 50 a day. It is a massively dynamic industry.</para><para>It was probably not sensible to try and tie down the references that such an important select committee should be able to receive. What you should do is allow for some flexibility. The amendment that I have moved and the original motion allow flexibility for issues such as convergence and such as Senator Bob Brown made in relation to access to equity.

This government can show that through the tax reform process the cost of the hardware required to get onto the Internet, for example, will be massively reduced. The cost of PCs, computers, peripherals, modems and all of the other hardware that you need to have easy access to the Internet will be significantly reduced by a new tax system.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Labor, to their ultimate detriment, are supporting an old tax system that puts a 22 per cent tax on computers. On the smallest computer that a young person in lower to middle income suburbs in Australia would need to go out and buy to get access to the Internet, Labor say, `No, you can pay a 22 per cent tax before you start.' We are saying, `Let's make sure that that tax is lowered to a simple, once-off, single 10 per cent GST which, if you are a small business, will be rebated.'</para><para>Similarly, with the Telstra debate—which the opposition have brought into this debate—the opposition are saying to the government, `No, we don't want you to spend $700 million on improving rural telecommunications infrastructure'—which will massively 
 increase the number of people in Australia who can get access to the Internet—through the proceeds of the sale of the balance of Telstra. They are saying, `No, you can't have that.'</para><para>In terms of access to equity, I agree with my colleague on the other side Senator Bob Brown that these are important issues. The government takes them very seriously—indeed, it is making a bigger commitment to them than any government in the history of our great nation. Senator Bob Brown and some senators in the opposition suggested that the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts—a committee that I served on for some years—should do it. I found Senator Brown's argument a little unconvincing in that, if you were to load all of these matters on to that standing committee—a committee that deals with the environment, which is another crucial area of public policy and an area that this government has made an incredible commitment to in terms of the quality of policy and the money we are spending on it through the Natural Heritage Trust Fund—it would be to the detriment of good public policy in the environment area. It is important that the work of that committee in the environment area not be frozen out or squeezed out by this massive load that we hope will involve consideration of public policy and information technology.</para><para>There are a couple of other matters that I wish to discuss here, one of them raised by Senator Faulkner. He quite correctly said that the opposition had identified that there was no report date for this committee. We sought to correct that by negotiating with senators from the opposition who were interested in this matter to find a mechanism to have a reporting date. There is also the fact that the motion setting up the select committee did not include any specific references, and particularly did not include the matter of wrapping up the report that the opposition had generated in the previous parliament. The lack of a reporting date was clearly an oversight. I should have looked more closely at that. We thank the opposition for raising it. We fixed it as quickly as we could. The other matter 
 that Senator Faulkner raised in his speech which was, I thought, being a bit naughty—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—Not Senator Faulkner!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—It is not like Senator Faulkner to be a bit naughty; he is usually extremely naughty.

The facts, indeed the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> , one of the most accurate recordings—probably not of the facts but certainly of the words of senators—shows that Senator Faulkner, as recently as 24 November, was claiming credit for the idea of having a Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System.

I do not think Senator Faulkner should do himself out of the praise for the historic importance that should be placed on the formation of that important select committee. It was his idea; it was the opposition's idea. He says, `We suggested originally that this should be conducted by a Senate select committee.' I do not think Senator Faulkner should back away from this. Maybe it was not his idea, but I think he should be proud of the fact that it came from the Australian Labor Party. It is one of the few ideas the Labor Party has had since the election—even before the election. It was a good idea and he convinced other honourable senators to support the idea. I do not think he should say it was someone else's idea. Clearly, when Senator Margetts's committee was set up, we were happy to support it. I know that Senator John Quirke was. He is the chairman of that and he tells me that he has already held two meetings and is getting on with the jobs of that committee.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In conclusion, Senator Mark Bishop, my colleague from Western Australia on the other side of the chamber, talked a few moments ago about the second reading stage of Telstra being delayed. I have a page here, generated by the statistics section of the Senate Table Office, that shows that in the last half a dozen 
 years at least a dozen bills have had their passage delayed towards the end of the second reading stage. In fact, this very week is probably a very good example. The first bill to be debated in this place relating to a new tax system, the fringe benefits reporting bill, has been concluded at the end of the second reading stage because the opposition wants to pursue some issues relating to that bill. The government would have preferred to have proceeded and have that bill pass through all stages but, because one or two members in the opposition wanted to discuss some issues relating to that bill, we agreed to halt it at the end of the second reading stage and hold those discussions.</para><para>There are a range of other bills that the opposition, when they were in government, pulled—to use the vernacular—towards the end of the second reading stage or at the second reading stage when it suited them. The government has made it quite clear that we are having discussions with any senators who retain an open mind in relation to any of the Telstra bills, with a view to successfully concluding their passage at the second reading stage and through the committee stages, as we are doing with the opposition in relation to a new tax system. I do not hear the opposition saying that we are being slack, or tricky, or sleazy, to quote Senator Bishop, when we pull a bill when the opposition wants us to pull it. If the government decides to pull the three Telstra sale bills, in their different guises, after 37 weeks of consideration in Senate committees—that must be some sort of a record; I will have to do some more research for the fourth edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Road Block</inline> newsletter, which will be going to press later this evening—and some 70 hours plus of debate in this chamber, it is somewhat cute for the opposition to say, `How dare you delay this legislation.' We have had more repetitive speeches on the Telstra sale bills than we did, I would suggest, even on the native title bills—which you endured, Madam Deputy President. The government appreciates the constructive contributions made to the debate about this select committee. I look forward to this select committee doing some good work in this crucial area of the Australian and world economy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>3307</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I apologise for my late arrival to the chamber, but I think this new amendment cannot go unremarked upon. This morning I spoke in strong support of the re-establishment of the Select Committee on Information Technologies. I did so, on behalf of my party, on the understanding that we would be re-establishing the terms of reference that operated for the last Senate select committee on this matter. Not only that, one of the strongest reasons put forward in this chamber—not just by the Democrats but by others, including Senator Harradine—was that there was an outstanding report, a report that is currently before the chair, in that we have the chairperson's draft of a report that needs to be finalised and acted upon. So those were the grounds and there was also the fact that we support very strongly and believe that a committee that looks specifically at IT related matters in their own right is warranted and appropriate.</para></talk.start><para>This morning I mentioned the broad range of areas and issues that we would like to see that committee examine. In fact I mooted the idea of an amendment very similar to the one before us and I was under the impression that the minister was drafting an amendment. The last informal looking amendment I saw drafted took into account the concerns of those in the chamber who supported the select committee and who sought to replicate the old terms of reference. However, I have just walked into the chamber and seen a very new set of terms of reference—granted that three out of four ain't bad. Three out of four essentially do what it was intended the committee would do; that is, monitor the personal, social and economic impacts of continuing technological change, look at outstanding reports and, lastly, give the committee the purview to look into related IT matters. I now refer to term of reference (c):</para><para>examine the Government's decision to establish a regulatory framework relating to illegal or offensive material published and transmitted through online services such as the Internet;</para><para>This seems to be a new one. It was certainly not part of the discussions this morning. In 
 fact I thought the government were suggesting this morning that there was not necessarily an inquiry mooted, that they had a particular inquiry in mind when they were seeking the re-establishment or the continuation of this committee.</para><para>This morning people talked a lot about process and the fact that the process was deemed inadequate—that we were dealing with the establishment of a select committee without appropriate terms of reference before us. The Democrats echoed those concerns. We thought those concerns would be resolved swiftly through the drafting of an amendment that sought to maintain the terms of reference that were previously in place. So we are rather concerned and pretty angry that the new terms of reference include what is essentially a new inquiry, an inquiry that—as far as I am concerned—has not been discussed with any players that I am aware of in relation to this committee.</para><para>It is not that I am suggesting that (c) is inappropriate because we should not be looking into regulatory frameworks that look at illegal or offensive materials on the net. I suggest that, if you do look into the history of not only this committee but also its precursor—the community standards committee—you will find that some of this work has been done. I am not going to draw to the Senate's attention today the conclusions or recommendations that have arisen out of various inquiries that touch on online services but they are there if you want to have a look—the difficulties in relation to regulation, the need for regulation in some circumstances and the types of material that are on the net.</para><para>I am not suggesting this is not an important issue—because it is. But why can't this issue be put up as the first inquiry once this committee is re-established and has time to meet and then determine its legislative or reference or policy priorities? In my mind this is not a priority. I suspect it is a priority for government, and I suspect I know the reasons why it is a priority for government. And before anyone suggests that I am a conspiracy theorist, this morning I put on record very clearly some of the issues we should be examining  in  relation  to  information 
 technology. I talked about e-commerce. I talked about some of the issues to which Senator Campbell has just referred in the Senate.</para><para>Access, equity, justice, use of the Internet, intellectual property laws, the issue of vilification and defamation—I do not see those in this motion, and they relate very closely to the idea of a regulatory framework. Maybe we should be expanding this, given that it sounds very much like the first inquiry for this committee. Maybe we should be talking about not just the illegal or offensive stuff but also about the examination of stuff that may be deemed to be vilification and the impact on our intellectual property laws. I know why it is not in there. I know why it is not deemed a priority by the mover of this motion or the government.</para><para>So either we put a list of preferred or prioritised inquiries that this committee will look at over the next months, or year, or whatever the time line may be, and that includes a whole range of proposals—proposals that I suspect all parties in this chamber should be given a say in—or else we go with what I thought was the original intention of this morning's motion. That was to re-establish this committee with the express intention of finishing a report that is currently before the chair and looking at the terms of reference that are currently in operation, allowing the committee to decide what its next area of priority or research or inquiry may be. It was not to present the Senate with amended, rather dodgy looking terms of reference that have clearly decided the first reference for this committee, the first area of inquiry and one that is obviously deemed a priority for whatever reason by this government.</para><para>The Democrats started from a position of very strong support this morning—probably more so than just about anyone else in this chamber, given that we have fought so long and so hard to have some kind of committee reference on technology issues—because we were instrumental in August 1997 in drafting the terms of reference that operated under the last committee, albeit with amendment and 
 compromise—and that is appropriate; the will of the chamber is something we respect.</para><para>As I said this morning, we have been very keen to get a broad range of IT and IT related issues onto the agenda—not just community standards in relation to IT and the media in general. That is what this committee seemed to examine in the last parliament. It defined IT as the `media', which I thought was an extraordinary definition. Nevertheless, it was a definition supported by Labor, Liberal and Independents so I went with the will of the committee on that one even though I felt that that committee looked into issues better examined by, say, a legal and constitutional affairs type committee. Especially in relation to privacy I felt that duplication was taking place.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>—Why didn't you turn up to any of the hearings last year?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Senator Calvert knows that my views are on the record in relation to the committee.

I certainly paid tribute to Senator Jeannie Ferris as chair this morning because she is hard working, as Senator Harradine pointed out. That is not the issue. People's level of commitment is not the issue here; the issue is whether we establish a committee to look into information technology issues per se—not use it for any other purpose or pretend we are looking into IT issues but have a very different agenda in mind.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other issue we are debating right now is the issue of process. It is something that was touched on this morning, with good reason. Again, I thought we had reached a compromise, that we had found a solution to this problem. But I walked into this chamber to see not the amendment I anticipated, not the amendment I expected, not the amendment I thought came out of this morning's debate and discussion but something that is amended—and I believe radically amended—to include words like `illegal or offensive material published and transmitted through 
 online services such as the Internet'. This could very well serve as a reference for this committee during its lifetime, but that is something, I thought, for the Senate or the committee members to decide at a later stage.</para><para>I put on record my concerns about this process and my grave disappointment because I can just see what is going to happen to this committee and why it has been established in the first place. I hope that at some point in the future this Senate starts to take issues related to information technology seriously—not just those little sensationalist, sexy issues that people seem to focus on, but the real broader economic, social, personal and democratic issues related to IT in our society. This committee has the potential to do that—that was the exciting thing about the re-establishment of this committee and the discussion this morning. We were going to go a bit broader for a change, not just back over the work we had done—although some of it is worthy of re-evaluation or re-examination; not keep harping on the same issues but actually expand the work of the committee and expand our minds and start looking at IT and IT related issues in a little more detail.</para><para>That is what parliaments across the world are doing. That is what the United States Congress is doing and that is what we should be doing. We are far behind. We are lagging behind on a lot of IT issues. That is not necessarily a reflection on individuals in this place; it is just a reflection on our parliament, perhaps our priorities, perhaps our opportunities, perhaps our level of knowledge on these issues. Let's start getting excited about these issues; let's start exploring them in a broad way—not just looking at the same tired old issues that get the newspaper headlines.</para><para>If it is the will of the committee and the will of the chamber to pursue (c) of this amendment in relation to regulatory frameworks and particular material on the net, so be it, but I think we will have lost another opportunity to have broad ranging terms of reference that would allow us to look at other issues. I reiterate, I am not suggesting that that is not an important issue in itself. The Democrats have produced a lot of work and done a lot of research on this. Anyone who 
 has read our reports and contributions to the work of this select committee and its precursor will know how much work we have done in these areas, how much written research, how many meetings we have had and how many opportunities we have had to put on record the complexities of these issues. The difficulty associated with labelling people and their views in relation to access to materials on the net or anywhere for that matter was touched on this morning by Senator Ray. There are civil libertarian considerations, issues of censorship and other issues of regulation—whether we need codes of conduct that are enforceable, whether we need regulation. More importantly—and this is something the Democrats have put on record many times before—if you want regulation, how do you do it? It is so complex. People know how difficult the Internet is to regulate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—I raise a point of order.

</para><para>(c)	 calls on the Minister to enter meaningful dialogue with all sectors of the aged care industry to address concerns about the quality of aged care received by older Australians.</para><para>I have brought this general business motion before the Senate today in response to serious concerns raised by residents, providers and employees in the aged care sector about the emerging crisis in the sector. Those concerns, some of which are contained in the motion today, describe a pattern of behaviour on the part of the government in relation to aged care that reveals the government's total inability to come to terms with the problems confronting the sector. Many of the concerns that have been raised with me stem from the so-called government reforms that were rushed through in 1996-97. We are now dealing with the results of the hasty implementation of badly constructed policy amended under strong public pressure. We should not forget that the primary purpose of those government reforms was to slash $480 million from the aged care sector.</para><para>There are also now widespread concerns about the inability of the current minister, Minister Bishop, to deal with the many issues that have arisen from that initial rush to reform the sector. It seems that the minister is so intent on avoiding becoming the third minister to lose the job as a result of the government's aged care reforms that she has adopted the strategy of doing as little as possible in the hope that this will minimise the number of mistakes that she will make.</para><para>The combination of the government's initial ill-considered rush to slash funding to the sector and introduce changes, followed by a strategy of inaction by the current minister, has left the sector in a highly precarious position. It is important to remember that there are approximately 150,000 people residing in residential aged care facilities and thousands more receiving community based aged care services. The government's policies in this area have the potential to impact directly on the lives of hundreds of thousands of older Australians and indirectly on the lives of many of their relatives. The quality of the care and services provided to older 
 Australians is a matter of vital public importance.</para><para>I do not need to dwell on the history of the so-called reform process. The fiasco of the accommodation bonds was graphic proof of the government's hasty and badly constructed response to the capital funding needs of the aged care sector. Who can forget the Prime Minister's total humiliation as he reversed government policy while appearing on <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair</inline>? That announcement resulted in the accommodation charges that residents now have to pay. It is not surprising that a hasty backflip to a badly constructed policy has not proved effective in dealing with the issue of capital funding in the aged care sector.</para><para>At the recent Senate estimates, the department admitted that the accommodation charge will raise only $84 million in 1998-99 and $112 million in 1999-2000. These amounts are woefully short of the money needed across the aged care sector to improve and upgrade nursing homes and hostels, particularly in the lead-up to the January 2001 deadline for those facilities to gain certification.</para><para>A report to be released shortly, I suspect, will show that billions of dollars are needed to meet the capital needs of the sector. Providers have made the valid point that the accommodation charge, in delivering small ongoing amounts, is inappropriate given the large up-front costs required for capital improvement. It is looking increasingly likely that a large number of aged care facilities—135 have currently failed to gain certification—will be forced to close their doors in January 2001 because they have simply been unable to raise the funds needed to make improvements to their facilities.</para><para>Many of these facilities are operating in rural and remote regions where there are already insufficient aged care services, as identified in the recent audit report on aged care. In many of these areas, there is only one aged care facility. If that closes, people will be forced to leave the area where their families and friends live. Having set the 2001 deadline for accreditation, this government has done nothing to assist providers to meet the standards that will be required.</para><para>It is also important to note that, in the recent Senate estimates hearings, the department admitted that providers are under no obligation to spend the amounts raised by the accommodation charge on improving their facilities. Within the industry, there are providers who are using the money so raised by the accommodation charge to meet recurrent expenses. In many cases, the use of the funds for this purpose has been forced on providers because of the $480 million that the government cut from the sector in the 1996-97 budget. They are living on the funds that have supposedly been raised to meet their capital needs. There are a minority of providers who are pocketing the accommodation charge and the Commonwealth concessional resident supplement—doing nothing to improve the quality of their facilities—and they will simply sell their licence when the 2001 deadline arrives.</para><para>It is scandalous that the very measure the government introduced to meet the capital needs of the sector, however insufficient, is not guaranteed to go towards those capital needs. The government has not made a compulsory link between the payment of those funds and the direction of those funds towards provision of the capital needs of the sector. As a result of all of the government's changes, the quality of many facilities in the sector has declined. Providers want to upgrade their facilities but simply do not have the funds to do so. Ultimately, aged care residents will suffer because of this government's incompetence. These problems will become acute as the 2001 deadline approaches and facilities close down and services to many areas are restricted.</para><para>The government's policy on capital funding arrangements in the sector is just one example of how it rushed into a complex issue and now has no idea how to respond to the problems that it has created. Almost all providers I have spoken to have remarked how they have suffered under the sheer number of changes the sector has endured over the last two years. There was little or no consultation with industry on the potential impact of many of these changes and how they might be best implemented. </para><para>As a result of this approach, in the middle of last year—days after the proposal to coalesce nursing home subsidies was to be implemented, and following last minute pressure from the industry—the government agreed not to go ahead with that change. The minister called for a Productivity Commission inquiry into the proposal. Here was another of the flawed reforms announced in 1996-97 being reconsidered under industry pressure and the logic of the argument.</para><para>It is interesting that the interim report of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into this issue found:</para><para>Under the proposal, the quality of care would adjust up or down to fit the income stream provided by resident charges and the arbitrarily determined national subsidy rate. In the Commission's view, it is inappropriate to treat the quality of care as the residual balancing item.</para><para>That is, the quality of care in some states, particularly in Victoria and Tasmania, would suffer markedly as a result of this simplistic approach to the funding of nursing homes. The government is focused purely on the cost of the services it provides, not the quality of care and the quality of services delivered to aged care residents in this country.</para><para>Even the Productivity Commission, not known as a particularly radical or necessarily caring organisation, has found that those government reforms would be totally inappropriate because they would downgrade care. That, of course, was only the interim report. I cannot share with the Senate what was contained in the final report of the Productivity Commission to the government because the government has failed to release it. The government, through the Treasurer, has had a copy of that report since 13 January this year—over 10 weeks ago—and we have not had one word from the government about what recommendations are contained in it, what its response might be or when we might hope to have a copy released publicly. This represents just another uncertainty that has been forced on the sector in dealing with this government. They need to know what is in the Productivity Commission report and they need to know how the government is going to respond—the industry needs certainty and decisions from this government.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, you do not have to take the word of the opposition that the government's reforms are bad policy. The current minister's predecessor, Mr Warwick Smith, informed the industry in a letter last year that:</para><para>. . . mistakes were made in the policy prescription adopted over our first term in Government.</para><para>That letter, sent in the immediate lead-up to the last election, went on to give a series of commitments to the industry to address a number of problems that had become increasingly apparent in the sector. Before discussing some of those commitments I note that, as I understand it, none of them have actually been acted upon by the government. I am not sure whether those commitments met the same fate as Warwick Smith or whether the government does intend, at some stage, to honour them.</para><para>The commitments included a promise that, if re-elected, the government would examine ways of providing further capital funding support. The former minister also gave a commitment to make changes to the arrangements for phasing out the previous grants given to providers. These commitments are an admission by the then minister responsible that, as of late last year, the government's solution for funding capital improvements in the aged care sector was not working. Another commitment given by the minister in that letter concerned residents in nursing homes prior to 1 October 1997. That commitment would have guaranteed that this group of residents would not be subject to the accommodation charge should they be forced to move to a new nursing home. This has become an issue where a home closes, or wards are closed, and the residents are forced to transfer to a new facility. As a result, these people are classified as new residents, are caught under the new system and are required to pay the $12 a day accommodation charge.</para><para>A number of constituents have written to me and other Labor members of parliament raising their concerns about their treatment in this way. There are approximately 4,000 residents who are potentially affected by this anomaly. At the time the change was introduced, the Prime Minister gave an assurance 
 that existing residents would not be affected by the changed funding arrangements. It seems that this was, again, another non-core promise. Despite the assurance, constituents are writing to me about their parents who were in a home before 1 October 1997 being forced to pay the accommodation charge after their existing home was closed and they were forced to transfer to another home. In some cases, a provider has built a new facility and then transferred all the residents to the new building, enabling them to charge the fee to those residents. I know the government has been aware of this issue for some time, but it has taken no action to protect the interests of those residents affected. It is a clear breach of the Prime Minister's undertaking and it is a clear mistreatment of those aged Australians. The government must act to rectify that problem.</para><para>Industry is getting used to delays in decision making by this government. The current minister appears intent on doing as little as possible for as long as possible in the hope that this will increase her chances of surviving the portfolio that has become such a graveyard for Liberal Party ministers. Two ministers have already sacrificed their careers to the government's failed aged care reforms. This minister does not want to become the third. While her strategy might succeed if she had to last only a few months, she surely cannot hope to get through the next three years without making a decision or dealing with the very serious problems that exist in the industry. If she continues to pursue this strategy, aged care will slip further and further into crisis.</para><para>Late last year the government put forward a bill that would allow the Standards and Accreditation Agency to charge fees for accrediting facilities. At the time, the government was eager to push the bill through to allow the agency to begin the massive task of accrediting the 3,000 residential aged care facilities before the January 2001 deadline. That bill was passed on 2 December 1998. It is almost four months later and the minister still has not finalised the schedule of fees that has to be tabled in this chamber. The deadline for accreditation was always going to be very 
 tight, but now it is looking increasingly unrealistic. The minister has just wasted four months because she does not seem to be able to make up her mind about how much to charge facilities for accreditation. We are told that at the time the bill was proposed, a draft schedule of fees had already been prepared.</para><para>This is not the only issue on which the minister has procrastinated over decisions to the point where the sector suffers. I will mention another few from a very long list. The minister is still to finalise the new certification instrument, which was due to be finalised last September. Until this document is finalised, providers are uncertain as to what standards they should be building to, which is further hampering the improvement of facilities in the sector.</para><para>The minister has not released the initial report of the two-year review of the government's aged care reforms. This review will provide valuable information in assessing the impact of the government's reforms. The six-monthly reports of the review should be made public to allow residents, providers and employers to make their own assessments of the success or otherwise of the reforms. The minister has also delayed the provision of growth funding for HACC to New South Wales. These grants should have been finalised late last year, but HACC service providers have been left in limbo because the minister will not sign off on these funds. She has of course attempted to blame the New South Wales government for the delay.</para><para>It is difficult to give due consideration to all the issues in aged care in the time available. There are so many problems building in the sector that are not being addressed. My colleagues who will follow in the debate will be addressing some of those, and I appreciate the contributions they are going to make. It is important that this chamber, this parliament and the government start to face up to the very real problems that are emerging as a result of the government's so-called aged care reforms. Every day another problem, another anomaly, emerges from the Aged Care Act. The government seems unwilling to confront those issues, unwilling to take the necessary 
 action to provide leadership and certainty to the industry in resolving those issues.</para><para>These problems have the potential to see a decline in the quality of care for many residents and growing inequities in the system. The minister is compounding these problems by failing to address them. The minister is required to provide the leadership to address these issues and bring certainty and coherence to the aged care sector. She seems unwilling to do so at this stage. The longer the minister procrastinates, the worse the problems get, the worse the funding issue will become and the greater the decline in quality and choice available to Australians requiring aged care will become. The minister has shown complete disinterest in working cooperatively with the sector to address the many problems in the system that her government has created.</para><para>It is important that we bring these issues to the attention of the government. It is important that the government responds in a positive and constructive way. Unless it does so, we will see a serious decline in the quality of aged care provided in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>3315</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The motion before us, put by Senator Evans on behalf of the Labor Party, really is a cruel and disparaging attack on the 20 per cent of aged Australians who use aged care services. Senator Evans is opportunistic in the extreme—scaremongering the aged when his efforts would be better placed comforting and alleviating them in retirement. It pays to look carefully at the motion he has put forward and the speech that he just gave, which did not get down to addressing the issues of people or human points of view.</para></talk.start><para>Before looking at the details of Senator Evans's motion, we should begin by asking: what are the problems for this current generation of aged Australians? Why, after 13 years of Labor Party rule in federal government, are we now standing here in this place debating a series of very negative points put by Labor which are certainly not in the best interests of the aged? Essentially, those aged 60 and over have inherited the economic legacy of Labor in government—that period from 1983 to 
 1996. If you were 45 years of age and had a housing mortgage in 1983 when Labor came to government, you certainly would have paid dearly throughout Labor's reign in the form of astronomically high interest rates—peaking at around 17 to 18 per cent. So while Labor mauled and abused the economy, who are the people who paid? What generation of Australians felt those effects? These people are now beginning to plan their retirement, as are many others who have moved into the retirement age and have been affected by that generation of Labor's administration.</para><para>I find it curious that Senator Evans should find it appropriate to move the motion he has here today, because Senator Evans and his party are directly responsible for undermining the security of aged Australians, and for that they should be condemned. What did 13 years of Labor mismanagement right across the board do to superannuation? What did it do to retirement investments? What did it do to health care? There is no acceptance of responsibility for an entire generation of very important economics—for all of these exacerbating problems that Senator Evans would have us believe our aged Australians now face. This motion is hypocritical. It is nothing more than a dot-by-dot reference of Labor's guilt file, attempting to shift their 13 years of mismanagement onto the Howard government.</para><para>Three years into the Howard-Fischer government, we are wrestling to address a number of hard issues for the people affected—for the aged people of Australia. We have to cover Labor's legacy. We have turned the economy around and we have fortified Australia to such an extent that we have been able to weather the Asian economic crisis and stand in good stead to prosper as a regional leader. We have given back security and cash advantages to families, who now feel it. We have shifted the focus of government back to regional and remote Australia. We will be putting in place a strong, robust tax system designed to meet our national needs. This last point also involves implementation of a workable Commonwealth, state and territory financial arrangement which will see the states better resourced to meet the needs of their aged residents.</para><para>I invite Senator Evans and others so critical in this debate to go to the various policy documents of the Liberal-National Party coalition and also of the Labor Party. Take a good look at our document <inline font-style="italic">Older Australians</inline> under health and family services. Part A refers to tax reform for older Australians. In part B, which refers to carers, we say that we will allocate $80 million over four years to expand community based respite care options for carers of people with dementia. I refer in that particular regard to yesterday's announcement by Senator Newman, the Minister for Family and Community Services, of $100 million for Australian carers. The effect of that will be that 14,000 carers of adult relatives will qualify for assistance for the first time, at a cost of $92 million over four years. Under `Residential and aged care', we address the issue in real stark policy terms. We say:</para><para>Planning arrangements for aged care places will be reviewed to deliver more flexibility to local communities and better recognise the geographic and demographic realities of rural and regional Australia.</para><para>In part D, `Older people living in rural and regional Australia', we say that we will provide rural transaction centres and reinstate and set up better Medicare Ezyclaim facilities by providing additional resources to regional health services. Under our policy, we have instituted the International Year of Older Persons. The other policy issues refer to healthy lifestyles for older Australians and building safer communities for older Australians and older job seekers. They are stark and very worthwhile policy points to look at.</para><para>If you turn to the Labor Party document, it is basically a regurgitation of past criticisms and sins and looks at areas which really can reflect on only their own administration. They wrote this a year or two after losing office and they accepted no blame or responsibility for any of the issues. If you turn to the last couple of pages, they come out with a few policies with respect to trying to capitalise on nursing homes issues that were current last year and talking about pension increases, which is always fashionable in an election period.</para><para>It is important that we turn now and have a look at those issues that are addressed in 
 Senator Chris Evans's motion—a motion in about eight or 10 parts which is nothing more than a series of dot points on which he has sought to score points. Let us take a look at it. The first point he raised was failure to provide capital funding. What did Labor do? They withdrew capital funding over their period in office. They commissioned and then ignored the Gregory report. All Labor was interested in was to deliberately scare older Australians. I think that is what has come through again in today's debate.</para><para>By comparison, Prime Minister Howard's plan to improve the capital flow into the sector is now paying dividends. This week in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> there was evidence that Commonwealth policies are working. There is significant interest by organisations in injecting funds into the aged care industry. The second point raised is with regard to equitable access to care. Labor failed to meet residential care targets that it even set itself. The National Audit Office reported that there was a drop in the number of residential aged care services over the last 10 years of Labor administration, and certainly Labor ignored the bush. Under Labor, there were 16 multipurpose services provided; there are now 42, and another 24 are planned. Under Labor, the safety net for these people was very weak.</para><para>We have redressed those inequities between states and regions. We have paid particular attention where it is important, at raising the level of aged care places in particular areas, and we have increased the range of aged care and health services to people living in rural and remote Australia. This government cares about older Australians and cares particularly about their residential care situations and the financial issues that so importantly arise from those areas.</para><para>On the issue of viability of aged care facilities in rural and remote regions, again in Labor's period there was nothing but a complex set of confusing funding supplements in nursing homes only. It is important to look at what the government has done. We have extended this supplement to also cover hostels. The viability supplement is targeted at facilities in rural and remote areas with a 
 weighting given to small facilities. Certainly, we make these arrangements with extensive consultation. In particular, rural hostels are now funded for the care needs of their residents and the government has a $10 million capital program. Facilities in rural and remote areas are a special target. That makes a nonsense of the point in Senator Chris Evans's motion.</para><para>The fourth point alleged a failure of the Commonwealth government to address the wage disparity issue of nursing staff. The government is still working within the framework set. Labor put in a new indexation method which does not tie the indexation to wage movements that Labor's 1995 decision shifted to safety net adjustments only. The government has removed inefficient bureaucratic barriers to the funding system to enable workplace agreements and improved work practices where staff could share the benefits. The coalition government's reforms have seen an extra $160 million per year for recruitment funding and this has been confirmed by an independent review.</para><para>There were a number of issues that Senator Chris Evans related to Minister Bishop, including the setting of accreditation fees. The government has put in place a rigorous process to ensure the best outcomes. The fee is certainly not to be a tax and the rate that will be set will be fair. This will again be done very carefully. We have asked a consultant to work with the accreditation agency to advise on a fee structure that is both fair and equitable.</para><para>The principles are being drafted. It is expected that they will be before both houses of parliament shortly after Easter. Under Labor, poor quality nursing homes were allowed to get away with giving poor quality care for too long. We will no longer tolerate poor care for frail older Australians.</para><para>Funding for HACC services is important. Sometimes in this area it is very important to look at what is going on, particularly in New South Wales, where there has been a media and correspondence exchange between Minister Bishop and the New South Wales Labor government which has not picked up many of the issues in those areas. Older 
 people and people with disabilities in New South Wales missed out on $15 million worth of HACC funding because the Carr government failed to match the Commonwealth's offer in the first two years of the Carr government. This was a total of over $12.7 million which would have paid for 5.6 million meals on wheels, almost 400,000 hours of community nursing or more than 450,000 hours of home help. By comparison, Victoria has had no trouble meeting the requirements. The Commonwealth spends more than $500 million on home and community care each year to help frail older people, people with disabilities and carers, and we have increased HACC funding by five per cent.</para><para>On the issue that Senator Evans raised with regard to certification, we are very concerned about improving the standards of residential care buildings. Labor totally ignored this problem. Contrary to what Senator Evans has alleged in his speech, the new certification instrument was approved on 3 March. It is now being printed and will be sent out after Easter. This will give the industry certainty. The instrument has strong endorsement from industry and consumer groups. Again, the government is setting standards, requiring poor nursing homes—Labor's legacy—to come up to scratch, giving them a strategic 10-year plan and directions and certainty for building and upgrading.</para><para>Senator Evans wrongly made the point that additional recurrent funding payments will become certified. Prior to the election, the government undertook to introduce an arrangement whereby service providers could receive capital transition payments for residents living in the home prior to 1 October 1997 and access accommodation payments. On 11 December 1998, Minister Bishop sent a fax to service providers confirming the change. Under the new scheme, nursing homes will be able to be certified and also seek accommodation charges from new residents or concessional supplements in respect of eligible residents. The capital transition payments will taper down over time as the number of new residents increases. The department is currently developing the arrangements to introduce this change. Industry 
 groups are being consulted in the process. Again, where is Senator Evans getting his information?</para><para>With regard to the two-year review, it is important to note that a summary of Professor Gray's first six-monthly progress report on the review was released on 18 March, and we have written to the stakeholders to advise them of this. The report is now available from Mrs Bishop and the department. The report details outcomes, particularly as a result of the round of discussions that have been held. Over 500 people with a good knowledge of aged care were consulted in 50 focus groups in 17 locations throughout rural and metropolitan Australia. They certainly identified that the reform—improvements in standards of care, residents' contributions to the cost of their care according to their ability to pay et cetera—was necessary. This gave us a clear message that the industry was very much in need of reform and that it was time the government took action—not inaction and decline as happened under Labor. The review confirms our commitment to increasing the quality of care for individual older Australians. This is very important.</para><para>With regard to the Productivity Commission reports, the commission handed the final report to the Treasurer on 13 January, and this report is due to be released very shortly. There will be a period of consultation and consideration, after which the government will make decisions on the report.</para><para>Labor's record was that they were locked in state differences. That remains the case today, because they are obviously locked in their thinking. They had 13 years in which they slashed capital funding, failed to keep pace with the ageing population and failed to take action against poor quality homes. They left behind a funding system for nursing homes which was totally out of date. Labor knew when it was in government that Australia was ageing, and it took no action.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>—That's not true.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6E4</name.id><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name></talker><para>—I am sorry, but your record speaks for itself. You have not been in the chamber listening for long. Labor certainly left aged care in a mess. That particular point is very important. There are, of 
 course, a lot of groups in the community that are in consultation with Minister Bishop and with the government. They are very pleased with the record and with the involvement and the consultations that are taking place. Let me just give you one endorsement from Eldercare, a major religious and charitable provider in South Australia:</para></talk.start></continue><para>Few can complain about the changes that have resulted from the process of aged care reform. The outcomes for Eldercare have been significant and we are now in the best financial position we have been in for several years. The new resident classification system is reflecting and funding the resident mix that we have always had but struggled with because the old classification system had long passed its use-by date. Across our 640 nursing home and hostel residents this produces additional government care related subsidies estimated at $2 million per annum. Over 80 per cent of this has been spent on additional staff.</para><para>These are clear endorsements of the government's program and policies for aged Australians. We should look at what the real priorities are, what they are being given and what they were not given by Labor during its particular term in office. I note that Senator Evans did not use the total 20 minutes speaking time that was allocated to him. In fact, he fell five minutes short. Again, this is indicative of the priority he gives to such an important area. He ran out of puff on this particular issue. He cannot spare five minutes to add to his own motion on such an important issue. Those aged Australians that Senator Evans claims to represent are, indeed, very poorly represented.</para><para>By comparison, Minister Bishop and the Prime Minister have indicated this government's priority in the area of aged care by appointing a very competent administration. Mrs Bishop is in constant contact with all of thess groups within the portfolio and is achieving results. Senator Evans's motion is a pathetic contribution, particularly in this, the International Year of Older Persons. As always, the ALP is looking backwards and not to the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>3319</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Over the past couple of years the Democrats have been very careful to distance themselves from much of what the ALP have had to say when it comes to aged care, 
 although I have to admit that the statements that we are concerned about were made mostly in another place. We have had to do this because much of what was said, particularly in relation to controversial issues such as accommodation bonds, we would seriously question. A great many statements made by the opposition over the past couple of years have had the effect of preying on the emotional vulnerability of elderly people in order to score political points. Some statements have, unfortunately, borne little resemblance to the truth.</para></talk.start><para>Having said that, on behalf of the Democrats I would like to speak in support of some aspects of the motion which is before the Senate today. I want to make it very clear that I may not agree with everything that opposition senators say in support of this motion. However, I can support many aspects of what is put before us.</para><para>The Democrats have long highlighted the desperate need residential aged care facilities have for increased capital funding. What we believe is needed is a policy package which is considered, consistent, coordinated and has some long-term vision. Without this, the future viability of residential aged care in this country simply cannot be guaranteed. Neither the coalition's current aged care package nor the Labor Party's pre-election promise to abolish all nursing home fees and provide a mere $500 million to the sector over three years is going to provide the funding which is so desperately needed.</para><para>In 1994 the Gregory report, which was commissioned by the former Labor government, estimated that approximately $1 billion in today's figures was needed just to get the existing nursing home stock up to scratch. The report highlighted the poor physical condition of nursing home infrastructure, including the fact that a number of aged care facilities did not even meet basic fire standards and a number of others were skating very close to the edge.</para><para>Despite the government's efforts, little has really happened to change the situation since 1994 and, unless something is done, it is likely only to get worse. Things are likely to get worse, because Australia has a rapidly 
 ageing population. It is predicted that, by the year 2051, 22 per cent of the population will be over 65 years of age and nearly 11 per cent will be over 75 years of age.</para><para>The Democrats acknowledge that the coalition has attempted to address the shortfall in funding for residential aged care facilities during its first term in government. It did this initially by introducing a number of reforms, including its controversial nursing home entry fees. The Democrats supported these proposals, because nobody, including the Labor Party, had ever been able to come up with an alternative and because we understood the urgent need the aged care sector had to raise additional capital.</para><para>After successfully negotiating with the government a number of added protections for elderly Australians, the Democrats believed we had something we could live with. But I have to say that we were disappointed when the government dumped a great deal of its package after the opposition's huge scare campaign which preyed on the emotional vulnerability of elderly Australians.</para><para>When considering this motion, none of us should ever forget that the ALP had 13 years when they were in government to address the problems in residential aged care. But they did not do so in any adequate sense. Now, as a result of the government's backflip on aged care policy, we have ended up with a watered-down, user pays based policy which is a long way short of providing a solution to these problems. While many aged care providers now say they think the current system may provide the capital they require in the long term—they say perhaps 10 to 15 years—it will provide little relief in the short term. I understand that the time the government had initially projected for when all the facilities would have to be up to standard has really had to be extended, simply because the reality is that it will be impossible for all of the aged care facilities to ever meet that standard.</para><para>What I want to know is: what is the government going to do to assist facilities in need of upgrading to meet the standards set down for certification in the meantime? I urge the government to consider the possibility of offering these facilities some kind of loan to 
 help them to undertake the work they require. I really cannot see any other way of funding the upgrades which are needed.</para><para>The Democrats believe that any future proposals which are designed to change the way the current residential aged care arrangements operate must be carefully weighed up against the impact they will have on elderly people's ability to access high quality residential care and against the long-term financial viability of the sector. These must always be the highest priorities in devising aged care policy.</para><para>Protecting the viability of aged care facilities in rural and remote regions is something which is particularly close to my heart and something which was highlighted in the Productivity Commission's interim report, which was released late last year. A few places I have been to discuss these issues, apart from major cities up and down the coast, include Emerald, Jericho and Dalby in Queensland, Wellington and Dubbo in New South Wales, and some towns in Victoria. The issue is always the same: how are towns in these areas to access the funds they need with a much lower revenue base and ability to raise funds, and how are they to get help on a user pays basis from people in their towns? I would be interested to hear whether the government has any strategies for ensuring that aged people in remote areas will be, in the government's own words, `able to grow old in the place where they have spent all of their lives'. That is very important to them.</para><para>The Democrats would also like to hear if the government has any plans for addressing the wage disparity for nursing staff that exists between the acute and aged care sectors. This is something which is often raised with us. It is important to note that this disparity is one which is actually getting worse, not better. I think we need to ask ourselves some serious questions about why nursing staff working in the aged care sector are currently so undervalued in comparison to those working in other areas. In fact, in some ways there seems to be almost a stigma attached to nurses who work for any length of time in the aged care sector—as though, somehow or other, they are 
 not of the same standard as nurses working in other medical facilities.</para><para>The Democrats would also like to know when we are going to see a concrete proposal on the level of fees that facilities will have to pay to be accredited. It seems like a long time since we passed the bill to facilitate the charging of fees last year. Surely it is now time to get some hard, cold figures on the table. Not knowing what the accreditation process will cost is causing aged care providers a degree of stress, simply because it makes it difficult for them to plan for the future. I urge the government to tell us what they are doing in relation to this matter.</para><para>In relation to funding for HACC services, I want to put on the record that the Democrats strongly support more community based services and programs. We would like to see an immediate boost in funding for the Home and Community Care program. In fact, that is the only way that the government  will be able to fulfil its promise, which is to provide for people to be able to stay in their own homes, because people will not be able to do so without the kind of support that Home and Community Care and domiciliary nursing programs are able to give them.</para><para>Another problem, which I must declare an interest in because I have a wife who is a registered nurse and works in an aged care institution, is the excessive paperwork associated with the RCS. My wife constantly tells me that she is so busy doing care plans and filling in forms—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">WEST</name><name role="display">Senator West</name></talker><para>—All paper care and no patient care.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—That is what she tells me, and she would like to get back to some nursing.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">HERRON</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name></talker><para>—The ALP introduced it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—No, you changed it, Senator Herron, and it has got worse. It was bad under the ALP, but unfortunately it has not improved as the government had promised. The reports I get are that it has got worse. I think that the government do want to solve that problem, but they have not; and we have got to solve it as quickly as possible. That is an issue that I throw out for the 
 government's attention. I do not want to be cynical, but sometimes I do wonder whether the resident classification scale is there to help us get appropriate care at the different levels that are needed or whether it is there sometimes to put a cap on the funding. I am not cynical, I suppose, but I do tend to get a bit cynical when I see what is happening.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Democrats also urge the government to release without delay the two-year review of the aged care reforms—a review which ended in January—and the Productivity Commission's report into nursing home funding, a report which was completed on 13 January. I think I heard the minister give assurances that both of those will be available very shortly, and that is pleasing.</para><para>In conclusion, the Democrats firmly believe that any future changes to the current aged care system and any finetuning of the current aged care package must be done in consultation with the aged care sector. Again, let me compliment the minister for describing the consultation process which is taking place. That is absolutely essential. That is the only way to ensure that we finally end up with a system that will work and be sustainable as Australia's population ages.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>3321</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will open my contribution to the debate on Senator Chris Evans's motion by declaring an interest of 18 years nursing experience and membership of the two colleges of nursing in this country.

 to. As we heard last night from Senator Gibbs, in Queensland the Churches of Christ are having a rearrangement of some of their institutions.

And what are the qualifications that are required for aged-care workers?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>—Making money for Doug Moran.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name></talker><para>—Senator Quirke, I think that your comment may not be totally factual, but it does certainly highlight a number of points. It can be about making money, or it could be about the fact that this government is actually winding back the amount of money available for nursing care. That is what keeps the patients well; it is what keeps their skin whole and entire and without blemishes and keeps their health status good. They are cutting back on that, it would appear; because aged-care workers are cheaper and they also have no need to have qualifications.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me remind people of what it was like 20 and 30 years ago. This is from the experience of my peers and colleagues in the industry. As registered nurses, they would go to work on an afternoon shift, often on a weekend, to discover that they had one or two new staff who were there as assistants. All of these people had to be shown, on the job, what to do and how to care for the patients. So not only was the registered nursed providing the care but she was also providing the education for the other staff that were with her. On a number of occasions it has happened to my colleagues that the person they were training—and the trainee may only last couple of days—would tell them that they had answered an ad for a job that morning for an immediate start as a cook or a cleaner, but because somebody had got there before them and had been given the job as the cook or the cleaner, they had been talked into being a care assistant to work with a registered nurse. That is what used to happen. People would wander in off the street and be given a job.</para><para>If we move down this path before us that is what will happen. There is no guarantee that a registered nurse or an enrolled nurse or an 
 assistant in nursing will be employed. This is a major concern for anybody who is in the health care industry. This is not just about having the right number of bodies there, this is about the standard of the delivery of care that is given to people in nursing homes. The level of acuteness of patients in nursing homes these days has risen quite significantly.</para><para>In the days when I was nursing, anybody who was sick in a nursing home with things such as pneumonia, or who required a blood transfusion or any other acute care, was immediately transferred to the nearest acute hospital. These days, these procedures are being undertaken in nursing homes. I am told by people who are professionals in the area, with expertise, that blood transfusions are quite common and that they are even doing things such as hyperalimentation and dialysis. Nowhere 20 or 30 years ago would they even have considered doing things like that in nursing homes. Those procedures are now being carried out in these institutions. As the number of people with dementia increases in institutions, it becomes much better for the delivery of their care that they be kept in the same institution, in the same environment with the same carers. As I said, the level of acuteness of patients is increasing.</para><para>I have spoken to directors of nursing who have told me that they have had patients back in the nursing home some 24 or 48 hours after the patient has had surgery in an acute hospital on the fractured neck of their femur. This requires a high level of care as it is high dependency. Sure, the RCS will accommodate that, but what will not accommodate it is inadequately trained staff. You need more than just one registered nurse and an aged-care worker. You need people with enrolled nurse qualifications and assistant in nursing experience to be able to support and deliver that care.</para><para>We were also told by Senator Gibbs last night that the Churches of Christ in Hervey Bay and Maryborough are saying that the registered nurses will not be expected to take a lead role. I am wondering where we are going in terms of the legal responsibilities here and in terms of negligence. There is a duty of care owed to residents, and that duty 
 of care is expected to be carried out by the average registered nurse or the average enrolled nurse or the average assistant in nursing. We do not know what the standards are for the average aged-care worker. It will not be the parliament that decides what the standards are; it will be a court of law that decides. The court of law will decide that the owner or the proprietor or the manager of that nursing home has a duty of care.</para><para>If something happens, and they are found derelict in that duty, they will be two parts down the path to being negligent. If there is damage to the patient, and if there is a direct cause of that damage, the nursing home will be negligent and so too could be the person who has provided that care if they have not been adequately trained. If the people providing the care have not got adequate training that is not an excuse. It will be judged and the people in the witness box will be expert witnesses who will be attesting to what should be the average quality of care that is provided to patients.</para><para>I warn people to think very carefully about this and I warn the government, because I think the government has left some loopholes in its legislation. The booklet it put out last year said that `the care may be carried out by a registered nurse'. I warn people to be very careful because there are legal ramifications in all of this. If the employer, the owner, is not providing adequately trained staff, they will be held negligent. We will find that out when we end up in coroners courts. If you are not going to have adequately trained staff, as we see is going to happen in Hervey Bay and Maryborough, you will end up with people in coroners courts, and that is a sad indictment.</para><para>The other thing that people need to remember is that we are 20 or 30 years on with improvements in nursing homes and aged care. The community is a lot more litigious now than it was 20 or 30 years ago, so take that as a warning. I am gravely concerned about these changes and this erosion of the standard of care that is being delivered to patients. When all else fails, the standard of care for patients has to be the primary consideration. </para><para>This change being mooted by the Churches of Christ is putting in danger, or destroying, the career paths for a number of enrolled nurses in particular.

I am glad that Senator Herron did interject because that just raises concerns with me about the fact that I thought that he, of all people, would have understood the need to have highly qualified and specialised nurses in the area that he works in, which is surgery—just the same as people in aged care deserve the same levels of care. This is the introduction—the first 
 signs that we are seeing—of the downgrading in the mind of this government of the standing of those who provide aged care in this country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This government is to be condemned for the attempted downgrading of the qualifications of people providing care. Allowing that to happen is appalling, and I have actually warned in the past that that could potentially happen through this legislation. Now we are seeing it happen, so I have been vindicated on that particular point. It is a disgusting thing; it shows a lack of care but it probably relates to the fact that these institutions are not getting adequate funding from the government because there is so much paperwork to be done. They are not getting adequate funding to undertake all of this, and this is the only way that the proprietors of nursing homes are actually able to cope.</para><para>The other area that I would like to touch on is the preliminary work that is being done by the New South Wales Nurses Association. It is a study that is unpublished at this stage, and it is going to be done over two years. But we certainly have evidence that they have been able to provide me with that indicates that the impact since the introduction of this act has been quite marked on institutions and aged care facilities.</para><para>Nursing groups have been told by the government that aged care funding will increase by 10 per cent. But this survey indicates—as I said, it is unpublished and it is preliminary—that only 4.5 per cent of the respondents believed personal care and nursing hours had increased as a result of new funding arrangements introduced under the act and that 42.5 per cent believed the new funding arrangements had led to reduced hours and changes in skill mixes. The information that has been received in this ongoing survey reveals that more than 40 per cent of aged care nurses have noted an increase in requests to perform work not directly related to care over the last 12 months. More than a third of respondents noted a reduction in the number of registered nurses employed in their particular facility over the same period of time and 32 per cent said there had been a reduction in the number 
 of enrolled nurses. This bears out what is happening in another state.</para><para>More than half the respondents said there had been a reduction in the standard of care and 59 per cent noted a reduction in the number of overall care hours over the last year. That probably bears out Senator Woodley's point about his wife's experience of spending more time on doing paperwork than on doing nursing care. Fifty-six per cent believed they did not have the resources necessary to enable them to provide an acceptable standard of nursing care. Almost two-thirds claimed their workload had increased significantly over the last 12 months. Almost 40 per cent believed current staffing levels placed the occupational health and safety of nursing staff at risk. One-third of staffers claimed the risk had increased significantly.</para><para>You are going to see that blow out even more if you do not have properly trained staff. People coming in off the street will not know how to lift properly, how to manoeuvre the machines that are used for lifting or how to use the equipment and will therefore be a greater risk to themselves and to the patient. This is just the sort of thing this government said would not happen, and it is now becoming quite evident that it is happening. The nurses are also saying that they are undertaking increased unpaid overtime.</para><para>We have also had the story of a hostel being left understaffed. When a woman went to visit her mother there, she and other visitors actually ended up having to support the nurse that was on duty because she was feeling so stressed by the level of workload that had been placed upon her shoulders. Another person in the same place complained because her mother had been left stark naked for 45 minutes because somebody had been called away. These are all examples of the provision of poor care to patients, and I think that the government has to stand condemned. It was warned that these things would happen but it has chosen to ignore that warning and this is now happening.</para><para>I also have concerns about what is happening in rural areas because I am being told more and more by institutions in those 
 areas that if they are small their viability is really in danger. There is also an anomaly in the Aged Care Act, which is affecting people in rural areas. I notice that there is an adviser in the box. I presume that the adviser has seen the letter from Ms Sue Irvine from Southern Cross Homes in Broken Hill, because it is in the article that has appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Barrier Daily Truth</inline> of Friday, 12 March. It is an anomaly where a resident owns a home and has total assets—including the home—below $23,500.</para><para>Before people tell me that that is not possible, I suggest they go and visit Broken Hill, where in the last few weeks the city has been told that the mine will close in a couple of years and there is a number of very small old miners' cottages for sale at very low prices. But, if a person does not have a home and has assets below this amount, they are considered concessional and get $12 a day. People who have assets below $23,500, and that includes their own home, are not classified concessional. This is an anomaly. When it comes to trying to claim hardship provisions they cannot do it. The government needs to fix it—no bleating from anybody. This is something about which an aged care provider has been writing to the department and to the minister for some considerable time.</para><para>If a resident has total assets including the family home of less than $23,500 they cannot be considered concessional. The department advises that residents with total assets of less than $37,000 can apply for hardship provisions. However, if a resident has less than $23,500 they cannot be charged an accommodation charge. But, she has been told that the department cannot consider a hardship application if a facility has not charged an accommodation charge.</para><para>There is a wonderful little loophole and you have done nothing about it. This particular person, Mrs Irvine, has been writing to the minister for some time about this issue and nothing has happened. It is another area where this government is disadvantaging people living in rural areas, particularly those who are elderly.</para><para>The other concern that elderly and rural people may have is the cost of accreditation for small nursing homes and small hostels. The amount of paperwork required is very similar no matter what the size of the institution, but there is nothing there. The other question I would like to touch on is the length of time an institution that has failed certification is given before it is required to actually close its doors. I know of one that was failed last year and the patients are still there. They have been told that they might be moved out of the nursing home some time this year. It is a good question.</para><para>I see that my previous comment about loopholes and anomalies has prompted some action on behalf of the departmental officer in the advisers box. Maybe that has been fixed in the last week. Wouldn't that be wonderful?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>3325</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today we are having a rerun of the same motion that was debated in this place three times, from memory, in 1997.

Labor withdrew funding enormously. In 1992 there was a total of $45 million spent on capital stock. I notice that Senator West never, ever stays in the chamber for these debates.

I did not hear Senator West or Senator Evans mention that.

The other thing I want to make sure is understood in the context of this debate is the fact that, in contrast to that enormous cut, the new capital funding arrangements put in place by Prime Minister Howard in 1997 will provide the $1.3 billion over 10 years that was identified as necessary by Professor Gregory's report and an extra $10 million every year in capital grants in addition to higher recurrent funding. We also recognise that a minority of 
 providers need assistance in meeting the new government requirements for quality building and services. For them we have allocated an additional $20 million to help them restructure and to obtain expert advice on how to do it. Yet we have heard today, again, the Labor opposition saying that we have cut funding.</para></talk.start></continue><para>	 I want to come to that last point that I mentioned about the minority of providers who need assistance in meeting the govern 
 ment's new requirements for quality buildings and services. This is part of Labor's other record. When they left office after 13 years, we just happened to find in the Gregory report that 11 per cent of nursing homes did not meet fire standards and 15 per cent did not meet health regulations. Professor Gregory also found that 40 per cent of residents had to share a room of more than four beds. Did the Labor government do anything about it? No, that is the legacy they left. Yet today they</para><para>have the audacity to come in here and say, when we are allocating more funding to correct their legacy, that that is somehow wrong and improper.</para><para>I seek leave to incorporate another table, which goes to the point of how much funding was cut. Once again I have previously sought the approval of the opposition to do so.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The table read as follows</inline>—</para><para><graphic href="S250399.G02"></graphic></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>—The Labor Party also ignored the Gregory report, yet it was a report that they commissioned. I cannot understand why they would want to commission it and then just let it gather dust. It took the coalition government to come into office and to start reversing the things that had been identified in the Gregory report. All Labor have been interested in doing since is scaring older people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Labor Party today have clearly said that they do not understand or accept the reality of extra money that has been put in to meet residential care targets. The Australian National Audit Office reported that there had 
 been a large drop in the number of residential aged care services over the last 10 years of Labor. This government has put in $280 million for staying at home packages, and that will raise the level of aged care places to 103 places per 1,000 people aged 70 and over by 2002. That is demonstrated by the first graph that I sought leave to have incorporated tonight.</para><para>The other thing that that money does is ensure important things such as more respite care and more carer support. I would have thought, even though this opposition can only knock, that they would say that that was a desirable outcome. But, no, every single thing 
 without exception that the coalition government puts up, they knock. They say it is not good enough. It does not matter how much it is reversing the damage that they did to any given industry in their 13 years of government.</para><para>The ANAO report says that considerable progress has been made to remedy the inequities between states and between regions, and that the government's staying at home initiative paid particular attention to rural regions. We just heard a diatribe from Senator West that was purely and simply unbelievable. The ANAO noted that there were still regional inequities, especially in the bush. Labor ignored that; we have started to redress that problem.</para><para>The Commonwealth government is committed to reducing these inequities. For example, 30 per cent of the 500 extra staying at home packages allocated in June 1998 went to rural and remote localities. Not one of us would ever say that we would not want more. Of course we would want more. If we lived in an ideal world we would want everything, and we would want to not pay any taxes to get it. But the reality is that the Labor government ran it down and the coalition government has allocated the money in successive budgets to fix it.</para><para>As well as that, the government has increased the rate of growth of multipurpose services to provide an increased range of aged care and health services to people living in rural and remote areas in Australia. Under Labor there were 16 multipurpose services; under the coalition government there are now 42 sites, with a further 24 planned. Yet we have had the scare campaign again today that there are inadequate numbers. Why don't they own up and say, `We had insufficient and at least you are turning this around. At least you are doing the right thing and the trend lines are going in the right direction'? There is no recognition at all because they can only knock.</para><para>The multipurpose services recurrent funding rates under this government have increased by an average of 10.2 per cent to a total of $17.48 million. Yet the Labor opposition say that they have been reduced. Senator West 
 happened to mention the problems that Ms Irvine had identified. I would like to inform Senator West, had she bothered to stay in the chamber, that Ms Irvine met with the minister yesterday and her concerns are under active consideration by the minister. Of course, Senator West does not bother to stay and listen to the other senators' contributions.</para><para>They talk about wage disparity. The government is still working within the framework set by Labor in the 1995 budget. If they think the wage disparity is so bad, why did they not change it? Why have they left it to the coalition government to make reforms that have seen an extra $160 million a year in extra recurrent funding that has been confirmed by an independent review? Why did they not do something about it in government? They come in here, three years down the track, and carp.</para><para>It is the same with the accreditation fees. This government is actually doing something about quality. I mentioned the state of nursing home stock at the time of this government's election, which Labor had left in a dreadful state. Under Labor, poor quality nursing homes were allowed to get away with giving poor quality for too long.</para><para>Then you get the crocodile tears of Senator West in here today; absolutely breathtaking stuff. But we will no longer tolerate the poor care for frail older Australians. The Aged Care Standards Agency set up by this government will play an important role in improving the quality of care. That is a responsibility of each and every government, but it has taken a coalition government to do it, and I am proud of that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Watson)</name></talker><para>—Order!

My colleague Senator Cook spoke about this yesterday and drew the attention of the Senate to the fact that our relations with India were strained as a result of the tests that occurred earlier last year in India and also in Pakistan. One has to look at the work of the Australia-India Council as being important in the sense that it is a bridge building organisation in the relations between Australia and India. There are other such councils as well for Japan and similar places. This report is indeed welcome because it highlights the work of that particular council over the 1997-98 period.</para></talk.start><para>There are a number of things I want to look at in terms of the report. The first is the matter of education. The report says that the objective of the council's education program is to raise the level of knowledge of India, including Australia's relations with India, at the primary and secondary levels in Australian schools. Of course, this also works the other way within India. One of the problems in many of our relationships with other nations is that we do not understand their social, cultural, economic or political systems. Organisations such as this go a long way to overcoming some of those problems. It is interesting to see the program outlined in the report where the council funded a tour of India by Australian primary and secondary teachers during January of 1998 and, according to the report, promoted effective use of India curriculum packages throughout Australia. That is an important element of these types of councils, and it seems from this report that the function is being well performed.</para><para>The other issue raised is international relations. My colleague Senator Cook, when he spoke to this report yesterday, referred to the strained relations as a result of the nuclear testing. Senator Cook also referred to the fact that the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee has conducted an inquiry into those tests and pointed out to the Senate that there was a totally bipartisan attitude in this country to the tests that had been conducted in India and Pakistan, and that was one of condemnation. The issue that 
 was raised during the inquiry conducted by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee was how long our protest would remain and how we would go about repairing any damage that was done to the relationship during that period of time. The curious part is that during that period, when our political relations were strained, our sporting relations were certainly not strained, because we had a tour going on in that particular country.</para><para>It is important that Australia look at repairing its relations with India, and with Pakistan for that matter. That is something that has not been given any real focus. India will be important to Australia in the future in terms of trade. Last year India was  ranked 12th on the list of countries that we export to. We have seen our exports to India grow by 17 per cent, which is a fairly strong trend growth coming off a very low base. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>3329</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Digital Broadcasting Industry</title><page.no>3329</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 23 March 1999, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooney</inline>:</para><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>3329</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This vital report talks about Australian industry in respect of digital broadcasting and has a most apt title: <inline font-style="italic">Thinking outside the box</inline> .

I was unable to make the trip to Norfolk Island, but I made the trip to Christmas and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. There are a number of issues that need to be looked at very carefully because, although they are part of Australia, in terms of communication they are quite remote. The islands are not entitled to any funding, under the infrastructure funding programs, from the sale of the first tranche of Telstra, and their access to lines for the Internet are impossibly slow—they are basically non-existent. This is a major problem for people, particularly in the education area when schools need to talk to the department in Perth via the Internet. As are most states, Western Australia is moving more and more to the use of technology for the provision of in-service training, for sending out forms and things like that, and their Internet service is not adequate enough to be able to undertake this. It is a big problem and it is one that we have to recognise, although they do have Intranet within the schools and that provides a very good service for them,</para></talk.start><para>There are problems also with the air services to the area. They now have some additional flights coming in through Indonesia into Christmas Island but not to Cocos (Keel 
 ing). All of the three islands—Norfolk, Christmas and Cocos (Keeling)—have problems with the lack of freight capacity and the off-loading of freight, particularly in relation to health and medical supplies. These sometimes require a cold chain—they are time sensitive. Certainly we had evidence of specimens being taken from Norfolk Island, sent to Sydney, not being collected properly by the couriers in Sydney and coming back to the island maybe a week later.</para><para>The diagnoses of some diseases and complaints—and also changes in medication, if that is required—and the tests that have to be done in Sydney or Brisbane can be time critical. This can delay people's treatment and cause a problem. It lowers their quality of life and it may even endanger their lives. So that is a major problem.</para><para>The other crazy thing concerns airmail sent from overseas to Australia to go to Norfolk Island. Let us say it is coming from the US: it travels from the US to Sydney via airmail and it might then be put on slow mail to get to Norfolk. So that anomaly needs to be addressed. One of the recommendations is that, if something is airmailed into Australia, we should not just consider that the airmail component applies only until it reaches the continent of Australia. Certainly a lot of mail gets sent around Australia by air that is not airmail. I think we need to make sure that people are in fact able to obtain this material.</para><para>There is also a problem in that many things get off-loaded. It is a bigger problem, I think, on Christmas and Cocos islands—and I think they have fewer shipping connections than Norfolk as well. We certainly had evidence from a number of people in the Indian Ocean territories that they would know when their telephone bill was due because the telephone would be cut off because they had not paid it. The bill would have been in the mail but would have been off-loaded because the flight was over capacity in weight. The aircraft have to run with additional fuel because it is a long distance to fly out there, and on some occasions that requires them taking less cargo than if the aircraft were doing a run within the country. So it is certainly a concern.</para><para>On occasions it also impacts on the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables that might have to come across on those flights. The health people also advised that they had had occasions when urgently needed medications and drugs had been off-loaded because of weight problems. Getting a seat on the aircraft out of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands going to Perth at peak times can be a problem because the flights can be fully booked for four or five months in advance. That is a major problem if somebody suddenly needs to go to Perth for medical reasons. It means that somebody who would have had their seat booked for some considerable time gets pulled off the flight. This is not good for those who need to travel and it is not particularly good for those who need to be evacuated.</para><para>We also heard how telemedicine would be able to improve diagnoses and specialist medical treatment and care, and maybe reduce the need for medical evacuations on some occasions. Medical evacuations are horrifically expensive—we are talking big, five-figure sums of money as well as considerable time. If they had sufficient line capacity and electronic capacity, they would be able to look quite realistically at the use of telemedicine and also at being able to send down the line things like X-rays and ECGs so that diagnoses could be made by a specialist, or a consultation could be had with a specialist, in Perth. This may result in, perhaps, not requiring an evacuation or maybe requiring an evacuation earlier than would have been undertaken. It would certainly allow the doctors on the islands to instigate more refined forms of treatment at an earlier stage. So it is a major issue for people in the area.</para><para>The change of footprint for some of the television stations was also of concern to them. Digital versus analog is an issue, and even the communications between the two main islands in the Cocos (Keeling) group are very difficult. The reception often does not work. Trying to ring from West Island to Home Island can be difficult. Also, the telephone service does not work on part of Christmas Island. Their television and radio reception is also very much subject to the 
 vagaries of the weather; if there is a lot of cloud cover, this can impact quite seriously upon the ability to receive clear signals.</para><para>These are things of concern. We need to remember that Australia is not just this continent and Tasmania; it does include Macquarie Island, territories in the Antarctic, Norfolk Island and the Indian Ocean territories. Whilst there may not be a great number of people living there, we need to make sure that their needs are recognised. Those outlying territories are certainly of strategic importance to this country. We are a multicultural country and we need to recognise that it is important for our islands that are more remote from the mainland to have access to the same programs that we have here on the mainland so that they do not feel isolated and so that they can see and understand what people on the mainland are doing, perhaps why they are doing it and what is going on here. Those islands are of strategic importance to Australia, and I think this report certainly highlights some of the things that need to be done to improve the communications. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties Committee </title><page.no>3332</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>3332</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 22 March 1999, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooney</inline>:</para><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>3332</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak to this report by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties as a former member of this committee. When a lot of the issues relating to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment were being dealt with, there was a high degree of public interest from individual members of the public right through to local government and a whole range of other NGOs with regard to what was proposed for a multilateral agreement on investment and what it meant for Australia.</para></talk.start><para>I have not read this report in total but, given its recommendations and the responses from the government to the interim report that was handed down, I found interesting the government's response to two of the recom 
 mendations contained in the interim report. In effect, they say that we have withdrawn from negotiations on the MAI on the basis of the decision by the French government to withdraw. I found that an outstanding position. It does not clarify whether, if the French go back in at some point in time, we go back. There is no indication of that whatsoever.</para><para>Given all the problems that were raised at several hearings we had, it became abundantly clear that Treasury—which was the department primarily responsible for dealing with the Multilateral Agreement on Investment—had not conducted the consultative process in any way like it should have been conducted. They said, I think, that they had conducted consultations with umbrella organisations, but the information had clearly not flowed and they had not sought to follow it up. It appeared, as is stated in this 18th report, that Treasury felt they owned it. I found the conclusions and the recommendations at page 105 of the report interesting. Recommendation 8.47 says:</para><para>The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that, if there are negotiations for an across countries agreement for the regulation of international capital:</para><para>.	 the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet assume the lead role in coordinating the Australian Government's negotiations;</para><para>.	 the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet actively and effectively involve all relevant Commonwealth agencies from the beginning of any negotiations;</para><para>.	 the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet ensure that all Australians have the opportunity to put their views on all aspects of any negotiating text as part of an open and public process, and</para><para>.	 from the beginning of any negotiations towards such an agreement, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet forward written reports on a six-monthly basis to the Commonwealth about their content and progress.</para><para>The committee concluded that simply because of the things that were involved with a multilateral agreement on investment. We had to provide treatment to foreign companies and foreign investors equal to that applied to national companies and investors, and a whole raft of problems could flow from that. The compensation provisions of the Multilateral 
 Agreement on Investment could allow for private companies to actually sue governments—local governments, state governments and/or the national government. As it was proposed in the draft form—where it had got to prior to us withdrawing from negotiations—you could actually see us having to repeal democratically made governmental decisions to comply with an international agreement. That is not a position any government or country should allow itself to be put into.</para><para>We have been debating in this chamber—and will debate again in this chamber—the full privatisation of Telstra. What I found very interesting in the draft agreement was where telecommunications was placed. There were schedules attached to this agreement, and telecommunications was placed in the section that had the roll-back provisions applied to it. The roll-back provisions under the then draft multilateral agreement on investment required a country to remove any restriction on foreign ownership of companies, be they public or private.</para><para>Despite the claims of the government at the time that they were going to legislate for only up to, I think, 35 per cent or a maximum of five per cent in any single holding of foreign ownership, if we had signed off on a multilateral agreement on investment we could have found ourselves being required to roll back that legislative restriction that we had in place—to remove it over time—to allow for the possibility of 100 per cent foreign ownership of Telstra. That is the reality of where we were heading to under the progress of the multilateral agreement that was being negotiated.</para><para>Of course, the other thing is that it could have possibly led to the elimination of the Foreign Investment Review Board, which is there, supposedly, to make an assessment of what is in the national interest with regard to foreign investment in this country. It would seek to lock in a whole range of deregulatory measures, such as the one I spoke about with regard to the roll-back provisions and stand-still provisions. I was reading what is a critical analysis by Mr Graham Dunkley. I will read some of the words from that analy 
 sis because I think he has very succinctly outlined some of the concerns and some of the arguments that ought to be put. He says:</para><para>Finally, the ultimate argument for the MAI is that FDI—</para><para>which is foreign direct investment—</para><para>is good, TNCs—</para><para>which is transnational companies—</para><para>are good, globalization is good; perhaps even greed is good. The traditional arguments for FDI are that it will supplement savings, expand investment, boost GDP growth, generate exports, create jobs, bring new technologies, improve skills and generally enhance innovation.</para><para>There is now a vast literature on these issues and the results are not as clear as MAI supporters assume. Certainly FDI can bolster savings, investment and income, but only if new investment continues to out-weight profit repatriations. Exports may only be generated if TNCs choose to make the country an export platform. The balance of payments will only be improved if exports are generated, counter-imports are not too high, adverse transfer pricing is not used and capital is imported (rather than simply raised locally as the new foreign private owners of Australia's airports have done).</para><para>I think that is a very valid point because, if we are about negotiating an agreement, then we ought to be negotiating on the basis of what is in the national interest. The negotiators we had under Treasury, who were gung-ho about this, were clearly not taking into account the sorts of circumstances that have been highlighted by Mr Dunkley.</para><para>I think the government still owes this parliament and the people of Australia a better explanation and a better response than it has thus provided with respect to where it was headed. It is all very good for some government senators to say, `Look, you started it.' You happen to be in government now.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">WEST</name><name role="display">Senator West</name></talker><para>—They have been there for three years.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—As Senator West just pointed out, you have been there for three years.

 French have jumped back in, will we be back in? I would be very interested to hear from the government to find out whether or not we will be back in if the French are back in. I think it is a disgrace and I look forward to the government's response to this, the final report on the MAI, and seeing where we are headed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>3334</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Many of the matters I was going to raise have been raised by Senator Murphy in his excellent speech. The committee that was looking at this—an international committee of the OECD—has now broken up. That does not mean that we have to cease to be concerned about the flow of international capital. As you would know much better than I, Mr Acting Deputy President, this is what the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which produced this report, was looking at. It is an excellent committee. It was looking at what the Australian Treasury was doing with other like bodies around the world within the OECD. What they were doing was working out the rules or the absence of rules that should operate in respect of capital as it went international, how it could be transferred, and so on.</para></talk.start><para>The report of the committee says that should another institution arise, should another treaty be contemplated regulating the flow of capital around the world, then Australia should be in the body that looks at that issue. And so it should be because the issue of the flow of capital around the world is a big one, as has been very much indicated in recent times with the disasters that have occurred in Asian nations and elsewhere.</para><para>If we are going to look at the flow of international capital around the world, we should be in a position to know exactly what capital is doing and how industry in our own country has been affected by the flow of money. There is some concern that we are going ahead with policy making without being fully aware of all the implications that come from the flow of capital and come from the issue of what companies might charge, for example. Prices that are charged and paid affect the flow of capital. In that context, it is interesting to look at the recent publication of 
 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission entitled <inline font-style="italic">Telecommunications Charges in Australia.</inline> I was reminded of this by the remarks that Senator Murphy made about Telstra. It is interesting to see what the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has to say about current pricing information. It says:</para><para>There is no official, published collection of telecommunications prices in Australia. However, Telstra is required to file its tariffs with the Commission and the compliance conditions under the price cap also require it to apply a methodology for estimating and reporting price changes to the Commission. Consequently, the Commission holds a full set of prices of Telstra's services and equipment, and interpretive data in respect of most of Telstra's price-capped services.</para><para>The Government has indicated its intention to legislate to require telecommunications carriers to report price and volume data across a range of specified services to the Commission to allow it to provide regular, impartial, public reports of pricing and market share.</para><para>It is good to see the government entering into the business world and to bring into it certain regulations and requirements so that the business world can function and operate to the good of the community generally and provide information that is needed to set up a policy, first of all nationally but ultimately internationally, that will enable the riches of the world—which is what capital really is—to be used in the most productive manner.  It is a matter of some amazement, I suggest, that we have not got available to us at this stage the sort of information that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says we should have.</para><para>I want to make these points. Firstly, the Multilateral Agreement on Investment is not going to come into operation because the people that were discussing it—people from various countries around the world, including Australia, all within the OECD—have ceased to discuss it. The proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment is finished. Secondly, it indicates that there is a need and an appetite for some international agreement about the flow of capital. Thirdly, it is likely that there will be a return to a discussion about how international capital should be 
 treated by the various countries around the world.</para><para>Fourthly, if you look at the sorts of comments that are made in this report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, it is essential that there be some requirement that such issues as the prices that are charged and the market share that particular companies have be looked at by government or by government agencies. In other words, there should be some supervision by governments—not only the Australian government but governments around the world—as to what is happening with investment and what is happening with companies of the size of Telstra.</para><para>Fifthly, the most important point is that, given all those things, there now ought to be development of some public policy as to how we as a nation are going to handle the flow of capital and how we are going to handle what that capital does. The useful exercise of capital is to build up business. We have got to look at what businesses it builds up and how those businesses operate within the marketplace, and so form a national policy and then an international policy which will produce the goods we are looking for. Then we need to look at how the goods, the capital or the products of the various companies we are talking about will be distributed fairly—this is perhaps the part that is not looked at enough these days—not only within Australia but around the world.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Procedure Committee</title><page.no>3335</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>3335</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 24 March 1999, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline>:</para><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>3335</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Yesterday I was speaking about my support for the motion moved by Senator West, particularly those aspects that relate to the actions of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, who undertook most disgraceful and most inappropriate action in orchestrating witnesses to appear before a Senate committee, under the cover of departmental witness 
 es, in such a manner as to provide aid and comfort to this government in its campaign to impose upon the workers of this country further attacks upon their conditions and their employment security in the matter of the unfair dismissals laws that they were proposing.</para></talk.start><para>In January this year, the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee inquired into this proposed law and heard witnesses from a range of backgrounds and from a range of organisations, yet this government, in a most sneaky and underhand manner, sought to bring to this committee as witnesses private citizens who appeared together with departmental witnesses. I was the deputy chair of the Senate committee, and I asked the committee to refer this matter to the Procedure Committee. The Procedure Committee has agreed that this is a most inappropriate action and, in its report, highlights:</para><para>Following a hearing of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee on the unfair dismissals legislation, concern was expressed at the action of the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business in bringing private witnesses with officers of the department who were to appear before the committee, with the intention that the evidence of those witnesses support the bill.</para><para>It went on to say:</para><para>The Procedure Committee considers that it would be highly undesirable, from the standpoint of both the Senate and the government, for departments to fall into this practice, particularly in inquiries by legislation committees into bills.</para><para>It further says:</para><para>It is not the role of the departments to be gathering private witnesses in support of a bill and insinuating them into committee hearings under the cover of an appearance by departmental officers. Such private witnesses, if they are invited by the committee to appear, should be heard separately.</para><para>Clearly these are views that I strongly endorse.</para><para>Of course I understand that this is not a contentious proposition—that all senators would naturally agree with this report. The evidence that was heard in the estimates committee demonstrated quite clearly the deep involvement of this minister in these 
 disgraceful actions. The committee resolved, after discussion, that it would report this matter to the Senate and that the committee would write to all ministers indicating that this practice is inappropriate and that if witness expenses are to be paid by others this should be known to the committees concerned.</para><para>These actions came about as a result of an invitation that was issued through the minister's office and the department for Mr Clive and Bryce Tonkin from Adelaide and Mr Frank Denvir and Mr Clement Maloney from Melbourne to fly to Canberra at departmental expense, at a cost of $2,268.60, and to appear before the committee with departmental officers. This was a most inappropriate course of action, as it was apparent that at least one of the witnesses was currently engaged in a matter before courts in this country and that other witnesses were involved in matters which had nothing whatsoever to do with the current law insofar as the unfair dismissal concerns they had related to state legislation, not to federal or Commonwealth law.</para><para>I must say that these witnesses must feel terribly badly treated in all of this, because I do not believe that they personally were necessarily involved in any action that was inappropriate but that they in good faith would have been asked by the government to come along and give their views. I can understand citizens wanting to do that. What they would not have understood is that they were being used in a cheap and tawdry political stunt to be the paid cheer squad for  departmental officers who were obviously short on strong argument to defend the government's position.</para><para>When Mr Denvir spoke to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper, as reported on 9 February this year, he said that `the visit to Canberra had left him out of pocket and had also cost him a day's lost work.' Mr Clive Tonkin said, `I was more than happy to pay my own expenses.' Yet the government, with all the largesse that governments have when they are trying to engage in these sorts of political stunts, paid the expenses of these witnesses to appear.  </para><para>The department and a senior officer of the department, Dr Shergold, indicated that it was the minister's office that suggested this course of action. And given the minister's involvement in the conspiracy matters associated with the Dubai affair, one could expect the concern that officers would have about being told that they should comply. I am very disappointed, however, that departmental officers sought to act in this way, because what apparently occurred, from the evidence we had, is that Dr Shergold apparently made little attempt to evaluate the evidence that was likely to be presented by these witnesses, and he obviously did not give any consideration to the unprecedented actions that were being embarked upon in the use of private witnesses appearing with departmental witnesses in this way. He had not understood that two of the witnesses were to give testimony about matters that had nothing to do with the Commonwealth law. He had obviously not thought about the involvement of Mr Maloney in the dispute before AIRC and that therefore, in my judgment, it was sub judice for him to appear.</para><para>What had occurred was that a junior clerk had been assigned the task of providing a cursory glance at possible witnesses to meet the minister's request to find suitable persons who could fill the role as cheer squad members. We understand that the department undertook to provide these names, but it was the minister's office that finally came up with them; it was the minister's office that came up with the stunt; and it was the minister's office that manipulated the normal departmental processes in engaging the department to facilitate these actions. And it was the coalition members of the committee that went along with these inappropriate actions.</para><para>An important consideration that does arise is whether this action is strictly speaking within the standing orders and should be put to one side. But we all know the precedents that are being set and how wrong it is for departments to act in this way. While there may not be, strictly speaking, anything in the standing orders to prevent a party from paying the expenses of witnesses before committ 
 ees—we all understand there is a provision within the standing orders to allow that to occur—it may however be a contempt of the Senate. I certainly believe that the Senate is being treated in a contemptuous way by this minister.</para><para>It may be contempt in that payments may be made by departments while seeking to deliberately conceal them from a committee, particularly in conjunction with circumstances where the committee could be misled as to the status of such witnesses or the nature of the evidence that they are about to present. It may well be that payment is made in an attempt to influence a witness as to the nature of the evidence that the witness should be giving and that the evidence may be tainted by the actions of the department in providing this inducement. It may well be that payments associated with this form of action may be an improper attempt to influence the character of evidence being given.</para><para>For those reasons, while I think there may not necessarily be procedural barriers to this action occurring, it is totally inappropriate. And therefore I support the view that the President of the Senate should be writing to all departmental secretaries and government ministers and telling them that this is just not on; that this is not an appropriate course of action to be embarked upon by this government.</para><para>We know that this government have a contempt for the parliamentary processes. We have seen it in the way in which they have sought to rort the Senate's voting system when they have advocated positions to undermine the authority of the Senate when it suits them. They are obviously not happy with the use of the Senate legislation committees to inquire into legislation, particularly extremely unpopular, unfair and unreasonable legislation, such as the unfair dismissals legislation. And of course it may well be that they think it is their right to impose witnesses in this way but, quite clearly, this is not action that ought to be countenanced by this Senate.

At the outset, I should declare some personal interest in tonight's debate—I have to admit to being an avid Essendon fan. It is not as bad as being a Carlton fan, I guess. It just so happens that the mighty Bombers are playing their first game of the season tonight against Carlton. Many residents of my electorate of the Northern Territory are fanatical followers of Australian football. AFL plays a very important part in their lives, as indeed it does for a lot of Australians, especially Victorians.</para></talk.start><para>As you may know, over the years the Territory has produced some outstanding AFL footballers, people like Maurice Rioli—now a Territory Labor MLA, Michael Long, Andrew McLeod, Robbie AhMat and Mark West, just to name a few. However, the issue that I want to speak about tonight is that the residents of the majority of remote Territory communities—whose residents, I should add, are predominantly Aboriginal—will be missing out on watching broadcasts of the AFL games. They have already missed out on watching the excitement of the preseason Ansett Cup competition. Football is big in the Territory's Aboriginal communities. Young Aboriginal kids love to play and love to watch.</para><para>Football is a big community event. If you visit any of the Territory's remote communities, you will always see young Aboriginal kids playing football, emulating their AFL heroes, wearing their jumpers. I am thinking of such Top End communities as Barunga, Daguragu, Pine Creek, Milingimbi, Yirrkala and Mataranka; and Central Australian communities such as Areyonga, Yuendumu, Santa Teresa, Willowra, Nyirrpi, Hermannsburg, Wallace Rockhole, Mutitjulu and Docker River—and the list goes on. These are remote communities, mad keen on AFL football and now unable to watch the Channel 7 footy broadcasts. I should also point out that many communities in the area of South Australia stretching from Moomba to Ceduna, which also receive Imparja broadcasts, may miss out on AFL broadcasts.</para><para>Next week I intend to table a petition signed by over 400 Territorians living in remote locations, who are upset that they cannot access AFL broadcasts in their communities. How did this happen, and why am I on my feet in the Senate to talk about this? On 23 December last year, the Australian Broadcasting Authority extended the broadcast areas of the Aboriginal owned Imparja Television, which broadcasts out of Alice Springs, and the Telecasters owned television station, then a Channel 10 affiliate, which broadcasts out of Townsville. The extension of their broadcasting licences allows Channel 7 Central and Imparja to broadcast into each 
 other's broadcast areas. This move gave viewers access, theoretically anyway, to two commercial channels.</para><para>At the same time, Telecasters decided to become an affiliate of Channel 7 Network from 1 February this year, giving them full access to Seven Network programming, including the AFL. As a result, Imparja, which had broadcast AFL games to remote communities via satellite for the past 10 or so years, lost the right to show AFL games—meaning that those communities that only get Imparja can no longer automatically watch the AFL broadcasts.</para><para>As a result of all this, these remote communities have three alternatives. They can keep Imparja, and go without Channel 7 Central and the football; they can choose to give up Imparja—with its local news, Aboriginal programs and other programming—and switch over to Channel 7 Central; or they can purchase the additional decoder and apply to the Australian Broadcasting Authority for a licence that would allow them to access and retransmit the additional commercial channel. However, if they decide to proceed with the latter—which is the most preferable because it gives them access to all TV channels—and buy the equipment, they need to find anywhere between $8,000 and $30,000, depending on whether they are a self-help or BRACS community, and depending on what transponders and transmission equipment they need.</para><para>For many remote communities, many of which are impoverished and barely managing with the local government funding they receive, that sort of money is simply out of the reach of most of them. Channel 7 Central has said it will install the necessary retransmission equipment, but only in communities larger than 2,000 people. However, this excludes the Territory's remote communities, which vary in size from about 400 to 1,000 people. I believe that the Territory's remote communities are entitled to access the AFL on the same terms as other Australians do. I firmly believe that a universal service obligation should be introduced for Australia's broadcasting services to ensure that all Australians have access to a range of broadcasting 
 services—including broadcasts of what is, after all, Australia's national game, AFL. As was pointed out in the report on <inline font-style="italic">Communications with Australia's External Territories</inline>, which was tabled in the Senate this week:</para><para>Broadcasting services are not just a commercial matter. They influence both cultural identity and the Australian people's sense of national integration. For this reason it is in Australia's long term interest to ensure that all Australians receive a variety of Australian broadcast services through clear and reliable signals.</para><para>Last week, in what can only be described as a very cynical move aimed at softening up the Senate for the debate on the further sale of Telstra, the federal government announced it would allocate funds to improve broadcasting services to remote and regional communities.</para><para>The government said this move would give BRACS, the Broadcasting in Remote Aboriginal Communities Scheme, and `self-help' communities in remote areas of Australia access to a second commercial channel and hence access to AFL football broadcasts. Self-help communities are those communities which decided not to install individual decoder dishes but instead bought a community transmitter. The funding would help them buy additional transmitters and a satellite decoder by providing for 75 per cent of the cost of the purchase. But, and here's the catch, these funds would come from the further sale of Telstra, which the government had hoped the Senate would pass this week.</para><para>However, we saw what happened with the government's Telstra bill this week. At the last moment, after a few hours of debate, the government pulled the bill from the Senate for an `indefinite' period of time. I am glad the bill has been pulled because I do not believe the sale of Telstra will benefit my constituents in the Northern Territory. It would simply lead to a reduction in the quality of telecommunication services. I also do not believe that the provision of adequate broadcasting services to Australians living in remote communities should be dependent on the further sale of Telstra. Instead, the federal government should ensure access to broadcasting services is provided to all Australians as a right, independent of Telstra's future.</para><para>The federal government has made a mess of the aggregation process involving Imparja and Channel 7 Central. It should have ensured that viewers would be able to maintain the existing viewing, especially programs such as AFL broadcasts, or rugby league, in the case of Northern Queensland viewers. The least the federal government can do now, in the short term, is immediately ensure that Imparja is given the right to broadcast AFL games for the 1999 year or until all remote communities are able to access the additional commercial channel.</para><para>Senator Alston should immediately call the AFL, Channel 7 Central and Imparja together to find a short-term solution so that those residents of remote communities can access those AFL broadcasts. The most obvious solution to the problem in the short term is for Channel 7 Central to allow a program swap, which would meet the needs of both stations' viewers in the short term. I also point out that Senator Ian Macdonald, the minister for territories, speaking on ABC radio last week misled Territorians by saying that Channel 7 and Imparja had agreed to a temporary program swap. When the stations were asked about this program swap, they knew nothing about it. It makes you wonder if this government knows what is actually happening in remote and regional Australia. Imagine the outcry if Australians living in Melbourne or Sydney suddenly found they couldn't access the AFL or the cricket.</para><para>It is simply not good enough for the federal government to ignore the problem or to promise that all the problems will be solved by the privatisation of Telstra. The government is being irresponsible in getting the hopes up of those residents of remote communities and using them as political footballs in this outrageous debate. I call on the government to act immediately to ensure that residents of remote communities have adequate broadcasting services and that all Territorians can access their footy.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Work for the Dole </title><page.no>3339</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>3339</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to inform the Senate and the general public of a conspiracy between the state ALP government and the

If you want me to refer to regional Australia, I will give you some figures on that. Last week, I was lucky enough to present the graduate certificates to two of these Work for the Dole projects in northern New South Wales. One was at the Walka Water Works in the federal electorate of Patterson and the other was the Mingara Centre in the federal seat of Dobell. The Walka Water Works scheme employed 180 local unemployed youth, with 80 per cent of them expressing satisfaction with the program and 30 per cent of them coming out of this with full-time jobs. Nationally, the average is higher, with 32 per cent of long-term unemployed emerging with full-time work and 10 per cent going on to further education and training.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But if the ALP and the unions had their way, this program would not have existed. Sixty young people in the seat of Patterson and 40 in the seat of Dobell would still be unemployed or not be taking it upon themselves to do further formal training. Despite the weight of evidence that the Work for the Dole scheme has been an outstanding success, the state ALP and their union co-conspirators are trying to block its path. The Australian Workers Union has this month blocked five Work for the Dole projects in New South Wales. These would have occupied more than 500 people who have been long-term unemployed in the towns of Port Macquarie, Armidale, Dorrigo, Grafton and South West Rocks.</para><para>On average, 200 young people who participated in the courses would have come out with a formal qualification and a job. But, because of one intransigent union official in a Sydney office, that has all been blocked and all of those young people will miss out on a job. That is 200 jobs in rural and regional Australia thrown away. The five projects to be undertaken in these towns were supported by the National Parks and Wildlife Service 
 and the local union organisers. But it was the state organiser, who obviously did not understand what was going on and did not understand the need for jobs in this area, who actually blocked it.</para><para>Across the country, this scheme has been working very successfully. The Howard government has now put in place 412 Work for the Dole programs, employing 18,000 young people. That is about to expand over the next four years to 125,000 long-term unemployed being given the opportunity to gain a job. That translates, on current trends, into 40,000 people in work, and 12,500 more people in formal education.</para><para>It is much more successful than the Labor government's failed Working Nation program. It is returning on average 32 per cent long-term unemployed into the work force, at a cost of $3,900, on average, compared to the enormous costs that existed under Labor's failed Working Nation program. We all remember the hundreds of millions of dollars that were wasted on that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—What was the percentage out of LEAP?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—We have a more effective and efficient program, Senator Forshaw. We are getting better job outcomes at a much lower rate—32 per cent is higher than Working Nation, and $3,900 is a hell of a lot lower than the $52,000 that your New Work Opportunities Program was costing. Senator Forshaw has gone quiet, and it is no wonder. Senator Forshaw should listen to some of his colleagues. I suggest he listens to and reads the work of the member for Melbourne, Lindsay Tanner, and of the member for Werriwa, Mark Latham. If Senator Forshaw listens to what they have to say, and reads what they have written about this, he will find that they tend to agree more with me than they do with him—which is why, I assume, one of them is languishing on the back bench.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Returning to the initial program where we are trying to expand Work for the Dole, it is very unfortunate that Premier Carr and the unions have stopped this going ahead.

It also vetoed youth wage rates, putting at risk the job security of 420,000 young Australians. We are not talking about new measures here. We are talking about measures that are in place which, because of the discrimination act, will cease next year unless the Senate amends it. To keep the current arrangements in place the Senate has to amend it. This opposition has refused to do that and puts at risk current jobs. You are not talking about creating new jobs; you are putting at risk up to 420,000 current jobs.</para><para>They have opposed legislation to extend mutual obligation, which is the foundation for such things as Work for the Dole. They have also rejected the coalition's enhanced apprenticeship scheme. We really have to ask this Labor opposition why they are so anti work. Why are they so anti programs that are going to put people in work? Why do they continually oppose in this chamber legislation which will assist programs that will give people real jobs?</para><para>Let me go back to what we were trying to do with Work for the Dole initially and see how Labor measure up now. We aimed to develop work habits in young people, to involve the local community in quality projects provided for these people, to help the young unemployed at the end of the projects to achieve real jobs and to provide communities with projects in their local community—such as the ones I saw at Walka Water Works—which will improve their standard. Everything, as far as this program 
 has travelled to date, indicates success, and continuing success will come with the government's dramatic expansion of this program over the next few years.</para><para>The young people I met at Walka Water Works and at the Mingara Centre were very heartened by their experience. There were very positive comments from them, their parents and the local community that was benefiting from these projects. It is obviously easier for the opposition to sit back and knock everything this government is doing for unemployment rather than try to support outcomes that will provide the youth of this nation with real jobs.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Keating, Mr Paul: Piggery</title><page.no>3341</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>3341</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On Sunday, 21 March 1999, the <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline>  program provided to the Australian people a devastating expose of former Labor leader Keating's financial transactions associated with his now infamous piggery. In typical Keatingesque style, he denied the allegations with a flourish. He called them a `hatchet job'. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>  reported on 23 March 1999 at page 7:</para></talk.start><para>Mr Keating said after the program screened on Sunday night that the "option did exist".</para><para>"It was not owned by me," he said. "But even if it had been, I was not required to disclose it."</para><para>Given that the option existed, the former Labor leader's other quotable quote—reported in the editorial of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>  of 23 March 1999 at page 16—needs full analysis. In that editorial the former Labor leader is quoted as saying:</para><para>"Everything I told Parliament was completely correct" . . . </para><para>So what did the former Labor leader tell the parliament? In answer to an opposition question on this very matter, dealing with the piggery and his personal financial transactions, the former Labor leader told the House of Representatives on 24 March 1994—that is exactly five years and one day ago—that:</para><para>The honourable gentleman—</para><para>referring to Mr McLachlan, the then member for Barker—</para><para>seems to know much, but he does not know that I disposed of my interest in this business nearly two weeks ago. He does not know that, but I am telling him.</para><para>So Labor's former leader, Mr Keating, announced to the world that he had disposed of his interest. Because he was not forthcoming with proof, we had to accept that assertion. However, it is now quite clear that the former Labor leader sold his shares but, in a slick deal, retained an interest—contrary to what he told the parliament—by retaining an option to buy back. Either he or a company with which he was associated held that option. The option was later sold for over $1 million. It would not be an exaggeration to claim that one million dollars plus is an interest, indeed a substantial interest.</para><para>An option is clearly an interest. As the value of the company increases, so does the value of the option, and therefore pulling strings or doing things to advantage the company are actions which increase the value of the option—a very clear interest in anyone's language. As such, there existed a responsibility to disclose the option. Indeed the former Labor leader appeared in 1975—some 20 years earlier, before he pulled this particular stunt—before a parliamentary committee setting rules for disclosing members' outside interests. A report of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shows Keating gave the hypothetical example of an MP being able to hide a profit if he had:</para><para>"an option to purchase for an infinitesimal amount, a property or shares, at sometime in the future, and only one copy ever existed and that was with the member himself—no-one", said Keating, "could ever say that had received it."</para><para>All hypothetical of course, but not so hypothetical in this case because, as has now been revealed, this is exactly what the former Labor leader did. The state of the evidence is now very clear. Mr Keating, the former Labor leader, did mislead the House—no splitting of hairs. No silver-tongued apologist can deny that. This should be a matter of grave concern to all honourable senators and members and to all Australians.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales: Election</title><page.no>3342</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3342</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As all senators would be aware, there is an election this coming Saturday for the lower and upper houses of the New South Wales parliament.

That is an issue of great importance—I do not need to convince anyone in this chamber of the importance of upper houses and the vital role they play in ensuring some sort of parliamentary check on the role of the government of the day.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—That is why you haven't got one in Queensland.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—As Senator Forshaw said, it is a great shame—I think that is what he said; I am sure he would have said that it is a great shame—that we do not have one in Queensland. We have seen some of the unfortunate impacts in my own state of Queensland of not having a proper degree of parliamentary scrutiny of the actions of government. Nonetheless, it is important that the representatives of any parliamentary chamber are capable people elected under a system that has the confidence of the people and that is suitably democratic.</para></talk.start></continue><para>A lot of attention has been paid to the size of the ballot paper in the upper house in New South Wales, which is due to the ability of people to get elected virtually entirely on the basis of undertaking arrangements in relation to preferences with other small groups without having to get any significant degree of support from the general public. The big difference between that chamber and any other upper house is that, in any other proportional system that operates within Australia, a candidate is rarely able to get elected unless they have a significant proportion of public support; the basis then being that the preference flows from excluded candidates provide a greater opportunity for the proper democratic wishes of the public to be reflected in the eventual outcome in the chamber.</para><para>What is probably even more disconcerting in relation to the situation in New South Wales—apart from the people that the public 
 basically knows nothing about, many of whom are unable to be contacted—is the ability of people to register themselves as a party. There is no requirement for that party name to accurately represent what that organisation is about, enabling them to completely misrepresent what they are about.</para><para>Perhaps one of the most obvious examples is a party that was registered as the Animal Liberation Party. The registered officer and certainly any members that have been able to be identified of that party have no connection with the Animal Liberation organisation in New South Wales. There is no commonality of membership and no commonality of purpose. Any reasonable person who sees a party called the Animal Liberation Party would assume that they had some connection with or support from Animal Liberation in that state. Clearly that is not the case in this situation.</para><para>We have a party that is basically standing under false pretences, giving a completely false indication of what their support base is and what their philosophy is about. Apart from the potential to mislead the voters, this also leads to the potential for the genuine organisation—and I use the Animal Liberation organisation by way of example—to be discredited by any statements or actions by people who are registered under that name.</para><para>It is a matter that is of great concern to the Democrats because it does bring the democratic system into disrepute. The crucial aspect of retaining what is left of public support for the democratic system and for our system of government is to ensure that the public has confidence in the electoral system and confidence in the accuracy of what people stand for when they stand for election. When the balance between being able to democratically choose and ensuring that the representation of parliament accurately reflects the views of the population is weakened by a system that has the potential to end up being not much more than a lottery, obviously the confidence of the public in that system can be significantly reduced.</para><para>This is an issue that, certainly as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Electoral Matters, I will be pursuing with interest, particularly in terms of the ability of 
 people to register under a party name that implies association with an existing and well-known community organisation. The example I gave of the Animal Liberation Party is but one of many parties that will be standing on Saturday for election to the New South Wales upper house. A number of other parties have registered under names that give quite a misleading indication of what their actual association and orientation is about. That can only be bad for democracy.</para><para>The Democrats, as honourable senators would know, have long supported a proportional representation form of voting. That voting system is one that we believe is strongly supported by the public because it does provide an outcome that most accurately reflects the views of the public. That is why chambers such as the Senate have strong support amongst the public. They know that its composition more fairly and accurately represents the views of people. They feel less disenfranchised than they do under systems such as those that operate in the lower house.</para><para>The situation in the New South Wales upper house is unfortunate, not specifically because of it being proportional representation but as much because of the great degree of ease with which people can register as a political party and pass themselves off as something other than what they represent. Perhaps more to the point, they can pass themselves off as a legitimate political party—and clearly a large proportion of those standing on the weekend are not legitimate. When people are able to register a political party purely as a publicity stunt for their commercial television program, that is a situation with the potential to further devalue the confidence people have in the democratic system. In that circumstance, I believe this is an issue that needs to be examined.</para><para>We are fortunate that we do not have a problem of that degree at the federal level. Certainly I will be keen to ensure that the problems that have been evident in New South Wales do not repeat themselves at the federal level. I am sure many parties in New South Wales will also be trying to ensure that the system there is modified so that a more 
 reputable and democratic system is in operation.</para><para>In closing, as a reaffirmation of the importance of the democratic process, I wish all candidates of all parties and persuasions the best on Saturday. I think it is important that people do participate in the political process. It is always a positive thing to have community debate and to have the opportunity for people to have a say as to who will represent them in their parliamentary system. In relation to the very important role of the upper house, I do urge the voters of New South Wales to think carefully, take the time to unfold that beach towel of a ballot paper and make sure they realise that they will be stuck for eight years with whoever they put a No. 1 next to. It is an important choice and I urge them to think carefully before they cast their vote.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>3344</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.24 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>3344</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>3344</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act—Statement under subsection 122A(3)—Suspension and removal from office of a regional councillor.</para><para>Australian Postal Corporation Act—Regulations—Statutory Rules 1999 No. 41.</para><para>Christmas Island Act—Ordinance—</para><para>No. 1 of 1999 (Interpretation Amendment Ordinance 1999 (No. 1)).</para><para>No. 2 of 1999 (<inline font-style="italic">Interpretation Act 1984 (W.A.)

Objections were received, and after independent assessment, were formally considered by the Commission on 25 November 1996. As a result 
 the Commission decided to redefine the boundaries of the place and re-enter the place in the Interim List as `Beeliar Regional Park and Adjacent Areas'. A notice of intention to register the redefined area was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>  and press on 24 June 1997. </para><para>No objections were received to the registration of the redefined area, however issues did arise in relation to the exact boundary of the park as defined by the Western Australian Ministry for Planning. Resolution of these issues is being pursued by the Commission to allow finalisation of the registration of the place.</para><para>(3) The guidelines referred to by the honourable senator are used by the Commission to set a priority for assessment for the initial step in registration, ie entry in the Interim List. The wetlands are in the Interim List and by virtue of section 31 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 are deemed to be in the Register for the purposes of protection under that Act.</para><para></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs: Provision of Newspapers, Magazines and Periodicals to Ministers</title><page.no>3352</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 536)</subtitle><id.no>536</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3352</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1999:</para></talk.start><para>What was the total cost during the 1997-98 financial year of the provision of newspapers, magazines and other periodicals to the minister's: (a) Parliament House office; (b) home/state ministerial office; and (c) private home.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3352</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(a) $2,632.20</para><para>(b) Nil</para><para>(c) These costs are met personally.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
