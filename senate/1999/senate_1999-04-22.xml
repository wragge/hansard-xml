How will the government ensure Tasmania is treated fairly in comparison to the more affluent and larger States? Tasmania, on a per capita basis, has the highest unemployment, lowest average weekly wage, the oldest population, the greatest number of people dependent on government income support and the most decentralised population of any state of Australia. The government's model for estimating the cost of the GST does not allow for the different economic and social patterns between states.</para><para>2. How will the government ensure families can afford good food which will be relatively more expensive in respect to `junk' foods whose price will decrease after the removal of sales tax? Tasmanians pay the highest costs for food in Australia and are among the worst health status population in Australia.</para><para>3. How will the government ensure that organisations and charities can continue to provide the necessary community services and support to disadvantaged citizens? Community organisations and charities in Tasmania will face a double jeopardy from the implementation of the Tax Package. It is predicted that poverty in Tasmania will increase and more people will be seeking extra assistance. At the same time organisations will have a reduced capacity to meet those needs because of increased administrative costs associated with compliance and in many instances reduced revenue because of the application of the tax to such things as membership fees and fund raising. 
</para><para>4. How will government ensure that service quality and scope of education, child care and health services can be maintained without increasing the costs of these services? The government proposes that essential services such as education, child care and health will be GST free. However, community based organisations offering these services will have increased costs arising from the extra administration and accounting requirements of the tax package.</para><presenter><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name><name.id>9L6</name.id></talker><para>Senator Mackay(from 83 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><para>Petition received.</para></petition.group><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>4089</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>4089</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline> to move, on the next day of sitting:</para><para>That on Tuesday, 27 April 1999:</para><para>(a)	 the hours of meeting shall be 12.30 pm to 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm to 11.40 pm;</para><para>(b)	 the routine of business from 12.30 pm to 2 pm and from 7.30 pm to 11 pm shall be government business only;

This legislation provides no scope for immediate deductibility of expenditure which has occurred after 1 January 2000. Under this system, such expenditure will, for consideration, fall under the proposed new general rules and will generally have to be written off over a far lengthier period.</para></talk.start><para>This is an unusual approach for the government, as presumably the proportion of expenses relating to the development of software to overcome the millennium bug after 1 January 2000 will be devoted to urgent remediation works required for systems which are either not functioning properly or not functioning at all. Indeed, these problems may not become immediately apparent. Rather, the progressive corruption of the software will occur over time, and those problems will only come to light as they impact upon business operations.</para><para>Surely responsible government should be encouraging businesses to remedy any problems and give them an entitlement to an immediate deduction for remedial millennium 
 bug expenses, at least until 30 June 2000. For this reason, the opposition has proposed an end date of 1 July 2000. This amendment merely brings forward the expenses that would otherwise be claimed later, thus allowing savings to be made in the government's forward estimates which would no doubt have been factored into the government's estimates of the general software depreciation provisions.</para><para>The inclusion of a multiple purchase rule in the bill means that, when the total expenditure on identical software in an income year is $300 or less, an immediate write-off of expenditure is available to businesses. This is a measure which the ALP supports, as it effectively means that these minor assets will be treated in the same manner as all items of plant and equipment which are valued at under $300.</para><para>This bill also provides special rules for those who develop software. These taxpayers will be able to make a once-only election to pool their expenditure. Once this election has been made, all expenditure incurred in the developing of software in an income year is to be pooled and written off at a rate of 40 per cent in the following two years and 20 per cent in the third year. This is a reasonable position for the government to take, given its claims that this write-off strikes an appropriate balance between considerations that software is a capital expenditure which should be amortised for taxation purposes and the relatively short expected life of software arising from rapid developments in the information technology sector.</para><para>This bill highlights an area that is worthy of political attention generally, and that is the tax treatment of this particular product and of the recognition of the crucial capability of software to unlock digital knowledge and information. Software expenditure is a significant and increasing expense of business, particularly if it is viewed in the context of converging technologies. It is also an important consideration, given the rapid rate at which online services facilitated by electronic commerce are developing. Every business now is faced with the challenge of either procuring proprietary software or, indeed, 
 building their own business solutions in a computer or digital environment.</para><para>The Internet as a distribution channel for services as well as for retail sales will draw a significant proportion of commercial activity in the future. I cannot think of a business or a commercial entity that will not be confronted by the challenge of working within a digital environment in the very near future. The international nature of the Internet, where location is irrelevant and any form of control is extremely difficult to establish, has the potential to significantly affect other taxation issues, such as taxation revenue, in many countries. The Internet has progressed beyond being an efficient communications medium to become a supply medium. However, the way in which products are delivered on the Internet is determined by the degree to which physical products can be transformed into digital products.</para><para>Information is the most obvious commodity for electronic commerce conveyed through a digital environment and includes both knowledge based products and computer software, including software fixes or patches and new versions and upgrades. This information exchange has the potential to significantly impact on taxation revenue. One example of this problem would include the difficulties associated with isolating an online business which deals in Y2K remediation software to a particular country or location for taxation purposes. This is due to the high global connectivity of the business environment with the Internet facilities and the potential for businesses to locate their premises, their fixed addresses, in nations which provide the best tax benefits. The interaction of this anomaly with the changes proposed in this bill will therefore need to be closely monitored due to the possibility of businesses being able to operate in a particular country in a virtual sense.</para><para>We agree with the need for business tax changes, and we are prepared to give support to measures where it can be demonstrated, as in this case, that those changes will improve productivity and growth by adding to jobs and strengthening industries. It seems to me that this bill certainly recognises current changes 
 and challenges confronting businesses in their growing need for expenditure on software and digital products. In resisting the temptation to speak at length about the GST, I would comment that the information technology sector is finding it hard enough to deal with the issues of the year 2000 problem without having to face the complex issues of the GST which it now has to deal with.</para><para>Time is required for redevelopment and testing of the new software, and the increased cost of software under a GST is yet another barrier the coalition government has created, and one which may begin to stifle this area of Australian innovation. It is interesting to note that whilst the government, in the construction of this bill, is offering a taxation benefit for the costs incurred with Y2K, if the GST bills are passed all software purchased will incur an additional 10 per cent on those costs. So there is some irony in this bill. While providing some respite for business, the overall costs of software to businesses—whether they are for Y2K remediation purposes or for general business operation—will increase under a GST.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>4095</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r722">Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999</inline>  deals with the issue of what business people or people who rely on the proper use of software can deduct from the amount of money they bring into their business before they pay tax on the residue. So it is a classical taxation bill. That is, fair taxation requires a situation where people are not taxed on all the money they get in or on all the income they have. What should be deducted from that income is the cost of earning it. Within the taxation philosophy is the concept that you take away from the amount of money that comes in the amount that you expend for the purpose of earning the profit. That is a matter that affects all business. Indeed, it affects people who have to expend money to earn money. In this case what has been talked about is deductions for certain sums that are expended on software or the development of software.</para></talk.start><para>There has already been some discussion about this matter in the previous speeches that has pointed out many of the issues that are 
 involved. But there is one issue I want to begin with: who will benefit from this legislation in its present form? I want to quote two different passages: one from the Assistant Treasurer's speech and one from the explanatory memorandum. The second reading speech says:</para><para>The measures broadly provide for spending to be written off over 2½ years. In certain circumstances, they also allow an immediate deduction. An immediate deduction will be allowed for software spending of $300 or less and for undeducted spending where software development projects are abandoned. This  will be helpful for small business.</para><para>I think everybody in this chamber, as is certainly evident from the debates that have taken place on the GST, wants to help small business. And so we should, because small business faces a lot of pressures that other business and other people do not. Perhaps I will return to that a little later.</para><para>On page 2 of the explanatory memorandum—I have checked and this seems to be the correct explanatory memorandum—in the context of the summary of the regulation impact statement, the main point is:</para><para>In common with the impact of many other taxation provisions, compliance costs are likely to be most onerous for smaller businesses without dedicated accounting personnel.</para><para>I think that is a matter of some concern. The explanatory memorandum is a memorandum put out by the government that introduces the bill, and it explains what the bill is all about.</para><para>There is a real worry here. The second reading speech says, `We want this measure to be helpful for small business,' and the explanatory memorandum that explains the thrust of the bill says, `In common with the impact of many other taxation provisions, compliance costs are likely to be most onerous for smaller businesses without dedicated accounting personnel.' That probably comes about because, unless you have dedicated accounting personnel, it is getting harder and harder to work out what taxation you have to pay.</para><para>You can have visions of what businesses are all about. There is very big business: international companies that trade and work around the world that are equipped with a lot of personnel, and some of them can work out 
 very accurately what taxation they have to pay. Then there are smaller businesses who may only work within Australia but who nevertheless have the ability, because of their size, to have a particular person or particular group of people working out what income comes into the business, how much tax they should pay and so on. Then you get to the small businesses. But the businesses that I think are badly treated by the system are the ones who cannot afford to have dedicated accounting personnel—for example, plumbers who might be working on their own. They have to do a day's work. Probably on their mobile they have to get the jobs lined up and go around to each one. They have to try to fit in their ability to do a job with the ability of the people they are helping to be at home. There are all sorts of pressures on them. That has to be considered. The opposition will be moving an amendment to this bill which tries to help those sorts of people.</para><para>As the legislation now stands, it allows a tax deduction for expenditure on getting computers into a position where they can cope with the Y2K date. The Y2K issue has become a bit like the doomsday issue where we are almost in fear of it—perhaps we should be and perhaps we should not be. We will wait and see what happens. In any event, the Y2K date issue is at the point where the government and the parliament as a whole say, `Yes, some accommodation should be made.' If you are a business person or a small company with computers and other equipment that require new technology to get them into proper condition by the fateful date of the year 2K, and if this legislation goes through as it is now presented, then you will get a tax deduction if you spend money to get that equipment right by the end of the year or the start of the next year.</para><para> The opposition's suggested amendment is that a further period of six months be given so that small business people in particular might be able to get their equipment right after the Y2K and into the first six months of the year 2000. It was Senator Andrew Murray, a person for whom I have great respect in this area, who said, `No, you shouldn't allow that extra six months because 
 people should have the foresight, the drive and the energy to get their equipment right by the end of the year.' But that does not really take into account the situation that small business gets into.</para><para>For example, take the corner store, which is now fast disappearing because of the competition from supermarkets and what have you. It is the advance—I suppose you have to say—of civilisation that leads to this situation. But there are still people who run small shops such as the corner store. They might sell papers, so they have to be up at 5 o'clock in the morning to get the papers in, cut the string, work out to whom they have to deliver papers and put the balance of the papers on the counter. They have to get their stock onto the shelves, and then people come in and start buying. A lot of worry and energy is expended just keeping the doors open. At the end of the day—it might be 8 or 9 o'clock at night—they close the doors, get their money in and do their own accounting. So they have a very busy day and they have a lot of pressure on them. The return they get from all that effort is usually quite moderate. You might think it would be a reasonable thing to give those people an extra six months so that they are not completely harassed by the burdens they have to put up with.</para><para>I will return to the previous example of plumbers who run small businesses. Since they are not employees, they are not entitled to the benefits of workers compensation, although in some states it might not be worth while being entitled to the benefits of workers compensation because the level is now so low. But leaving that aside, they are not entitled to any workers compensation. They are not entitled to lots of other things that employees are entitled to, although those things seem to be disappearing. Nevertheless, they do not have such entitlements.</para><para>As I say, plumbers are out digging trenches, laying pipes, doing their own paperwork, working out their receipts, working out their next contract, going to the next job and finding people are not home and having to come back. Then they are going home at night and doing all their paperwork. Again, they are getting what could be called fairly 
 moderate returns. We are saying to them, `You not only have to be a labourer digging the ditches, you not only have to be a skilled tradesman putting the pipes together and running the pipes in the right direction, you not only have to be a skilful purchaser of goods because you have to go out and buy the goods and make the decision as to where you are going to lay them, you not only have to be a public relations person because you have to get your custom—not only do you have to do all that but you also have to be your own accountant. Somebody is suggesting that you get an extra six months to get your computers and whatever else you have to get in order because of the Y2K problem.' But people say, `No, you shouldn't be entitled to the extra six months. You have to do all this work, take all this strain but, nevertheless, get yourself into proper shape for the coming Y2K.'</para><para>That is why I say it is a hard thing to give businesses that have the ability to hire, as it says in the explanatory memorandum, dedicated accounting personnel to have all this done the benefit of this legislation but not to give other people who are out there—energetic, decent and honest people—some sort of extension. An extension of six months is suggested in the proposed amendment to allow them to get what those in more powerful positions get. Small businesses may grow into big businesses. We should encourage them. Small businesses—for example, electricians, small shopkeepers or somebody who is trying to develop some new idea so that cars can run better—may stay at the level they are at now. If you give encouragement to those sorts of people, people who are bringing up families, that is a good thing.</para><para>The concepts behind this legislation are good but they could be made better if they were extended to small businesses. Running a small business can be a lonely exercise. Your future may depend upon your health: if you get sick, you are gone. If you make a bad contract, in the sense that you haven't quoted enough, things can go wrong. If you have all this sort of uncertainty upon you, you have to be given some help.</para><para>So the general idea behind the Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999 is supported by this side of the chamber, but this side of the chamber says that instead of having this concession, if that is what it can be called, regarding the expenditure you make on the equipment that you have, which depends upon the chips and other things that may be affected by Y2K, or this help going to 1 January, why not extend the help to 1 July 2000? That would seem reasonable. It would at least give small business a pat on the back in the sense that we are saying: `Yes, we understand your situation and we will try to accommodate it.'</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>4097</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise to address some of the issues related to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999, in particular the provisions related to the Y2K compliance software projects. While the bill is primarily intended to modify the general computer software depreciation provisions, there are also a number of provisions which will significantly modify the treatment of software expenses incurred in attaining year 2000 compliance. Under these provisions expenditure will be immediately deductible if the principal purpose of that expenditure is to ensure that existing systems will be made Y2K compliant.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats, as I am sure all senators are aware, have a great deal of interest in the year 2000 problem or issue. A week ago, amid much fanfare, Senator Alston released the first of the Commonwealth government's Y2K agency reports, as required under the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Act of this year. We were particularly interested in the government fanfare accompanying the release of that report. Once again we were informed that the government was taking the initiative in releasing this information and that the picture was a rosy one.	We have been told that the government is currently meeting targets and that by July this year all systems will be compliant. According to the government, the remainder of the year will be used to prepare contingency plans.</para><para>But there are still numerous concerns raised in the pages of the report. As at 5 February a 
 number of agencies still had significant compliance problems, including the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Australian Customs Service, Comcare, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the Australian Taxation Office. All of those problems are potentially quite serious if compliance is not attained.</para><para>As we approach Anzac Day, I also note that the Department of Veterans' Affairs was only 31 per cent compliant in early February, although there was a footnote to the report indicating that the compliance level has since risen to at least 56 per cent. It should be remembered that the release of these figures in the detailed quarterly report last week was as a result of a non-government amendment to the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Bill.</para><para>The Democrats are not alone in their concerns about compliance. One of Australia's foremost experts, Mr Phil Dodd of Unisys Australia, has stated that the government cannot reasonably expect to complete its compliance program before the end of the year. I guess all of us hope he is proved wrong. The head of the government's Y2K industry program, Mr Graeme Inchley, has separately indicated that it is unreasonable to expect that an organisation like the Australian Taxation Office will be compliant by the end of the year, given the current rate of progress. It is also indicated that the government should adopt best practice and issue monthly reports rather than quarterly reports, which I remind the Senate it was only compelled by non-government amendments to do.</para><para>My colleague Senator Stott Despoja noted other concerns with the Good Samaritan legislation at the time it was discussed in the Senate. She was rightly concerned that the legislation made a number of concessions to businesses which would need to be carefully monitored. The Democrats are keeping a careful watch on the use of the disclosure provisions. We are concerned by recent reports that some of the disclosure provisions of the disclosure legislation have been misused.</para><para>The Australian Democrats are always interested in concessions that are made to businesses. This current legislation makes 
 additional concessions relating to the costs of Y2K compliance. It allows software costs related to year 2000 compliance to be written off directly, which will result in significant costs to government and savings to business.</para><para>We can only hope that problems like this do not roll around too often. We certainly do not want the provisions of this software depreciation legislation to be a reward to slow movers in the business community. We are also concerned that this legislation could be used to write off costs of significant upgrades to non-essential systems.</para><para>Australian business has responded to the year 2000 problem—and the Democrats do acknowledge that—but not as rapidly or effectively as we had hoped. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has warned of a very poor response to a Y2K readiness survey of securities dealers, investment advisers and insurance dealers. The commission was highly concerned with both the low response rates to the survey and the low compliance levels.</para><para>The latest reports to the Australian Stock Exchange by listed companies also show major problems with compliance in a broad range of Australian companies. Costs have increased dramatically and the growing delays in reaching compliance are becoming a major concern.</para><para>Whilst in relation to many other countries in the world Australia has been doing well, the nation as a whole needs to do all it can to improve that performance further. It is not much of a consolation if we are not fully and adequately compliant by the year 2000 and run into problems to sit back and say, `At least we haven't got as many problems as people in other countries.' We need to ensure that we are fully prepared and do not encounter any problems that are in any way avoidable.</para><para>As my colleague Senator Stott Despoja has indicated, the Australian Democrats are also very interested in the year 2000 problem `problem'. I am referring here to the growing fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding the year 2000 problem. During a recent MPI debate, Senator Stott Despoja drew attention to the need for governments to take a leading 
 role in educating and preparing the community for problems that might arise during the transition to the year 2000. This is not because we believe there is going to be widespread community disaster, but because uncertainty and ignorance is not conducive to a calm and appropriate response.</para><para>We need to have decisive action to keep the community informed. Without this, avoidable problems could occur during the transition. I am particularly referring to problems such as bank runs, panic buying and the possibility of a telecommunications crisis. Earlier this month an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> discussed the possibility of self-fulfilling prophecies in this area. A quick calculation was undertaken of the possible effect of all Australians following the advice that has been given to staff of Westpac and the Reserve Bank. These organisations have advised staff to withdraw two weeks' worth of cash in late December to ensure they have enough money to cover the transition to the year 2000. Crude calculations suggest that the amount of cash withdrawn, if all Australians were to follow this advice, would be equivalent to almost half the total amount of coins and notes in circulation.</para><para>I know there are already moves to increase the amount of cash in actual circulation to address anticipated or possible action in the broader community along those lines. This would most likely lead to serious problems with the Australian banking system if there is a significant run on cash withdrawals in the last weeks of this year, this century and this millennium.</para><para>The Australian Democrats call on the government to begin an urgent public education campaign to increase awareness and preparedness within the community. Clearly, the sort of advice that is being given to employees in many organisations could lead to serious problems. Again, whilst we do acknowledge that the government has been active in this regard, we urge in as constructive a way as possible that more be done to ensure that problems are minimised and, if possible, completely eliminated. This is not just the problem of the so-called Y2K bug itself, but the problem of people having 
 unrealistic concerns about the nature and effect of that problem.</para><para>The government needs to do all it can to communicate with Australians about appropriate responses to the concerns of the community. Part of that relates to what this bill does, and that is obviously welcomed, but there is a lot more in a wider context that does still need to be done. The Democrats encourage the government to address those issues and we as a party are doing all we can, as part of our role as parliamentarians, to contribute to broader community debate and understanding about some of these issues.</para><para>The Democrats remain hopeful about the level of preparedness within the Australian community and hope that this legislation will be used in good faith to improve the readiness of Australian business. Once again, I emphasise that we are monitoring the use of the disclosure provisions and we will monitor carefully the costs and outcomes of this legislation. We do recognise the need to encourage appropriate responses at all levels of the Australian community, both within government and the private sector. In as much as this legislation goes down that path, we would certainly welcome its intent.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>4099</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators who have contributed to this important debate on the progress of Australia towards combating what has become known as the Y2K problem.</para></talk.start><para>This is an important measure. It will indeed provide tax assistance to businesses that purchase software to remediate the Y2K problem. We have had a very important debate in relation to that particular measure. There is a debate to ensue about the desirability of extending the measure beyond 1 January 2000 based on an amendment foreshadowed by Senator Sherry.</para><para>I am pleased that the Democrats share the government's view that it would be desirable that the date stay the same as it is in the legislation. If it does not, you are sending very mixed messages to small business. Senator Lundy in her speech recognised that 
 it is very important for the major sectors of the community, including of course the Commonwealth government, to be Y2K compliant; that, particularly at the Commonwealth level, they have the systems checked, remediated, compliant and back online by July—that looks to be the case for almost every Commonwealth agency; and that we spend the next six months leading up to New Year's Eve working on contingency plans, going through all the what and what-ifs—what if something does go wrong that we have not looked at, what if this supplier of mine, for example, an electricity utility or a telecommunications company or, indeed, another small business, is not able to supply because of the Y2K fault?</para><para>It need not necessarily be a computer matter. I take the opportunity of saying this is not just something that occurs in PCs, it is not just something that occurs in computers or mainframes; this is something, as the Department of the Senate found out recently, which can occur in a voice messaging system in this very building. It can occur in airconditioning systems where you have got these little black boxes with `embedded chips', as they are called, that control virtually everything that happens on the globe these days. Little date dependent chips in these little black boxes that have got nothing to do with PCs can ensure entire airconditioning systems come crashing down as a result of dates.</para><para>I repeat a story that tends to turn people's attention to the details of this problem more than anything else. People may be tempted to do what Senator Cooney alluded to in his speech here today, that is, wait and see—`We'll see whether it's a real disaster or a doomsday.' But there are those of us who take this threat extremely seriously. If any business is tempted to `wait and see', they should listen to the story of the Epworth Private Hospital in Melbourne in Victoria, a hospital that I think I could claim is probably at the forefront of fighting the year 2000 date problem within all of its systems.</para><para>They have had a program going for nearly three years now. They have been going through all of their medical equipment, their internal systems, their accounting systems and 
 their patient systems. Last year they looked at their building systems, which are, of course, just as critical to running a hospital as they are to any other facility where human beings are wandering around, particularly hospitals where people are usually frail, vulnerable and ill. They found that an airconditioning system that was installed less than four years ago will be entirely unserviceable come 1 January 2000—an airconditioning system installed less than four years ago. I think that story highlights the problem of the year 2000. It is not just a computer problem; it is far from it. In fact, the biggest risks to life and to commerce probably come from chips—date dependent chips that are not in computers at all. So this is a very serious problem.</para><para>I want to quickly respond to some of the points that do demand a response, not only because this is an important tax measure which will help small business but also because it deals with the year 2000 problem. I share with other senators the view that this is an important opportunity to not only debate this measure but also to help inform the public.</para><para>Senator Murray suggested that there are a couple of `important events', as he called them, that will occur in the life of small businesses between now and July 2000 which will put enormous stress on businesses. He said that the date change is one of them and that the introduction of the new tax system on 1 July 2000 is another. I might say by way of aside that that shows Senator Murray seems to have some confidence in that occurring, which I welcome. I say to Senator Murray and to everybody else that there are a range of events relating to Y2K that are very important for people to be aware of, and I take this opportunity to very briefly alert them to that.</para><para>Many expert commentators say that July 1999 will be a crucial Y2K date because, all of sudden, spreadsheets, mortgages and a whole range of financial matters that go out over the coming 12 months will start. This has been happening ever since 1 January this year but, as the new financial year clicks in, many year 2000 experts expect a serious rise in the number of Y2K problems—that is, 
 from July 1999 as the new financial year starts picking up the 2000 date. The next date that is a very important event for businesses, and another date that Y2K experts around the world expect to cause trouble, is September 1999 because, in some computer coding languages, the figures 9999 basically say to a computer: stop. That is the red signal for a computer, so many people are predicting serious problems and dislocation on 9 September 1999 as a result of that particular date that sends a different message to computers. I guess it also sends a different message to people who have their birthdays on that date.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">MURRAY</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—I think that is Natasha's birthday.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—Is it?

They will start saying, `Oh dear, this is serious. What a shame I didn't do something about it 300 days ago or 253 days ago,' as we are today. People may, indeed, try to make contingency plans that are either sensible or not sensible because they failed to act. That is a period, an event, that could be a problem.</para><para>The issues that Senator Murray raises are very serious issues. We in the government are very keen to ensure that we move through the Y2K events in a seamless, sound and wellmanaged way. This government has been recognised around the globe in this regard by groups such as the OECD and the Gartner Group. Indeed, our friends and colleagues in the US Senate, who have a special committee on this, have indicated that Australia is amongst the best prepared nations in the world.</para><para>It has been my privilege and honour to sit with all of the Y2K ministers from around Australia at two ministerial council meetings to discuss this, and to see the level of corporation on this issue gives one hope about the cooperation that can take place between federal and state levels of government. But 
 the issues Senator Murray raised are very important ones. It is important that the government smooths the transition as much as possible through Y2K and, equally, Senator Murray, through the introduction of the new tax system, subject of course to the parliament's agreement to that proposal. And to that end the government has allocated half a billion dollars—$500 million—to ensure, particularly, that the small to medium enterprise sector is assisted through that transition.</para><para>Senator Murray suggested that we should be considering tax concessions in that regard. We believe there is a whole range of measures that need to be brought in. The opportunities for getting a whole new massive raft of small to medium enterprise sectors into electronic and digital integration directly with the Taxation Office and directly with a range of other government agencies at all levels to make running small businesses in Australia a lot easier and a lot more efficient, giving them a lot more time to actually do the core tasks of their business, rather than complying with piles and piles of paperwork that governments at all levels pile onto them, are actually quite extraordinary and can be tagged onto the back of introducing a new tax system.</para><para>Senator Cooney—just to move to his remarks, because they flow naturally from the issues that Senator Murray raised—talked about the typical small business persons who have to comply with all of this paper, do much of the paperwork, do much of the accounting themselves, or at least prepare their documents for their accountants to do. The new tax system recognises that and, indeed, it seeks to replace a system that has an average small to medium enterprise doing something like 12 payments on tax instalments annually on behalf of employees, four income tax payments, 12 sales tax payments, potentially four fringe benefits tax payments—something like 32 separate interactions with the tax office, as the law provides at the moment. This does not include income tax and fringe benefits tax returns. And, of course, the new tax system that we are bringing in seeks to roll all of those systems into a new single pay-as-you-go system. So we will be replacing PAYE, PPS, RPS, provision 
 al tax and company instalments with one new comprehensive system.</para><para>Furthermore—and this directly responds to the points made by Senator Cooney and, I think, by Senator Murray as well—instead of having a range of different numbers that businesses and individuals need in order to interact with the tax office and another business related agencies, we will be rolling all of those into one simple new Australian business number. So each company in Australia will have one simple identifier, which will be available for use by all agencies needing to capture company data. So it is an historic reduction in the amount of interactions made by companies of all sizes, including Senator Cooney's single corner store—and God bless the corner store—and single person enterprises, such as plumbers.</para><para>I might say, by way of an aside, I have two plumbers who are close members of my family who both had plumbing practices in New Zealand during the introduction of the new tax system in New Zealand. Both of those plumbers—both of them my brothers-in-law—were extremely sceptical about the introduction of the new tax system in New Zealand by the then Labour government. They were worried because they had heard of all of the concerns that are now being scaremongered by my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle that this would increase their paperwork and that this would make life hell for small businesses. Both of those plumbers—again, my brothers-in-law—lived through the introduction of the tax system in New Zealand, which was a goods and services tax system, with some assistance I might say, Senator Murray, from the Labour government at that time. They did provide assistance to small business people to allow them to use accountants if they wanted. But both of those people found that the system was so simple and so easy to do that they did it themselves from then on in. They did not need accounting assistance to do it. It required very low compliance. And, of course, they were extremely pleased that their income tax would be lower. I think many small business people would very much welcome the tax cuts that this package would include.</para><para>But back to rebutting or at least responding to some of the arguments from honourable senators who have contributed to the debate. We heard from both Senator Lundy and Senator Bartlett that we should urgently have a public education campaign about Y2K. At that ministerial meeting I have referred to already the public education campaign that is being planned and coordinated by the Commonwealth with the states was again discussed. The unanimous, overwhelming decision of the ministers, including the federal government and the year 2000 industry program leaders—Graeme Inchley, the Chief Executive Officer, and Maurice Newman, the distinguished Chairman of that group—is that the timing is very wrong for a public education campaign right now.</para><para>That is the point I made in the last debate in the chamber on this issue. We want to ensure that we have a public education campaign that focuses on the needs of the public about the year 2000 issue. You could have a debate, I guess, with marketing and public relations consultants and pollsters and a range of other people about when is the best time to launch a campaign about the year 2000 problem. I guess whatever we do we will probably get it wrong, but there was a consensus between all state governments, the Commonwealth and the industry program that to launch a public education campaign now would be shooting the ammunition far too early, that we do need—to use a hackneyed cliche—to `keep our powder dry'.</para><para>But I can assure the Senate that it is a very, very important issue. I do not underrate it. It is just a matter of timing and of the quality of the campaign. The government—and, in fact, governments—are planning a public education campaign. We are, I think, at this very moment talking to experts on this. I think we might even be letting a tender in relation to this in terms of preparing the campaign and seeing how we deliver the information and what sort of information would be useful to put out there.</para><para>I do not think anyone can complain about a lack of information on Y2K; in fact, some might say that, if anything, there is a bit of an overload of Y2K information. I can assure 
 Senator Bartlett and Senator Lundy that preparations are well in hand. I think the way we are handling it is appropriate and, certainly, our approach has been supported by all state governments across political lines.</para><para>The conflict in approaches, as pronounced by Senator Lundy, Senator Sherry and Senator Cooney—but particularly by Senator Lundy and Senator Cooney—in relation to preparing Australia for Y2K date change events, is of concern. We are saying to government, small business and large business, `You need to spend the money now. You need to make the investment in time and management resources to ensure that your business is ready. You need to check your supply chains. You need to check with the people who supply you with crucial goods and services and ensure that their failure will not hurt you. You need to work with them to ensure that they are not going to fail. Most importantly, at the moment, you need to work with your customers.'</para><para>A fortnight ago in Adelaide, Westpac Bank made a presentation to the ministerial council about a program that it has to communicate fantastically clear, concise and easily read information to its business customers—particularly small business customers. The bank is providing counselling, tutorials and consultancy advice to all its customers to ensure that the customers solve their problems.</para><para>The banks have very quickly realised that they can make sure that there is a seamless delivery of services from their suppliers to the banks on 1 January 2000. The banks will not have very good businesses if their business customers—or, indeed, any of their customers—start to fail because of the year 2000 bug. To survive, the banks require their customers to be successful. If a lot of their customers fail because of the date change problem, then the banks themselves will fail. I congratulate Westpac. I know that the other banks also have similar sorts of programs to ensure that their customers are Y2K ready.</para><para>That is what businesses should be doing. The strong message to small businesses from government and from the industry program is, `Do all of this and get ready for the year 2000 before New Year's Eve.' That has been the 
 message from the industry program for well over a year now. We are saying to all our government departments and agencies, `Here is some money to help you do it. This is what you have to do. You have to report to your minister every month. We have to report to cabinet every quarter. We have to publicly release every agency's compliance now. But if you are a small business and you can't get it done by Christmas, don't worry. We will give you the tax incentives for another six months afterwards.' It is a confused message, and that is why the government is sticking very clearly to its guns. We are saying, `We will give you a tax incentive on software if you get it done before the change of the first two figures of the four digit year—the year 2000.' We will be sticking to that.</para><para>We deeply appreciate that the Democrats have seen the validity of that argument. That covers most of the arguments that were made. I genuinely appreciate the assistance of the honourable senators opposite in this debate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>4103</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>4103</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Schedule 1, item 14, page 6 (after line 4), after the Table of Subdivisions, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Guide to Division 46</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">46-1  What this Division is about</inline></para><para>	 This Division allows a deduction, over 2½ years, for capital and non-capital expenditure you incur in acquiring or developing software for your own use.</para><para>	 You may choose to pool such expenditure.

Amendments 1 to 4 we are dealing with, like the 128 amendments we got on the GST legislation yesterday, reflect the government's incompetence. There are four amendments here that deal with very important and critical issues on software depreciation. This highlights the general incompetence of the government, just as yesterday, after being assured for months and months that the GST package was all okay, we got 128 amendments on the GST 
 package. I would submit to the chamber that is one of the reasons why we are not dealing with the GST package today. The government made 128 mistakes, as in this legislation they have made a number of other errors and we are considering amendments 1 to 4.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Going in detail to the amendments, Senator Campbell, we have received representation from a concerned adviser in the taxation area. I will quickly go to part of the correspondence we have received. I understand that the amendments 1 to 4 we are considering deal with this issue, but I would like some assurance that they do. The amount to be depreciated is the expenditure on software. Expenditure on software includes salaries or wages paid to a person who is involved with the development of the software, section 46-10. Paragraph 14 and onwards in the explanatory memorandum state that where the software is developed in-house the expenditure is to be capitalised until the software is used or installed ready for use and then it can be depreciated. Paragraph 20 of the explanatory memorandum states:</para><para>Expenditure on a software project which is to be capitalised will include any cost that is directly related to the project. Such costs will generally consist of salaries and consumables.</para><para>This means that where an organisation has an employee who spends part of their time developing software only part of the employee's salary is deductible. The other part must be included as part of the expenditure on software and depreciated over 2½ years once the software has been developed. It appears to us that the intention of the government's original legislation was not to allow a deduction for part of a person's salary after the company paid it to him or her. My point is, and my question goes to, whether or not the government's amendments we are considering deal with this type of problem that we have had representations about.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>4106</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer is no, these amendments do not address that problem.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>4106</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me go into this issue a little more.

Instead, part of their salary is spread and deductible over time.

As I am advised, and I am certainly not expert in this area, if the salary is being paid to a person who is developing some software which at some time in the future will produce some income, it only becomes deductible when what will become an asset—it might be intellectual property, I guess—starts producing the income. So it is not immediately deductible. It only becomes deductible when that asset becomes income producing in the future.

 correct.

Part of the amendments within this bill are indeed to replace the principle embodied in the ruling within the legislative regime. Part of this legislation is the development of that principle.

 fixing the year 2000 problem—and more speed to their arms in doing that—that portion would be fully and immediately deductible. For the person who is developing software to fix Y2K, if the commissioner's ruling from 11 May applied to them, it would not be deductible until they started producing income from that asset they are producing. What this bill is doing is saying that up until midnight on 31 December that work in developing that software will have the same treatment as the maintenance person who is fixing Y2K. So they are all put together. So it is a special concession up to then. After that, the commissioner's ruling from 11 May has effect.

I know Senator Murray indicated he was not going to support this, but I am interested to know in a little more detail what his reasons are.</para><para>This Labor amendment, which as I understand is not supported by the government, extends the qualifying period for deductibility of expenditure on software expenses relating to the Y2K compliance problem from 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2000. The reality at this stage is businesses can plan for only foreseeable eventualities that occur come 1 January as a result of the Y2K bug. Once 1 January actually ticks around, no-one is in a position to know exactly 100 per cent what the impact will be on computer operating systems. I would argue that, even if it is 99 per cent compliant on 1 January, there may be a small number of businesses who are not compliant, despite their best endeavours and our best endeavours to provide an incentive to do it.</para><para>We believe it is fair and reasonable to provide an extra six months for businesses to rectify these unforeseen problems and to be able to claim such expenditure accordingly. We are aware of the legitimate argument that 
 to provide such an extension could provide an incentive for some businesses to put off until as late as possible the necessary work they need to do to make their computer systems Y2K compliant, and this is a concern. But I would state that Labor believes, on balance, that a six-month extension is justified because there would have to be some businesses who would not be compliant, would be part-complaint or would have a series of consequences because they are part-compliant or not compliant from 1 January and would need to fix those problems.</para><para>There is no way that every business in the country will have the opportunity to put the expenditure they need to make in order to cope with the Y2K bug by 1 January. I just do not think it is possible to do that. We believe it is not possible to know every problem that may occur until 1 January 2000 actually comes around. That is why we believe—and there is another reason I will touch on in a moment—that we should be cautiously generous, not overly generous, in providing a cushion for business through this extension of the date.</para><para>The other great concern of Labor is what will happen if the GST package is passed—and we should be dealing with that now, I might remind the Senate again. We should be dealing with the GST package now in committee. That is what we were called here to do; instead we are on software depreciation and quarantine. They are both important issues, but that is not what we were called here to do. That is not what the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, are out there urging us to deal with. We have the ridiculous situation with the Prime Minister and Mr Costello, the Treasurer, saying that the Senate should get on and deal with the GST legislation, and their leadership in here is bringing before us software depreciation and quarantine. So on the one hand you have the Liberal leadership out there saying we should deal with the GST but, on the other hand, the Liberal leadership in here will not let us deal with the GST legislation—an utterly absurd situation.</para><para>As I touched on earlier, it was a shambles in the government yesterday: two senators 
 went to lunch early and they lost a critical vote and the Leader of the Government in the Senate is away. I do not know what Senator Kemp is doing and what part he is playing in all of this, but he is the Assistant Treasurer.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senator interjecting—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—He is not; I will take that interjection. Senator Campbell is looking over his shoulder at Senator Heffernan, trying to take his job from him. It was an absolute shambles yesterday. No wonder they had to defer the committee stage consideration, and we were then presented with 128 amendments to the GST legislation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We were told for months and months that the GST legislation was fine, that the package did not need amendment, and we got 128 amendments from the government yesterday covering issues like the sale of farm land, insurance, anti-avoidance measures and charities. These measures were referred to as finetuning—just another example of the government's incompetence.</para><para>I will return to the software depreciation bill and the amendment that Labor has moved. I was sparked in my remarks then by the concern that Labor has if this GST comes in. It is an unfortunate coincidence that, if it does come in, small business in particular—obviously it affects all businesses but our particular worry is small business—will have Y2K compliance on 1 January 2000 and then the dreadful GST six months later.</para><para>I accept that big businesses have some problems. They have to make their computer software compliant with the GST, but it is significantly easier for big businesses to do that than it is for smaller businesses. Smaller businesses which have computer systems, and many of them do not, will be struggling to become Y2K compliant and at the same time planning for the dreaded GST. Where businesses do not have software, computer systems, I am sure many of them will be looking at purchasing computer software to take account of the goods and services tax. So they are really going to have to deal with two serious issues almost on top of each other.</para><para>The added cost of complying with the GST, as I said earlier, is not so bad for big busi 
 ness. They have in-house computer systems, in many cases, and the overall percentage cost is relatively small, if indeed it is any cost at all. It is different for small business, and that is another reason we think this six-month extension should be given—to deal with this dreadful GST, if it ever gets through and if we ever get to deal with it, as we should have been dealing with it this morning.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>4109</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Can I quickly respond because it is an important issue. I did cover it briefly in my second reading speech. There are two points to make. Firstly, we need to send a very clear message to small business—which is, `Get your systems fixed, replace your software, do what is required, check your supply chain, help your customers. Do all of that work and do it now. You have 253 days to go and we do not want you to wait and see.' We do not want them to put off these decisions. We want them to take action.</para></talk.start><para>Those who have not taken action prior to today should be taking action today. We say, `Go to the Y2K web site; go to the Standards Australia web site. Look at all the resources that are there to assist you. Talk to the Y2K officers within your state government, come and talk to the Y2K unit in the federal government, but take some action. Talk to your accountant. Talk to your engineer, if you are a manufacturing business. Do it today. You will get a tax benefit if you do it in the next 253 days.'</para><para>We do not want to say to them, `Wait and see.' We want them to do the work, particularly the software development and replacement. Not only is it going to have a tax benefit for them if they do it now; clearly it will be a benefit to their business if they do it now. They will be able to be more confident on New Year's Eve that their businesses will survive the date change. Many businesses around the world will not survive it. If they have not done the work, they will not survive it, so we want them to do it now.</para><para>On the upside, there will certainly be work done on Y2K in the year 2000. I have pre 
 dicted in a number of speeches I have made on this issue that there will be work going on on Y2K remediation in the year 2001, the year 2002 and the year 2003 in many parts of the world. Under Australia's tax law, normal work that takes place on that will be deductible anyway; it is just the software and replacement that will not get special work.</para><para>So in response to Senator Sherry's specific question of, `Why don't we get a tax deductibility for work that takes place on Y2K?' the answer is that the remediation work that takes place on Y2K will be deductible under the normal tax laws anyway. It is just the special benefits for the replacement that we are talking about.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>4109</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have a question to the minister about these dates. 1 January 2000 is not necessarily the only date that is going to cause a problem with Y2K compliance. 29 February 2000 is going to be an even bigger date, or as big as, because there was no 29 February in the year 1900. There are some dates in March next year that are also critical to that. If you move the date in the legislation out from 1 January to 1 July, those businesses that would have been fine for 1 January but would have had a problem with 29 February may be saved some problems.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>4109</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are saying to all of those businesses, `Fix the problem in the next 253 days. If you fix the problem in the next 253 days, in all probability you would have fixed the whole problem.' Senator West, you have quite rightly pointed out that problem, too. I just went back to my notes, and that was one of the events that I forgot to mention. In relation to Senator Murray's use of the term `event', it is indeed a very crucial event, as you said. It is again a very unique date, because the year 1900 was not a leap year.</para></talk.start><para>So if a computer happens to slip past the date problem on 1 January 2000—because it has turned itself back to 1900 and merrily thinks it is quite happy—it is going to merrily operate on that basis all through January and 
 right through February and then all of a sudden crash on 29 February. If you do the remediation work now, the assessment of whether you have got a date problem will include looking at that. A computer consultant or expert is not going to come in and look at your embedded chips and see what needs to be done in relation to the January 2000 problem in your computer without fixing the 29 February problem; that will of course be solved.</para><para>We are saying to people that they should get these problems solved, and I think we are sending a loud and clear message from this debate today: `Don't wait till even the end of the year to solve this problem.' July 1999 is a problem, September 1999 is a problem—9/9/99 is a problem—and, as Senator West has quite sensibly and accurately reported, 29 February 2000 could easily be a serious problem. So we are saying, `Fix the problems now and do so because you get a tax incentive as well as a business benefit, in that your business has a better chance of survival by acting now and not delaying.'</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>4110</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Could I touch on the example?

In fact, it may be that some people simply are not able to get a computer expert in to advise them; there may not be the time. I understand that computer advisers who are involved in attempting to fix this particular problem are in very short supply at the moment.</para></talk.start><para>As I said earlier, there will be the additional problems of the GST. If the GST goes through, it seems to us a sensible arrangement that businesses, particularly small businesses, have an additional six months. We believe that offsets the argument about the pressure. I do not think the pressure will be any less if there is a six-month extension. There is pressure on business at the moment to get this issue dealt with. But we believe the reality is that, through no fault of the businesses, there will be some hangover problems and businesses should be compensated in the same way as they would have been before January 2000. Inevitably there will be some hangover.

But I would expect, in the first sitting of the Senate in the year 2000, the parliamentary secretary with responsibility in this area to report to the Senate with an appraisal of the situation and the hangover—and I do not mean on 2 January but in February when we meet. If the hangover were significant, I personally would expect the government to take due recognition of that and retrospectively address the problem.</para><para>I cannot, through this discussion, evaluate how big the problem will be post 1 January 2000.

I think it is a point of consistency. Senator Campbell alluded to the issue of liability being a factor in the consideration of what happens post 1 January 2000. Specifically, I refer to the so-called Good Samaritan legislation, which does address issues of liability for companies, firms and businesses that take advice on the issue of the year 2000 remediation, preparation plans, contingency plans, et cetera. If they act on that advice, and that advice is found to have been given in good faith, the purposes of the Good Samaritan legislation shifts the legal test as to whether or not there is any recourse available to the recipients of that advice.</para></talk.start><para>This is relevant in this debate, and the point of consistency is valid. On the other hand, the government moved through that Good Samaritan legislation with our support. There was recognition that there was a great need to promote disclosure and discussion about the Y2K problem and to encourage dialogue between various entities on Y2K. The intent and structure of that particular piece of legislation was very much one of opening up the doors of dialogue in recognition of the fact 
 that no-one could predict precisely what was going to happen.</para><para>Its relevance with this bill goes to the heart of that unknown quantity. Post 1 January 2000 we may have a situation where advice may have been provided in good faith and acted upon in good faith. If there is a failure, then the ability for the business affected to claim legal recourse has been affected by the Good Samaritan legislation. That is all well and good, and it had a specific purpose. But surely in that context there is scope for the government, given that they were prepared to shift the legal test for companies suffering loss as a result of advice given with the right intent, to provide this minor mechanism to allow them to recover some benefit for taxation purposes in subsequent expenditure.</para><para>To not do this starts to work against the spirit of the previous piece of legislation brought forward by Senator Campbell in this place and the genuine intent behind this bill, which is to relieve this burden. Because we will not know the extent to which the Good Samaritan legislation will be tested in affecting those liabilities until after 1 January 2000, it is reasonable to apply the same degree of consistency to this bill in saying, `We will not actually know the degree to which businesses will suffer prior to 1 January 2000.' Therefore, we are requesting that it be extended by six months, as Senator Sherry so eloquently conveyed to the Senate. If the government is to be consistent, you must find it within yourselves to support the Labor amendment.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sherry's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>11:45:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator S.

I certainly recognise that a report of such a nature required some time for the government to consider its response, but it should not take 2½ years, particularly when the government's response to the committee's recommendations was published by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, in August 1997. So it took from October 1996 to August 1997 for the government to consider the report and issue its response but it has taken until April 1999 for the government to bring in this legislation.</para><para>The only reason this legislation is before the Senate today is that this government has adjourned debate on the GST legislation. As I am sure every Australian knows by now, the Senate is sitting this week and next week to deal with the GST legislation. We are sitting at a time when the House of Representatives is not sitting. We are having special sittings to deal with the GST. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer claim that this is the most important piece of legislation that has to be dealt with by this parliament. Those gentlemen are out there in the community urging the Senate, telling the Labor Party, to get on with the job and pass the legislation. Well, we are here waiting for you to bring it on, and 
 what do you do? You squib it. You can't get your act together.</para><para>I am quite happy now to deal with the Quarantine Amendment Bill. Indeed, I have had my contribution to this debate prepared for some time. We are not about delaying important legislation that needs to be dealt with by the Senate. This is a most important piece of legislation. The Quarantine Amendment Bill 1998 seeks to implement many of the recommendations of the Nairn committee, which I will come to shortly. I wish to pay tribute to the former minister, Mr Bob Collins, for his initiative in establishing this committee of inquiry to broadly look at the important issues of Australian quarantine arrangements.</para><para>As people are aware from the recent reports regarding an outbreak of Newcastle disease in the poultry industry, quarantine issues are becoming more and more important. Australia can no longer rely upon the fact that it is an island continent, that it has natural boundaries, to maintain its reputation and its status as essentially disease free with respect to many of its agricultural industries. The world today, particularly with respect to international trade and travel, means that we are becoming more exposed to the problems of diseases and pests that exist in other countries. We have to be increasingly vigilant to protect our industries, our agricultural industries in particular, our food industries and our public health.</para><para>This legislation, I am pleased to say, goes a long way towards enhancing that protection by improving our quarantine arrangements. I must point out, however, that there was one recommendation of the Nairn committee that the government has not agreed to and that we likewise do not support. That was the recommendation of the committee to establish a separate authority which would be largely independent of government to look after quarantine issues. We believe that recommendation was not appropriate. We are glad to see that the government didn't pick it up because ultimately the buck stops with the government on quarantine issues. It is essential that we have a properly resourced public body such as AQIS, staffed by experts, to oversee quarantine in this country.</para><para>The bill picks up many of the recommendations of the Nairn committee. I will deal with a few of the issues covered by the bill and then move on to some issues that were specifically looked at by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. There are a number of definition changes in the legislation, particularly with respect to the use of the terms `disease' and `pest'. Without going into those in detail, we note that they are more extensive and appropriate to today's environment of greater international trade and travel.</para><para>One particular amendment to the act is the inclusion of the reference to ballast water. Whilst this may appear to be a technical issue, it is in fact a very important issue, as we know. Australia—particularly the state of Tasmania where you come from, Mr Acting Deputy President—is facing a major problem in its seafood industry as a result of ballast water from ships bringing in organisms and pests, particularly the starfish that can attack the shellfish industry. That is one matter that has become increasingly important in recent years and is covered in this legislation.</para><para>Another provision of this legislation requires greater consultation between the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage when looking at quarantine issues and in particular when exercising powers under the legislation. The bill also provides for greater flexibility in pre-border, border and post-border quarantine arrangements. By that I mean that we have moved from the traditional approach of just using border controls to handle many quarantine arrangements and extended that, for instance, by requiring pre-entry reports from vessels so that the quarantine risk is reduced even further.</para><para>There is much work that can and should be done beyond our immediate border points with respect to ensuring adequate quarantine arrangements within this country. Of course, that is particularly important with respect to the importation of food from other countries.</para><para>The bill also significantly strengthens the penalties for offences against the quarantine requirements. There are also changes which 
 will bring about greater consistency in the special quarantine zones that exist, such as in the Torres Strait. Special quarantine zones are designated particularly in that area because the traditional inhabitants move from island to island within that region. Whilst that should be facilitated, we need to ensure that exotic pests and diseases are not introduced as a result of the movement of goods or people within those areas.</para><para>The existing powers which can intrude unnecessarily on the lifestyle of indigenous inhabitants of the Torres Strait have been replaced in this legislation by a more flexible approach in dealing with those quarantine matters. We support the government on that proposal and think it is eminently sensible.</para><para>As I said earlier, this bill, which was passed by the House of Representatives with the support of both the government and the opposition, was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. That action was taken to enable AQIS, the department and such other groups as the National Farmers Federation who have an interest in this issue to appear before the Senate committee to provide more information regarding the legislation.</para><para>There are two areas of concern I wish to quickly refer to on which we sought information in that inquiry. One was with respect to the privatisation of quarantine stations. The opposition has a concern to ensure that we do not move down the road of the privatisation of quarantine matters, thereby reducing its effectiveness, and move too far away from the public responsibility that rests on government in respect of quarantine.</para><para>There was a recommendation in the Nairn report that supported the concept of privatising Commonwealth quarantine stations. During the inquiry evidence was given by AQIS. I will quote from their submission. They said:</para><para>In addressing this issue of privatisation, these stations—</para><para>that is, the quarantine stations—</para><para>remain government owned and operated, and thus are not commercial premises at this point. AQIS is about to publicly distribute a discussion paper on their future before taking any further steps down 
 the identified path of privatisation. AQIS would see any new arrangements being made the subject of stringent compliance agreements.</para><para>We are most concerned as an opposition to ensure that any proposals which involve the greater use of commercially operated premises—if they are to be put forward—are clearly put on the table for the parliament to consider. As I said, we are concerned to ensure that the primary responsibility for quarantine, particularly in respect of high-risk quarantine issues, is retained within a public authority such as AQIS.</para><para>We do note that this legislation encourages greater interface and cooperation between quarantine services and industry, and that is something that we strongly support. Whilst some low-level quarantine functions can be undertaken by industry successfully, that should not become the hallmark for the future of quarantine across the board in this country.</para><para>Another issue that the committee addressed in our inquiry—and I urge senators to have a look at the committee's report because, as I said, this is a most important issue for Australian industry, for our economy and for public health as well—is a proposal in the legislation to remove the privilege against self-incrimination. Essentially, this legislation removes the right of persons who have information which should be available to AQIS officers in carrying out their duties of quarantine to rely upon the privilege against self-incrimination in declining to provide such information. The corresponding arrangement is, however, that any evidence obtained by using that provision is not permissible in subsequent criminal proceedings, except in certain limited circumstances. We were naturally concerned to ensure that removal of the right to answer questions on the grounds of privilege against self-incrimination was not being removed without good cause. As we note in the committee's report, AQIS were somewhat unclear regarding the implications of this proposed section of the bill, which is section 79A.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'BRIEN</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—You are being very kind.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—I am being kind to AQIS. The committee report notes that clarifi

The Scrutiny of Bills Committee noted that, on balance, they were prepared to accept the proposal as being one which strikes a reasonable balance between the requirements of law enforcement and the protection of individual rights. Having had that assurance by the eminent chair of the scrutiny committee, Senator Barney Cooney, I think all senators would at least be willing to accept the proposal on that ground.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is a range of other issues dealt with in this legislation, such as the delegation of powers by the minister, the question of ministerial responsibility and the liability of the Commonwealth, the Crown and the minister in areas where quarantine issues arise. I am sure that my colleague Senator O'Brien will take up those issues in his remarks following my comments.</para><para>In conclusion, I indicate that the opposition supports the passage of the legislation, but we do so recognising that we have to be ever vigilant in this area. I express our particular concern that we do not wish to see further privatisation in this area. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>4116</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also wish to speak to the <inline ref="r689">Quarantine Amendment Bill 1998</inline> , and indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the legislation.</para></talk.start><para>At the outset, I should indicate that at this stage I am not sure about the amendments to this bill foreshadowed by Senator Brown. But I presume we will have time to look at those, given that we probably will not get to the committee stage of this bill today. I am not sure yet what our response will be to those amendments to be moved by Senator Brown, but no doubt in the committee stage we will be able to indicate either agreement or otherwise. I will certainly listen carefully during the debate to Senator Brown's reasons for foreshadowing these amendments. I do not know if Senator Brown was present in the Senate committee inquiry hearings; I presume he was not. I certainly was not able to get there, but was able to read the report. I just wonder where the amendments come from—whether they come from out of the ether 
 somewhere or whether in fact they are valid amendments. They are the questions I will want to hear answered by Senator Brown.</para><para>I indicate that the Democrats still have concerns about the whole area of quarantine. We believe that this legislation is picking up a number of those concerns and is, therefore, an improvement on the current situation, but I put on the record that we still have concerns. No doubt the experience that we gain from the operation of this bill may suggest further amendments in the future—that remains to be seen—but I think we do need to allow the legislation time to bed down and see how it operates.</para><para>The bill seeks to amend the Quarantine Act 1908 and reflects the legislative response of the government to the Nairn report, which was released in October 1996. The government is reacting to the report's view of the importance to the community of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service's contribution to the protection of the environment, and it is imposing an obligation on quarantine decision makers to consult with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in certain circumstances, and we certainly support that.</para><para>I do not need to go through the whole history of some of the quarantine disasters that we have experienced in this country, but certainly the one which comes to mind for me was that of the papaya fruit fly in my own state, in North Queensland. In the end, the cost of cleaning up that problem was far in excess of that of the quarantine measures that had been in place and had been removed, which allowed the papaya fruit fly to enter North Queensland and, of course, to cause a tremendous cost in terms of the clean-up of that problem.</para><para>However, it is good to be able to place on the record that, in fact, that clean-up operation did work and that, to all intents and purposes, it appears we were able to eradicate the papaya fruit fly from North Queensland. So we commend the government and the government instrumentalities on their achievement in that regard. But it underlines again the importance of quarantine, the importance of making sure we have in place proper meas 
 ures to, as far as possible, ensure that there are not breaches of our quarantine protection. I have debated previously—and in fact, I think I remember Senator Calvert also being involved in a debate on this issue some time ago—the whole issue of risk management. I concede that, unless you are going to spend an incredible amount of money, probably risk management is the only way that we can balance out the cost of quarantine measures and proper protection.</para><para>But I just place on the record again that if you asked the Australian population what they required from the quarantine service they would probably say that they would hope that `no risk' would at least be the goal of the quarantine service. We know that we have got to balance the `no risk' option against the cost of such an option. In fact, I believe that the Nairn report describes `no risk' as being a myth and impossible to achieve in a major trading country. The reality is that they are probably right. But, as an idealist, as I always am, I would still hope that risk management meant that we went as close to the `no risk' option as possible, at least in terms of the goal of the quarantine service.</para><para>One of the problems in this whole area—and this truly underlines the debate about privatisation of quarantine stations—is that we have experienced in Victoria a number of problems with the privatisation of laboratories. The privatisation of some of those laboratories turned into a bit of a farce when the privatised laboratories found that they were unable to operate economically. So I would like to underline what Senator Forshaw said and to repeat the last sentence of the quote he read, which was from AQIS to the Senate inquiry:</para><para>AQIS would see any new arrangements being made the subject of stringent compliance agreements.</para><para>I have to say that the Democrats remain very cynical about that kind of assurance, because we have seen, time and time again, that before you privatise you can give all sorts of promises about compliance agreements and the rest of it, but after privatisation often those compliance agreements are very hard to maintain in a privatised company. I can give you some examples. I have already mentioned 
 the laboratories in Victoria. There is also a problem with trying to regulate the airport in Brisbane. There is aircraft noise and a whole lot of issues to do with the parallel runway which is proposed for Brisbane. The problem, of course, is that now that the airport is privatised it is very difficult to impose any kinds of restrictions on that airport. It is an example of the problem.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—You think you've got a problem with the Brisbane airport?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—You are in Victoria, Senator McGauran. Yes, there is a problem with the Brisbane airport. It is not the present Brisbane airport; it is a projected future possibility of a parallel runway and the difficulty of enforcing on a privatised company any kind of regulation about aircraft noise. It is just an example of the problem. I could go on to talk about Telstra or the Commonwealth Bank, but it is the same problem: that it is very easy before privatisation to talk about `stringent compliance agreements' but, in our experience, after privatisation compliance agreements are very hard to impose and to maintain. So I just raise that. In terms of any proposal to privatise our quarantine stations, we know that at this stage that is not going ahead and that there is a discussion paper which AQIS is to issue, or has issued. I believe that, should we come back to further legislation along those lines, it will need to be scrutinised very carefully.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I know that I am jumping around a little bit in this speech but I think it is important to put some of these matters on the record. Let me return to the issue of the papaya fruit fly in North Queensland and the particular problem for organic growers. One of the problems that organic banana growers in North Queensland found was that once, the papaya fruit fly had entered North Queensland, all of the fruit from that area had to be dipped in chemicals. That absolutely destroyed those organic banana farms because they cannot use chemicals—that is the whole nature of organic farming. So the pest infestation was far more devastating for them than it was for other farmers who were not organic growers. This example is certainly one that raises issues about quarantine protection.</para><para>This legislation again raises issues which we have debated previously. Certainly, the Democrats will monitor this legislation very carefully. We commend the government for taking up nearly all of the issues raised by the Nairn report. The legislation is a big improvement in many areas. We will be monitoring it to see just how it works because the whole issue of the quarantine service is very important for the Australian public, for every one of the senators in this place and for Australian primary industry. I note that the committee report recommended shared responsibility between industry, government and the general public in maintaining the high standard of the service.</para><para>The current situation in our country is that Australia remains relatively free of pests and disease. But as Senator Forshaw pointed out, the recent outbreak of Newcastle disease in the Hunter area is very worrying. Apparently that was an indigenous virus rather than anything that came from imports. This, of course, raises issues for importers from overseas countries who will point the finger and say, `Why are you stopping us from importing? If it is fear of Newcastle disease, you have it here already.' So you can see that debate opening up once more.</para><para>In closing, let me commend the government and say `Well done.' I do not want to be churlish and say `It is about time,' but we certainly welcome this legislation and will be supporting it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>4118</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As has been said earlier in this debate, the <inline ref="r689">Quarantine Amendment Bill 1998</inline>  represents the government's response to the recommendation of the Australian Quarantine Review Committee—more commonly known as the Nairn committee—that the Quarantine Review Act 1908 be revised as soon as possible. It has also been noted that the Nairn committee was set up by Labor and commenced its work in January 1996. This bill provides the legislative framework for many of the recommendations of the Nairn committee, but the government has chosen to make its changes largely within the framework of the existing structures rather than by setting up entirely new ones as envisaged by Nairn. 
 In particular, the government has chosen not to set up a new statutory authority—Quarantine Australia—which was the cornerstone of Nairn's recommendations. Labor supports that view.</para></talk.start><para>This bill outlines the scope of quarantine by including reference to the environment and economic activities for the first time, as recommended by Nairn. A requirement to consult the minister for the environment in certain circumstances is included. These circumstances relate to the role of the quarantine service in protecting indigenous fauna and flora from exotic pests and diseases. Moving people and goods in and out of Australia will always involve some level of quarantine risk. The approach taken in the bill is to manage quarantine risks to Australia to an acceptably low level in a manner that provides appropriate protection based on scientific assessment and which is consistent with international rules and standards.</para><para>Some flexibility is introduced into preborder and post-border quarantine measures. Carriers will gain some flexibility, for example, in the timing of pre-arrival reporting obligations and will be allowed to make their quarantine reports by exception in certain cases, such as for scheduled international flights. The power of quarantine inspectors to use dogs to assist them is formalised. A system of rectification notices is introduced to enable importers to rectify deficiencies which might otherwise cause goods to be refused entry to Australia, particularly where breaches relate to minor deficiencies in required paperwork.</para><para>Some flexibility is also introduced in dealing with contraventions of the act due to minor technical deficiencies. The power of the Director of Quarantine to order the seizure, sale, destruction or re-export of goods is clarified. Emergency powers are also strengthened to ensure that expedient measures can be taken in respect of newly emerging pests or diseases, even before such threats are proclaimed as quarantinable diseases.</para><para>At this stage in the debate I wanted to touch on the matter of Senator Brown's amendments, which have only now been 
 tabled in the Senate. There are four amendments to schedule 1 proposed by Senator Brown. The opposition has not seen these amendments before now. The opposition has not heard of any intention to amend this bill before this morning. </para><para>The bill was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. In relation to that reference, a hearing of the committee inquiry into the bill was conducted on Monday, 22 March. Evidence was heard. In addition, the committee met on 29 March to consider its report. There was no indication at the hearing of the committee on 22 March that there were issues which Senator Brown sought to raise. In fact, my recollection is that he did not attend the committee at all, nor did he indicate that he was desirous of doing so but unable to do so for other reasons. In addition, the meeting to consider the report on 29 March, to my recollection, did not have drawn to its attention any intention to seek to amend the bill as proposed in the amendments which were tabled this morning.</para><para>Whilst recognising that minor parties may have some difficulties in being present at all inquiries, it certainly seems to me to be incumbent upon those minor parties to indicate if they have an interest in a matter. If they are proposing to table amendments, senators should know about that before the debate arises. Indeed, there are processes of the Senate and its committees which allow that to take place, including the process of the referral of this bill to the legislation committee for inquiry. As I have outlined, it is my belief that has not taken place in this case.</para><para>Resulting from that, the opposition are in the difficult position, if this matter proceeds today, of having to seek to address those amendments on the run, and seeking to address amendments on the run is not a desirable way of proceeding. The opposition's view is that until we have an opportunity to appreciate the intent of the amendments, we would not be keen for this matter to proceed to the committee stage. As that will not occur, I suspect, before this part of the proceedings ends—and this bill will not be due to recommence today, as I understand the legislative 
 program—we may have an opportunity to do that tomorrow. That could not be guaranteed, depending on the import of the amendments and the fact that we will no doubt need to be in contact with our colleagues from the House of Representatives, who are not here this week because the House of Representatives is not sitting. In particular, the responsible shadow ministers may not be easily contactable. I cannot say what their position will be because I do not know. I have only just seen the amendments when I came into the chamber now.</para><para>I am expressing a caution to the government to say that we may not be ready to proceed with this tomorrow either, depending on the advice we have received. That is unfortunate because we have been saying and continue to say that we support the bill. I think it would be irresponsible for us not to give proper consideration to amendments which are laid before the chamber. To simply say, `They are too late. Therefore, we will oppose them' is not an argument we would use. This circumstance is brought about by the fact that these amendments have been drawn to our attention at the eleventh hour—in fact, well past the eleventh hour. Had the amendments not been tabled today we would have been in a position to finalise consideration of this bill if not today then early tomorrow. I think that would have been the desirable course of events. I must say that it is not necessarily the case now.</para><para>In relation to a matter that Senator Forshaw referred to—that is, the question of the broadening of the powers of the minister in this matter—we did deal with that at the committee stage. Ultimately, we were satisfied with the information we had as to what the real intent of the bill was, although during our inquiries the evidence from AQIS appeared to be a little confusing and somewhat in conflict with the library's <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>, which described the bill as doing certain things which AQIS were perhaps not keen to concede were the intent of the bill. We have clarified that.</para><para>I suppose, when you are rewriting legislation and a broad range of material is reconsidered, sometimes items of detail can get lost in the process and be less understood than 
 otherwise might be the case. We did have some difficulty coming to grips with the extent to which the powers of the minister were being broadened in relation to the committee's inquiry process. Ultimately, it is fair to say that the committee's report clarifies the position, if there is a need to clarify it. The position is that we are not at all unhappy with the bill in relation to the broadening of the minister's powers.</para><para>I did want to touch upon a matter which has been dealt with by the two earlier speakers, Senator Forshaw and Senator Woodley. This is a matter which is of critical importance in terms of the future of the quarantine service—that is, the question of privatisation. In the evidence given to the committee by the Executive Director of AQIS, Mr Paul Hickey, into the provisions of this bill, the AQIS submission to the committee hearing advised that it was about to circulate a discussion paper on the future of the quarantine inspection stations. Mr Hickey said that the release of this discussion paper was the initiation of a process that may or may not lead to the privatisation of its quarantine stations. He said that the privatisation of high risk quarantine stations would depend upon government policy at the time. He stated:</para><para>If government policy was to authorise the use of private premises for high risk areas, that conceivably could be the case.</para><para>I also asked Mr Hickey what the value of community service obligation funding is for the high risk quarantine stations. He advised me, and I think I can tell the Senate, that the funding is in the order of $1.5 million per year.</para><para>It appears to me that this government, as it has done elsewhere, is likely to look to privatise these high risk quarantine facilities based on its philosophical commitment to small government rather than good public policy. It is, I would suggest, a fact that there is a significant public benefit in the provision of effective quarantine management. In saying that, I highlight some of the matters that have been referred to by Senator Woodley and Senator Forshaw about the risk to Australian industries of the introduction of pests and diseases not hitherto present here.</para><para>The cost to the community of the introduction of pests and diseases can be enormous and can cripple industry. The economic loss to the community can be huge not only in simple dollar terms but also in social terms if that leads to the dislocation of important industries. Short- to medium-term unemployment can also arise from the introduction of diseases. What often happens in some of these industries if things go wrong is that the people who rely on them for their industries lose their employment. They are often in rural and regional areas where there are not alternative employment opportunities. The community dislocation in those circumstances is in fact higher than it might be in other parts of Australia where there are alternatives for people to go to within the community.</para><para>In terms of the risks occasioned by breaches in the management of quarantine, certainly the high risk quarantine stations should remain as government run facilities. I do not think that there is any doubt that the community should make a financial contribution to meeting the costs of the management of quarantine, particularly for those high risk quarantine stations. As I said, the risk of a breakdown in the monitoring of our borders against the introduction of pests and diseases is too great to take our chances. Having said that, and with the qualifications I made about the amendments which lay on the table, the opposition will support this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>4120</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I, too, support the <inline ref="r689">Quarantine Amendment Bill 1998</inline> , but the Greens are bringing in a series of amendments to tighten it up with regard to the protection of Australia's environment. We believe that this legislation in simply requiring the quarantine officers, where a matter of Australia's environment is at stake, to decide whether or not they will notify the minister for the environment and then decide whether or not they will take advice from that minister is simply not good enough. We believe that if there is a quarantine matter which threatens the Australian environment then not only should the minister always be advised but also the advice from the minister should be taken. I will come back to that a little later.</para></talk.start><para>Quarantine is absolutely essential to this nation. Just up the road from my place at Liffey under the Great Western Tiers of Tasmania—and I know that you, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, know that beautiful region well; I understand it is under snow from a fall the night before last—is one of the most wonderful walking places in the world where pencil pines grow. They are a unique pine to Tasmania, but they grace the beauty of many of the posters of Tasmania, particularly those that show off places like Cradle Mountain and the Walls of Jerusalem. Yet at the start of this decade I noticed that one of these was dying by the highway—the only place where a highway goes near pencil pines in the world. Consequent investigations have found that there is a phytophthora. A rootrot germ is attacking those trees which apparently comes from alpine areas in the Northern Hemisphere, maybe America. It was not thought that phytophthora would touch alpine regions until now. The threat of this is enormous—that is, the extinction of the species.</para><para>If you go to 1,200 metres elevation on the Lake Highway above Liffey you will find barricades and fences, and beautiful little picnic spots that were a past delight to people from Launceston and elsewhere are now blocked off. The quarantine services are trying to prevent the spread of this disastrous blight on the highlands of Tasmania, which probably got in on somebody's boots or on somebody's machinery.

This body of legislation, which I refer to as the primary industries levies amalgamation legislation, is intended to provide a framework for the imposition of future levies and charges and to streamline that process, as I said, from currently 40 separate acts to two principal acts and three related acts. The two principal bills in this legislation are the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Bill 1999 and the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Bill 1999.</para><para>Currently, primary industry levies and charges are imposed upon various rural industries, generally at the request of and on behalf of those industry organisations. Those levies and charges are imposed to provide funds for the promotion of research and development for those particular industries. 
 As I said, they are often imposed as a result of industry initiative, and the government acts as the collection agency on behalf of the various industry peak bodies.</para><para>The specific provisions of the bills and the purposes thereof are set out in the minister's second reading speech, and I do not need to go over that in detail. I do wish to indicate that the opposition supports passage of this legislation, as we are assured that, firstly, it has been the subject of intense consultation with industry, who support it, and, secondly, it will streamline the process into the future.</para><para>Along with those assurances, I note that, if problems arise in the future, the industry peak bodies will be on the phone to us pretty quickly, as they usually are to let us know when they have some difficulty with either government legislation or particularly government regulation. It is really the regulations powers that are used to impose the additional levies, and we will hear those concerns pretty quickly if they arise, will be able to examine them and, if necessary, will take them up with government. So with those few remarks, and noting that my colleague Senator O'Brien also wishes to add some remarks to this non-controversial but very important legislation, I will indicate that the opposition supports the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>4122</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—These bills consolidate 40 levy and charges imposition acts into just two acts. The proceeds raised by these levies and charges will principally fund research and development, statutory marketing authorities and health and safety monitoring in a large number of key rural industries. These bills had a fairly shaky start in the Main Committee of the other place with the eleventh hour introduction of a plethora of amendments. This is yet another illustration of the failure of this government to manage its legislative program properly. We have had these bills on the books for a considerable period of time, then from nowhere the government introduced a significant parcel of amendments. The amendments were sensible, but the manner in which they were introduced was not.</para></talk.start><para>The amendments, or the intent of these amendments, have an interesting history. They 
 were introduced into the parliament by the former Labor government in 1995. The purpose of the 1995 bills was to streamline the process of managing a large number of levies and, in doing so, save significant amounts of parliamentary time. They were designed to allow for a levy rate to be amended at the request of the relevant industry by way of a disallowable instrument rather than a bill. The then opposition opposed the bills and they lapsed as a result. Now we have basically the same legislation but this time sponsored by the former opposition. The purpose, according to the government, of this package of bills is to, you guessed it:</para><para>. . . enable the government to better service industry by simplifying the processes and reducing the long lead times surrounding changes to levies and charges and by being more flexible and responsive to industry requests . . . </para><para>The government also claims the bills will enable the administration of the levies and charges to be streamlined. We support the government's adoption of our sensible package of bills for the reasons we outlined in 1995 and for the reasons the government presented last month.</para><para>I want to make only one more point. This approach of pulling down sensible programs or blocking good legislation simply for the sake of it has been a feature of the administration of the primary industry or agriculture portfolio under the Howard government, and these bills are just one more example. A large number of rural industries could have benefited from these changes in 1995—not 1999—but thanks to the former minister for primary industries, Mr Anderson, those industries have had to wait until 1999 for these changes to go through the parliament, and they will today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>4122</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The most important thing to note about this legislation is that it will make the law more accessible to those involved in agriculture, fisheries and forestry. The main achievement of this legislation is the amalgamation of 40 primary industry levy and charge acts into two main bills. This will reduce the call on the time of parliament and the public sector for the often involved process of making 
 changes to levies and charges by reducing the number of imposition acts that will have to be amended to effect changes in the future.</para></talk.start><para>The other important aspect of this legislation is that it provides a framework for future levies and charges to be imposed by regulation. This will enable the government to better service industries by simplifying the processes, reducing the long lead times surrounding changes to levies and charges and being more flexible and responsive to industry requests for such changes as well as for new or additional levies. The streamlining of the administration of levies and charges legislation would also introduce new efficiencies to the public sector.</para><para>It is important to note that the government intends that, when tabled in parliament, a regulation introducing new levies will be required to be accompanied by a report setting out the extent to which the proposed levy or charge complies with the government's general principles for new primary industries levies and charges. Such a regulation will be subject to disallowance by parliament. In addition, the Office of Regulation Review examines new levies through its regulation impact process, and a regulation impact statement is required for each new levy or charge.</para><para>Industry is supportive of this primary industries levies amalgamation legislation, as it will streamline the process of amending levy rates and introducing new levies. I would point out to Senator O'Brien that many industry sectors took the opportunity to request minor amendments to the legislation while it was before parliament. The amendments moved in the Main Committee demonstrated the responsiveness of this government to industry's requests, and other minor technical amendments to correct deficiencies and improve the legislation were moved while the bill was before the House. This government is being very responsive to industry in terms of what industry wants. I am pleased to say that the House passed the amendments and that industry will benefit from this. In conclusion, this government's initiative in introducing this legislation represents a major step forward in the administration of primary 
 industries levies and charges, and I commend the bills to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bills read a second time, and passed through their remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4123</page.no><id.no>s198</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>4123</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 17 February, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abetz</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>4123</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to speak on behalf of the Labor opposition on the <inline ref="s198">National Health Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999</inline>  and indicate our support for the bill.

Australia enjoys affordable subsidised pharmaceuticals that people in other countries are obviously keen to access. The PBS not only provides universal access to affordable medicines; by setting out a national schedule of prices, the scheme also minimises the overall cost of pharmaceuticals. A 1996 Industry Commission report into the pharmaceutical industry found that Australia spends less per capita on pharmaceuticals than Germany, Canada, the US, Japan, Sweden and Ireland.</para><para>We hope this bill reflects the government's continuing commitment to the PBS.

This means it is possible for a government to suppress a domestic price. When your local industry is being swamped with imports from some of these countries, you traditionally make an estimate of what the local price would be. But, in a command economy like China, it is possible for the government to make sure that the inputs and the output costs are all very low. Therefore, the domestic price is artificially kept low.</para><para>For Mr Fischer to have granted what is called free market status to China a couple of years ago as part of an agreement for which we have not yet had an explanation is quite extraordinary.

We on this side of the chamber, and our colleagues in the other place, have been keen to progress it.

Albeit that these practices are on a voluntary basis, there are measures that governments can take if they are not met. Clearly that is a competitive advantage that some countries have over us but it can be addressed through the customs legislation.</para><para>We can make changes that will not be in breach of the WTO rules. If we look around the world at the degree of protection that is employed by a whole host of other countries, including some of the biggest economic powers of the world, we see a totally different approach. We see examples from time to time where the US, at its will, takes certain measures that to all intents and purposes would seem to me to be in breach of the WTO rules, but are found not to be.</para><para>I have people say to me, `You suggest that we ought to take some measures, but they could end us up in a trade war, and we are not in a very strong position to enter a trade war.' I accept that, but there is nothing wrong with any country that takes measures that are consistent with the WTO and the rules that apply through the WTO. There is no reason for other countries to embark upon a trade war with us, if all we have done is to employ measures that are GATT and WTO consistent. 
 If they did, then I would suggest that they should only take measures that are also WTO and GATT consistent because otherwise we could run the same argument.</para><para>There have been many problems associated with both anti-dumping and, in the other area of customs, our own import restrictions. One example which I think was stuffed up monumentally from the start relates to our salmon farming. Clearly we ought to have a long, hard look at what we are doing in this area. Whilst we do support these bills as a small step forward we still have a long way to go.

This is to correct a drafting error—and I will not be provocative, Senator Murray, and say it was a drafting error from 1993. The amendment will safeguard the duty which has been paid to date. It is not as a result of any court cases; it has not affected anybody at this stage. The duty collection arrangements have not been 
 the subject of any court challenge. The amendment does not result in the imposition of any additional burden on any party—it merely serves to clarify and safeguard existing arrangements. I thought we should put that on the public record since you had raised that issue here.

I have referred to the strength of the current sales tax system on a number of previous occasions in the Senate in the context of the debate on the government's tax package and its continual assertions that the sales tax system is `broke'. It is not just the Treasurer and the Prime Minister who have made this 
 claim but recently the head of Treasury, Mr Evans, in estimates also said bluntly that it was broke. I have referred again on a number of occasions to the <inline font-style="italic">Oxford Dictionary</inline>  definition of broke or broken. We have had this continual mantra: the tax system, particularly the wholesale sales tax system, is broke or broken. The definition of broke or broken refers to such indicators as bankrupt.</para></talk.start><para>If we look at the recent revenue collection from wholesale sales tax, in fact the revenue for the six months up until December last year from wholesale sales tax collections grew by approximately nine per cent. To put that into perspective, that is well in excess of the current rate of economic growth. If a tax is broken, why is it collecting an ever-increasing amount of revenue and indeed why is it collecting more revenue than the economic growth of the country? So in terms of revenue projection it is clearly not broken.</para><para>It is interesting to note that in the last 12 years the Commonwealth budget has been in surplus on six occasions. Of those budget surpluses, four were delivered by Labor in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. As we know, the budget is back in surplus, it will certainly be in surplus when the next budget is handed down, and it is going to be in surplus for the foreseeable future with an alleged broken wholesale sales tax system and without a goods and services tax—at the present time at least and I hope for the long-term future. The notion that the sales tax base is crumbling is just unsustainable.</para><para>Recently, Access Economics released a paper analysing Australia's tax revenue base. They looked at the wholesale sales tax and pointed out a worst case scenario. They indicated that there was likely to be a loss of revenue of perhaps $100 million per year from the sales tax. Even if this were true, the loss of $100 million per year in revenue over, say, the next 20 or 30 years is absolutely minuscule in terms of the Commonwealth's revenue and the total budget.</para><para>Again recently, on the Senate tax committee of which I was a member, on the Monash model it was reported that Treasury had asserted that a major change in the tax mix was necessary because the present array of 
 indirect taxes will raise insufficient revenue in relation to Australia's future public sector requirements; however, the Treasury provided no explicit revenue forecasts. I emphasise that point. Treasury, according to Monash analysis, does not provide any explicit revenue forecasts in respect of the sales tax.</para><para>My colleagues Senators Conroy and Cook and I pursued in the recent estimates this issue with Treasury. We questioned them carefully about some files that we knew existed. We did not know their contents, but we knew that they existed about future revenue projections from sales tax. Initially at least, Treasury was denying that these files existed—until we read out the file numbers, which was a clear indication that the files existed. We wanted to know what was in those files. What are the future revenue projections? We had just had, as I referred to earlier, Mr Evans, the head of Treasury—and I know that Treasury officials do watch these debates on the TV screens down in the Treasury building—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">PATTERSON</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—Wave to them, then.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—I like to do more than wave to them. I like to give the big finger down to that GST, Senator, and all the misinformation we have been getting on the GST. It does not disappoint me that the government provides misinformation—you expect that, unfortunately—but it does disappoint me that the Treasury has been part of this process, from the fact that we could not get the sales tax revenue forecasts out of Treasury and the fact that Mr Evans says `It's broke' when clearly it is not broken. Labor makes no apologies for its position that the current wholesale sales tax should continue.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is not as though the current wholesale sales tax has not been updated and modernised, and not just in terms of the rates for collection. There have been very significant changes to our current wholesale sales tax over the past 50 or 60 years. It has been continually updated, continually modernised. Sales tax has great flexibility as a tax policy tool. You have a number of levels of sales tax and you can effectively tax progressively—unlike with a GST, where it is a common 10 per cent rate across almost all goods and 
 services. The wholesale sales tax is an input tax, just as this tax in respect of a GST on financial services and home rentals is an input tax; but the wholesale sales tax is a multiple rate structure, and that is an advantage, as I said earlier.</para><para>We do not believe that the current level of criticism of the wholesale sales tax is valid. Also, the wholesale sales tax does not tax the necessities of life. It does not tax most food, or clothing, footwear, electricity, gas or telephone—as the GST will. All that you wish to achieve in terms of revenue can be accomplished by the maintenance of the wholesale sales tax. It is not an unusual concept, even with a GST, to apply different rates of tax according to your particular ideological position about who should be taxed and at what rate.</para><para>It is interesting that there are many countries in the OECD—Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico and a considerable number of others—where their VAT applies at different levels. Labor certainly do not believe that we should have a GST. We do not believe that there is any need to shift from the current wholesale sales tax.</para><para>It is interesting that, with the goods and services tax proposed to replace the wholesale sales tax and nine other taxes—in the main, state taxes—the GST will raise some additional revenue. But that additional revenue is not critical to the maintenance of the budget surplus, and it is not critical to the delivery of the second element of the government's tax package, which is the income tax cuts.</para><para>One of the frustrating elements of the last election and the period since then is that, unfortunately, a significant number of Australians do not realise that with the government's tax package—and it is inequitable in terms of income tax cuts—those income tax cuts can be delivered without a GST. They are not dependent upon a GST. You could deliver the government's income tax cuts with the current wholesale sales tax, without it being replaced by a GST, because the proposed income tax cuts are based on a budget surplus that is likely to continue for at least the next couple of years. We do not need a GST. We simply 
 do not need it. We do not need it in order to maintain the revenue from indirect taxes and we do not need it in order to provide revenue for income tax cuts. For numerous other reasons, we do not need the wholesale sales tax replaced.</para><para>One of the major advantages of the wholesale sales tax is that there are only 70,000 tax collectors—70,000 businesses collect the wholesale sales tax. Initially in the first year the estimates are that under a GST there will be 1.4 million tax collectors, which will rise to 1.6 million tax collectors. In efficiency terms, how can a tax that increases the number of tax collectors from 70,000 to 1.6 million—there will be more than 1.5 million new tax collectors—be more efficient in terms of collection?</para><para>The vast majority of those new tax collectors will be small businesses and they will have additional compliance costs: the costs of doing business, meeting the paperwork requirements or whatever that may be. It may be $500 in one instance or $1,000 in another. In another instance it might be higher. We do know that the collection of the GST by small business particularly will involve compliance costs which will be greater than they will be for large businesses.</para><para>The wholesale sales tax is not perfect—I would be the first to say that—but it can be renewed and updated. One of the most misleading comments that is made, and one of the most commonly misunderstood aspects of the sales tax, is the continual assertion that the sales tax system is based on manufacturing and not on the growing services sector. The logic that is drawn from that is that that is why it is not a modern tax and in fact revenue will decline.</para><para>What is interesting about the sales tax is that it does tax a number of electronic goods, such as computers, to take one element, and they in turn are based on the growing services industries. So a sales tax is, in part, certainly based on manufacturing, but in turn based on the growth of services industries. It is not correct to say that the sales tax is purely based on manufacturing. That is one of the reasons why sales tax revenues are not declining. </para><para>I want to make a couple of other points about sales tax. Sales tax is maintaining its revenue collection role. It is efficient to collect in terms of the cost of collection, both for government and businesses that are involved in that process. There does not seem to be—certainly to Labor—any good reason for a GST, other than an ideological obsession on the part of this government.</para><para>As I said earlier, we can have the income tax cuts that the government is proposing without a GST; there is no basis for such a proposal in terms of revenue. The GST can be knocked over, and Labor is certainly intent on doing that and ensuring it is not passed. The government's proposed income tax cuts are grossly inequitable and unfair, and reward the higher income earners by a factor of two or three to one over the lower middle income earners. But, if the government wants to deliver that, it can deliver it tomorrow without a GST and the budget will still be in surplus. Those are a few points I wanted to make about sales tax.</para><para>In my concluding remarks I might just say that we are debating non-controversial legislation, which is the norm on a Thursday. There are a number of bills put before the Senate that can be dealt with speedily, and Labor has facilitated that. Again I emphasise that it is a matter of deep regret to the Labor opposition that, when we go back after question time this afternoon to debating government legislation, we will not be dealing with the GST legislation.</para><para>There are more people than normal listening to the broadcast, because the House of Representatives is not sitting. There is a certain degree of public interest in the goods and services tax package. But what is important is that many of those listening—whatever the number—had a belief that we would be dealing with the goods and services tax. The Senate's  time this week and next week has been specifically set aside to deal with the goods and services tax.</para><para>In fact, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, have been out in the community and on the radio waves saying, `The Senate has got to pass this tax package.' They are telling the senators, `Get 
 in there and pass it.' Labor is here in the Senate wanting to debate the goods and services tax package.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">COONAN</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name></talker><para>—But you don't want to pass it, do you?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—We certainly will not pass it. I will take that interjection. But the sooner we get on with it and know what the final position is, the better. Labor will not support a goods and services tax. I am proud of that, and the Labor Party is proud of that. That is the position we took to the last election and, for some of the reasons I explained a little earlier in my comments, it is not a tax that Australia needs. The goods and services tax is not necessary.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I indicate to those people who believe that we should be discussing the goods and services tax today that we are not discussing it because the government's own leadership in the Senate yesterday afternoon decided to put off the debate on the GST, and not go into committee and discuss it in detail.</para><para>There is the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, out there saying, `Get on and pass the GST,' but the Liberal government's leadership in here is saying, `We are not going to consider it until tomorrow,' and I suspect not until next week the way things are heading. This is not because of any deliberate time delaying by the Labor Party.</para><para>Yesterday there were some examples of confusion in the Senate. Two government senators went to lunch early and the government missed the vital vote. There was some degree of confusion on the government's side. The government leader, Senator Hill, is away and has been replaced by Senator Alston, who has not been able to keep up with the game in terms of dealing with the government's GST legislation.</para><para>Surprisingly—the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and Mr Howard have been assuring Australians that the GST package does not need any amendment; that it is a good package and it does not need any change—yesterday the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, presented us with a list of about 125 or 126 amendments to the government's package.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">MURRAY</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—There were 128.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—Thank you. The government is bringing in 128 amendments to its package, which, it has been assuring everyone, does not need amendment. I always get suspicious when Senator Kemp says `minor technical matters' or `minor technical details'—he has done it on another occasion. But on this occasion 128 amendments to the government's GST package are referred to as `minor technical matters'. If you look through some of these `minor technical matters'—and I had an opportunity overnight to look at some of them at least—they relate to the sale of farms and how they will be treated with a GST. Some of the amendments relate to charities and the way in which the GST will be collected and enforced. Quite fundamental issues are addressed in those `minor technical amendments'. Normally Senator Kemp refers to them as `enhancements'—that is the jargon you get when the government is backing down on something in a big way.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I emphasise again that the sales tax we have in this country is sustainable and efficient and there is no need to replace it with a goods and services tax. There are particular problems with the sales tax, but they can be addressed and that should continue on an ongoing basis as it has for the last 60 or 70 years. For this and other reasons, which we will get into on other occasions, we do not need a goods and services tax. Labor stands ready to debate that package of legislation. We should get on with it and debate it and hopefully—certainly Labor will take this view—we will be voting the GST down.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>4132</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r601">Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998</inline>  seeks to exempt from sales tax four main categories. The first one is space equipment. In 1998 the government took several initiatives designed to facilitate the development of a commercial space industry in Australia. That statement on its own is worth noting. I am always pleased when I see the walls of economic rationalism and free marketeering crumble, because the government's support for a commercial space industry specifically entails selecting an industry for development which will be good 
 for Australia. I think that is entirely the right policy, and I am very glad to see the saner minds in the coalition prevail on those issues.</para></talk.start><para>The financial impact of exempting from sales tax space launch vehicles, payloads and other goods intended for launch into outer space or to be brought back from outer space—true exports in the bigger sense of the word, I guess—amounts to $60 million. So we can quantify the amount of industry assistance being provided to this very desirable new industry by Australia. Thank you to those in the government who do not believe in the extremes of economic rationalism and who do believe in supporting industries and in providing subsidies and supports where appropriate.</para><para>The second area being addressed is that of goods imported by Olympians. Certain goods are to be exempted from sales tax when imported by overseas participants and delegations attending the Sydney 2000 Olympics, Paralympics and associated events. The goods are not provided in a scheduled sense—they are just described generally—so it is a fairly loose and broad approach. The exemption for goods imported by Olympians has a financial impact which is unquantifiable but is expected to be low. I am not sure what `low' means but, nevertheless, if we are in for billions with supporting the Olympics this measure is just adding to the sense of supporting an enterprise and a sporting event which has changed the face of Sydney and which will be good for Australia. The whole question of Sydney 2000 Olympics and any support, even by the sales tax bill, is to be welcomed.</para><para>The third area of attention is that of sales tax evasion in the computer industry. The government has quite rightly tightened up on the potential for such sales tax evasion to occur. But again the financial impact is recorded as an unquantifiable revenue gain.</para><para>I will need a response from the parliamentary secretary because the Scrutiny of Bills Committee again drew attention to this bill. The committee expressed concern that the starting date in respect of the provisions dealing with sales tax evasion in the computer industry is not defined, and there is no provision for automatic commencement after the 
 lapse of a certain period. The government's response to this, when the Scrutiny of Bills Committee wrote to them, was that sales tax evasion in the computer industry is not yet a significant problem—I do not quite know how they assessed that—and they will only proclaim these provisions to commence if it does become a problem. Given that the wholesale sales tax will be abolished on 1 July 2000—that is, if the GST bills go through—it may be that the commencement of these provisions could be postponed indefinitely and exporters therefore would be saved a compliance cost. This is an interesting approach—and perhaps the parliamentary secretary can explain it in her response—because it seems to me that it is almost like a threat, where the government is saying, `We've got the law, we've passed the law, and if you don't mind your p's and q's in this business, we are going to proclaim it.' That sort of provision makes me a little nervous, frankly, because there is no sunset clause and this could hang around for a long time. I might have misunderstood the intent, but I would appreciate a response on that.</para><para>The other area picked on in the sales tax bill is the temporary importation of goods. I note that the estimated gain in revenue is $2 million per annum, so it does mean that people who are involved in that area will see themselves squeezed a little tighter by the Treasurer and the Treasury for the gain of $2 million. I do not think it deserves any special attention, but there it is—another revenue raising device. With those brief remarks—I will not take the full 20 minutes that is allocated to me—I record the support of the Australian Democrats for this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>4133</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the <inline ref="r601">Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998</inline> . The bill contains four proposed changes to the sales tax law, of which two are anti-avoidance measures, one will encourage the development of the commercial space launch industry in Australia and, as Senator Murray pointed out, the other measure will ensure that sales tax does not apply to certain goods brought into 
 Australia by non-Australian family members of participants and by delegations of participants in the Olympic and Paralympic Games and associated events.</para></talk.start><para>With respect to the issue that Senator Murray mentioned regarding a matter raised in the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, in order to facilitate the passage of the bill I will table the letter that was sent to Senator Cooney as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills from Senator Kemp so that it is available on the public record. But, as a short answer: it is considered that the proposed export provisions will be a powerful disincentive to evasion, even without a fixed starting date. These amendments will act as a deterrent to discourage this type of behaviour from developing, while allowing for a quick response in the event of an emerging problem with tax evasion of this nature.</para><para>Commencement of these provisions would lead to potentially significant compliance costs for some exporters. On the other hand, if the provisions do operate effectively as a deterrent to evasion, it may be possible to indefinitely defer the start date and these compliance costs. This is in line with the industry's wish to have laws which target evasion but have a limited impact on complying taxpayers and the industry generally. Industry has noted that such strong statements from government are effective in combating evasion.</para><para>The avoidance of compliance costs in this case is especially desirable, given the current intention to end sales tax on 1 July 2000. Any fixed starting date for the legislation would be shortly before 1 July 2000. It would not be cost effective for either the industry or the tax office to incur these compliance costs unless there was proof of significant emerging abuse of the export exemption.</para><para>A similar open-ended commencement date exists with respect to the retailer withholding regime, which is another anti-evasion measure aimed at the computer industry.

I think it is important to have that highlighted in this chamber because constantly we have had a focus on GST and food in, food out, but it seems to have been forgotten what an enormously important initiative tax reform will be for low to middle income families, especially those with children.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Can I just list some of the things that people may well have forgotten. There is the reduction in marginal tax rates, for example, 
 and an increase in the tax-free threshold to $6,000. Every family under $50,000 will face a top marginal tax rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar—and that is a huge improvement when you consider the existing income tax rates which have not been changed since 1993. Eighty-one per cent of taxpayers will have a top marginal tax rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar.</para><para>When you think about the existing system, if we do not do anything about tax reform, those taxpayers on average weekly earnings now will be paying 47 cents in the dollar—that is,  the top marginal tax rate—unless we do something now. These are average income earners, and that surely is just not fair. So in all the debate about tax reform let us not forget those people, who are waiting for a fairer system for them and their families.</para><para>The existing $1 billion of the family tax initiative, which the government introduced as soon as we came into power in 1996, is going to be expanded and the family tax initiative will become a $2.4 billion package. There is the increase in the tax-free threshold to $13,000 for families with children under the age of five: they pay no tax until they reach $13,000. Families will receive an effective 70 per cent increase in support from the Commonwealth for each dependent child. That is an additional $140. There is improved child-care assistance, such that a family with one child in full-time care will receive up to $120 a week in assistance with child-care costs.</para><para>There is abolition of the assets test for family payment, which will particularly be helpful to those in regional and rural areas; an increase in the level of income at which assistance begins to be income tested from $24,350 a year with one child, which it currently is, to $28,200 a year; and a reduction in the income test taper from 50 per cent to 30 per cent. That means that low income families, who under the existing system face a high, effective marginal tax rate of some 85½ per cent, will see that fall to 61½ per cent under tax reform. These are disincentives that we inherited from the Labor Party, who opposed tax reform. We want to address them with our tax reform package because we 
 believe Australia families deserve a better go. Our tax reform package will deliver that, and in the fire and brimstone that we hear from the Neanderthals opposite they never ever give you any time of day for Australian families trying to raise kids.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4140</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

As the senator stated, it has been known for a long time that fine particles when inhaled can lead to aggravation of respiratory symptoms in people with pre-existing respiratory illness and to hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. That 
 is correct. But other air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and ozone, also mainly due to motor vehicle pollution, can also cause increases in respiratory symptoms leading to hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, as reported recently in a study conducted in Sydney. So it is not good enough to start talking about diesel fuel emissions.</para></talk.start><para>While diesel vehicles generate 70 to 80 per cent of all vehicle produced particulates in our cities, this figure needs to be seen in context. The State of the Environment report estimates the combined contribution to particulate levels from all motor vehicles at 31 to 46 per cent in summer but only nine to 10 per cent in winter. So it is all very well to make these breathtaking statements that it is all related to this. It is not true. Those proportions that I have mentioned vary from city to city and are due to multiple factors such as domestic wood fires, hazard reduction burning and bushfires. We have to take all that into account.</para><para>The government, through a coordinated approach between transport and environment agencies, has recently launched a major campaign to reduce the impact from all motor vehicles on public health and the environment, as it should. A key effort of the campaign is to set strict standards on diesel vehicle emissions and improve the quality of diesel fuel. Both measures are aimed directly at reducing particle exhaust emissions from diesels. It is expected that, even if the use of diesel powered vehicles were to increase, the level of air pollution in the future due to diesels should decrease as a result of increased controls on vehicle emissions and improvements in fuel quality. The proposed measures are intended to reduce the overall cost of transport services, which will provide a considerable advantage in terms of reducing the cost of healthy food for those individuals living in rural and remote communities.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4146</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

These issues are being examined in the budget context, and I am advised that they will be addressed shortly.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Fairness</title><page.no>4150</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>4150</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston) to a question without notice asked by Senator Faulkner today, relating to compensation under a goods and services tax.</para><para>This was a question which went once again to the government's credibility in terms of the proposals that the government has for compensation for the GST package that it is seeking to push through this chamber. I use the term `push through' in a very loose sense because, as we know, the debate on the bills has been adjourned and, frankly, the government's program has ground to a screaming halt. What we heard today was Senator Alston's very limp, lame attempt to explain the government's embarrassment over the growing number of backbenchers that are now drawing the country's attention to the inadequacies of the government's compensation package for the GST. We have had Mr Bob Katter, Mrs De-Anne Kelly, Senator Tierney and now the member for Parkes, Mr Lawler, who was quoted today in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> :</para><para>But the Government's attempts to hold the line on the package were undermined again, this time by National Party MP Mr Tony Lawler, who suggested economic growth yielded plenty of revenue to meet claims for extra compensation.</para><para>`While keeping the GST on food is essential to the success of the package, flexibility on concessions is equally important,' Mr Lawler said.</para><para>Senator Alston suggested to us that Senator Tierney had been misrepresented in the remarks that he had made earlier this week to 
 the TV cameras in front of this building when he had indicated, according to AAP, that `the government is looking at particularly the lower end of the tax scale'. Everyone knows, as he indicated, that that is what the practice is at the moment.</para><para>We now have a number of government members indicating how inadequate the compensation package is, yet we still have Senator Alston suggesting to this chamber, in a manner very reminiscent of the ostrich with his head in the sand, that there is nothing wrong with the GST package. Nothing could be further from the truth. What we have seen with this package is that the proposals that the government makes on compensation are in themselves acknowledgment of the unfairness of it. You do not seek to compensate people for actions that have been taken by government unless they are in fact hurtful to people. That is the whole nature of compensation, I would have thought.</para><para>These proposals regarding tax cuts will see more than 50 per cent of the benefits going to the top 20 per cent of income earners. We will see higher income earners benefiting in ways which far outweigh any benefits which might arise for persons on social security payments. We see the situation being developed by this government where a couple with no children earning $100,000 per year will get five times the benefit of low income families with three children.</para><para>We saw throughout this week Senator Alston trying to sleaze his way through a number of questions on the GST, and in a most duplicitous and disingenuous way suggest that there are no losers in this package. Of course, from the other questions asked today—Senator Crossin asked about the higher education sector, and Senator Kemp failed to address that problem—it was clearly identified that those persons who do not have a direct relationship with government—that is, those who do not pay tax or are not part of a social security benefit—can in no way enjoy any compensation at all. That is not to mention those who do have a relationship with government whose compensation measures will be quickly eroded under this government's proposals. No measures are being 
 taken to protect people from that inevitable consequence.</para><para>We have been able to establish, as Senator Alston indicated yesterday, that some 19 per cent of Australians will be worse off. His position does not take into account that pensioners will be worse off, that parents with kids at school will be worse off and that older people will be worse off. Average families and poorer people will be worse off under this proposal. If we look carefully at Senator Alston's comments that no-one will be worse off, what we really understand from that is that no-one he knows will be worse off. The circles in which he moves in the leafy suburbs of inner eastern Melbourne are where the people are who will directly benefit from this proposal. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>4151</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It never ceases to amaze me when someone like Senator Carr from the Labor Party gets up and talks about compensation. How much compensation did the ALP offer to Australian taxpayers every time they put up tax? Not one cent, Senator Carr. Now all you want to do is talk about levels of compensation that are going to be given to the Australian people as a result of the biggest reform of taxation that this country has ever seen.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian government, in formulating this package, made sure that with modelling and consultation they could compensate those people who were going to have the price effect of a CPI affect their household expenditure and their ability to pay—compensation that the Labor Party never offered and never even looked like offering to the Australian people in 1993 when they decided they would increase the wholesale sales tax rate, which is the only way that they can ever increase the amount of revenue that is collected by this government by way of indirect taxation. They just increased the wholesale sales tax rate out of hand, after going to an election in 1993 promising to reject a new form of indirect tax and promising income tax cuts. But what did we get? No income tax cuts, and a higher rate of wholesale sales tax with absolutely no compensation. </para><para>Senator Carr talked about other members of the coalition who have made comments in relation to this. I just say to Senator Carr that that is one thing that we on this side are allowed to do—over there, you are not. If you do not agree wholeheartedly with everything that your party does, you have no opportunity to say so—unless, of course, you happen to be Mark Latham or Lindsay Tanner or one of the young turks who do not like the way the Labor Party is progressing at present and do not like the way that the party has no policy on anything at all. Some of the young turks have decided that they are going to have a bit of a dig to see if they can put some life into this old Labor Party which has no policies at all and nothing to offer the Australian people in place of the comprehensive tax reform that this party and this government has introduced.</para><para>I do not know what it is that Senator Carr has against average wage and salary earners in Australia. In all of the debate that we have had over the past few months about who is going to be affected by the introduction of a goods and services tax—we have had body after body of social security and welfare agencies, and people of that sort, coming and giving as evidence—nowhere has anybody from that side of the chamber ever defended the position of average income earners in Australia. Average income earners currently pay far more tax than they should be paying. They are currently paying a far greater proportion of their household income on tax than ever was the case 15 or 20 years ago.</para><para>The Labor Party have no concerns at all about average wage earners in Australia. They are the party that always says they represent these people. They go off about the big end of town and try to make up what they would call evidence with regard to welfare recipients and low income earners, but the Labor Party could not care less about average wage earners in Australia who have been treated poorly by them now since 1983 and who have seen their relative take-home pay, as a percentage of their total earnings, decrease in every situation.</para><para>The Labor Party talk about high salary earners who they think are not paying their fair share of tax. We will have a situation 
 soon, if we do not start changing it now, where nearly 80 per cent of Australians will be paying at least 43c in the dollar. Many of those people will be paying the highest marginal rate of tax. If you are a single income earning family, on the average wage, is it fair that you should be paying the top marginal rate of tax or very close to it when you are thinking about trying to raise a family in Australia's current climate, and when your actual household expenditure—or the amount of money you have available for household expenditure—is reduced every time there is a wage increase by the effects of bracket creep? Senator Carr, when you start talking about compensation and all of the other measures, spare a thought for the average wage earner in Australia who you could not care less about and who you have disregarded now for the past 13 years.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>4152</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to join this debate today because Senator Alston's failure to answer this question almost led to a situation of high farce. In fact, I am reminded of the fable of the emperor with new clothes because Mr Howard, the Prime Minister of this country, goes around saying, `I've got this fine new GST suit, and all will be better off as a result of it. The compensation will be adequate, everyone will be better off, it won't be eroded. I've got this brand new suit that's going to solve the problems of our economy.' All the courtiers on the other side—all the members of parliament—say, `Oh yes, Prime Minister, it's a wonderful new suit,' and, `Yes, this is the solution to all our problems.' But one poor lonely backbencher—maybe out of ignorance or maybe he is trying to get noticed; like the little boy in the fable—says, `But the emperor has no clothes. The compensation isn't adequate. </para></talk.start><para>The compensation will not protect the poor. The poor will be worse off. We must do something about it.' He has exposed the fact that the emperor—Mr Howard—has no clothes. And what is the reaction? The reaction is to try to hush him up—to go on pretending that the emperor is wearing a fine new suit, because they cannot face the reality.</para><para>The courtiers have been warned by some of their country cousins that the emperor has no clothes, that the suit is not what they claim, but they have ignored the country cousins because `They never take much notice of them. With the inbreeding and other issues that go on there, they don't worry about them.' So what do they do? They call in the poor little backbencher who has exposed the fact that the Prime Minister has no clothes and say, `You can't go around saying that. You have to believe too. You have to believe that we have this shiny new suit—that the compensation is adequate, that the poor will be better off, that Australia will be better off, and that there are no problems.'</para><para>I think on this occasion the emperor has to recognise that he has no clothes. They have tried to ignore the peasants, they have tried to ignore the churches and to pretend that when they say the emperor has no clothes that in fact he still does, but we all know the emperor has no clothes. This suit is not a bright, new shiny suit. There are really serious issues here: the compensation to the poor and to low income earners in this country is not adequate. They will be severely hurt by the GST.</para><para>The government's way of dealing with that critique from within its own backbenches is to call the recalcitrants in and tell them off. They have to continue the sort of pretence that Senator Alston has gone on with this week when answering questions about the GST. But you can see his heart has not been in it. I suspect that, like Senator Tierney, he really believes that the emperor has no clothes. Can he argue the case? No. When he comes in, what does he do? He reads Mr Costello's article from the newspaper. He cannot mount the argument to defend the government's line on compensation.</para><para>Everyone recognises that the compensation for the poor and low income earners will be eroded over time—it is now an accepted fact—but Senator Alston does not have the capability to argue the government's case. He has to read not only a speech by Mr Costello but an edited version out of the newspaper, because that is the limit of his grasp. He cannot argue the case because it is indefen 
 sible. Compensation is inadequate. The poor and low income earners in this country will be worse off under the GST, and the government will have to recognise that eventually—to get this package through the Senate it will have to recognise that fact. The question posed today was whether Senator Tierney will get an apology. I suspect not. But the government will have to acknowledge what everyone else in Australia knows—that the GST is unfair, that the compensation package is inadequate, and that the compensation will be eroded over time.</para><para>If Senator Alston wants to be Leader of the Government in the Senate he is going to have to get a lot better at arguing the government's case. Even when there are impossible cases, he will have to do a much better job than to merely read Mr Costello's newspaper articles. It may be a sign of loyalty, but it is not a sign of intellectual rigour and it is not a sign of a leader.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—I'm going to read it too.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>—If you will be reading it too, Senator McGauran, that makes my case.

He talked about how consumption tax benefits business. He talked about it being a time for honesty and responsibility, not scare tactics. That was in a speech in 1985. Keating said that it was time for reform.

In a <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline>  program interview on 2 June 1985, he said:</para></talk.start></continue><para>. . . unless there is a source of income in the consumption area, then the mass of Australians—the ordinary taxpayers—are not going to be able to get the substantial cuts in personal direct taxes to which they are entitled.</para><para>And they did not get the tax cuts they were promised.

Hawke knew that. He knew that to be able to provide health and social security, and to be able to provide the states with what they need to fund hospitals, roads and education, we need a broad based consumption tax and overall tax reform.</para><para>You should listen also to some of the people who have become disillusioned with the ALP. Former ALP National Secretary Bob Hogg has called on the party to abandon its opposition to the GST and the full sale of Telstra. He said that Labor should support the GST. He argued that it should be supported provided that measures are introduced to give continuing compensation to low income earners and pensioners. Senator Newman has reiterated over and over again in this place how that will happen, and Hogg has called on the Labor Party to support the GST as long as those compensations are enshrined in law. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 24 March, he said:</para><para>While Beazley fights the past on (Prime Minister) Howard's and Harradine's terms, he and the ALP will remain marginalised and diverted from the central task of designing new policies.</para><para>That is just it. Even the Democrats have come up with a concept—the Irish model. The only way you can describe the Labor Party's model is as `the Atlantis model' or as `the Babylonian model'—ones which are reliant upon 
 wholesale sales tax. It is an ancient, decrepit, outdated and complex system which is unfair and by which the Labor Party was able to increase wholesale sales tax. Just after the 1993 election, it increased wholesale sales tax on everything, from buckets to horse rugs, to pet food, to gladwrap, to alfoil, to toothpaste or toothbrushes—I cannot remember which has wholesale sales tax. I reiterate here in the chamber, as I have done over and over, that wholesale sales tax applies to strawberry Quik but not to chocolate Quik. How they can justify that, I do not know. But that is their policy. They have a tax policy to support wholesale sales tax—a decrepit, outdated system, the base of which is becoming smaller and smaller and means we cannot sustain into the future social security, health and payments to the states.</para><para>After the 1993 election, Labor increased sales tax on everything—as I said, from buckets to horse rugs. Sales tax on cars was increased from 16 to 22 per cent. Petrol excise was increased by 5c a litre for unleaded petrol and by 7c a litre for leaded petrol. The Medicare levy was increased to 1.5 per cent and company tax was reduced, only to be increased soon afterwards. What did they do? They did not give one penny to compensate for the cascading effect of all those increased wholesale sales taxes. They did not give one penny of compensation, and they failed to deliver on the second tranche of the l-a-w tax cuts. To come in here and talk about compensation is hypocritical and totally untenable, and it is about time they took the advice of the former ALP secretary and supported the tax reform package.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>4154</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are here now to take note of the answer given by Senator Alston to one question this afternoon. In fact if this speech that I am making now was as long as his answer, I would have already sat down. There was change out of 30 seconds in his answer to that question. That somewhat disappointed most of us on this side because, when we heard that Senator Hill was not going to be here, we thought that the ambitious deputy would be really keen to get into the front seat, which he has always wanted to do, to show us and the 
 world how good he is and how he can answer questions. We had also hoped that, as a bonus, during this week of GST sittings he might actually have been able to organise the House. But that did not happen either.</para></talk.start><para>What happened in that one question today? And I want to stress that: one question. The other day we on this side asked Senator Alston five or six questions. We did not get very far; we did not get anything more than the usual abuse and, unfortunately for the good senator this week, the fumbling through of all the briefs. In fact, I really have to go back to my state member of parliament days, when I watched representatives from the State Bank of South Australia present themselves for estimates, to see people fumble briefs worse than what I saw here by Senator Alston this week—with, sadly, the same result.</para><para>When Senator Alston cannot get his fingers on a brief—the idea of actually learning about it or knowing something about the topic before he comes in has actually escaped him—what we normally get from him is a tirade of abuse which normally starts out by pointing out that every senator over here has either been, still is or will be a trade union official. That is the usual start for it. For those of us of the Catholic faith, I suppose you could say that that is making the sign of the cross. Afterwards, we get the usual bombastic bullying and abuse that flows from the deputy leader over there.</para><para>Today we did not get any of that. In fact for most of the week we have had a really curious stumbling which I can only describe as a curious lack of confidence from the man who wants the job of leading the government in this chamber. Today we got a 30-second answer which said, `It's a hypothetical question,' and he sat down. I must say that I have watched Senator Tierney over the last couple of days, and I think it was anything other than hypothetical. In fact I would have liked to know how severe the carpeting was. I must say that I do not think it was as severe as that of poor old Senator Watson a couple of months ago. When Senator Watson came in here after his tea and sympathy trip up to the Prime Minister's office, he certainly looked 
 like the Spanish Inquisition had dealt with him.</para><para>Senator Tierney has been sitting back there and probably taking his lead from Senator Watson, who today obviously joined in the show and asked a question and made all the right noises—and I think somebody here said something about the emperor's new clothes, but I do not want to get into that. At the end of the day, he seems to have jumped back on board the bus. Not only should Senator Alston have run this place better and been across his briefs this week; he should have been prepared to do something to show that in fact he could competently lead the government in this place—that is, he should have actually answered a few questions. Today we gave him just one question. All he had to do for us today was answer one question, and he could not even do that. I think that, unfortunately, when Senator Hill's plane touches down that is going to be the end of Senator Alston's ambitions to lead in this place. Bring on Senator Minchin.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>4155</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Quirke, I think you have misread—which does not surprise me—Senator Alston's demeanour at the front table.

I rise to speak in relation to the actions of two ministers. The first minister I would like to speak about is Senator Ian Macdonald. He is one of the main culprits in relation to this and the one I wish to deal with in particular. I think it is appro 
 priate that this matter be debated here today in general business because of the serious nature of the allegations that I am making.</para><para>Senator Ian Macdonald has exhibited what can only be described as an arrogant attitude towards the Senate and towards public accountability and transparency in general. This is something that this minister has turned into an art form, dodging questions and inventing various complex excuses as to why the Senate should not be provided with information about government programs and administration.</para><para>This minister, when he puts out his media releases, often does not even show the courtesy of putting them in the opposition box. The opposition always, as a matter of courtesy, puts its press releases in the government box so that the government can be apprised of what we are saying. He often does not. I am not sure why. If it is deliberate, I think that is pretty puerile. Certainly there have been a number of occasions on which press releases have been put out and we have not received them.</para><para>Let us cast our minds back to the estimates hearings held on 8, 9 and 19 February. Senator Ian Macdonald made it very clear from the outset that he was not keen on questions on notice. He did not want to answer them and he did not want his public servants to answer them. He attempted to claim that, if the department were to answer questions on notice put by the opposition and others, it would take up too much time, cost too much and it would not happen. He offered the opposition a private briefing.</para><para>Interestingly, at the conclusion of estimates, Senator Ian Macdonald was being so obstructive that, in relation to a request by my colleague Senator Lundy that he take a question on notice and pass it on to the relevant department, he suggested that Senator Lundy should put a question on notice to Senator Alston because, `That way you are certain of getting a response.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—What a joke.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—That has its inherent ironies indeed, Senator Carr, but I think it does say something about Senator Ian Mac 
 donald. It is clear now what he meant in relation to that comment to Senator Lundy, because there is no certainty of getting a response if you put the question on notice to Senator Ian Macdonald. Senator Ian Macdonald showed the full extent of his attempts to obstruct transparency when he told the committee on 19 February:</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have got to say there are more important things to be done by the department, and my instructions to the department will be not to divert themselves from the real issues of the department to answer questions which are really matters that could be done at private briefings much more quickly and much more efficiently.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Less publicly.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—Not publicly indeed, Senator Carr. That was the point of it. Clearly there is no public accountability in relation to this and this minister is silly enough to admit it—and here he comes into the chamber.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Later in the estimates the minister went on to seek to prevent public servants from answering perfectly legitimate questions about consultation between the departments. They were questions such as on what date officials from his department had meetings with the officials from the department of education. This was in respect of Greenwich University. They were very specific questions. Senator Ian Macdonald, in what I regarded as a contemptuous manner, stated:</para><para>What I am saying is that I do not want the officials to be talking about who they spoke with, when they had these flashes of brilliance where they determined policy, who they got the advice from . . . or which calculator they used to add up the figures.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—They didn't; that is the problem.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—That is correct. This was somewhat ironic, given that the opposition had been referred to his department to answer questions specifically on Greenwich University, so ably taken up by my colleague Senator Carr.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The minister's directive to the department was offensive, not only to us as the opposition but also to the public servants involved, casting aspersions on their competency. Consistently during the estimates, Senator Ian Macdonald would interrupt his officials as 
 they were attempting to answer questions and answer them himself. From an opposition's perspective it is always handy when the minister digs the hole for himself, and that is obviously what happened. However, on a number of occasions we were after answers to very specific questions from the public servants involved, which Senator Ian Macdonald could not have known the answers to. On a couple of occasions he got it wrong.</para><para>As I said, this reflects very poorly on the department and you could see the frustration on their faces as the estimates proceeded. He is not doing his department a service when he interrupts his public servants and does not allow them to answer questions. Who was it who said while in opposition, in relation to the non-answering of questions, `This is appalling behaviour on behalf of the government and quite typical of the way it manages the country'? Who would that have been? None other than Senator Ian Macdonald. In fact, Senator Ian Macdonald made a real art form of continually coming into the chamber and getting stuck into the previous government in relation to the non-answering of questions. When he was in opposition, in relation to Senator Ray, Senator Ian Macdonald said:</para><para>The fact that the minister may be busy is tough luck. The standing orders are the rules which run this chamber, and the minister, no matter how busy he is, is obliged, like the rest of us, to abide by the standing orders of this chamber.</para><para>That is from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> , 14 December 1993. Don't comments you make in opposition come back to bite you in government? Here we are, almost five weeks on from the deadline by which the answers to questions on notice were supposed to be tabled, and we have not got one answer from Transport, not one answer from Regional Services, not one answer from Territories and not one answer from Local Government. In fact, we are advised by the secretariat of the committee—I checked this again today—that the minister's own office has advised the secretary of the committee that the questions on notice were sitting on the desks of Minister Ian Macdonald and his colleague the minister for transport. In a week and a half's time we have additional supplementary estimates in which 
 we are expected to ask questions, and we have no indication of when these answers are going to be tabled.</para><para>It is not just the opposition that is concerned about this. I would like here to acknowledge the efforts of Senator Crane, who as chair of the estimates committee has gone to great lengths to attempt to get answers from Minister Macdonald and Minister Anderson.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'BRIEN</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—Fair enough.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—Good on him too. He has written a number of times to the department and the minister essentially saying that these questions on notice must be answered. I think that Senator Crane, whatever else we may think, is generally pretty reasonable in relation to these sorts of matters. It was raised again at a committee meeting earlier this week, and Senator Crane basically indicated that there was not a lot more he could do in relation to this matter; hence the general business motion here today.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When Senator Macdonald offered the opposition a private briefing in relation particularly to transport, because we had had the temerity to put a large number of questions on notice, we sought the advice of the Clerk of the Senate. I would like to read a section of the written advice. It reads:</para><para>The Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, suggested that briefings should be used as an alternative to written and oral questions at estimates hearings, and made this suggestion partly on the basis that such questions divert departmental resources from delivering the services of the department. Two preliminary observations should be made.</para><para>This is getting to the important part that I invite Senator Macdonald, now he is here, to listen to very closely:</para><para>Any scrutiny or accountability process diverts departmental resources from delivery of service, but this does not mean that public departments should be free of scrutiny and accountability processes.</para><para>It then goes on:</para><para>It is not clear why the Minister thought that there was anything inappropriate about the questions asked or where any particular questions were regarded as unduly diverting resources. Secondly, it is not clear how the provision of briefings that 
 Senator Macdonald offered would involve any less use of resources than answering questions at estimates hearings. It would appear that both processes would equally occupy departmental resources.</para><para>The opposition took that advice on board. We then wrote formally to the committee and said, `No, we respect the opinion of the Clerk in this instance and we will not be pursuing the private briefing.' This was after a considerable debate at the committee meeting where we did canvass every option in relation to the briefing and we decided that, if we were going to have the briefing the way we wanted it, which was open to the public, which was Hansarded, which was telecast, et cetera, it was effectively an estimates hearing, so what was the point of doing that. We may as well go ahead with the questions on notice and proceed with the estimates process as it is duly determined.</para><para>As I said before, the questions were put on notice during the estimates in February and the due date for the receipt of those answers was 25 March. It is now a month down the track and we have not had a single answer. So much for accountability. The estimates committee did offer Senator Macdonald the option of his department releasing them to us as they finished answering them. That is fair enough, so we said, `Okay, as you get through them, provide them to the opposition.' No, they are still sitting on the two ministers' desks. I would like to quote from a letter that Senator Crane wrote to the department, with a copy to the minister's office, in terms of the requests, pointing out:</para><para>Whilst members acknowledge there were a significant number of questions placed on notice during this round of estimates, committee members also noted that the supplementary round of additional estimates hearings are proposed for the first week in May and that answers will be required well in advance of that hearing.</para><para>Senator Crane is correct, and again I would like to put on record the opposition's thanks to Senator Crane for attempting to get these answers. You would have thought that, as he is one of the government's own members, we might have got some answers to questions on notice. Not a cracker!</para><para>Senator Crane then wrote on 13 April directly to Senator Macdonald seeking the answers, pointing out the concern of committee members to receive those answers that had been processed by the department well in advance of the supplementary additional estimates hearing scheduled for 4 May. It was 13 April when Senator Crane wrote. Estimates are now six working days away, and we still do not have one answer.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—What is he doing?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—That is a very good question, Senator Carr. I do not know. As I said, I understand that the secretariat has been advised by the minister's office that they are sitting on the minister's desk. We have had a major reshuffle in terms of departments, we have had major changes, we have new ministers, we have new programs and we have a new structure. It is not in the interests of the public, never mind the Senate and the people we represent, that questions on notice are not answered, particularly in relation to regional Australia, which is so remote and it obviously takes time to get the responses out.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us just have a look at some of the questions we actually put on notice, which Senator Macdonald trivialised. There are a number of questions relating to the safety investigations carried out by CASA in the past 12 months. That is obviously the subject of a further inquiry. We asked questions in relation to the current status for reopening consideration of statehood in the Northern Territory. I would have thought that would have been of some moment to the minister for territories. We wanted to know what recommendations the review of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme had made. No response to that. We wanted to know whether there was funding or technical assistance available from the Commonwealth to assist local governments to meet Y2K compliance. Time is certainly ticking away on that one. No response. We wanted a full list of local government development grant programs made since the publication of the local government national report. Incidentally, the minister has been running around the country merrily announcing these since the estimates, but he does not feel able to provide them in 
 response to questions on notice from the opposition.</para><para>This is pretty odd: the minister is running around the country announcing them—the minister is announcing some but usually it is in fact the coalition backbencher who is doing the announcing in relation to those—but we still cannot get a consolidated list. We also asked about the criterion process in place for allocating rural plan grants, something which the government and coalition backbenchers have had a lot of rural media about in terms of announcing them. This has been widely advertised, but the minister does not see fit to advise us of what the procedures are in relation to this. These are only a few examples.</para><para>There are a number of questions that went to the heart of accountability. They were in relation to consultants, expenditure on government advertising—something which I know many people on this side of the chamber have pursued avidly, and correctly so—and what the department and the minister term `communication strategies'.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Polling?

Senator Alston has continued to assert, in relation to Telstra and the arrangements that were made with Senator Harradine, that Tasmania has done extremely well. Tasmanian senators such as Senator O'Brien and I know very well that this is not the case. But what has Senator Alston done? He has come into this chamber and in what can only be described as an Orwellian manner said, `Tasmania has done well.' `Why?' we say. `Because I said so,' says Senator Alston.</para><para>The opposition has pursued precisely what the arrangements were in Tasmania through a number of forums—estimates, questions on notice and directly to Telstra through their government liaison officer. Not a cracker! So in absolute desperation, with an impending Telstra debate, I actually wrote to Minister Alston and asked him a number of questions in relation to the staffing situation in Tasmania. The sorts of questions that we asked were not particularly difficult. They were things like, `How many staff are there in Telstra in Tasmania?' and `What are the function/location of the staff in Telstra in Tasmania?' and `How many people are there employed in the call centres?' and `How many 
 of them are casual?' They are the sorts of things that one would think the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, with a department the size of what he has, would be able to respond to very quickly. But we have not had a response.</para><para>We wrote to Senator Alston on 26 March—faxed him a letter asking a number of questions in relation to this—and I regret to say that up till now we have not had a single response from Senator Alston. We have made a number of attempts to get this information. We have the original fax on the 26th, my office has been in continual contact with the minister's office and we finally sent a fax on Friday, 16 April, requesting a response as to whether he was in fact going to answer the questions at all. Why waste everybody's time if this minister has no intention of answering the questions at all? We still have not got a response, so we do not even know whether we are going to get the answers. I certainly hope we get them before the Telstra debate and I certainly hope we get them before Senator Harradine makes his mind up about whether or not he is going to agree to the 16 per cent sell-down.</para><para>What has this minister got to hide in relation to Tasmania? Why can't we get the answers to these questions?

Again, seeing that Senator Crane is here, I would like to put on record our appreciation for his efforts. I hope that Senator Macdonald is going to make a contribution so that we can actually get answers to questions that we have due, although `Don't hold your breath' is not a very good indication of the outcome.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>4162</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Unfortunately, I did not hear all of Senator Mackay's contribution, as it started before I was alerted to the debate coming on. The matter is what you could summarise as the sixty-four thousand dollar question, because during estimates, and I have had some experience in estimates over the years, for six years that we were in opposition we were stonewalled at every opportunity by the likes of Senator Robert Ray, Senator Bolkus and Senator Faulkner—I think they are the only ones that are left here—and we would never get anything from them, Madam Deputy President, as you would well remember. Since we have been in government, we have tried to the best of our ability to answer questions from senators who choose to ask them.</para></talk.start><para> Can I alert the Senate to the following facts: in 1994-95 a little over 300 hours of questions were asked when we were in opposition; in 1995-96 a little under 300 hours of estimates questions were asked of the Senate ministers; in our first year of government, 1996-97, the hours taken by the opposition to ask questions increased to almost 450 hours; and in 1997-98, the last we have any statistics for, almost 700 hours of questioning at estimates. It would be different if these questions were getting anywhere, if they were leading to some policy from the Labor Party, but we have a Labor Party with absolutely no policy at all at the moment. And when asked about it, they said `We are in our contemplative stage.' They are now navel gazing. If the questions were going anywhere, you might understand the over 700 hours of questioning.

Senator Mackay has to explain to the Australian public whether the Australian public will get $64,000 worth out of the quite often ridiculous questions that she asks. As I said, if they were leading to the production of some Labor Party policy then that would be appropriate, but so far we have seen no policy at all from the Labor Party.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Many of the questions asked were hypothetical—things that were going to happen in the future. And, as I continually pointed out, that is the question you should ask at the next estimates committee hearings. Estimates 
 committees were originally about the expenditure of government departments. The Labor Party have chosen—because they are quite incompetent in question time in this House in getting any information—to attempt to bog the departments down with all of this information. I am yet to see in the time we have been in government what has resulted from all of this. It simply puts the department to an expense for information which is rarely used by the opposition. I have to say one thing to Senator Mackay and I say this genuinely: I am disappointed that my department has not made material available as it was prepared. I will ensure that in future as the questions are done in convenient batches they will be distributed.</para><para>The questions from my section of the portfolio—that is, Regional Services, Territories and Local Government—that have been completed have been filed with the Table Office. Mr Anderson, I understand, is not in the building at present but he will no doubt get on to these as soon as he possibly can, but I refer to the sheer volume of questions involved. During the estimates process, I kept saying to the committee that this was going to take a long time; that the department was fully engaged in getting together real work for the Australian people—things like our rural transaction centres initiative, the rural plan initiative and our regional communities program.</para><para>That is what I am asking the department to do—things like making sure that local government got a good deal out of the tax reform package. And they got a fabulous deal. There was $70 million worth of cost reductions for local government. In Queensland alone, there were savings of $18 million for fuel use for local government. As a result of the tax reform package, Queensland councils are going to get an extra $30 million to $35 million from the state government.

It shows the benefits of tax reform in Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Good on the Labor Party, at least at state level, in that you do embrace the GST because you understand what a fabulous package it is. At state level both the Queensland Labor government and the Tasmanian Labor government have embraced tax reform and, as a result, their councils will benefit magnificently. I hope that in the states where there are Liberal governments in power, they will follow along. I also urge Mr Carr in New South Wales to follow the lead of the Tasmanian and Queensland governments, because that is what tax reform is all about.</para><para>I will ensure that, in future, as questions are answered and as they come to us, they will be sent to senators on the estimates committees. As I recall, that is what was done with the ones that I was interested in when we were in opposition. I am a fraction disappointed that that has not happened in this instance, but it will happen in future.

I am as concerned as the Labor Party is about what the government is doing with some of the processes of the parliament. Estimates committees certainly are one of the problems. As well, question time itself has degenerated into high farce—sometimes because of the questions which are asked, I admit. But honestly, you could not say that this government is attempting to answer almost any of the questions asked in question time.</para></talk.start><para>But let us return to the matter that is under consideration this afternoon. I have been on the rural affairs committee for almost six years now so I have quite a long experience of how matters are dealt with in this commit 
 tee. It is usually a very cooperative committee. It has an extremely cooperative chair, Senator Winston Crane, a person who is very generous with his assistance to all of us and who is also very patient in dealing with some of us who at times may try his patience.</para><para>I imagine he is going to come in this afternoon and defend the government because that is his task. But I am quite sure that he will do it very much tongue in cheek, because he knows the problems that we have had in that committee, particularly with this minister, in getting answers. I do not want to cast aspersions on the way Senator Macdonald, who is now a minister, is doing his job in general. But certainly, in terms of estimates, I have a long memory of Senator Macdonald when he was in opposition at times asking many questions which I thought had nothing really to do with estimates. But I found the previous Labor government, particularly in terms of estimates hearings, quite generous in allowing a wide range of questions to be asked.</para><para>I do remember—and I might tell the story one day—an exchange between Senator Collins and Senator Margetts which is quite a funny story, but maybe this is not the time to tell it. Nevertheless, I think that the Labor Party when they were in government were very generous in allowing very wide-ranging questions to be asked.</para><para>I was interested when this minister first appeared in the estimates committee, because he made a speech about wanting to be very cooperative and I thought, `This is interesting coming from this minister.' But I am a generous person myself and I thought, `We'll take it at face value and we'll wait and see just how cooperative he is.' He was certainly very profuse in saying how much he wanted to facilitate the committee, as he has again stated this afternoon, I notice. But rhetoric and performance need to mesh together, because without performance rhetoric does not mean very much.</para><para>I must say that in the particular estimates committees from which most of these questions on notice came it was not long before this cooperative minister began to try to limit—in a way that I had never seen in six 
 years—the range of questions. In the end, unless there was some dollar amount put on the question, he was trying to rule it out of order. In the end it got to be fairly ridiculous but I thought that both the chairman and we committee members were fairly generous with the minister.</para><para>We thought, `Well, he is a new minister. He does not understand and we will let him grow into the job.' So we did agree to put a number of questions on notice. I had some questions that I asked that I think were quite appropriate. They all really did have reference to expenditure, but not every one of them was about a dollar amount. When you are developing a series of questions, there are often lead-up questions which in the end lead to an implication for expenditure. But he tried to rule my questions out of order. So I had to rephrase many of them.</para><para>But the problem was that there would never have been as many questions on notice if the minister had been prepared to answer the questions at the time, instead of going on with very pretentious and pompous pronouncements that he was not going to allow this question and he was not going to allow that question and so on. And the department were willing to answer those questions. He interrupted the answers being given. This is the frustrating thing. This is why I am down here this afternoon—because, really, the hide of this minister! I am almost speechless, and that is saying something for me; I can talk under wet cement.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>—Senator, if you can, you should still address your comments through the chair.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—Sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President.

In its frustration, the committee itself said to the minister and to the department, `Let's have whatever you have done.' But again nothing happened. It really is not good enough for him to come in and say, `Well, really the department is very naughty.' I suspect it is not the department at all. I think I know where a lot of those questions are: they are sitting on a certain minister's desk. And that is the reason we have not got them. He did not admit that; he sort of tried to blame the department saying, `I've got to tell my department they are going to have to smarten up their act.' I think he probably ought to talk to himself in this case, because that is where the problem is.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So you can see that you have here a committee which is incredibly cooperative, a committee that always works together, with a very cooperative chair, but a committee that itself is becoming very frustrated with the processes engaged in by this minister. Not only does he object to questions and tries to make them fit a very narrow preconceived framework that he had dreamt up in his sleep, because it does not exist anywhere in standing orders, but also, having agreed that perhaps we would allow the questions to be put on notice, we then do not get answers.</para><para>The problem is that part of the reason many of the questions were put on notice was so that we could then see whether or not his assertion was valid, from the answers which were given and by going through them and checking. What we need to know now is whether or not his assertion was valid—I do not think it was—because now we have to prepare questions for additional estimates, which begin on 4 May. I do not know what we are going to do. Are we going to have some big fight between the committee and this minister? When we get to additional estimates I think we are going to have exactly the same problem again. I do not know what he wants, but he certainly does not know. So this is the problem we are dealing with this afternoon.</para><para>I reiterate that I have been on this committee for six years. I believe the Labor Party 
 was very generous in what it allowed as questions when it was in government. I remember this minister, when he was in opposition, asking all kinds of questions. I think it is a matter of high cheek for him to try to limit the questions during the committee hearing and then, when in deference to him we try to be cooperative because he was a new minister and he was still learning, we put the questions on notice so that he would have some chance of answering them, he comes in here and blames the department. I think he wants to be the cook, have his cake and eat it too—and probably keep it and produce it next week but then blame everybody else.</para><para>This is what we are faced with this afternoon and this is what has brought me into the chamber to take part in this debate. I have to say that really it can become impossible to operate this place if we do not get cooperation between one another. While we can chuck political bricks across the chamber—and we all do that—in the end, to make the parliament function, really does depend a lot on cooperation. But we have not seen much of that from this minister.

The answer is that, if it is not actually before a jury, it is not necessarily sub judice. We had worded the questions, with a lawyer's advice, very carefully—as one does in those kinds of questions, so you do not go to the questions that are being dealt with in the legal case. The irony is that it was very current that the government was choosing to take legal action. The answer continues:</para><para>The remaining matters go back more than 40 years and are not currently active.</para><para>Interesting, considering he is saying it is sub judice.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—But 40 years ago is too far back to answer.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name></talker><para>—But 40 years ago is too far away for him to answer. The answer continues:</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am sure the Senator would appreciate that to respond would involve a number of officers and many staff hours, including an extensive archival search for files. Given this, I am not prepared to authorise the resources to answer this question. If the Senator has any questions regarding any current or recent past concerns on Christmas Island, then I would be happy to assist the Senator.</para><para>I am interested to know what the statute of limitations therefore will be in relation to this minister. What does actually constitute `recent past'? If the problem is that it is too far past, why is the government even bothering to take legal action to stop justice for these particular Islanders?</para><para>So here we have a situation where people's lives—in the past, but also currently—are being affected by actions by government. They have asked whether I could ask questions to clarify what the government's respon 
 sibility is to them. But the minister is saying, `I am sorry, but this happened so long ago that I can't be bothered answering. However, I am not going to be bothering to answer because there is a current court action associated with the issue.' It is either one or the other. The reality is that he answered none of the questions, because he got out of both of them. As I say, I did not know this debate was going to feature Senator Macdonald, but I thought I would add my little bit too, because I have never seen anything quite like that in relation to a question.</para><para>There is another issue which I have to mention here, and that is the issue in relation to Senate estimates answers. I came in here frustrated about Senate estimates answers when there was the change of government. The opposition may remember that, having been in government for a long time, when they got to be in opposition, we seemed to be one of the few groups concerned that the turnaround time for Senate estimates answers was not being enforced. In fact, we had a debate on appropriations, if I recall, for which we did not have the answers from Senate estimates.</para><para>It may have been that the carry-over anger about how it had felt being a minister in government was still there, but I have a feeling that the opposition needs to perhaps share some of the blame for that. I think the government felt early on that they got away with slack answering in relation to Senate estimates and I think it is because the opposition still remembered what it was like being in government and did not want to be as tight with the government then as people had been with them. Whereas we could normally have expected a turnaround time for Senate estimates answers of about eight to nine days, now there seems to be almost no more particular benefit, in terms of getting answers to our constituents, in asking questions on notice at Senate estimates than there is in asking questions on notice in the normal format.</para><para>That is a pity, because the reality is that we are asking questions in relation to budget documents that we are asked to vote on for appropriations soon after that. So there is and was a good reason for the quick turnaround. 
 I have to say that maybe the opposition have to work out how they might better deal with the issue to put the pressure back on the government and make it more accountable for a quick turnaround. There are very good reasons for requiring a quick turnaround on Senate estimates questions, especially if, as we have had an indication of today, there are some ministers who are requiring the committees to put more and more questions on notice. If that is the case, there should be an understanding that the more questions they put on notice, the more responsibility there is for them to put the resources in to make sure those answers are given.</para><para>I quite clearly recall—and Senator Ray will recall—questions on Defence. We may have had our disagreements in relation to that, but I do recall that Senator Ray made sure, as far as possible, that the answers to questions were available on the day, realising what the consideration might be for not doing that where it was possible to ask on the spot.</para><para>It is a lot more convenient, if there is a person somewhere in the room who can answer the question, for the person who is asking that question to get that direct feedback. If they do not get the answer they were looking for in the first question, they can at least change the question and find out the answer. If it has to go backwards and forwards then, yes, there are going to be costs involved. Sometimes you can get to the answer quite quickly if you have that face-to-face question and answer. And if there are problems in the question, they can be dealt with at the time. If there are still problems later, further questions can be put on notice.</para><para>If the problem is that ministers themselves are deflecting or, as has been indicated today, stopping some public servants from answering questions or requiring senators to put questions on notice which could well be asked and answered at the time, it is hardly fair to suggest the problem is the number of questions on notice. Page 26 of today's <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> says that there are 140 questions still unanswered after 30 days. I cannot say that I know what that means in terms of what it has been in previous years but that does seem to me to be quite a lot of questions outstanding.</para><para>The other matter I want to bring up today is the whole issue of avoiding answers for various reasons. We have heard the sub judice claim, and we have heard various responses—Senator Allison's request in terms of documents springs to mind—today as to why documents are not provided. The reasons are that some are cabinet documents, some are commercial-in-confidence and some of them are sub judice issues. The reality is that we should be asking more and more and the government should be providing more and more information about the basis of those statements.</para><para>Commercial-in-confidence can cover a multitude of sins. When you consider that we are operating under a major policy shift called national competition policy, you will notice that the commercial-in-confidence response covers more and more answers these days. Anything slightly embarrassing for bureaucrats may be covered by commercial-in-confidence. I believe this is quite unnecessary in most cases. We have to start challenging government departments when they say that they cannot release information because it is commercial-in-confidence. In many cases, if you scratch the surface, you will find that the private contractor is being asked, or forced, to sign a document stating that they will not release information. The government is requiring them to sign a document saying that they will not release information.</para><para>We are not protecting the commercial operators at all in some of those instances, what we are doing is protecting the bureaucrats. We are losing that very valuable accountability into the way that taxpayers' money is spent, into the way programs are operated and into the very accountability that we all feel is so valuable in the way the Senate operates.</para><para>I would like to hark back to a statement that Senator Macdonald made in his contribution which was very disturbing to me. He mentioned Senator Mackay and he said that in using time answering parliamentary questions his department was being taken away from its real work. I believe that shows a contempt of the community, because of course the government does not necessarily 
 ask itself questions on behalf of the community; questions usually come from opposition and crossbench senators. That is the reality. It is the Senate, most often, which asks those questions on behalf of the community. That is our job. It is a job of the government to provide the responses. It is not for us; we are the means by which those questions are being asked, but the answers are going to the community, to the electors, to the people of Australia.</para><para>If Senator Macdonald is saying that answering parliamentary questions is taking his department away from real work, he is not showing a contempt for parliament—although, obviously, that appears in the response—he is showing a contempt for the community, for the electorate and for the people we are supposed to be representing. I must admit I have had the same arguments with Senator Ray over time. He would know there have been arguments about whether the time spent answering questions is valid or necessary. If it becomes a case where ministers decide whether the question is valid or invalid, I guess what they are doing is saying that they are the best ones to judge whether the information that we require, and the information required by the community, is valid. That is making a lot of assumptions, and I am sure Senator Ray will respond to that later.</para><para>We in this parliament have to be vigilant that we do not allow the whole situation of the avoidance of questions, sheathed in such things as commercial-in-confidence, to remove governments from accountability. It is their responsibility to explain and change, if necessary, the way they are spending the money provided to them by the taxpayer. If more and more services and roles of government are being forced into private hands—if in fact the parliament is operating more and more on a privatised basis—we have to grow up with that. We have to work out how accountability and privatisation goes hand in hand.</para><para>I am afraid we will get to the very frightening situation which I have heard of in the UK where a minister, when asked a question, is able to say, `I am not able to answer that question because I have given over that 
 responsibility to a private contractor.' We have legislation coming up, which I will be dealing with in the next few days, which deals with that very issue. What happens if we get to the point in this parliament where we ask a minister a question about their portfolio and they say, `I am not responsible for that any more because I have delegated that responsibility to a private contractor'? What if the impact of that is not just about private profit or loss or about the ability to sue a private individual? What if the impact of those decisions could potentially destroy the health of the community or wipe out an animal species in Australia? What if the potential decisions have a widespread impact, way more than any private contractor could pay in a lawsuit? What have we done to our parliament, if that is what we are leading to? As I said, we have to grow up with that.</para><para>There have been a number of decisions about this, and I think we will all be interested in the outcome of the finance and public administration committee inquiry currently taking place. I think I might be referring to an old resource there. Basically, I think we have to be vigilant and we have to note what has happened in court decisions in relation to commercial-in-confidence. We have to understand that, in most cases, the courts have suggested that it should be very narrowly interpreted and that, if commercial-in-confidence is used as a means of not providing information, there must be very good reasons.</para><para>That is what we all have to do with this government. Governments have to grow up—become adult. If governments are saying that the way to go in the future is to use public money to provide goods and services and programs via private companies, then we all have to work out a means by which it is not used as a means of masking responses to legitimate questions. Unfortunately, I think we are going to be speaking a lot more on those issues, but it is certainly not good enough the way it is working out at the moment.</para><para>I, for one, will not be around long enough to see this through, but I would like to throw in as one of my contributions that this is something that the community has to understand more—that there is usually no valid 
 excuse for withholding entire documents. It is possible to protect individuals without losing government accountability, and it should not be left in the hands of bureaucrats to use commercial-in-confidence to stop accountability for their own decision making.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>4171</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me begin by congratulating Senator Mackay, Senator Woodley and Senator Margetts on their very lucid comments here today. They were extremely constructive. I may not agree with every ounce of what they had to say, but I think they have advanced the argument much further.</para></talk.start><para>There is not much amusement in being in opposition. The only downside of being in government is being a minister on chamber duty during general business. That is about the only downside of being in government I can think of. There is not much amusement if you are in opposition, but if you want to amuse yourself you can go back to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record from 1983 to 1996 and reread the comments of those opposite about the provision of information in this chamber—you will get hours of entertainment when you look at what they said then, and you will get equal entertainment when you see the procedural devices they encouraged and put in place in that time but really hate today.</para><para>They put time limits on answers to questions. Why? Because they wanted to get more questions up. But time and time again we see them in question time try to run by their four minutes to get their information over. So what they did in opposition has come back to haunt them in government. Then they put in place the 30-day rule for questions on notice, and now it has come back to haunt them. They put in place the three-month rule for responses to Senate committee reports, and now they do not comply with that rule in most cases. This action was not just limited to these areas. They also changed the whole committee structure. They grabbed about 11 chairperson positions about a year before they came into government, and now they are all crying in their soup that they are not all chairmen, that the opposition and the Democrats chair some of these committees.</para><para>This tells you that, in opposition, they did not have any thoughts for the future—or even any expectations of winning government in the future—otherwise they may not have signed up to these various procedural devices that they now do not want to comply with. Let me go to the first area of non-compliance, and that is returns to order. Most people may not realise that returns to order were an absolute rarity in the first 80 years of this parliament, but in the late 1980s, and certainly into the 1990s, the coalition suddenly discovered that this was the mechanism to seek information. Indeed, in the last parliament of the Keating government, this government when in opposition moved 52 successful returns to order. These days, whenever a return to order is put up, they always oppose it—once again they do not believe in provision of information—and, when they do not like a successfully carried return to order, they simply refuse to supply the information.</para><para>That is in the nature of governments—I understand that—but there are double standards involved following their previous attitude. They have had a road to Damascus conversion simply on the basis that they have a majority of seats in the House of Representatives. All previous principles have been thrown out, and they now adopt the stance that they are in executive government and the parliament simply does not have the right to know.</para><para>Let us look at questions on notice. It is quite interesting that it was this coalition government that forced through the 30-day rule. Of more than 40 identified portfolio areas in the last parliament, only four of them averaged a response to a question on notice in less than 30 days—four out of 40 managed to do that. In other words, 90 per cent of portfolios are not obeying the rule that the Liberal-National Party coalition and other allies at the time put into place in this chamber. One of the problems, I should stress, is that answers come from departments, go to the minister's office and then are not approved—they sit there for week after week without coming across.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>—I remember you doing it yourself.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Senator Newman says she remembers it.

What was good for you in opposition is apparently not good for you in government. So these answers just sit in the minister's office and do not get passed on, and that is the problem.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me give you some examples—and I will only relate my own activities. On 30 November 1998 I asked six ministers about their entertainment expenses being approved by the department. Not one answer to those six questions to ministers has been received. They all happen to be National Party ministers, but not one of them has answered the question.	On 25 November I asked all departments about the costs of their market research. Three still have not answered. On 10 November I asked all ministers about Telstra shareholdings by their personal staff—163 days have elapsed since then, and not one of those questions has been answered. Indeed, because of this lack of answering of questions, Senator Hill saw fit to write to me—it was an undated letter, but I received it on 15 February—promising that every effort was being made to answer these questions as quickly as possible. That was 66 days ago.</para><para>Currently I have 82 questions that have been on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> for more than 30 days still awaiting responses. I do not rush into the chamber after question time and demand of every minister that those questions be answered because I take the attitude that some questions will take longer than 30 days to answer; I understand that. But to have 82 questions outstanding beyond the 30-day rule is just a little beyond the pale.</para><para>To counterbalance that, let me at least positively say that I put a lot of questions on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> on 8 March to DOFA and the Electoral Commission. Let me give credit 
 where credit is due: DOFA has answered the majority of those questions within the 30 days and the Electoral Commission is the same, showing that it is possible to answer these questions. So it is not all departments and it is not all ministers, but of course the now government when in opposition always demanded that the 30-day rule be abided by; they cannot abide by it in government.</para><para>Let me move on to the example of estimates committees and the amount of information that is passed over there. We have the notorious case of one minister, lounging around the table, doing his work and never answering questions. That is Senator Alston—he does not engage, he just does his paperwork and treats the whole process with contempt. We have another example of a minister at the table leaving it to a departmental secretary to answer all the policy questions. Or the technique is used that the appropriate witnesses are not at the table, or they refuse to bring them to the table. We have asked questions about missing documents in the Prime Minister's office. The people who would know about those missing documents are in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, but that department refuses to allow them to sit at the table to answer the questions, and then the witnesses who are at the table say, `We don't know anything about this.' Efforts could be made to in fact provide that particular information.</para><para>Probably the worst example, the most contemptuous example, of the treatment of estimates committee hearings comes from Senator Kemp, who consistently refuses to take valid questions on notice. Someone, early on, gave him the formula: `Senator, I will draw that to the attention of the minister, and if he wishes to respond I will forward the response.' That is not the correct attitude to providing information to this parliament. The correct attitude, taken, I acknowledge, by the majority of the coalition ministers is, `Senator, I will take that question on notice.' But time and time again, Senator Kemp will not do that. He will not properly take questions on notice and will not insist that witnesses give accurate answers. He intervenes to divert and move the subject area away from where 
 questions are answered and, as such, he is definitely the worst estimates minister I have ever seen at the table.</para><para>Some ministers of course do intervene. I have had reason on occasions to note and praise Senator Hill—not always, because I am also critical of some of his estimates performances. But I have seen him sit at the table when witnesses have given insufficient information when they have that information, and he has turned around to them and said, `No. Provide the senators with the full information.' And they do. If ministers behaved in that way, the transparency of government operations would be far better. But one area where Senator Hill will not provide information is to do with the federation grants. Evidence was given that the department assessed all the applications that went to Senator Hill and Senator Alston. They were all marked 15, 12 or 20 out of whatever. A line was drawn and it was said that any grant or any project below 15 should not get a grant. Yet we got evidence that 12 of the projects below the 15 mark got funding but he will not tell us which projects. Were these projects the ones that were scattered through the marginal seats and announced during the last election? I am pretty certain they were. But he refuses to hand on the information to us so that we can make that particular judgment.</para><para>Then, of course, we move to question time, which is the prime area where governments are accountable in the parliament. The general behaviour of ministers in this government in supplying information could only be described as abysmal. No-one could have failed to notice this week that Senator Alston failed to answer questions asked of him. There is a variety of reasons for this: (1) he never reads his brief; (2) he does not understand any of the issues; and (3) he gets a greater psychological thrill out of abuse than he does out of providing information. You can almost ring a bell in here to know when Senator Alston is in trouble—`union official' comes out, and off he goes in a mad dervish. Indeed, it spread to one of his poor, unfortunate colleagues today who had a break-out in that 
 regard. So coalition ministers do not take question time seriously.</para><para>You cannot ask Senator Newman a question if she is representing someone else because she says, `I'm sorry, I'm not the minister in charge; I will have to get an answer for you.' Well, that is not good enough. Senator Minchin is the only one who listens to the question and tries to answer it. I do not say he does it adequately on every occasion, but he actually listens to the question, analyses it and tries to provide you with a response. With Senator Vanstone, if it is a question from our side, half the answers we get are, `I'm sorry, I don't have a brief on that.' I will say that she then goes and gets an answer and brings it back, which is commendable, and she usually does it with a degree of rapidity that we acknowledge. But if she does not have a brief, if it is in the immigration area or anywhere else, we do not get a response.</para><para>It is hard to remember who else is over there at question time, but let me try. We have Senator Herron—who is present in the chamber—who rarely can find his brief, and if he cannot find it he has the honesty to admit it, but then he seems to be able to pull any other one out of the file and just read it for four minutes. It has no relevance to the answer, but all of his colleagues give him the tick for taking up four minutes of question time. That is a good try, we have to say.</para><para>Then we move to Senator Kemp. If we had the same provision in our Constitution as the United States about unfair punishment, he would be guilty of constitutional breach every day of the week—talk about a mumbling, waffling, hopeless performance day in and day out. Then we have Senator Ellison, who does, I think, try to answer the questions. I would have to say that. I would rate him in the top three—although trying to get eye contact with him as he looks at journalists for four minutes nonstop for reinforcement distracts us from our supplementary questions because we get fascinated by it—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Woodley interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Well, that is your job, Senator, not mine. So question time basically is not about the transmission of information. That is not surprising, because it 
 never has been. It has always been a rather adversarial process. But the one thing that should happen is that, if you cannot answer the question, you should get an answer and bring it back. That is what differentiates ministers in this government—some are very good at it and some are very bad at it and do not take it seriously.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me move on to the excuses for not providing information to the chamber. The first one is commercial-in-confidence. In my view, that is a valid reason on the face of it, but it has become much more difficult now. So many elements of government have been contracted out that it is now almost an excuse never to provide anything. In those cases where it is entirely internalised to government, it is amazing how often that 90 per cent or 95 per cent of the information can be delivered with the commercial elements extracted out. One or two departments attempt to do this; the others just use it as a bland and broad excuse not to provide information.</para><para>The second excuse through which we are refused is internal working documents, yet in many cases these would be subject to freedom of information. So it is not a valid excuse for them not to be produced here, especially in a return to order in the Senate—they should be produced.</para><para>The third excuse is legal advice. I would assert that not all legal advice should be tabled in this chamber if it is government property, but it should not be quoted from to back up their case if they are not willing to table it, and that is the position we have—`Oh, Senator, we've had incredibly strong legal advice on this matter.' Well, let us see it. But of course the answer is, `Oh no, we don't table legal advice'—unless at the time they want to make a point. Legal advice is tabled in this chamber by governments from time to time when it wholly and solely backs up their case. So that is not always a valid excuse.</para><para>Cabinet-in-confidence is used. I acknowledge that. I do not know why so many cabinet-in-confidence documents appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> or who puts them there, but clearly they should not be tabled in this chamber. Advice to government basically falls 
 into the same category unless the minister is saying, `Oh, the advice was impeccable.' If they want to rely on the advice, then they should be willing to table it. Finally, there are those areas that impinge on security matters, which I also say from my experience should never be tabled here.</para><para>The other option for us outside the chamber to pursue these matters is freedom of information. I have done that on a number of occasions, especially with the Department of Finance and Administration. But mid-part through last year a change of policy by that department occurred. Instead of providing me with the information and giving me a cost waiver, suddenly the bills rolled in. For one of my applications I had to fork out $9,500. I did not have the `readies'—I admit it. The other one was, I think, $1,000 to $2,000. The excuse that the department gave me—and this is the interesting thing—was, `We won't give you a cost waiver because you have other avenues in which to obtain this information.' That is, if I had asked a question on notice, they would have responded to me and given me all that detail.</para><para>There are cases where I want to know the information but not necessarily to spread it around the country. That is why I went the FOI route; that is why I paid my $30. I may have never published that information. If I seek the information by way of a question on notice it is in the back of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as a privileged document and everyone gets to know about it. In one case I wanted to know what the average hotel expenditure of a minister was—not because I had any intention of exposing that minister but so that we could lay down a reasonable approximation and guidelines for future Labor ministers. I did not want to embarrass that person by asking a question on notice and having it all detailed there.</para><para>In summary, for all the pompous statements about morality and principle by the Liberal and National parties, once they came into government they reverted to type. They have not kept any of those principles. As much as possible, they have tried to deprive this parliament and the Australian people of information that they are entitled to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>4175</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This motion is actually quite a serious one, in spite of Senator Ray's levity—I think he is known for his levity.

It is not necessarily correct. That is her view, and she is entitled to have her view—it is a democracy, it is a free country and she is entitled to have a view if she wants.

As a consequence of his trip back in history, Senator Ray then formed the conclusion that this government was somehow hypocritical, that we had somehow changed the ground rules. If this is correct, then it will stand up for the converse as well.

Who had the beneficial ownership of this group of companies? Paul Keating. So he got a gift of $4.9 million because the Commonwealth Bank said, `We are just going to write off that debt. We are not going to pester you about that anymore.' He got a gift of $4.9 million.

We are accepting an invitation made by Senator Ray in his contribution a couple of minutes ago. Senator Ray accused the government of hypocrisy.

Senator O'Chee has sought permission to table particular documents. Consistent with the standing orders, the opposition has refused permission for him to table those documents.

This matter is incredibly relevant to the disclosure of information by government. This matter is incredibly relevant to the question of requests for information on government programs and administration. I will tell you why this is relevant to requests for information on government administration. Four or five years ago when Mr Keating was the Prime Minister—when Mr Keating oversaw the disclosure of ministerial interests—he misled the parliament. He misled the parliament in direct response to questions about his interests in these companies.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So there you have it. You had a request for information. The question was addressed to the Prime Minister—he was in charge of this particular area of government administration—and the Prime Minister misled the parliament for his own interests. And that is the standard of propriety by which the people on the other side of the chamber should be judged. Of course, Senator Bishop starts to get terribly sensitive about these matters because it is very embarrassing. But it is not correct that Senator Bishop can get up here and assert that, simply because the people on the other side of the chamber have decided to continue the cover-up by refusing to allow the tabling of these documents, somehow I should be precluded from even discussing the matter.</para><para>Here is a group of people who move a debate today to say that this government does not disclose enough information, and yet they not only want to censor the production of information but actually want to censor what people can talk about. They actually want to use a little fiction on the other side to try to stop any discussion of these matters; to try to stop any discussion of what happened to 51 per cent of the $4.9 million written off by the 
 Commonwealth Bank, owed by the former Prime Minister of Australia and owed to the people of Australia, the taxpayers, who own the shares in the Commonwealth Bank. So much for their standards of propriety. So much for their commitment to an open, honest and transparent government process. They love transparency when they think there is something in it for them, but they hate transparency when the truth is yearning to come out. Here they are, sitting on the other side of the chamber, smirking away because they think that they have stopped the truth getting out.</para><para>Let us talk about what this opposition did when they were in government to prevent the disclosure of how the taxpayers' money, through the majority public ownership of the Commonwealth Bank, was used to enhance the financial position of the then Prime Minister. What happened was that the Prime Minister had a group of companies that invested in a piggery but he just did not bother to pay the interest. It is a fact that the annual report of the Commonwealth Bank for the year ending 30 June 1994 will record that in that financial year the total amount written off by the Commonwealth Bank, across all of the agricultural, forestry and fishery sectors put together, was $26½ million. Almost $5 million of those write-offs was directly attributable to companies owned by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating. So across three whole industries—all of agriculture, all of fishery and all of forestry—the Commonwealth Bank wrote off $26½ million, and 20 per cent of that was owed by the then Prime Minister. And they did not even bother suing him. That is the amazing thing. This is how the taxpayers' money was applied when they were in government.</para><para>Every time honourable senators from the coalition parties asked questions about this and every time members of the lower house from the coalition asked questions about this, they were treated to ritualistic abuse. They were called criminals. They were told that they lived in the gutter. They were told they should go back to the gutter. This was how the now opposition responded to very legitimate questions about what happened to 
 millions and millions of taxpayers' dollars. So that is why they do not want this particular document to be tabled. They do not want this particular document to be tabled because this goes to the heart of government administration when they were in government. The only way you can judge whether this motion is reasonable or not is to judge it on the very terms set by the people who moved it when they themselves were in government. That is why this analysis is very important. The document to which I have referred, `Memorandum to Head of Credit Recovery', says:</para><para>Purpose</para><para>The purpose of this memorandum is to formalise the aggregation of BHG and related facilities, itemised in the attached schedule, for DLA purposes.</para><para>What does that mean? It means that there were a whole heap of related companies here where the bank wrote off millions of dollars of debt. They wanted to lump them in together and they needed to write this memorandum because they had to ensure that this memorandum existed for delegated line authority purposes, as is required by the bank. The next paragraph says:</para><para>Aggregation</para><para>The following group facilities (excluding Onoufriades/Scoufis) should now be aggregated for DLA purposes in accordance with Section 5.2.1 Corporate Handbook.</para><para>It then goes through to list the facilities and the rationale for each one:</para><para>Facilities</para><para>1.

</para><para>Here is the interesting thing about what happened to the taxpayers' money. The next heading reads `Delegated Authority'.

There ought to be a copy of this sitting on the table of this chamber if the opposition are fair dinkum about the motion they have moved today. If they are fair dinkum about government programs and government administration, they should be fair dinkum not just for when we are in government but for when they were in government.

It is clear that this government has been about hiding information from the public and trying to frustrate attempts from the opposition to do their jobs. In fact, we had Senator Ian Macdonald complaining about the opposition doing its job and asking too many questions. Obviously he does not like being asked questions, because the problem was that we asked too many questions. That is what he said. Asking questions, getting answers and making the government accountable was all too much for Senator Macdonald.</para><para> Last Monday my office faxed off a note to the offices of the Assistant Treasurer, the 
 Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I was seeking answers to questions placed on notice that were overdue. Senator Herron's office was able to get answers for me very quickly, and I thank his office for their assistance. Senator Kemp's office is attempting to track down answers to 10 outstanding questions. I would appreciate those answers from Senator Kemp's office by Tuesday. But I received a note from Senator Macdonald's office advising that draft answers to eight outstanding questions were in their final stages of preparation. His chief of staff advised that he expected answers to be provided `in this sitting period'. I would like to know from Senator Macdonald what that means exactly. Is it this week, this fortnight or this month? I believe that the answers—being overdue—should be available by next Tuesday, and perhaps there will be other ways of pursuing it.</para><para>But one of the questions, question No. 5, was asked on 10 November last year, which is 162 days ago—I think Senator Ray had 163 days, so I have not hit the record—and I cannot get an answer.

Thirty days is what the then opposition, now government, wanted to be the turnaround time. Like Senator Ray, I am not in the habit of coming into this place on the 31st day and saying, `Where is the answer?' The process that we have followed has been to request, after a reasonable period, an answer. In most cases we do get answers, although the 30-day rule is not met. Where there are rules that have been laid down, perhaps the government should be prepared to play by the rules—or at least attempt to do so. </para></talk.start></continue><para>There were also a large number of questions taken on notice—a number at the invitation of the minister in the chair, Senator Macdonald—during the estimates round, and Senator Mackay has referred to that.

Perhaps we will have to do it more and more often, because the performance of his department is appalling.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Since September last year, I have asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services 72 questions on notice. They have not been general questions about policy but technical questions mainly about the administration of 
 aviation in this country. The reason for the large number of questions on notice is quite simple. There are significant and ongoing problems in the administration of aviation by Mr Anderson as there were with the former minister, Mr Vaile, and, before him, Mr Sharp. This means that there are also significant community concerns about aviation safety in this country. Everyone talks about how safe it is to fly in Australia. We brag about our international reputation. However, the manner in which this government has managed aviation since 1996 is putting that safety record at risk.</para><para>I stress again that the hopeless performance of the government in this important portfolio is also the reason why there are a large number of questions flowing from the estimates hearings. That is also why a number of Senate inquiries into aviation are about to commence. If this portfolio were being managed properly and aviation reforms were being implemented effectively, with not only the support of the industry but also the support of the broader community, there would be little for us on this side of the chamber to ask and little for the minister to answer.</para><para>I might add that not only are the Labor Party and the Democrats putting pressure on the government in relation to aviation; the government is putting pressure on itself. There have been three or four inquiries into aviation since the last election, only a few months or so ago. A matter relating to the administration of aviation safety was even referred to the Federal Police by the former chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Dick Smith. The best way to remove the administrative burden currently on the minister, his department and agency as a result of the large number of questions is not to attack us. The solution is not simply to refuse to answer questions legitimately asked. The real solution is for the minister to properly administer his portfolio. </para><para>We want answers to questions asked both on notice and through the estimates committee. If the confusion and maladministration of aviation continues, there is no doubt that we will continue to pursue the minister and the 
 government. After all, that is the responsibility of an opposition.</para><para>However, incompetence is not the only reason for the transport portfolio being placed under pressure. If we look back on the fiasco that was the Mr Reith and Mr Sharp waterfront plan, we find a government and a senior officer of the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business not refusing to answer questions but giving false answers. In August 1997, in response to a question on notice about consultancies, the government advised me that a consultancy had been let to ACIL Economics to prepare a waterfront reform plan. The role of the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business in the development of the plan was pursued by my colleagues Senator Collins and Senator Mackay at the next estimates hearings. Those hearings were in August that year.</para><para>The senior officer responsible for waterfront reform in that department claimed to have no knowledge of the consultancy or the plan. Either on his own initiative or under pressure from above, he misled the committee. Effectively, he lied to the Senate. Again, in February 1998, he did exactly the same thing. Again, he misled the committee and lied to the Senate.</para><para>But it is difficult to maintain the deception in this case. The evidence, much of it from Mr Gillespie's own colleagues, continues to build against his evidence. In a letter from the Secretary to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Dr Peter Shergold, to the chair of the Economics Committee in June 1998, Mr Gillespie fessed up. He said that he had made `inadvertent errors' in his evidence. That evidence was given in several estimates hearings over several hours. I refer to Dr Shergold's letter so that the Australian public will know what sort of obfuscation we have had to put up with in this area.</para><para>Bear in mind that this is an area where the government had a fair bit to lose. It had become involved in a protracted industrial dispute clearly generated by its own policies, orchestrated by its ministers through the departments and with the funding of the 
 Commonwealth. Consultancies were funded by this government. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were paid to consultants to engineer the sacking of Australian waterfront workers. There was a desperation to conceal this sort of performance by this government. So it is not surprising, I suppose, that there were inadvertent errors in Mr Gillespie's evidence to conceal what was clearly a conspiracy by this government to illegally sack hundreds and hundreds of Australian workers.</para><para>Dr Shergold was in the practice of writing letters. He did this twice. We always got the letter either during the weekend before a Monday meeting of the estimates or in the morning of the estimates or thereabouts. If there were a matter to be proceeded with, the opposition would be inconvenienced by the supply of this information just before the estimates commenced or after it had commenced. That is another procedure that the government relies upon. While I am on the issue of the waterfront, everyone will recall that the government, when asked about consultancies relating to the waterfront dispute, hid behind the so-called sub judice rule; that is, because the matters were before the court, they could not be answered.</para><para>What was the view of the Clerk of the Senate on that matter? A letter was tabled before the committee in relation to that matter. The Clerk of the Senate had quite a different view from the government. I am not going to quote it because I do not have the letter before me. However, it is on the public record. I will read Dr Shergold's letter, which is dated 2 June 1998, into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>:</para><para>I refer to my letter to you—</para><para>it is addressed to Senator Ferguson, the chair of the committee—</para><para>of 3 April 1998. In that letter, I set out the Department's position in relation to matters raised by Senator O'Brien concerning evidence given by Mr Derren Gillespie, an officer of the Department, to the Economics Legislation Committee in August 1997.</para><para>I wish to provide the Committee with further information which has come to light after a recent review of documents, including certain material originally prepared by officers of the Department of Transport and Regional Development. Mr Gillespie has had the opportunity to consider that 
 material to which he did not previously have access and has asked me to draw the Committee's attention to certain inadvertent errors in his evidence.</para><para>In respect of the ACIL 2 consultancy, Mr Gillespie informed the Committee on 18 August 1997 . . . that he did "not have any insights into any of the work that ACIL may have done under that contract". That answer was in response to a particular question by Senator Jacinta Collins, namely, "(t)o your knowledge does the ACIL plan fit with the terms of the Workplace Relations Act or does it contemplate action outside the legislative framework?"</para><para>A review of events immediately after the signing of the contract between ACIL and the Department of Transport and Regional Development (the ACIL 2 contract) on 20 June 1997 indicates that Mr Gillespie's response, when considered in a wider context, was not correct.</para><para>What those listening should understand is that Mr Gillespie was at that time part of a task force into waterfront reform within the department and had access to information about the ACIL plan, so he knew what the answer to the question was. The answer that he gave was, I think, designed without any doubt to hide from the committee knowledge that he had. In other words, he was not being truthful. It goes on:</para><para>On three occasions (24 June 1997, 8 July 1997 and 15 July 1997) Mr Gillespie attended meetings at which an ACIL consultant, undertaking work under the ACIL 2 contract, was also present. Each meeting took place at the early stages of the ACIL 2 consultancy.</para><para>The meeting on 24 June 1997 concerned a waterfront issue on which the Department had worked before the ACIL 2 contract took effect. An ACIL consultant attended the meeting. The Department did not arrange the consultant's attendance. The Department continued to work on the matter without further interaction with ACIL.</para><para>The meeting of 8 July 1997 involved a preliminary discussion of how the ACIL consultancy might be undertaken. Officials present were Mr Gillespie and Mr Manthorpe from the Department of Industrial Relations and officers from the Department of Transport and Regional Development.</para><para>At the meeting of 15 July 1998 port operations were discussed with representatives of a port authority. Both Mr Gillespie and an ACIL consultant were present.</para><para>This is the sort of performance that we have had to deal with. The government and particularly Senator Macdonald have complained 
 about the volume of questions asked. But when you have to be careful to ask precisely the right question and listen to the answer from some officials, is it any wonder that the opposition has to be meticulous in asking as many questions as possible to elicit the truth?</para><para>Here we have circumstances where clearly a deception was practised on the committee, admitted by the Secretary to the department subsequently. I do not accept the term used: `inadvertent errors'. The committee was misled and in relation to that matter it took a great deal of public time to go over the issues and so, if there was cost to the public, it was occasioned by the deception from the department, no doubt with the knowledge of the minister. When I say the minister I do not mean the minister who was sitting at the table, because it was Senator Alston and Senator Alston never takes any interest in estimates—when he does manage to stay at the table and not depart to make telephone calls or whatever else he is doing when he is out of the room. He seems to be busy handling his documents. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>4183</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Mackay and Senator O'Brien have told the parliament today that they believe the government has been tardy in supplying information on government programs and various aspects of administration in response to opposition requests. Senator Mackay specifically mentioned the tabling of material on government programs and administration. Senator Robert Ray has contributed a quite condescending `term report' on government ministers in the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>But Senator Ray has a short memory when it comes to the ministerial performance of some of his colleagues when they were in government. Just taking a short stroll down memory lane through the estimates <inline font-style="italic">Hansards</inline> during the time of the previous government you can see it all there on the record, Mr Acting Deputy President: `We will take that on notice,' `We will take it on notice,' `We will have to take that on notice,' `I will take that part on notice,' `I would have to take that on notice,' `Can I take that on notice?' I am not going to name the minister responsible. I am not going to engage in the politics of 
 division and derision that has been the characteristic of those in opposition over the last week or two. I will simply say that people in glass houses should not be throwing pebbles across this side of the chamber.</para><para>We agree that open government is absolutely essential in a democracy and that any government has an onerous responsibility, acting within the appropriate safeguards, to comply with opposition requests for material to be tabled. This government has nothing to hide in relation to public information. I think that was very clearly borne out when the opposition and the Democrats engaged in a quite outrageous witch-hunt in this place, in a fruitless search to find the updated model of the Ros Kelly memorial whiteboard, connected with the Natural Heritage Trust grants. Despite hours of digging in question time and stacks of material tabled in this chamber day after day, the opposition failed to uncover a single thing except some quite disgraceful allegations about a government colleague—who happens to be in this chamber—Senator Winston Crane, regarding his farm family operations in Western Australia, and a very eminent Australian family and particularly one member of that Baillieu family who had died decades before.</para><para>So if we are talking about a balance sheet of who, on the one hand, has made material available and tabled documents where they can and who, on the other, has attempted to hide, to duck, to weave, under stones and whiteboards and any other place they can hide for months on end, and has had to have material wrenched out of them as was done with the whiteboard material on the sports rorts, we would have to be talking about this opposition when they were in government.</para><para>However, just yesterday the opposition was given four opportunities in this chamber—and there was another this afternoon by Senator O'Chee—to prove that it not only believes what it says in this motion today but that in government it did what it now claims we are not doing: recognise the need for information on government administration and make government more accountable and more open through the tabling of documents and material related to government decisions and adminis 
 tration. Those are the very words that you used in your motion today, Senator Mackay.</para><para>The documents I am referring to could not have been more clearly linked to the administration of government policy at the time. I am talking here about the probity of a government-controlled institution with a government-appointed board of directors who were then wholly responsible through the Prime Minister of this country to the people of Australia. Of course, we are talking about the people's bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which in 1994 gave a special deal to one special farmer customer in this country, former Prime Minister, P. J. Keating, which enabled him and his companies to enjoy a benefit worth $20 million not available to any other farming family in this nation.</para><para>By far the most important document that I sought to table in this chamber just last night is from the Commonwealth Bank itself. It shows that in May 1994 the bank did indeed write off $4.9 million of the Keating piggery debt. Until yesterday all that had been known about this matter was that in 1992 the Commonwealth Bank had provisioned for a $4.5 million loss. The document, which goes to the heart of Senator Mackay's motion about probity and openness, is a document about the operation of a government-controlled institution which in 1994 wrote off not $4.5 million of piggery debt, as they had expected to in 1992, but $5 million of Keating piggery debt. The Senate must now agree that this document be tabled. I seek leave to table the document now.</para><para>Leave not granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name></talker><para>—Once again, the opposition, for reasons best known to themselves, are refusing to have tabled documents which show the truth of this matter.

This is the fourth time leave has been sought to table these docu 
 ments which go to the heart of the truth of this matter. This document is from the Keating family's own accountants, KPMG, and shows that in February 1995 Mr Keating's piggery was technically bankrupt. In paragraph (vii) the document declares that the Euphron group of companies could continue to trade only with the support of the group's shareholders and bankers. Could there be another document right now in this country that more importantly goes to the essence of Senator Mackay's motion on probity and openness in government?</para></talk.start></continue><para>We now know that the Commonwealth Bank came to the rescue of this high profile farming Prime Minister. The bank knows that this was a pork-barrelling exercise that would do a pig farmer proud. Pig farmers in this country, whom Senator O'Brien has referred to time and time again in this place as having gone through a quite tragic set of circumstances as a result of some difficulties in the pork market, would surely be wishing that they could have got their trotters in that pork barrel. But there was no room, because there were some very high profile trotters right up to the top in that pork barrel.</para><para>The Commonwealth Bank silently wrote off $5 million worth of debt at the same time as the sale to Indonesian interests was taking place. In doing so, it allowed the multimillion purchase price to flow to farmer Keating without any claim by the bank—no claim at all. To put this into perspective, that year the Commonwealth Bank wrote off $26 million across the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries—mostly after the borrowers, those farm families, had been bankrupted, thrown right off their properties, evicted, sold up. So Mr Keating's write-off accounted for almost one-fifth of the total debt written off that year, despite the fact that millions and millions of dollars were on their way from Indonesia. That is the operation of open administration and information on government programs, Senator Mackay, resulting from the probity of the previous government.</para><para>What an extraordinary double standard has been revealed in this debate today. On the one hand, the opposition call for openness in administration which opens the government 
 up to scrutiny by the opposition, and on the other hand they continually deny us leave—as has been denied to me again in this speech for the second time in 24 hours and as was the same for Senator O'Chee—to table documents that would shed new light on the way the opposition conducted their business when in government. This is a disgraceful double standard which the opposition can now deal with by allowing these documents to be tabled so that the people of Australia can know the whole truth about the gold-plated Keating deal made with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia—the people's bank.</para><para>Senator Mackay, if you come into this chamber and move a motion about the openness of government and the need to be free and frank in tabling documents, let us have a look at these documents. Let us allow these documents to be tabled so that we can all have a look at what sort of a deal pig farmer Keating was able to extract from a bank which proudly called itself the people's bank and which has operated in this nation since 1916. I would be very surprised if there was one other person—farmer, businessman, small business man, corporate businessman—who was able to extract from the people's bank a gold-plated deal worth $20 million that went to one very high profile member of this nation. Now the opposition, for reasons best known to themselves, are continually denying the opportunity for us to table these documents so that we can all get to the truth of the matter, so that we can know once and for all the detailed special deal that the Keating family company got from this bank. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>4185</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, pursuant to standing order 191 I indicate that I have been misrepresented and I wish to make a short contribution.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Watson)</name></talker><para>—Was it in relation to your speech?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—It was in relation to Senator Ian Macdonald's speech.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Proceed. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—Senator Macdonald, in what I thought was a very disorderly fashion, asked me while he was giving his speech whether the Tasmanian state government had entered into an agreement with Tasmanian local government, and I gave my assent.

I suppose I should declare somewhat of an interest, having spent five or six years working as an infant welfare registered nurse and having had some experience of what happened 20 years ago. There is no doubt, with regard to the feeding of infants, that breastfeeding is the best way and that breast-milk substitutes, whilst effective, certainly do not offer the child the full benefits that breast milk does. There are, however, many women who are unable to breastfeed or who need to supplement the breastfeeds with formula. But that should be done very cautiously and with, on occasions, medical coverage and medical supervision. The report is important because it actually outlines in the foreword an increasingly used market strategy. It says:</para></talk.start><para>An increasingly used market strategy that the Panel has identified in the last 12 months is the promotion of specialised infant formulas such as `lactose free' or anti-reflux'. The Panel is concerned that the promotions for such products may involve unsubstantiated therapeutic claims aimed at conditions which may not require treatment with such a product. The Panel has written to the Minister responsible for Consumer Affairs and the Minister for Health and Aged Care to outline its concerns.</para><para>I will certainly be following up in estimates with those ministers and departments what precisely they have done and if there has been any action that they have undertaken.</para><para>When I look at the outlines given in the report as to how this is taking place, they are talking about formulas being available that will stop reflux. As a former clinic sister, I would be very loath to allow self-diagnosis and self-decision about treatment of this particular condition. It is one where there is often no major treatment required, as the child will grow out of it. If treatment is required, then I am firmly of the opinion that this should be done at least under medical supervision and preferably under a paediatrician's supervision.</para><para>There is also one talking about lactose free. Again, the diagnosis of lactose intolerance is something that should be undertaken only under medical supervision, and the treatment of that with a lactose free substitute should also be undertaken only under medical supervision. It is highly remiss of these companies and outlets to be advertising these products in such a way. Whilst we can stop them from doing that here in Australia, I am concerned that when they go overseas to developing countries they might well be undertaking these sorts of marketing programs, much to the detriment—and potential hazards therefore—of the children and babies in those developing countries.</para><para>We know that they have high mortality rates and that there are problems in some areas with access to sterile or clean water, which of course is essential when making up infant formula. It is something that needs to be watched closely and cautiously. As I said, I will be following up with ministers at estimates to see what they have done about this strategy that appears to be being adopted. 
 It is certainly one of grave concern to those in the profession. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>4187</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following order of the day relating to government documents was considered:</para><para>Australia-India Council—Report for 1997-98.

This item is extraordinary because I believe it is part of the game play going on outside of this chamber to foster legislation, such as the sale of 
 Telstra and GST legislation, through the Senate courtesy of Senators Harradine and/or Colston.</para><para>The Senate has heard my view on the accelerated treatment being given to the establishment of the Committee on Information Technologies which is looking at how to prevent pornography on the Internet, pornography in cyberspace. I have no worry about that happening, but I am acutely aware of the fact that, after six months of nothing happening, the committee was suddenly established a week or two ago and that the whole process is now being truncated to give a result to the wish of Senator Alston and the government to hastily bring in regulations censoring the Internet by 11 May—budget day.</para><para>What an extraordinary situation. For six months nothing happens and then everything has to happen within a couple of weeks. We have the establishment of the committee and the hearings. We see from motions now on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, and foreshadowed, the dealing with the legislation itself by this committee. Here we have a motion to ensure that whatever happens, if the Senate does move to have a sitting next Tuesday night, that cannot get in the way of this either, that the committee's hearings will proceed to give a result by budget day. We are going to get, on the day of the budget, the delivery to Senator Harradine of his wish that there be censorship of the Internet.</para><para>All of us are concerned about material on the Internet. I have a particular concern about violence. I note that the Eros Foundation, and one can take or leave their figures, did a public survey which found that the majority of Australians are more concerned about violence than sexually explicit material in cyberspace. In fact, the figures, as I understand them, are that 50 per cent of Australians would first ban violent films; 32 per cent would first ban racist material; and 12 per cent would first ban sexually explicit material. I think that is probably a fair reflection of what the public thinks. But it is not a reflection, I submit, of what Senator Harradine thinks or Senator Alston thinks.</para><para>We also know, no matter what this committee comes up with, that the ability to censor 
 explicit material on the Internet deriving from Australia is not going to knock out the ability to censor material coming from overseas, and that is where 90 per cent or so of it is coming from. It is going to be an ineffective instrument. If there are legitimate reasons for such a move, then this committee should be looking at them—but not now.</para><para>This is purely political pay-off. This is about what the Independents are getting for considering the sale of more of Telstra and/or the passage of the GST. This Senate is being asked to be party to that process without being informed. If we are going to be part of the process of paying off Senator Harradine, then let the government tell us what the process at hand is. Let the government say, `Yes, this is the negotiating process as we see it.' Explicit or inherent, let the government say, `This is what is going on here. We are concerned about the GST. We feel that it would cushion the process of the GST through this chamber if we were able to offer other things to the Independents.'</para><para> Whether one of them is this legislation and this committee's establishment, let it not be inherent, let it not be inferred—let the government be direct about it, let the Independents be direct about it. On the face of it, we are in the process of establishing a committee to rush through a wish by the Independents, who will be less powerful after 1 July, to effect what Australians can see or cannot see on the Internet. I stress again: it is valid that this chamber look at such things. What is not valid is that the agenda of this chamber be altered to give effect to a negotiating process outside this chamber which has nothing to do with this legislation but which has to do with the government's wish to get through the GST and/or the sale of Telstra.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that the government has circulated a list of what it calls `high priority' bills to be dealt with by this chamber prior to 30 June—the great date when the new senators come in here and the Democrats take the balance of power, which, as far as the government is concerned, is currently held by the Independents. It is an extraordinary list. There are little  asterisks next to the list of high priority bills 
 and the list under it of bills that will be dealt with, `time permitting', by 30 June. The government lists 27 pieces of legislation it would like to see through by 30 June. At the bottom of the page, it says:</para><para>This list does not indicate the order of priority.</para><para>But I can tell you it is very close to what the government's priorities are. When you look at this list of 27 bills, the ANTS package of bills come first, the sale of Telstra comes second, and then third is the <inline ref="s213">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999</inline> —so the anti-porn legislation is No. 3 on this list. What is below it? What has been shuffled out of the way to make way for this priority legislation for Senator Harradine, if that is the case? And the government can tell us whether or not it is the case. There is the Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill—potentially for people coming from Albania. There are the appropriation bills, the Wool International Privatisation Bill and the Export Market Development Grants Legislation Amendment Bill. There is legislation to do with radically altering—in my submission, for the worst—the environment laws of this country. There is the Further 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security) Bill. There is legislation on telecommunications and superannuation—so that people will have a choice of superannuation funds, a choice that is currently not available. There is new workplace relations legislation: that comes in way down at about No. 10.</para><para>There is other legislation on taxes, quarantine, the destruction of forests, corporate law, customs and Aboriginal issues as well as on textiles, clothing and footwear matters and higher education. They have all been moved down the list so that a hastily concocted committee can deal with pornography on the Internet, although the government did not move in the first six months of this term of office to do anything about it at all.</para><para>It is patently obvious what is going on here. I do not want to be party to it. I believe the Senate should order its priorities according to what is important and not according to what is going on in negotiations either in the Prime Minister's suite or in the suites of the Inde 
 pendents. I do not think that we should be a party to having our priorities set without the government being explicit itself about what is happening in those negotiations. It is a matter of extraordinary importance to the public. I would agree with Senator Harradine that pornography or violence or racism on the Internet are important issues we should be dealing with, but I can tell you this: there are many Australians who are more concerned about the effect of the tax package on their lives and about the sale of Telstra and what that might do to people in regional areas or to low income earners who are not in the CBD—there are a whole host of other issues, as I have just listed.</para><para>I know the government might get up and attack on this and say that it is not so, but give us an explanation, please, as to why a sudden priority has been set now—at this time when the government is engaged in massive negotiations with the Independents, who very often cannot be in here because they are so busy. I respect that—people often are not in here because they are busy. But it has been obvious to me, watching events here in the last week or two, that the Independents are distracted by their heavy burden. Senator Harradine will not cavil at this, as he sees it is on his shoulders to make sure he gets right whatever arrangement he and the government come up with on the GST and the tax package. So it is a very disturbing situation. It is a case of trying to find out what is being traded here but, above all, in my books it is a case of the Senate not having its program changed and important matters being dropped down the list to make way for a negotiating process which might suit the Indpendents but which is not giving priority to the real needs of this nation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>4189</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was not intending to speak on this matter that Senator Brown has referred to, but I believe this morning he would not give leave for this particular committee, the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies, to sit on Tuesday night.

However, witnesses have been called and they do have to make travel arrangements. It is my understanding that the Australian Broadcasting Authority, which is based in Sydney, has to make the necessary travel arrangements. It is a public holiday in Sydney on Monday—unlike Melbourne of course, where there is no public holiday thanks to Mr Jeff Kennett's retrogressive attitudes and the appalling approach he has taken to the question of Anzac Day—and of course we have a public holiday here in Canberra on Monday.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think it is reasonable to give witnesses before this inquiry an opportunity to make travel arrangements with some certainty as to their likelihood of appearing before the committee.

We will do all that we can to explore that relationship, should it be demonstrated that the government has in fact entered into arrangements to secure the support of senators for the GST or for the privatisation of Telstra. As to the sitting hours question itself, we do not believe that is a reason in itself to reject the proposition that there be authorisation given for this committee to meet.</para><para>The government has an opportunity tomorrow morning to express why it believes it needs the extra sitting hours. We will take our chances on that basis. I trust that there will be a majority of senators who will not agree with the government. We have made propositions to the government with regard to a compromise on that matter, and to this point they 
 have been rejected. We think that the issue of the inquiry itself does warrant close examination. It may well be that the minister's attempt to secure the various means of introducing new forms of censorship will be demonstrated to be totally inadequate, totally inept and totally impracticable. It may in fact lead to considerable damage to this country. These are all matters that may well be demonstrated through the committee process. I trust that the committee will examine these issues in some detail.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>A New Tax System Committee </title><page.no>4191</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Addenda and Corrigenda</title><page.no>4191</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>4191</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—With some trepidation, I seek leave to table a document on behalf of Senator Cook.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'CHEE</name><name role="display">Senator O'Chee</name></talker><para>—About what?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name></talker><para>—I wish to present the addenda and corrigenda to the report of the Select Committee on a New Tax System and I want to move that the document be printed.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>4191</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—Although this side of the chamber has not been provided with a copy of the documents and the usual courtesies have not been—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>—Yes, they were.

This was the final step in the process of consideration by a number of Senate committees of the original batch of taxation bills put forward by the government. Since that time we have had another batch added into the mix, which is also being considered by this committee which, I think, is due to report at the end of next week.</para></talk.start><para>It is, of course, an important document. There has been some attempt to disparage the work of the committee and the members of it—from whatever side—by other MPs and people in the general community saying that the report produces nothing that was not already predicted at the start of the whole process because everyone's minds were made up. Certainly from the Democrats' perspective, our minds were not made up on a number of issues. More importantly than that, the report, which consists of many hundreds of pages, details a wide range of information that was provided by the community—by people from all walks of life with all different areas of expertise—on a whole range of areas that were affected by the taxation package.</para><para>I certainly believe—and I am sure that all my Democrat colleagues would similarly agree—that it is absolutely crucial that the public have the opportunity to have input into consideration of any legislation that is contentious, and particularly legislation as comprehensive and wide ranging as the taxation package. I do not believe, and the Democrats do not believe, that all wisdom on any matter—let alone taxation matters—resides with members of parliament, parliamentary advisers or bureaucrats. I certainly always place great value on the information that is provided by people from the community.</para><para>As a member of one of the other committees—the Community Affairs Committee—that examined some aspects of the taxation 
 package, I can certainly say that I found it of great personal value. I learnt an enormous amount about the potential consequences of the taxation package from a wide range of people in the community who presented evidence through written submissions and public hearings, as well as from individual meetings and correspondence I have had directly with people.</para><para>I would like to indicate my own belief and the Democrats' belief in the importance of both the committee process and this process for bringing to light a lot of information that was not available. Part of the reason it was not available was the government's lack of action in considering the potential ramifications in a whole range of areas. A lot of that is contained within this report. A lot of information had to be got from the community because the government did not provide it. The government did not know. The government had not figured it out and had not done the modelling.</para><para>As members of parliament we obviously have a responsibility and a duty to ensure that we are as fully informed as possible about the implications and ramifications of any legislation, let alone legislation as comprehensive as this, before we decide what is the appropriate way for us to vote. If the work is not done by the government—as it clearly was not done in relation to this taxation package—then it makes it doubly crucial that we have a process that does enable that work to be done, particularly when we can do it in a way that enables us to dip into the enormous amount of expertise out in the general Australian community.</para><para>In relation to the content of the report, the Democrats' position on some aspects of it is widely known. It has received some attention in recent days, particularly in relation to the Democrats' position on the issue of food. For some reason, some people have seen the Democrats' position on the issue of food and our statements in the last few days about some of the favourable aspects of the so-called Irish model of exempting basic foods from a GST as being some sort of retreat or backflip. Those people who have been following the Democrats' statements on the issue of 
 the exemption of food since before the election would know that we have stated as a bottom line principle that the GST should not apply to food. That is for a wide range of reasons, all of which are contained in this report, but most importantly because of the issue of fairness so that it does not discriminate against low and middle income earners.</para><para>How that issue of food was defined was something that we had not nailed down a specific position on. Indeed we have not yet nailed down a specific position on that. We have stated some arguments in favour of specific models, but we are quite willing to negotiate and discuss further with other members of the Senate which model of food is appropriate. If the government wanted to accept a food exemption which applied universally, then that would be fine by the Democrats.</para><para>A range of approaches have been taken by many other countries around the world in relation to food. That in itself highlights that what the government has said about how many problems are involved in treating food in a preferential way is just hot air. Most other countries in the world can manage it. For some reason this government does not seem to have the intellectual capacity to be able to cope with the concept, but the Democrats certainly do.</para><para>Beyond that I would like to reiterate a number of the Democrats' other positions in relation to the tax package. Again, because of the focus that has been put on food, there has been less attention paid to many of the other problems with the tax package as it stands at the moment. That is why this report is so valuable and why it needs to be so comprehensive. There are many aspects of the package that, as it stands, do present problems. That is why the Democrats indicated in this report our recommendation that the package not be passed by the parliament unless it is substantially altered. Substantially altered does not just mean dealing with the issue of food; it means dealing with a wide range of other issues that need to be addressed to improve its fairness, to remove its regressiveness, to reduce the negative effects on the environment and to reduce the negative effects on 
 employment. The Democrats believe that all of those issues need to be addressed.</para><para>As a parliament we have a responsibility to consider legislation that is put up by the government. The parliament is elected by the people to do that job. That is why the Democrats have taken this legislation seriously and why we have insisted that it be examined in detail. This report is part of that process. Having done that, we have identified a significant number of issues that need to be addressed before it will be appropriate for this parliament to pass that legislation.</para><para>The government is formed by the electoral process to put forward legislation, as is its right, its responsibility and its duty. The parliament, which is directly elected by the people, has the responsibility to consider any legislation put forward by the government, and to rubber stamp legislation put forward by the government, regardless of what it contains, would to all intents and purposes remove the purpose of the parliament and completely remove the fundamental underpinning of the separation of powers that operates within our democratic system. So not only is it appropriate for the parliament to consider legislation such as this in detail and to decide for itself what should or should not be passed but it is indeed a very important duty for the parliament to do so.</para><para>Some of the issues other than food that the Democrats believe do need to be addressed are highlighted in this report, which also contains the Democrats' recommendations from the Community Affairs References Committee that I was on, the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee chaired by my colleague Senator Allison, and the Employment, Education and Training References Committee on which Senator Stott Despoja is the Democrats' representative. There are a number of other issues that the Democrats believe are absolutely crucial and that need to be addressed, such as protecting jobs by zero rating inbound tourism, zero rating books as an item essential to education, restructuring the inadequate First Home Buyers Scheme to make it more fair, providing more assistance for small retailers, ensuring and guaranteeing 
 funding for local government, improving income tax cuts so they are fair and a wide range of other issues. I hope the parliament gets the opportunity to address those issues properly over the coming weeks and months.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carr</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title><page.no>4194</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>4194</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 31 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Chee</inline>:</para><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>4194</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This report deals with the <inline ref="s156">Genetic Privacy and Non-discrimination Bill 1998</inline> .

Genetic privacy is a very important issue. The whole issue of genetic engineering and the privacy aspects of it are of great concern to the community, and ensuring non-discrimination in relation to those issues is something that the Democrats believe we are lagging behind on. We do need to encourage much more prompt action and much more community debate on the issue and, where appropriate, government regulation on it. This report deals with the genetic privacy bill that was put forward by Senator Stott Despoja.

The first is that I believe most decent people would support the concept that cloning of human embryos should be banned—that is, quite simply, for fundamental moral reasons. The first of those moral reasons goes to the sanctity of human life, because to clone a human embryo you actually have to destroy another embryo or destroy the genetic contents of the embryo, and therefore there are many people who believe that cloning is in fact a type of killing.</para></talk.start><para>But there is another philosophical reason why cloning of humans poses real problems, and that is, because everybody is genetically unique, people have a concept of self. The concept of self is tied up with the uniqueness of a person. If you allow cloning, you destroy the uniqueness of each human individual and therefore you challenge the very concept of self. Self is tied up with exclusive identity. It poses fundamental philosophical problems if you do that. It flows from that that if you want to use human embryos to grow spare parts there are even more fundamental moral and ethical dilemmas.</para><para>I think this is symptomatic of technology which is going too fast for our society to deal with it in ethical terms. We really should take time to pause and ask ourselves why we need some of this technology and whether we should accept the arguments of those who say, `The cloning of humans is inevitable and therefore we may as well do it now.' I do not believe that cloning of humans is inevitable. Just because it is possible does not mean that we should do it. It is possible to detonate a nuclear bomb over a city, but just because it is possible does not mean that it is a good thing to do. I believe that one of the fundamental requirements of government is to make judgments about what is good and what is bad, and I do not see much that is good from cloning human embryos.</para><para>It also creates massive problems—which, of course, were raised in the consideration of the committee—about identifying particular genetic types and then using them for a purpose or limiting their potential. One thing I do know about human beings is that, irrespective of what genetic inheritance a person may have, the fundamental limitation on that person is often their will, and you cannot identify will genetically. Will is something which cannot be tied to a particular gene and cannot be tied to a particular piece of DNA. Will is not inheritable. For those who are religious, will is something which is God-given. The reason I say that is that, if we were to go and identify foetuses and say that this foetus is potentially impaired or that this foetus has a potential problem and we decide to terminate those foetuses, we terminate without any appeal the potential that that unborn child has to a life, and maybe a very important life. It is folly for us to believe that, just because we are busy mapping human DNA, we can tell the future. We cannot tell the future. But the argument that science gives us all the answers, which is inherent in the belief that we should use these technologies to decide which foetuses should be born and which foetuses should not be born, is arrogant. For those reasons, I think we should all consider this matter very seriously.</para><para>It flows from that that there is another thing that we must examine, which is the whole idea of letting technology run rampant. I believe it is our moral responsibility to form at least a moral framework in which we can examine the application of technology. Too frequently we hear people who create technology saying, `This is good,' because it does something better, faster or more efficiently. But nobody would suggest that the atom bomb is morally good because it kills people faster or more efficiently. I think there is a real difference between the efficiency of a particular type of technology and its moral worth, and the moral worth comes from the application.</para><para>For those reasons I believe that it is well worth the time of the Senate to examine this report and also well worth the time of all senators to consider the issues about the 
 interface between ethics and the broader spectrum of technology. If we do not do that, we face the very real prospect that we will unleash on our society technological changes which may not in fact make our lives better; they may make them substantially worse. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee </title><page.no>4196</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>4196</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 31 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Woodley</inline>:</para><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>4196</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The impact of any changes that are made to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport's operations is an issue that is specific to New South Wales and regional New South Wales. The airport is the central access to Sydney for anyone coming in by air of course. There is certainly a lot of conjecture about the future of other airports that may be used and may be constructed. That is not an issue that I want to get into or canvass, but I certainly want to say that this report canvasses very clearly the importance to regional and rural New South Wales of maintaining their access to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport.</para></talk.start><para>People from the bush, when they go to Sydney, want to be in the centre of Sydney. That is where most of them conduct their business. If they are going down for medical appointments, most of the major teaching hospitals are reasonably close to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. If the airport were put further away, they would not choose to fly there; they would actually drive. I have had people from Wagga tell me that if they could not land at Kingsford Smith airport they would drive. I certainly know that people from Bathurst weigh up the options and do on occasions drive if a flight schedule does not suit them. If people from Orange, Dubbo and all over regional New South Wales were to lose their access to Kingsford Smith airport or had longer times to travel, they would take the other option open to them and drive.</para><para>That would increase the amount of road traffic already going into Sydney and lead to 
 greater backlogs, greater bottlenecks and would increase people's risk of being injured, because certainly the risk of having an accident on the roads leading into Sydney is great. This is particularly so with the Great Western Highway going over the Blue Mountains from Lithgow to Sydney, one of the most dangerous sections of road in the state. The chances of having an accident on that road are far greater than those of having an accident in the air. It is for that reason that I think it is vitally important that we look very seriously at this particular issue.</para><para>For many people air travel is a lifeline. It may be considered to be a luxury, but it is vital to the development and growth of regional and rural New South Wales. As for industry in my home town of Bathurst, certainly I know that the airlines are used significantly by people from Devro, from Uncle Ben's in particular and from the ISP factories—such as Simplot—as they travel between the various other factories that they have; by people from shops, because they travel to Sydney to do their buying; and by business people to travel to Sydney for appointments. They use and want access to Kingsford Smith airport. They want to be able to just arrive and get in a taxi—or when the rail system is working get on the train—and move off to their destination.</para><para>Also, a lot of the people who travel out of the bush into KSA, regional commuters, actually on-fly. They board the major domestic carriers and travel interstate. Quite a significant number and percentage do that. So it is very important that this remain a feasibility. Many of the airlines are now operating their schedules so that country people can travel down to Sydney early in the morning, conduct their business and go home in the evening and even have the opportunity to connect with an interstate flight certainly to Brisbane and Melbourne—Adelaide is a bit harder—and come back the same day. This saves business overnight travel costs and it saves individuals overnight travel costs.</para><para>I know of at least one young lady who is about to have a cochlea implant who lives further away—she lives down in Griffith—and is able to access the Isolated Patients 
 Travel Assistance Scheme. With her mother this little girl is required to travel to Sydney once a week or once a fortnight during this process, which is going to be for almost 12 months. This saves her parents from having to do a nine-hour drive there and a nine-hour drive back, and they can do it by air in the one day. It means leaving home before 6 o'clock in the morning and not getting home until 8 or 9 o'clock at night, instead of having to drive nine hours down, see the doctor and then drive nine hours back.</para><para>If they had to stay overnight, as would be the case if they had to stay away if things were moved, they would in fact be up for greater cost. So it would cost them more and they would not be able make those same claims on the travel assistance scheme or, if they were able to, it would cost government more to provide such schemes. So access for regional and rural people in New South Wales to Kingsford Smith airport is a lifeline, because otherwise they will drive.</para><para>We also had evidence in this inquiry from the airlines as to the lack of suitability of other airports such as Bankstown for the mixing of high performance commuter aircraft with slow single engine general aviation. Certainly, passionate pleas were made not to mix those for reasons of safety. Access to Kingsford Smith airport is what country people in New South Wales want. It is important to the future development of that state. I am told that percentage-wise not many people perhaps travel on it, but they know that that service is there. They know that having that access to air transport is vitally important to the development of their communities and to the maintenance of industry in their communities. It is a service. So often these days we are seeing the erosion in the provision of services—a lot of it has been done by this government. We have seen the removal of tax offices. There have been a lot of changes where people are feeling that the services to their communities have been reduced.</para><para>If this were to happen—if access to KSA for regional and rural commuter airlines were to cease—there would be a major impact on the aviation industry in the state and there 
 would be a major impact on the regional development for New South Wales across the Great Dividing Range, because air transport is vitally important. It is also vitally important that the air ambulance maintain its access to Kingsford Smith airport, again because of the proximity of Kingsford Smith airport to most of the major teaching hospitals. They do not want to be lumbered out to the back of beyond.</para><para>This is a vitally important report on a vitally important issue. I hope the government takes cognisance of the report. Whilst it is specific to one state, its impact is of major importance. If you talk to the airlines in New South Wales, they will all tell you how important it is for them to maintain access to Kingsford Smith airport as an integral part of maintaining their viability and their existence. Whilst it might seem small in the national scheme, for those in the most populist state it is an issue of significance. It is important to those 1½ million people who live outside of Sydney. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Procedure Committee</title><page.no>4197</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>First report of 1999</title><page.no>4197</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 25 March 1999, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator West</inline>:</para><para>That the Senate</para><para>(a)	 in relation to the use of unpublished documents in dissenting reports, adopts the amendment of standing order 37(2) at pages 1 and 2 of the report</para><para>(b)	 in relation to the appearance of private witnesses with departmental officers, adopts the views expressed by the committee at page 2 of the report</para><para>(c)	 in relation to notices of motion and postponements, adopts as temporary orders ceasing to have effect at the expiration of 30 June 1999 the amendments of standing order 76(1) and 67 at page 4 of the report.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>4197</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the debate be adjourned.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">WEST</name><name role="display">Senator West</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I wish to speak.

It needs to be said that Senator Crane was aware of a document coming from the National Association of Forest Industries headed `NAFI not in breach of ACCC rules'. It is a statement by Dr Robert Bain, the Executive Director. This is the outcome of a dispute about a book. His association threatened legal action if it was not withdrawn from the shelves of BBC Hardware and other places. The point about this is that inadvertently the Senate was being misdirected. The statement by Robert Bain that NAFI is not in breach of the rules is wrong. It pulls the rug from under his strident attack on environmentalists and others about not having correct information. The ACCC, just a couple of hours after his statement, pointed out:</para></talk.start><para>The ACCC is particularly concerned that NAFI, while alleging misleading and deceptive conduct in the book's content, ignored section 65A of the Act, which specifically excludes publishers and information providers from those very provisions.

I thank my National Party colleague Senator O'Chee for allowing me to take his place in the adjournment debate. The issue concerns an insidious social contagion that has already spread across several states. It is bringing about derision, isolation, erosion and, ultimately, destruction to hundreds of families.</para></talk.start><para>For the individuals concerned who are unfortunate enough to have fallen prey in their search for belonging, life becomes one of deprivation, control and total dependency. Imagine a four-year-old boy who has eaten nothing in his life but lambs brain and ox tongue and who can drink only unfiltered tap water and soy sauce. Imagine tommy rough boiled six times a day every day for eight weeks or liver steamed and eaten hourly for days on end. Imagine succumbing to the belief that not adhering to this bizarre regime results in horrid retribution and that if one's husband or wife does not engage in the same bizarre ritual divorce is advised.</para><para>It has been brought to my attention that 450 people, which means more than 400 families, including young children and babies, in South Australia alone have fallen victim to these practices. They can only be described as the workings of a cult. The Vibrational Individuation Program is a personality cult operated by Joan Phillips of Inglewood and Marie Steinke of Upper Sturt in South Australia. The program is based on the use and control of food to followers of the cult. Members consult either Joan Phillips or Marie Steinke to undergo what is known as a food test, which determines what foods the recipient should eat for a designated period.</para><para>A person undergoing the food test lies on a couch while the therapist observes the response of the wrist and surrounding muscles 
 as she reads through a checklist of food items. Depending on the response, the therapist determines which foods are to be eaten exclusively, how they are to be cooked or prepared, the quantity to be eaten, how often and for how long. Usually five to six foods and one beverage are prescribed for the whole of the designated period of some two to 11 weeks. Offal always features as one of the required foods. The person is to rigidly adhere to these instructions until the next food test. The body is asked when the next food test should be and, depending on the locking nature of the wrist, a date is set.</para><para>Despite each client being assigned their own individual program, it seems there are foods that are in vogue at the time for all the clients. For a while, everyone may be assigned brains and tonic water. Another time, it may be corn chips and another time a brand of sardines. After the food requirements are sorted out, the person is `invited to ask the body any other questions you like'. Again, depending on the muscle response, an answer is given.</para><para>As the person gets more involved in the program, every time they want to do something—anything—the body must be asked if it is okay. Every facet of the person's life is controlled by how the body's muscles respond to the question and, in turn, how that response is interpreted by Joan Phillips or Marie Stienke. Followers have been known to be issued with instructions as bizarre as wearing only pink or white underwear, or not wearing black jocks. Another was told to move to Perth from Adelaide and promptly did so.</para><para>The person ends up entirely dependent on these two women, who are the only ones who have `the knowledge' to perform the food muscle test. Followers are charged between $30 and $60 for each food test and approximately 10 to 15 of these tests or programs may be required each year. Based on this information, one could estimate an income for this group of some $20,000 to $25,000 a month.</para><para>This cult has been very cleverly concealed for 10 years in a seemingly innocent facade called a Food Program. You cannot find it in the phone book. Nor will you learn about it 
 at your local health food store. In fact, you cannot find it at all. It finds you. And then the brainwashing begins. Followers are indoctrinated into believing that by not abiding by their individual food program, disease will enter their body. When signs of physiological breakdown begin to show, followers are programmed into believing it is for their ultimate good and to ignore all symptoms. In fact, when a follower in obvious distress calls the Food Program help line, a recorded message immediately lulls them into dangerous submission.</para><para>As is usual of cult practice, pregnant women are the prime target. Programming the foetus ensures a compliant follower. The cult promotes an anti-medical philosophy, which includes refusing ultrasound testing, refusing immunisation, refusing Guthrie and Agar testing, refusing vitamin K injections at birth, refusing added iron or other mineral supplements to mothers or children and refusing baby health checks. Children born into this cult are fed the most bizarre food from birth and reports have come to my attention of undernourished, underweight babies. In addition to malnourishment, children miss out on vital socialisation which is so necessary to their overall development. In the words of a person who managed to defy the cult:</para><para>Children can't have birthday parties, can't go to a friend's house for tea or have a sleep over . . . in case the host parents feed the child something normal.</para><para>You can't go to restaurants, have a coffee, go to barbecues—the whole thing is so isolating—social life becomes totally non existent with a total reliance on others on the program for support and interaction.</para><para>You can't give blood, you can't see the dentist without asking and then sometimes the body will say you can—you must ask first before seeing a doctor and it is usually no.</para><para>But the control does not end there. The cult advocates the breaking up of families should a follower's spouse resist the Food Program. They even operate at least one known `community respite house' in the Adelaide metropolitan area. This house is used for members who have been advised by the food test to leave their partners, and as a hidden residence to house them and their children for 
 indefinite periods. Outsiders have no access to these respite houses; nor do the spouses. The cult then advises the separating parent to deny children access to the noncompliant partner for fear of the children discovering foods other than the dictates of the Food Program.</para><para>The cult does not promote or advertise in any way and only accepts people into its group by word of mouth and after initial `balancing' consultations. Publications of this cult are restricted to members or followers only. Effective from January 1999, all Vibration Individuation Program participants are now required to install fax machines to be in constant contact with the two operating therapists.</para><para>There is new evidence to suggest that the cult has spread outside of South Australia. My research indicates there are now followers in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. With an estimated 450 members and the application of pyramid marketing techniques, proliferation is certain if this group remains unchecked. It is of particularly grave concern that these cult protagonists pose as health practitioners and health therapists, offering their program as a healing modality. This has potentially fatal consequences, as evidenced by an individual who was advised by Joan Phillips that a melanoma class 4 skin cancer—which I understand is the second-highest degree of melanoma—need not be removed.</para><para>In reality, this group is obviously headed by delusional megalomaniacs whose philosophies run contrary to our social and family structure. Followers of this Food Program are indeed victims, snared in moments of mental weakness and vulnerability, trapped in a cycle of fear and dependency, totally reliant on their cult leaders and the group. Some followers have given as long as 10 years of their life to the cult. Others, not as severely indoctrinated, have sacrificed two or three years and hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars before breaking free.</para><para>It is for these reasons that I am forwarding information about the Vibrational Individuation Program, its operations and its members to the federal Attorney-General and the 
 federal ministers responsible for health and family services, to investigate whether any breaches of Commonwealth statutes have been committed by the group, and to all state and territory attorneys-general and health and family services ministers, to investigate possible breaches of provisions in the state medical practitioners acts, and/or child protection acts, based on the fact that Joan Phillips and Marie Stienke are clearly giving medical advice, for a fee.</para><para>I am sure all senators would agree with me when I say that children who are subjected to this type of parental abduction and are harboured inside this cult are at serious risk of physical, emotional and psychological abuse and that this behaviour should not be tolerated by a properly functioning family oriented society.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Textor, Mr Mark</title><page.no>4201</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>4201</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This morning in the Northern Territory Assembly, the Northern Territory Labor Party tabled a transcript and edited video of a focus discussion group run in the Northern Territory by the notorious Liberal pollster, Mark Textor.

Of course, the former President of the CLP and recently deposed CLP Chief Minister, Shane Stone, is the same man that the Prime Minister Mr Howard has apparently given his imprimatur to to become the next President of the Federal Liberal Party.</para><para>In the last five months the Senate has heard much about the Liberal Party's favourite pollster, Mark Textor.

 deceived those involved in focus groups. As we will see, Mark Textor's behaviour and the behaviour of those people associated with him have implications not only for the new Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Denis Burke, but for the federal Liberal Party.</para><para>The transcript clearly shows that Mark Textor lied to the members of the focus discussion group.

What I 
 cannot understand is why Denis Burke continues to work so closely with people like Paul Cowdy. They were politically involved in this Mark Textor exercise. They used public money for blatant political research on behalf of the CLP. As I went on to say, he has been busy in the ACT. His involvement in push polling raises an important question about the new Chief Minister, Denis Burke, and his apparent lack of concern about working so closely with those CLP operatives implicated in defrauding taxpayers' money in the Territory. It is on the record that the push pollster Mark Textor was also used as the Country Liberal Party's exclusive pollster in that 1994 election.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In l994, Denis Burke was the CLP candidate in the seat of Brennan where push polling was used. I do not think it is any coincidence that Mark Textor was working for the CLP in the Northern Territory when push polling was being used. It is inconceivable that Denis Burke would not have known that push polling was being used in his own seat. He may not have approved of it. It may have been out of his control. But now he is the Territory's Chief Minister he has the opportunity to show the Northern Territory that he does not approve of push polling as an election technique and that he does not approve of the misuse of taxpayers funds for party political purposes.</para><para>Mr Burke should sever links with any CLP operatives involved in push polling. He should get rid of any other CLP operatives involved in the defrauding of Northern Territory taxpayers. He should make it clear that Mark Textor's special services are not welcome in the Northern Territory, and he should cut Paul Cowdy adrift.</para><para>The CLP's defrauding of taxpayers' funds for their own party political research also has federal implications. Mr Gary Nairn, now the Liberal House of Representatives member for the seat of Eden-Monaro, succeeded Shane Stone as the CLP president. According to one of the co-conspirators, Andrew Coward, Gary Nairn received much of the research and, indeed, was present at a number of discussion groups, watching the proceedings on closedcircuit TV—without, I might add, the know 
 ledge of the participants. Textor, Stone, Nairn, from humble beginnings in CLP politics in the Northern Territory, are people now active in conservative politics on a federal level.</para><para>If the Liberal Party is prepared to accept Shane Stone as federal president, then they will be sending out a clear message to the Australian community that they condone the defrauding of taxpayers' funds for party political purposes. If the Liberal Party is still prepared to use the questionable services of the immoral and dishonest Mark Textor, then it shows they support push polling.</para><para>We know push polling techniques were used on a number of occasions by the Liberals in the recent New South Wales election, and Textor was directing both the polling and advertising strategy for that campaign. The abject failure of that campaign is symbolic of Textor's incompetence, as well as his willingness to use improper polling techniques. The evidence presented today in the Northern Territory further highlights the dishonesty of Mark Textor, and the federal Liberal Party must rid themselves of his questionable services.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ralph Review of Business Taxation</title><page.no>4205</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>4205</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As senators would be aware, the Ralph Review of Business Taxation has the task of developing recommendations for an internationally competitive and structurally sound business taxation system for Australia. The Ralph committee deliberately encourages a structured debate on the reform of the business taxation system. That is the purpose of my contribution tonight.</para></talk.start><para>In February, the review released its second discussion paper entitled `A platform for consultation' where various options were raised. That discussion paper considered a range of issues and problems exposed by the current taxation treatment of investments and entities. The proposed reform of the investment base is undertaken with four key policy objectives: (1) to encourage business development with an internationally competitive tax treatment of business investments; (2) to achieve closer alignment of tax value and commercial value; (3) to achieve the goal of 
 reducing the company tax rate from 36 per cent to 30 per cent; and (4) the need to achieve overall revenue neutrality. I believe a fifth priority should have been included, and certainly it is an issue that was ignored by the Ralph committee, to reduce the cost of compliance for all business in relation to taxation, particularly for small business. In fact, for small business, the cost of compliance, in terms of options put forward by Ralph, increases dramatically.</para><para>Also, the mining industry has drawn attention to compliance costs which are exacerbated by the extraordinary amount of anti-avoidance provisions in the current legislation. In the discussion paper, the Ralph committee is missing an important feature of investment decisions. It is not merely the reduction in the corporate rate but the overall impact of tax on any entity. The discussion paper focuses on capital intensive industries required to fund the revenue gains necessary to achieve the proposed reduction of the company tax rate to 30 per cent. The base broadening required to achieve a 30 per cent company tax rate requires a significant paring back of current accelerated write-off arrangements for depreciation.</para><para>The desirability of such changes must be considered in light of the differential impact on industry sectors of reduced write-off concessions. The services sector would benefit at the expense, for example, of capital intensive activities such as farming, manufacturing and mining. Therefore, the financial wealth producers gain at the expense of the physical wealth producers—in other words, the real wealth producers versus the money churners.</para><para>Let us look firstly at farming. On 17 March 1999, in his opening address at Outlook 99—`Building on our past to secure our future: continuing the great traditions of Australian agriculture'—the Hon. Mark Vaile MP stated, `The government will honour its election commitment to retain the many primary producers' tax arrangements.' So the Ralph report must be read in relation to that commitment given by the Prime Minister and reiterated by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mark Vaile.</para><para>The removal of accelerated depreciation would significantly impact on the rural sector. The proposed depreciation rates reflect write-off over the effective life of assets and allow a deduction equal to the actual decline in value of an asset year by year. Accelerated depreciation allows the farmer to write off the cost of an asset faster than it loses value.</para><para>The standardised model proposes that deductions will be available to the taxpayer bearing the economic cost of the asset after the investment becomes income producing. That is the theme that runs right through the Ralph proposals. For example, the costs of planting horticultural and viticultural plantations would not be	deductible until they produce income.</para><para>The review proposes that the cost of a wasting asset is the actual cost to the taxpayer. This proposal impacts on horticultural and viticultural plantations and forestry where the deductions are based on original cost. For horticultural plants, the taxpayer can obtain a deduction for establishment expenditure even if the previous owner incurred it.</para><para>In my state of Tasmania, this deferral of expenses until income produces can have a severe impact on some new crops. I refer to the pyrethrum industry, which is not an annual crop. It is a sunrise industry and one that will be particularly affected. Another industry which will be affected in Tasmania is the forestry industry. I remind the Senate that a similar suggestion was put forward in New Zealand which altered and reduced investment in forestry so much that the government subsequently had to change its legislation.</para><para>A negative proposal for the rural sector is the removal of the balancing charge rollover for depreciated assets. The rollover now allows the balancing charge to be deducted from the cost of new plant for depreciation purposes and reduces for future depreciation deductions. Of course, this balancing charge can apply to all other sectors. I put it to the Senate that this balancing charge argument must be viewed in the light of certain capital gains rollover changes announced several years ago. The Ralph proposal did not mention this specifically, but the concept of a 
 balancing charge removal attacks the same sort of issue. So I ask the question: will these capital gains tax provision mooted changes be caught up in the Ralph type proposals? Perhaps the minister might respond later on that issue.</para><para>Farm machinery and capital equipment are often in much need of upgrading, so the potential impact of removing accelerated depreciation for agriculture will be to slow the adoption of new technology. This will create difficulties for farmers to update ageing machinery and equipment. Of course, there is always a need in this country to encourage investment in new technology. Any measure that makes investment in capital equipment less attractive is cause for concern. There is a high reliance on latest technology, capital intensive farm machinery that has given Australia the edge as a low cost producer in primary industry matters.</para><para>There are many negative impacts for the average family farm. The removal of accelerated depreciation would affect all farmers, but the benefit of a lower corporate tax rate is not available to all. For example, most farms operate as partnerships or sole traders. The proposal creates particular disadvantage for those farmers who do not operate their business via a corporate structure because they will receive very little benefit from a reduction in the corporate tax rate since only five per cent of farmers operate in the corporate form. I also put it to you that most small businesses do not operate in the corporate form either.</para><para>With the mining and resources sector, the Ralph review recognises that the current system of capital allowances is in need of comprehensive reform and proposes that no special rules are to apply to the resources sec-</para><para>tor. To implement a standardised model for the treatment of capital allowances threatens numerous concessions available for capital expenditure. To move to a lower 30 per cent corporate tax rate will result in the elimination of the benefit of substantial tax concessions such as the write-off of development and exploration costs and rehabilitation of mining property.</para><para>The proposal in the Ralph review's second discussion paper clearly puts the nation's miners at a disadvantage. Miners value accelerated depreciation highly, particularly in the formative years, due to the capital intensive nature of their businesses. There is a vital need to enhance the international competitiveness. If the proposed depreciation regime is to apply to the resources sector, it will detract from international competitiveness. Removal of tax concessions results in the tax competitiveness of Australia's mining industry being less attractive compared with other mining operations.</para><para>There is also a difficulty if we are going to lose development costs and exploration costs—it will only encourage exploration to take place outside Australia. The loss of concessions to the mining industry will lead to a decline both in the investments and the value of their operations. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>4207</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.48 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>4207</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>4207</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Public Service Act—Locally Engaged Staff Determinations 1999/8 and 1999/9.</para><para>Sydney Airport Curfew Act—Dispensations granted under section 20—Dispensation No. 3/99 [2].</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>4208</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement: Logging Levels</title><page.no>4208</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 437)</subtitle><id.no>437</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4208</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 5 March 1999:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement (RFA):</para><para>(1) Will the RFA set levels of logging for jarrah, karri and marri in state forests that are ecologically sustainable.</para><para>(2) Will these levels subsequently be open to full review by the panel of experts which the Western Australian State Minister for the Environment has announced; if not, why not.</para><para>(3) Will both the levels of logging and the comprehensive adequate and representative (CAR) forest conservation system be open to full review and possible alteration in the course of the development of the new forest management plan, including the assessment by the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority; if not, why not.</para><para>(4) Will the Commonwealth be liable for potential compensation payouts under the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 if, as a result of subsequent reviews of logging levels or the adequacy of the CAR reserve system, further reductions in logging levels are necessary.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>4208</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) In line with previous Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs), the RFA for South-West Western Australia will accredit a process for forecasting sustainable yield.

 externally review the expected sustainable yield figure, in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable forest management, as part of the development of the next Forest Management Plan, due in 2004. This panel is independent of the joint Commonwealth-WA RFA process.</para><para>(3) I am advised that the Western Australian Government will implement a number of their RFA commitments, including proposed harvesting levels, through a new Forest Management Plan, as required under the WA Conservation and Land Management Act 1984. The statutory process for the Forest Management Plan involves full public consultation and assessment by the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority. It is anticipated that the WA Government will initiate action to create the formal reserve component of the comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system prior to the next Forest Management Plan. Any new informal reserves within State Forests will require action under the Forest Management Plan.
