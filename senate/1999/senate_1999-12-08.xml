The Government announced that, as the Department of Defence relocates from certain sites around Sydney Harbour, it would establish a Trust to assume management and planning responsibilities for those sites.</para><para>This bill will fulfil the Government's commitment by establishing the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust.</para><para>As the cradle of European settlement and the focus of Australia's most populous city, the Harbour is the quintessential image of our nation abroad. It will be the centre of international attention during the 2000 Olympic Games.</para><para>For the people of Sydney, the Harbour provides an avenue for commerce and the transport of people. The Harbour and its foreshores are a focus of city living and of recreational pursuits. 
</para><para>For these reasons the Government is committed to preserving the Harbour and its foreshore for future generations.</para><para>Over the last century, the Commonwealth has been custodian of some of the foreshore areas of greatest natural and heritage significance. Those lands have been used by the Department of Defence for the activities of both the navy and army.</para><para>Defence is relocating, or in some cases has already relocated, from North Head, Middle Head, Georges Heights, Woolwich and Cockatoo Island as part of the Government's program to improve the defence of Australia. As Defence relocates these lands will be vested in the Trust. The bill will also allow other Commonwealth foreshore sites to be vested in the Trust if desired.</para><para>The Trust will be required to manage the sites with the objectives of:</para><para>.	 ensuring that management of Trust land contributes to preserving the amenity of the Sydney Harbour region;</para><para>.	 conserving the environmental and heritage values of Trust land, and establishing suitable land as a park;</para><para>.	 maximising public access to Trust land; and</para><para>.	 cooperating with other Commonwealth, New South Wales and local government bodies.</para><para>The Trust will be a transitional body, established for ten years, to ensure that the Commonwealth's duty to rehabilitate the former Defence sites is fulfilled, and that the sites are returned to the people of Australia in good order and with a sustainable financial base for their ongoing management.</para><para>In establishing that financial base, the Trust will be able to recommend the commercial use of parts of the sites and their transferral to freehold title. However, any such long-term proposals will need to be considered as part of the management planning process and the associated community consultation. They will also need to be in accord with the objectives of the Trust which, as the government has made clear, are about rehabilitating, protecting and presenting these sites for the benefit of the whole community.</para><para>I also take this opportunity to reaffirm the government's stated policy of ultimately transferring North Head, Middle Head and Georges Heights to the NSW government for inclusion in the Sydney Harbour National Park. We will consider long-term arrangements for the Woolwich site and Cockatoo Island following the management planning process and while we have no final view, it is our intention that the ultimate ownership of these sites will be determined on the basis of the best outcome in maintaining these sites as community assets. 
</para><para>The Trust will consist of a Chair and five Members, appointed by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. The Government of New South Wales will be invited to nominate two Members for appointment to the Trust. A full-time Executive Director is to be appointed to the Trust, and other staff and consultants may be hired.</para><para>The bill provides for the Trust to develop management plans for the sites within 18 months of the land being vested in the Trust. Management plans must be developed with full community participation, and are subject to my approval as Minister for the Environment and Heritage.</para><para>The bill provides that the Trust will establish a community advisory committee in respect of each management plan area, for the purpose of providing advice to the Trust on issues relevant to the management plan area. The Trust must consider the advice or recommendation of these committees. Additionally, the Trust may establish a technical advisory committee.</para><para>The Trust is expected to work in close cooperation with the New South Wales government and local government authorities, and is fully empowered to do so.</para><para>Due to the need to commence management planning as soon as possible, I issued a media release, on 13 March 1999, announcing that the Commonwealth Government would establish an Interim Trust to commence planning and public consultation. The Interim Trust was duly established and I formally opened its office at Chowder Bay on 15 August 1999, and announced the appointment of an Executive Director. The bill provides for actions undertaken by the Commonwealth on behalf of the Interim Trust in relation to a management plan to be considered as having been performed by the Trust.</para><para>In recognition of the considerable community interest in the future use of these foreshore sites, I released an exposure draft of the bill and explanatory memorandum for public comment in August 1999 and I am appreciative of the large number of individuals and organisations who took the opportunity to make suggestions. The government continues to assess the matters raised during the public consultation period and while that occurs I have decided to introduce the bill as originally drafted to allow Senate processes to commence. It will be our intention to introduce any amendments to the bill arising from the public consultation period during the committee stages of debate.</para><para>This bill presents an historic opportunity to protect what are without doubt nationally significant sites and I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned till

The bill as it stands enables the ANZFA to formally manage food standards and codes of practice without the additional mechanism for review, public input and information about food regulations and decisions that the health ministers meeting currently provides. We believe that this is an inadequate situation for the purposes of public consultation and public education, a theme that has been a feature of the debate about this bill.</para><para>Furthermore, the term `less significant' is not defined under the bill. It is not clear how extensive the new ANZFA's powers will be if this bill is enacted as it stands. Additionally, the 28-day turnaround period in which the health ministers can veto the ANZFA's 
 decisions of less significance as proposed under the bill, we believe, is inadequate for consumer consultation and for lobbying. For these reasons the Democrats cannot support the increased regulatory powers of the ANZFA. Therefore, we seek to omit such changes under the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>11367</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>11367</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I appreciate the issues being raised by Senator Stott Despoja, but can I give her an assurance that these mechanisms do not cut out the public consultation process. It is a matter that the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Council, the 10 ministers, would have particular oversight of and would always be mindful of in any of the issues that are being addressed. We do not support these amendments as they remove an important streamlining provision allowing matters of minor significance to be dealt with more efficiently than through the sometimes lengthy current arrangement. For the provisions relating to these kinds of matters to be used, three hurdles have to be cleared. Firstly, the ministerial council has to have previously approved a general approach to be followed in the development of the specific type of standard; secondly, the draft standard must raise issues of minor significance or complexity only; and, thirdly, no substantive objections have been raised by stakeholders in their submissions.</para></talk.start><para>In addition to these three hurdles, the bill contains an important safeguard. Even if these requirements are satisfied, it will take only one minister on the ministerial council to object to the draft standard and the process will revert to the standard arrangement of having all ministers vote on the issue. This is an important efficiency measure that does not reduce the integrity of the standards development process or, for that matter, the rights of the community in the public processes that are always transparent.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>11367</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Labor opposition does not support these amendments, which seek to remove the provisions for the faster handling 
 of less significant applications. We sought successfully to make amendments in the House of Representatives to remove some of the deficiencies of the government's original approach which were raised in the committee hearings and which we took quite seriously. It is recognised that there are excessive delays for some minor matters and that there should be procedures that avoid every single matter banking up waiting for formal ministerial council approval. We believe the opposition's amendments make it possible for concerned community groups to object and prevent any particular application from being fast-tracked if it contains a contentious matter. We think that provides the effective protection to ensure there is proper scrutiny of all matters if there is a group or interest that feels that the fast-tracking should not apply. We obviously will monitor that in practice to make sure that that intention is met and that it does work successfully. We are, therefore, happy to support at this stage the current proposal and will be opposing the amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>11367</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Could Senator Tambling give an example of what is a minor change as against what is a major change?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>11367</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am advised that an example might be a minor extension to a food additive.

 the minister similar questions. First of all, I would like to know what Senator Tambling understands the term `less significant' to mean in relation to areas where ANZFA will make food regulatory measures without the approval of the health ministers under the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Council. What is his understanding of that term? Who is to determine what regulatory measures are of less significance? As I said in my speech at the second reading stage, is it the media, is it consumers, is it the industry, or is it ANZFA? How does the government define `less significant', and at what stage along the development of a public debate will the relevant persons, whoever they may be, gauge what is of greater or of lesser significance? Certainly I suggest that ANZFA was not too good at determining the significance of the matters in relation to substantial equivalence in the past. Can Senator Tambling explain his understanding of `less significant'?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>11368</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is an important policy issue where the ministerial council would determine the guidelines under which it would operate. Let me give a couple of examples. Senator Stott Despoja would probably be familiar with the folate project which, of course, relates to special foods and special food issues with regard to pregnancy which militate against spina bifida. In that particular situation there is a listing of quite a number of products and commodities. The matter would still be addressed very properly by the ANZFA board in the process of determining that particular area.</para></talk.start><para>Similarly, Senator Stott Despoja would also probably recall that in the discussions that are taking place at the moment with regard to genetically modified food there was a list of policy criteria determined by the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Council. Whilst that is still an ongoing matter to be properly determined—it will come back here for debate in the early part of next year—when we get to the detail of the particular issues, that will be a matter of where the appropriate authority lies as to what is less significant, otherwise 
 Food Standards Council ministers' conferences, which generally try to embrace their agenda a couple of times a year within a half-day or a day session, will in effect become major areas. There is a board. The board has appropriate responsibility. In looking at the amendment, I can assure Senator Stott Despoja that there is no way of avoiding public accountability or transparency in the process, but we would not want to subject the changes to unnecessary delays as they go through the processes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>11368</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Tambling for his answer. He raises the issue of public transparency and the issue of accountability. I ask whether the rationale behind a 28-day turnaround period is that a precedent has been set. I do not know if that is the case for other bodies or what have you, but does the government really believe that that is a satisfactory period of time in which to allow members of the public, consumers as well as different representative and lobby organisations, to come together to register their understanding of or concerns with the decision? Is a 28-day turnaround period really sufficient? Does the government honestly believe that? To me it seems a very short period of time, and one that is inadequate.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>11368</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am advised, regarding the 28-day process to which Senator Stott Despoja refers, that there is a time constraint from when a decision goes through the board and is then presented to ministers out of session, with ministers having 28 days in which to advise whether they have an objection.

The stated policy objective of this bill is to ensure that superannuation savings are invested prudently, consistent with the requirements of the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993 for the purpose of providing retirement income and not for providing current day benefits. This is a policy objective that Labor established when in government. It is an objective that we still support. However, it is precisely because we support this objective that we cannot support this bill, which by the admission of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, extends the opportunity for superannuation funds to be invested for current day benefits.</para></talk.start><para>Labor will be opposing this bill based on five key criteria. Firstly, the government has 
 provided no substantive evidence of a systemic abuse of the current investment rules by what are known as do-it-yourself superannuation funds that would require the proposed changes as they are drafted. Secondly, the changes contained in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which passed the parliament with the support of the Labor opposition, should begin to address many of the problems where they may exist. Thirdly, there are other ways of tightening the existing laws that will better address the perceived problems where they may exist. Fourthly, this legislation, if passed, will make it tougher for small business. It will increase restrictions, red tape and costs. Fifthly, it does have some adverse implications for people living in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>The government has argued that some self-managed superannuation funds, SMFs, are not complying with the spirit of the current laws, which are designed to prohibit superannuation funds from borrowing. The government claims that, where this practice is occurring, it increases the risks associated with superannuation fund investments and is contrary to a retirement income policy designed to ensure that superannuation savings are preserved until retirement and not accessed for current use.</para><para>Labor in determining its position on this bill, and on just about every bill that comes before the Senate that amends legislation established by a Labor government, asks itself: how will this improve the operation of the superannuation law for the benefit of all Australians? A threshold issue for Labor is whether, as the government claims, the practice of superannuation funds borrowing and using retirement income for current day use is so widespread and constitutes such a systemic threat to retirement incomes policy and to the retirement incomes of fund members that it needs to be significantly changed. In addition, Labor has been required to make a judgment on whether the government's legislation actually achieves what it claims it is designed to achieve. To Labor, the obvious answer to all of these questions is no, the government fails the tests.</para><para>To ensure that our legislation was based on the widest possible evidence, Labor referred this legislation to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services. The decision to refer the bill to a specialist committee for examination was also taken to allow the government the opportunity to present its case in support of the bill. The usual materials supporting the bill—the explanatory memorandum, budget announcement and various press releases—did not present an appropriate supporting case. Disappointingly, the government did not provide adequate evidence in support of its bill.</para><para>According to the evidence presented to the committee, the opposition is not convinced that there is a widespread practice of inappropriate use of superannuation funds. The committee did not receive convincing evidence that the retirement income of fund members is at high risk. However, where the government can show that unusual investment practices which place retirement incomes at unacceptable risk are occurring, Labor will support appropriate measures to crack down on this type of behaviour.</para><para>Firstly, is there a need for change? The Insurance and Superannuation Commission, or ISC, as it was known, carried out a survey in support of its claims for the need for this legislation. The government drew upon a random survey of 1,000 excluded funds conducted by the ISC in 1997. The survey found that around 20 per cent of excluded funds were investing in unit trusts that were effectively controlled by the fund members or the employer. It appears that one-half of these unit trusts were undertaking geared investments. Around 13 per cent of superannuation funds were leasing or renting assets to associated parties such as members or employers.</para><para>The ISC conducted follow-up fieldwork of 100 selected funds which provided an example of superannuation funds investing in unit trusts which, in turn, invested with the employer sponsor, made loans to members and employer sponsors, and leased assets to employer sponsors. The government claims, based on the evidence of the ISC survey and fieldwork, that these practices affect the integrity of the SIS investment rules.</para><para>The majority of the evidence provided to the committee roundly criticised the data provided by the government in support of the bill, in particular the fieldwork conducted by the ISC on which the bill seems primarily based. Much of the evidence to the committee argued that the ISC's fieldwork, while identifying problems with the investment practices of some of the 100 chosen funds, did not consist of a representative sample of excluded funds. In addition, evidence from the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants pointed out that the research was now three years old and was undertaken by a different regulator to the Australian Taxation Office, which now regulates SMFs as a consequence of the recent legislation in the No. 3 bill that I referred to earlier.</para><para>The Assistant Treasurer provided a response to questions taken on notice during the committee hearings which included some additional information about a small sample of 145 funds conducted in 1998-99 based on funds' historical activities. The sample found that around seven per cent invested in geared trusts compared to a total of around 30 per cent that invested in related trusts. Where breaches of the existing law were identified, APRA put in place enforcement or rectification action. It would have been more useful for the committee to have had access to this information at an earlier stage and in a fully disclosed format. The opposition referred this bill to the committee on the premise that it was incumbent on the government to provide more substantial evidence of the need for the measures contained in the bill.</para><para>The additional survey conducted by APRA does not provide any substantive support for the legislation. Even assuming that the survey was both representative and robust, the information provided by the Assistant Treasurer actually supports the retention of the existing legislation. If breaches of the current laws were identified and APRA were able to take corrective action, that would support the view expressed by many at the hearings that there is little need for changes as contained in this SLAB 4 legislation. I emphasise that point. Where some abuse has been taking place, the regulator, APRA, has been able to enforce the 
 law as it now stands. The Australian Taxation Office, which now regulates this area, will, I suspect from evidence we have received, be a more efficient regulator in this regard.</para><para>The committee received little, if any, convincing evidence of SMFs failing. The Small Independent Superannuation Funds Association argued that, where SMFs had invested in a small business, the success or failure of the business itself did not necessarily equate to the success or failure of the SMF. This is because not all SMFs invest in small business or property. In addition, the government did not provide any conclusive evidence of SMF fund members losing their retirement incomes as a result of poor investment practices and becoming fully or partly dependent on the government.</para><para>I will make some comments about self-managed superannuation fund investment returns. One would expect that, if self-managed superannuation funds are conducting some sort of risky investment practices, this would be reflected in the investment returns of these funds. However, evidence provided by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants citing an article from the <inline font-style="italic">Personal Investment</inline> magazine stated that, according to research conducted by Rainmaker Information Services and Rice-Kachor Research, SMFs actually earned better than average investment returns in the three years up to 1997. The government was unable to refute this evidence, which does not support the need for this bill to be passed.</para><para>There is now a significant doubt about the tax concessionality of superannuation. Currently, higher income earners pay tax on superannuation at 45 per cent. With the new income tax rates to apply from 1 July next year, most middle income earners will be on the 30 per cent tax rate, which is the same rate for superannuation. Lower income earners pay tax on superannuation at a rate higher than their marginal tax rate. Thus, it can be argued that superannuation for a significant number of people is no longer taxed concessionally. But it can be argued that, if it is, it should not be used for current day purposes or investment practices which place the generous tax concessions at undue risk. In 
 answer to a question on notice from the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Kelvin Thomson, the government was unable to provide evidence of the extent of tax concessions used by SMFs.</para><para>In addition, the government has contradicted its own claims that superannuation funds should not be invested in assets with the intent of using them for current day purposes. In a speech in Brisbane on 28 May 1999, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, said in commenting on the SLAB 4 changes:</para><para>Funds with fewer than five members will be able to invest up to 100 per cent of their assets in business premises leased to members or the employer-sponsor of the fund. This will enhance the ability of small business owners to use their superannuation savings to invest in their own business premises.</para><para>If the government has admitted that it is extending the opportunities for small business owners to invest their superannuation savings in their business premises, surely that is in conflict with the claim that superannuation funds should not be used for current day benefits.</para><para>In addition, deliberately permitting—in fact, encouraging—a superannuation fund to invest all its assets in one asset, as opposed to one asset class, is hardly consistent with what is generally considered to be an appropriately diversified investment strategy that balances risk and return. While there are a few investment restrictions on trustees of super funds, they are required to ensure that the funds' investments as a whole are diversified and do not expose the fund to risks from inadequate diversification. A strong case could be argued that the extension of the business real property rule to 100 per cent does not allow for appropriate diversification.</para><para>As was the case with fund returns, one would expect that, where the government has identified an alleged abuse of the investment rules, this legislation would result in revenue savings. However, in both the explanatory memorandum of the bill and evidence before the committee, the government was unable to provide any substantial evidence of a risk to revenue that the existing investment rules pose. Neither was a strong case mounted that additional revenue will flow or that the 
 existing revenue base will be preserved as a result of the passage of the bill. In response to a question on the revenue impact of the bill, Mr Painton from the Treasury said:</para><para>As presented in the 1998-99 budget, it was in terms of not having a revenue effect within the forward estimates years. But the understanding is that, over time, these measures will improve the integrity and investment rules, and that is expected to have a positive effect on the budget. But there is no identified budget effect within the forward estimates . . . </para><para>It is the prerogative of governments to ask the parliament to pass legislation which relies on an understanding rather than on cold hard facts. But it is the responsibility of opposition parties to scrutinise the evidence presented by a government and, where it does not measure up, to reject the legislation it purports to support.</para><para>We have an existing investment rules regime and it should be possible for the government to substantiate its claims with existing experience or robust statistical modelling and analysis. The government does have available to it the resources of the highly respected Retirement Incomes Modelling Unit in Treasury which is able, given the availability of appropriate data, to model the longer term effects of government retirement incomes policies. It would have greatly supported the government's case if it had provided some analysis of the government's proposed changes through the RIM Unit. The facts are that there is little substantial evidence supporting the government's bill: SMFs are not in crisis, retirement incomes are not being jeopardised and there is little evidence to support that the alleged high risk investment practices the government claims are occurring are causing a systemic breakdown in the retirement incomes system.</para><para>Is the existing law adequate? The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants claimed that the provisions of the existing laws regulating investment practices are adequate and that existing abuses, where they occurred, are minimal. They also argue that the government's proposed changes were like using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut and were not the most effective way of meeting the government's stated policy objective.</para><para>The association also argued that the changes implemented as a result of the recent passage of the SLAB No. 3, which require all SMF fund managers to be trustees of the fund and transfer regulation of SMFs to the Australian Taxation Office, go a long way to ensuring that advertent or inadvertent breaches of the existing investment rules were remedied. We had similar evidence from Mr Murray Wyatt from the CPAs.</para><para>I would now like to turn to the issue of a unit trust look-through requirement. Evidence to the committee raised the issue of whether there should be a look-through requirement for auditors to require them to look through the fund and into any unit trusts that the fund operates to ensure that the unit trusts are also complying with the spirit of the legislation and not conducting risky or non-commercial practices. This would seem to be a sensible suggestion and is something that Labor would encourage the government to consider as an alternative to what is being proposed here. In support of the argument that the transfer of the regulation of SMFs to the tax office will result in better compliance than occurred previously is the additional $6 million in resources the ATO will be putting into its role as SMF regulator.</para><para>A range of other issues which this bill raised have convinced the opposition that it would not be good public policy to support this bill. Many of the witnesses appearing before the Senate committee examining the bill claimed that the proposed bill will increase the complexity of operating an SMF. This is disturbing, as the parliament should be acting to simplify the operation of superannuation, not make it more complex, particularly for small business. Increased cost is usually commensurate with increased complexity. The evidence before the committee suggests that the passage of the bill will increase costs by at least $2,000, depending on the complexity of the fund. In some cases the fund might just be wound up and the money put into a master trust.</para><para>I mentioned the impact on rural and regional Australia as an important principle. Most disturbingly, Labor is concerned about the negative impact this bill is likely to have in 
 these areas, particularly by restricting small business investment. Mr David Coogan, chairman of the superannuation task force for the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said in evidence to the committee that there will be areas of the market, for example the rural sector, where it could have a negative impact. The Small Independent Superannuation Funds Association also supported this view. It must come as a great shock to National Party senators in this chamber, given the enormous problems National Party members have been having recently, particularly in Victoria, that yet again a piece of legislation has come before this chamber supported by this coalition, dominated by the Liberal Party, which will negatively impact on regional and rural Australia. But where is the National Party?</para><para>There has been a significant time delay with this legislation, some 18 months between the initial 1998 budget announcement and introduction of the bill, which means that some superannuation funds which acted in accordance with the announcement may be in breach of provisions of the bill. The Senate has a non-binding procedural order that recommends that the Senate not pass any tax legislation that comes before it more than six months from the time it was announced. There seems little doubt that if this bill is passed by the Senate it should operate prospectively rather than retrospectively.</para><para>On the issue of the choice of funds, the government has asked the Senate to support its choice of funds legislation, which surprisingly, given the government's apparent support for it, has yet to be debated in the Senate and has been pulled from the list of bills to be debated this year. The government's approach in respect of this legislation for small business is inconsistent with its so-called choice of funds philosophy.</para><para>Labor will not be supporting this bill in its current form. Where there is evidence that the existing law is being abused, Labor will support reasonable changes that crack down on that abuse. It is clear that more evidence is required to accurately ascertain the extent of the problems that the government claims are occurring and which this bill claims to address. Labor will not be a party to compli 
 cated, difficult changes to superannuation which make it tougher for small business, add to cost and add to problems in regional and rural Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>11374</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before commencing my speech on the second reading, I wish to declare for the record that my partner has a self-managed superannuation fund which has some investments in a unit trust and in which I also have an interest. As far as I know, this bill would restrict the activities of that fund.</para></talk.start><para>This bill, the  Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 , deals with an extremely complex area of superannuation law governing the investment rules for small superannuation funds. As our report on this bill suggests, it has not been an easy bill for us to develop a position on. However, investment rules are designed to limit the risks to superannuation savings and to ensure that superannuation is preserved for retirement incomes. This is done by restricting investment in the employer or associates, prohibiting super funds from borrowing funds or lending them to members, preventing member assets from being acquired by the fund and requiring all transactions to be at arm's length. The ISC became concerned that a number of funds, particularly smaller funds, were getting around those tough investment rules by investing heavily in unit trusts which were then not bound by the rules, and proceeded in some cases to flout them. This opened up the prospect of a very large proportion of tax preferred superannuation assets being invested back into a person's business or heavily geared, thereby reducing their contribution to retirement savings.</para><para>A 1997 survey of excluded funds covering 1,000 of the 140,000 funds revealed that 20 per cent of funds invested in unit trusts, that 13 per cent of funds were leasing or renting assets to associated parties and that, in all, around 10 per cent of funds used unit trust or lease arrangements that circumvented investment standards. This legislation has sought to overcome these difficulties by preventing superannuation funds from investing in closely held unit trusts. The prohibitions on super funds borrowing or dealing with associ 
 ates would also continue. Against that, the legislation provided a new concession for superannuation investment, allowing small funds to invest a greater amount of their assets into real business property. Currently only 40 per cent of assets can be invested in real business property. Under the new bill, this rises to 100 per cent.</para><para>Given the continuing prohibition on super funds' gearing, this will increase the flexibility of super funds to invest in big, lumpy but attractive real property investments. That concession will be particularly important in regional Australia. Small superannuation funds, the Senate committee was told, are an important source of finance for investment in regional areas. People want to invest in their local areas and this concession will allow for increased direct investment by small super funds in real property in their local regions.</para><para>However, it remains a tall ask for a small superannuation fund to undertake an investment in real business property off its own bat. For a fund with, say, $200,000 to $300,000 of funds, an investment in a single real property could make up 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the fund's total assets, and that is a real risk to the investment diversity of the fund and its associated risk profile. Of course, this was part of the attraction of investing in a unit trust: it allowed a super fund to spread its investment in real property across other unit holders. This bill precludes that by precluding investment in a closely held unit trust; that is, a trust with less than 20 members.</para><para>The Democrats have come to the conclusion that there are very sound reasons for super funds investing in a closely held unit trust, particularly where such a trust is investing solely for real business property. There are sound reasons for allowing the large and lumpy cost and risk of property investments to be shared by a superannuation fund with other investors, even associates, through a unit trust. However, I think that the prohibition on borrowing which applies to a superannuation fund should also apply to a closely held trust on the basis that it could affect the liquidity and the risk profile of the underlying closely associated super fund.</para><para>I understand that in the committee stage the government will be moving an amendment to ensure that small superannuation funds can continue to invest in closely held trusts where the sole asset of those closely held trusts is real business property, provided the trusts do not borrow more than the currently allowed five per cent. That extends the same investment rules for a superannuation fund to a closely held trust but allows that extra bit of flexibility by allowing a super fund to spread the cost and the risk of a real property investment. I do not think that there is any need to allow closely held trusts to also invest in shares. Shares are much smaller unit investments than real property parcels and can and should be dealt with directly by the small superannuation fund.</para><para>Another issue raised by submissions to the Senate committee is the supposed retrospectivity of the legislation. The government's intention to introduce this legislation was first announced in the 12 May budget in 1998. An exposure draft was released more than six months later with a number of significant concessions agreed to by the government during the consultation phase. The bill was finally tabled in the parliament on 11 August of this year, some 15 months after the budget announcement.</para><para>There are two sets of transitional arrangements with this bill for assets purchased prior to May 1998. The transitional rules allow, effectively until 2009, for such funds to rearrange their affairs to comply with the new rules. For assets purchased after May 1998 and prior to royal assent of this bill, the funds will have only until July 2001 to comply with the bill. We think this is a rather tough ask particularly given that there was a 15-month period before the actual law was tabled. I think it is almost impossible to ask trustees to comply with rather vague budget press releases and then wait 15 months for legislation, particularly when the legislation ends up being rather different from the Senate announcement.</para><para>While we appreciate that this bill is designed to deal with potential tax planning through unit trust structures, it also has the effect of severely affecting what may be quite 
 legitimate investment decisions by super funds as well. Indeed, as evidence to the committee from Cleary Hoare Solicitors, quoted in the Senate report, points out:</para><para>If a taxpayer, even with the best advice, has acted contrary to the provisions of the Bill since May 1998 in a way as to make complying superannuation funds non-complying the taxpayer on the current laws, will have 47% of the assets in the superannuation fund confiscated.</para><para>Given these sorts of concerns, the Democrats do not believe that we can retain the 12 May 1998 operative date for this bill. I understand that the government has agreed that in the committee stage it will move to make this bill operative from 11 August 1999.</para><para>The penultimate issue I want to deal with is that of the actual definition of business real property. A number of submissions to the committee suggested that the definition of business real property might need to be extended. It was suggested that leases, vacant land and other types of property might be included in the definition. A government amendment will make business real property the only allowable investment for a closely held unit trust, and I think this definition becomes very important. The Democrats will be seeking an assurance from the minister that the Treasury will be prepared to consult industry groups over enacting a regulation that might ensure that the definition of business real property is as wide as is practically possible within the risk and investment constraints intended by the law.</para><para>The Senate will be aware that for some time the Democrats have advocated and moved to see that all superannuation legislation deals with the inequitable situation that applies to same sex couples. We are advised that in the case of this bill it is technically difficult to amend the legislation. However, my colleague Senator Bartlett will be moving a second reading amendment requiring the government to prepare a report for the Senate on the technical and legislative requirements for removing the discrimination faced by same sex couples in superannuation and tax laws. With that comment I will conclude and indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the bill at the second reading.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>11376</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on behalf of the government to support the <inline ref="r896">Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999</inline>  put forward by the government. One of the strengths of the superannuation arrangements in Australia, particularly the superannuation guarantee system, is the flexibility in terms of investment restrictions. We are different to most other countries in that superannuation funds are free from some of the very onerous investment regulations. While this bill will certainly restrict certain investments which may expose funds to greater risk, it will allow superannuation funds considerable scope for diversified investment.</para></talk.start><para>It is important to look at the matters that have moved since the budget announcement some time ago. For example, there have been very generous grandfathering provisions, especially for those funds that had particular arrangements in place on budget night. Essentially, all those funds would have been protected. Also, there is the incentive to increase the business rule property exemption from 40 to 100 per cent. A number of submissions acknowledged the very extensive consultation that has taken place. It has taken a long time and there has been a great deal of consultation. Naturally, not everybody was happy about particular outcomes.</para><para>I am particularly pleased about an amendment that the government agreed to following the hearing in Melbourne on 18 November. I refer to the government's agreement to the use of an interposed unit trust, but only in circumstances where that unit trust is not allowed to borrow. Perhaps one of the most contentious issues arising from the deliberations of the hearing that I chaired in Melbourne was the view that widely held trusts are in a position to leverage and to borrow much more extensively than is possible under the arrangements for the smaller funds. That seemed to be a grievance. I must say that that sort of issue raises a number of problems for me in superannuation. Leverage is always a difficult area because any leverage at all exposes funds to a greater risk. Obviously, the responsibility of any superannuation trustee is to get the highest return, commensurate with 
 the minimum amount of risk. Of course, any situation which allows leverage is a situation where members' investments are open to greater risk. Perhaps this was the issue that really dominated the whole of the hearings.</para><para>We have to go back a little in history, because when the SIS arrangements were first put in place—they were put in place by a Labor government with close supervision by the superannuation committee, which Senator Sherry and I chaired over that period—there was a very strong feeling that there was to be no borrowing whatsoever. Subsequently, a piece of paper was issued by the ISC that allowed an extraordinary situation where you could not borrow directly, but if you interposed a unit trust, that unit trust was able to leverage or borrow. As such, it meant that super funds were in a position to acquire a wider range of assets. But the whole process effectively lifted the risk profile of many small funds. It is always difficult for regulators to look closely at investment strategies, so broad guidelines have to be laid down. The government in its wisdom has seen fit to do so, but in some cases where you have an interposed trust there is exploitation of the situation. That is not in every case—in fact, I would say the majority of super funds that use this interposed trust as a mechanism for leverage do so very responsibly. But, of course, we have to be careful as legislators to make sure that we do not allow those who are unscrupulous to move in.</para><para>One of the big challenges in the superannuation industry at the present time is that this pot of gold in superannuation continues to grow at a tremendous rate. Despite the government announcement, it is significant to point out that do-it-yourself funds, small super funds, et cetera are still increasing in number, size and importance. I remind you that it was always the original intention of the SIS, supported by both levels of government, that there should not be borrowing. This raises the wider question that a number of funds alluded to: why do you put so-called tighter restrictions on the smaller funds rather than on the larger funds, where they can invest in companies that have a certain amount of gearing or have these sorts of trusts?</para><para>There is also the question of investing in certain types of derivatives. Derivatives are an issue that I think will challenge the superannuation industry in the future because, used inappropriately, they can be used as a mechanism of leverage—and no, I am not satisfied that we have got these rules completely right in Australia at the present time. It could well be an issue for further evaluation not only by our committee, if time permits, but also by the industry generally. That is because, after all, we have to safeguard the protection of these moneys, particularly as more and more of people's money is being put into the private sector, and there will always be people within the private sector who put private profit, personal greed, ahead of members' interests. You can always get situations where you have a very aggressive chairman taking a fund in directions which may not necessarily be in the best interests of the wider membership, despite all the sorts of powers that we seem to be giving to the individual members. My time is brief; I know the minister is anxious to get on with this bill, so I will conclude my remarks in support of the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>11377</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak to the <inline ref="r896">Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999</inline>  on behalf of the Democrats in conjunction with my colleague Senator Allison. As Senator Allison indicated at the end of her second reading contribution, one issue of ongoing, frequent and regular concern to the Democrats has been the inequities suffered by same sex couples under superannuation legislation—and a range of other legislation—at Commonwealth level. I have spoken on this a number of times, as have many of my colleagues. The Democrats have an overarching piece of legislation in the Senate aimed at removing all forms of discrimination and ensuring recognition and equal treatment of same sex couples across all Commonwealth legislation.</para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, parliament being what it is, getting private senators' bills passed through the parliament is a fairly difficult process, as the close to 100-year history of this parliament would attest. I am not totally sure but, off the top of my head, I think about six or 
 eight private senators' bills have been passed in the whole history of the parliament, so it is not an easy road for ensuring legislative reform. I hasten to add that that should not be taken to suggest in any way that the Democrats are not continuing to pursue every avenue to obtain the passage of that legislation.</para><para>Nonetheless, the Democrats are also about trying to ensure outcomes. It is important to raise the issue, but the people that are suffering unfair discrimination around the country are looking for that discrimination to be addressed and are looking for concrete outcomes in that regard. Many times in the past, the Democrats have moved specific amendments at the committee stage of legislation trying to address discrimination against same sex couples, and we could have approached this piece of legislation in the same way. If it had been accepted, it would have at least opened the door and removed one area of discrimination, but discrimination in a lot of other areas of superannuation legislation would have been maintained as it exists. It would also have put that issue in the middle of a potential bouncing backwards and forwards between the two houses of parliament of the overall bill that we have put it onto.</para><para>I will actually be doing the government a favour this morning, although I am not sure that they will see it that way. Instead of having it embodied in a piece of legislation which the government would be unwilling to accept, thus putting the whole legislation at risk, on behalf of the Democrats I will address the issue through a second reading amendment, which has been circulated. I apologise for the late circulation but, hopefully, all senators are aware of the content of it now. I move the Democrat second reading amendment:</para><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>"and that there be laid on the table, on or before the last sitting day in March 2000, details of all legislative changes that would be required to ensure the recognition and equal treatment of same-sex couples under all Commonwealth superannuation and taxation legislation".</para><para>The second reading amendment, which I hope will receive the support of the Senate, specifically and quite simply requires the govern 
 ment to provide details of all the legislative changes that would be required to ensure the recognition and equal treatment of same sex couples under all Commonwealth superannuation and taxation legislation.</para><para>There was a suggestion that this issue could have been referred to a Senate committee for examination. On one level, this sounds like a reasonable idea except that we have already had a number of reports on these issues over the years, not least a very comprehensive Senate committee report into the Democrats' sexuality discrimination legislation that I spoke of previously. There was also the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, chaired by the previous speaker, Senator Watson from the coalition. Their report of November 1995 on superannuation and broken work patterns contained a recommendation that superannuation regulations be amended so that those in bona fide domestic relationships and single people be treated in the same manner as married and de facto superannuants. That recommendation was aimed at ensuring that all people in bona fide domestic relationships, whether same sex or opposite sex partners, would have equal treatment. That was a unanimous recommendation of the committee from four years ago, and it has not been acted on. I think people are getting tired of waiting.</para><para>There was also a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report on superannuation entitlements of same sex couples, which did not focus on the whole gamut of superannuation legislation but on a broad range of it, particularly in relation to public sector recipients of superannuation. Again, that report contained a recommendation, which was brought down by the Human Rights Commissioner in April this year, that various sections of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 and relevant trust deed rules under the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 be amended to remove provisions which impair equality of opportunity in employment and deny protection before the law. In particular, it recommended that gender specific terms should be replaced by gender neutral terminology so that benefits apply equally to 
 opposite sex and same sex partners. This is another report with another recommendation relating specifically to superannuation entitlements which clearly highlights the unjustifiable discrimination that same sex couples face and recommends that that discrimination be removed.</para><para>The second reading amendment that I have moved basically requires that all the legislative changes that are required to ensure equal treatment and recognition of same sex couples would have to be compiled and presented to the Senate. Part of the aim of that is to ensure that all of the required changes would be presented in one block. It might be a fairly feeble defence, but nonetheless the defence that is regularly used by the government is that it is inappropriate to make piecemeal changes, thus creating anomalies where you have different definitions of couples in different areas of legislation. This would ensure that the whole range of required changes across all the superannuation and taxation legislation would be put together and, in effect, would require some degree of government response to recommendations from reports such as those that I have just detailed. It obviously does not commit the government to adopting them, and that is a decision for the government to make. In that sense, it is not a policy based amendment at all; it simply requires that the legislative detail be provided as a single group to the Senate. I believe that would make some advance.</para><para>As I said at the start of my contribution, when one speaks often on this issue one is conscious that outcomes are slow in appearing, certainly at the federal level. Even in the short couple of years that I have been speaking about these issues in this chamber, we have seen very significant and positive legislative changes being made at the state level in Tasmania, and there are positive changes now being made by the state government in my own state of Queensland. It is getting more and more unacceptable and, from my point of view, embarrassing that the federal legislative level is now lagging far behind most states—even states such as Queensland and Tasmania, which some people might mistakenly see as 
 conservative, backward or red-necked on these sorts of issues.</para><para>Queensland and Tasmania have shown a progressive approach. They have made positive changes and the sky has not fallen in. In fact, significant benefits have arisen as a consequence. We are getting to a stage where the Commonwealth, instead of taking a leadership role, is very much behind the pack. Apart from the situation in Western Australia, where legislation there is completely unacceptable and even more discriminatory, the Commonwealth is now about the worst in the country. Whilst this amendment will not achieve concrete legislative change, which is what the Democrats are aiming to achieve in the long run, it will hopefully move a step towards that in a way that does not commit the government on any policy level but provides the information to be made available to the Senate for consideration.</para><para>I do hope that all senators will give favourable consideration to the amendment. As I said at the start, in effect it does provide the government with an easier path than attempting to make specific legislative changes to this particular bill, which deals with only one small component of what is, as all Australians know, a very large and complex superannuation industry governed by quite a range of legislation and regulations. It provides better opportunity for the government to present the information to the Senate without having it enmeshed with other policy and legislative changes. I hope the Senate as a whole does see this as a positive way forward and supports the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>11379</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank senators for their remarks.

So, for us not to support it, I need to hear some indication from the government as to why it would present some issue of unworkability.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>11383</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been provided with some additional material which I think will answer Senator Sherry's points in more detail as well as respond to Senator Bartlett's request for information. I think Senator Sherry by interjection responded accurately to Senator Brown's point about why you cannot deduct a speeding fine. I do remember a particular year in Western Australia where it would have been very helpful for me to be able to do so. I had about five speeding fines in a row. It was a significant expense involved in getting to and from work. But I realised it 
 was probably cheaper if I just got out of bed 10 minutes earlier and left home earlier, rather than speeding along the Roe Highway to my Cannington office and meeting the constabulary on the way. The answer is, as Senator Sherry said by way of interjection, that there is a specific exclusion in the tax law about those fines. In a way this is clarifying the tax law in a not dissimilar way, ensuring that moneys used to bribe foreign officials cannot be deducted.</para></talk.start><para>The point that should also be made clear is that there is no evidence that taxpayers are claiming tax deductions for expenditure on bribes paid to Australian officials. I guess that would apply to foreign officials as well. It makes some sense to say that if you are involving yourself in illegal activities it is unlikely that you are going to bring the money you might use for that activity into a formal system such as the taxation system. It is more likely that you are using money that you want to ensure is outside the system. So it makes sense that there is no evidence of it. Certainly there is no evidence of claiming tax deductions for expenditure on bribes paid to Australian officials. While some royal commissions and inquiries into corruption have reported the payment of bribes to police officers and other government officials, these payments have not been claimed via the taxation system. I think, again, on the face of it, that is logical. You are not likely to report money that is being used for those circumstances to the tax office and try to claim a deduction for it. You would have to be pretty stupid to do that.</para><para>To respond to Senator Sherry's point, the government obviously takes the matter of any bribery of Australian officials most seriously. There are very strong criminal penalties applying to Australian officials acting corruptly. These penalties are backed up with effective enforcement regimes, including via the Federal Police. The rationale for denying deductibility of bribes to foreign public officials is that effective criminal sanctions against such behaviour do not exist in certain less developed countries, and this rationale does not apply within Australia. This answers Senator Bartlett's question as to why we do 
 not need this amendment. Therefore, any extension of the bill would have no impact on illegal behaviour. We do not believe that it is a beneficial measure.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>11384</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For clarification of the matter, I ask the parliamentary secretary: why is there not a simple law which says that if it is illegal it is not tax deductible?</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Calvert)</name></talker><para>—The question is that the amendments moved by the opposition be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>11384</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was quite an important question I put.

Here we are dealing with an amendment to the tax law which says that if you bribe a foreign official, which is an illegal thing to do, you cannot tax deduct it. I would have thought that there should be a tax law which says that if you do anything that is illegal, you cannot tax deduct it. I can see the merit in looking at illegal activities. The obvious ones that come to mind, for 
 example, are running a brothel when it is illegal, a gambling activity that is illegal or growing a crop that is illegal. If the taxation department knows about them they should be taxed like any other activity. But I think it should be clear in the tax law that there ought not be the facility for getting a tax deduction for an illegal activity. That is surely what the government is saying here.</para></talk.start><para>If you bribe a foreign official that is illegal. Under Australian law, that is not allowed. You will not be able to tax deduct it either. What we all know is that Australians and Australian companies are involved in the business of bribing foreign officials in countries to our north. Apparently that is being put down as a necessary part of business and tax deductibility is being sought for that. I believe that it ought not be. As the parliamentary secretary has explained, there is a worldwide move to try and stop tax deductibility for bribing foreign officials.</para><para>I do not want to hold up the committee. I would say that the government needs to look at amending the tax law, if it has not done so already, to simply say that the money gained from any activity which is illegal is not tax deductible. It would save listing every crime under the statutes and saying, `You can't deduct this, you can't deduct that.' If you are speeding on your way to work, you cannot deduct the fine that you have to pay, because that is an illegal activity. If you incur a business cost when you are making money illegally, while you get taxed for the making of the money, you cannot deduct whatever illegal thing it is you are doing as a tax deduction. I think it would make tax law much simpler if the Taxation Office and the minister look at this and come back to the parliament with a very simple amendment to the tax law which says, `Costs incurred through illegal activities are not tax deductible.'</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>11384</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I appreciate Senator Brown's comment that he does not want to bog down the committee stage in this debate.

We have made the point about how the tax office will get that information in the first place and that it may well be sparse. But their job is to assess the income and collect the tax on that income. It is not their job—it is the job of the criminal enforcement side of things—to make judgments as to breaches of the law.</para><para>It is not the tax office's job to make a judgment as to how that money has been derived.

That intent extends to bribes to all public officials, including those within Australia.

It may not be the answer that Senator Brown wants to hear, but I have read it and it seems a reasonable proposition. There may be a disagreement about whether the tax office always proffers reasonable suggestions, but the reason is that the government does not support varying the current provisions of the legislation in this area—that is, the $5,000 cut-off. The threshold is imposed quite simply to avoid the compliance costs associated with allowing deductions for donations of low value items, for example, second-hand clothes or used household goods, and to simplify enforcement. Donors making donations below the threshold are still able to access tax deductions by selling the asset and donating cash. The bill provides for income tax deductions to be allowed for the market value of donations of property worth more than $5,000 regardless of when it was purchased or acquired.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>11389</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That presumably means that, if some

I do not think it is difficult to differentiate that from second-hand clothes. The problem I have with this is that it means the small donor right across the Australian populace who may not have works and properties of more than $5,000 that they can donate is disadvantaged against the big donor who, being better off, is going to have works or properties worth much more and who gets the deduction regardless of how old the item being donated might be.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>11389</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In relation to cultural gifts, I am advised that the example you used, which is a painting, would fall under the category of cultural gifts and under that category there is not a $5,000 threshold.

Someone who wants to donate something worth $4,500 is going to ask why the 
 system is biased against them and point out that if they made a donation worth $5,500 they would get a deduction. That is the problem. You will have the same arguments whether you set it at $2,000 or $1,000.</para></talk.start><para>Our advice is that compliance costs are balanced in the national interest if you set the threshold at $5,000. We could easily spend the next two sitting days coming up with examples illustrating that that is not a good threshold. Our best advice is that that is a reasonable threshold in terms of costs and benefits. The cultural gifts program specifically creates a system that will allow cultural gifts to be given, which solves the problem that Senator Brown first raised. In terms of giving gifts to an organisation that may seek to benefit Australia's natural environment or other heritage, donations of over $5,000 of property will be tax deductible; if property is worth less than $5,000 the option is that the good could be sold and the donation made. In that case the donation would be tax deductible.</para><para>We are not therefore saying that anybody who has got property of less than $5,000 to give cannot benefit the organisation. We are just saying that, in terms of the compliance mechanisms in relation to the gifting of property, there are bigger compliance issues at stake. I am not an expert in this field, but obviously, if you donate property, valuation issues come into it. If you are donating cash, it is quite clear: you write them a cheque. If you were, for example, to auction or put up for sale on one of the many excellent Australian electronic auction rooms on the Internet these days a good or an item that you wanted to sell and donate the money to the Wilderness Society in Tasmania—an excellent cause, I am sure you would agree, Senator Brown—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—Absolutely.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—My younger brother Colin spent many years of his life raising money for the Wilderness Society in Tasmania.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Why didn't you?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—I actually helped to raise money for the Wilderness Society in Western Australia and gave over

Let us say I had something of value to auction. I could easily sell it, create some money and hand over a cheque to the Wilderness Society. That means that someone who has a piece of property that is worth less than $5,000 can still do the right thing by the Wilderness Society or any other organisation that they wish to donate to. It ensures that that sort of philanthropy can go on. But, in terms of the compliance cost of property and the additional compliance that will relate to gifting property, the government believes that $5,000 is a good threshold.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>11390</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am tempted to add that, with Christmas being around the corner, the Wilderness Society shops are the best place to go to.</para></talk.start><para>I have a couple of follow-ups on that.

Let us say you have made a collection of historic labels for apple boxes from the Huon Valley, which are very brilliant and colourful, for the apples being sent overseas in the 1950s, 1960s and so on, and you want to donate that. They are assessed as being worth $3,000. Surely it is not a sensible option, if you are going to get tax deductibility, to have to sell them somewhere to a private collector when you want to put them into the public domain and then add $2,000 to get tax deductibility. I want to check on that. I hope Senator Campbell is going to say that, because it is a cultural donation, exemption will apply. The second thing is that I wonder about the provision which says that gifts of property valued at less than $5,000 are tax deductible only if the property was bought within the 12 months before making the gift.

If you have purchased something within 12 months and gifted it, quite clearly the valuation issues are a lot simpler and it will be easy to say what the value was because there would have been a transaction that has taken place to make the value quite clear. The other point I should make is that it has been part of the legislative regime and we are not seeking to change that. It is not a new measure; it is something that has been in place for some years.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>11391</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The problem with it is that it has the effect of giving tax deductibility to somebody who buys an item of less than $5,000 value and then donates it to a public institution or collection.

If that is the case, if such items get exemption because they are of cultural value, why have this proviso of 12 months? What items are you looking at that a person might buy that are not cultural items and might gift within 12 months to an institution that is going to draw the allowance for tax deductibility?

And it is very obvious what the value of that good is if it has been purchased within the past 12 months.</para><para>With the compliance cost in relation to determining the value for the sake of tax deductibility purposes, the key issue of why you set the threshold at $5,000—which is how much paperwork and how much compliance cost is involved by the parties involved, including the tax office, in setting the amount for the deduction through valuation processes and other issues—is solved if the item has been purchased within 12 months because the valuation is therefore quite clear.</para><para>An item with some historical value or significance that has been in the ownership of a family over 150 years is clearly a different matter when you come to valuation. Ultimately, the tax office needs to place a value on things, and the costs involved in trying to determine the value of those items make the government's point. That is why there is this exemption for items purchased in the past 12 months. It is a provision that has been in the law for many years and it makes sense.

Senator Hill was wanting to come into the chamber to deal with those issues and it might pay, since he is certainly far more versed in these matters than I am, for him to address that issue when he arrives.

We are coming to a range of amendments—particularly from the Australian Democrats but there are also some from the Greens—that seek to extend the benefits that we have included in this bill in relation to philanthropy for conservation purposes. Within this bill there are quite historical changes to encourage donations of property for conservation purposes, and that should not be overlooked. In the future, a donation of property for that objective will be tax deductible, which will be a huge incentive for the transfer of properties. That is somewhat consistent with a trend that is taking place in some other countries, in particular the United States. It has contributed there to a vast array of property being dedicated by individuals to conservation purposes, which significantly complements the traditional way of doing that through a national park system. So, through this bill, the government is taking a major step to encourage the development of such a philosophy in Australia. It does it in relation to the income tax deduction. It is also a benefit that capital gains tax will not apply to a test of entry disposition of such a property.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Australian Democrats, as is not unusual, say, `Yes, we'll take that, but we want to go further.' Their amendments cover a range of other initiatives that could be addressed by government to even further encourage philanthropy in this area. In particular, they provide that where a property owner covenants a property or part of a property for conservation purposes and that results in a reduction in the value of the property, then that should be treated as a tax deductible sum. In addition, they say that where a property has been donated, the donor should have the additional advantage of being able to average out that donation for income tax purposes over a period of five years. Again, they argue that if a property is donated for this purpose capital gains tax should not apply.</para><para>The government's position on each of these additional measures is that we are not pre 
 pared to support them in this bill. We think, as I said, that we have made a historic start along this road of encouraging the disposition of property for conservation purposes, and we are prepared as a government to seriously consider other initiatives during the course of next year. It has been interesting to reflect upon the work that has already been done in this area, particularly by the CSIRO's Carl Binning and Mike Young, which has been very helpful in putting together a possible suite of initiatives that a government might take in regard to this—two of which, as I said, have been picked up by the government in this bill. It is also interesting to note that significant property owners and business people in Australia are now coming together and debating among themselves what they might be able to do to encourage this philosophical change in the Australian people towards the disposition of property for conservation purposes. So the community is moving to a position which the government would obviously regard as desirable.</para><para>There is considerable information on the public record as to a possible suite of further initiatives, and the Australian Democrats and the Greens have put on the table today some further options in that regard. The government's view is that they should be seriously considered during the course of next year—obviously not surprisingly in relation to the cost as well as the issue of effectiveness—and then the government can make a decision as to which further initiatives, if any, it should take, within the budgetary constraints of the government but also with the objective of getting the most effective outcome in terms of conservation for whatever commitment that the government might be prepared to make in relation to revenue forgone. The government put to the committee that that is a better way to proceed on these other initiatives that are put up in the form of amendments by the minority parties today, and to that sentiment the government would not be prepared to support them on this occasion in this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>11393</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Hill spoke to amendments that I have not moved yet.

The substantial issue is amendment No. 10, which basically adds an extra component to the act. As I said in my second reading contribution on this bill, some of the aims of what the government has done with this bill are laudable and the Democrats support them. As Senator Hill indicated, the bill does broaden opportunities for taxation incentives for some conservation related measures. In our view, it presents an ideal opportunity to extend that further in a way that we believe will be at fairly minimal cost to the public purse. In terms of savings to the public purse in the long term through improvements to our land quality and to our record in the conservation of land, it would be money well invested that, in our view, would pay itself off many times over.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The amendment inserts two new sections into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997—I think that is the correct one. The first relates to rules for working out how much people can deduct for a gift of land if it is given to an environmental organisation, fund, authority or institution—as defined—or to a public fund established and maintained under a will or 
 instrument of trust solely for the purpose of providing money, property or benefits to environmental organisations or related institutions. When people sell land they own to an environmental organisation for less than its market value, it provides the opportunity for them to deduct the difference between the market value of the property and the actual sale price. Or, if they give that land to an environmental organisation or related authority and retain the right to live on the land for the remainder of their life and, upon their death, pass the ownership of the land over to that environmental organisation or trust, again, the market value of the property can be taken into account for tax purposes.</para><para>The second section enables deductions for land affected by conservation covenants. Establishing a conservation covenant on land means, in broad terms, having a requirement inserted into the actual land title to preserve particular parts of the land. This would usually protect the vegetation from being cleared or impacted on, prevent buildings from being constructed or preserve and protect the creeks and features of the land. If you enter into a conservation covenant like that with either a relevant trust or a government authority, the decrease in the market value that occurs as a result of putting that conservation covenant on your land is also able to be used for tax deductible purposes.</para><para>It is worth pointing out that the use of conservation covenants is not new. It has been used already throughout Australia to great effect—in some states more than others. The amendment lists various state based acts that conservation covenants currently operate under. In my own state of Queensland the state government is moving to improve the operations of that process. As I have mentioned in this chamber before, the Trust for Nature in Victoria is an excellent example of a conservation trust established and recognised under state legislation. I have also mentioned the operation of a large number of conservation covenants overseas, such as I have outlined in this amendment. The sort of work that the Trust for Nature has done has been incredibly effective, not just with its ongoing conservation outcome but also in 
 terms of the savings to the public purse. It is worth emphasising that point. It sits alongside the operation of national parks and publicly managed areas of land. I am not in any way suggesting that these sorts of measures should replace national parks and areas of land managed by state authorities, but resources at government level can go only so far in that area of activity. One of the major ongoing impacts on the environmental value of our land is the use humans put that land to and the way they live on it.</para><para>If we can provide mechanisms that encourage people to conserve and maintain the environmental values of that land, it will be a massive saving down the track to society as a whole, both economically and environmentally. It would assist the landowners themselves to be a part of conservation management. As I am sure all senators would be aware, a major issue in Queensland at the moment is land clearing, which is a very unfortunate and immensely environmentally destructive activity. For economic reasons, farmers feel it is a necessity to clear their land, predominantly for cattle grazing—for those of you who might be pondering having a steak for lunch.</para><para>Farmers are moving in that way because they believe there is some economic incentive for them to do so. In many cases it is very marginal. There are the costs of clearing the land, and the return they then get on it from cattle or whatever is often very small—there is a very thin margin of so-called profit there—but there is immense environmental damage that the community as a whole has to bear for many years to come. We can provide tax incentives for people to maintain vegetation on their land, and these sorts of measures can make all the difference in that regard, particularly when you are dealing with the marginal income making activities that are driving a lot of the land clearing at the moment. For a very small initial impact on the public purse, there is a massive environmental and economic benefit for the country down the track.</para><para>An immediate and prominent example that is proving to be of immense difficulty for the state Labor government in Queensland is their 
 unequivocal election promise to put adequate controls on land clearing in Queensland. The way the world works, for better or for worse, is that financial matters often drive a lot of human activity, including a lot of environmental destruction. Along with using measures such as strict legislative and regulatory controls and punitive measures, we all know that providing incentives and encouraging people through positive means to change behaviour are often just as effective, if not more effective. Where there are opportunities to adopt such an approach, I think we should try to grasp them.</para><para>This particular amendment is significant in that regard. I am not in any way suggesting that it would solve the land clearing problem in Queensland overnight; it is more about putting in place the mechanism for long-term behavioural change. I would not want the state Labor government to see it as an excuse to back out of their election commitment to introduce some proper land clearing controls, but it is a mechanism that can add to that. It has flow-on benefits across the country of involving landowners themselves in conservation, and it attaches some economic value to maintaining the health of our environment.</para><para>Often one of the big problems for people who want to preserve the environment is that there is no dollar value placed on things. There is a dollar value in raising a cow and getting someone else to slaughter it and slice it up, but there is often no dollar value in maintaining the health of the land. Down the track we will all have to pay those hidden ongoing costs of the environmental damage. Whether those costs are from repair of or reduced productivity from the land, or whether they are from pollution and other flow-on health costs, there are enormous in-built costs that just do not show themselves to the individual.</para><para>This is only one mechanism. I should emphasise that it is, in its own way, a small measure but it provides a good mechanism for a lot of that philosophy of providing incentives—of giving economic value to conserving land rather than just degrading it. In that sense I think it sends a positive message, as well as providing financial incentives for 
 people. It builds on systems that are already in place at a state level through conservation covenants. It does not limit covenants to those mechanisms, so it is flexible enough for other mechanisms for conservation covenants to be put in place, for example at the federal level.</para><para>Some marvellous work on using the tax system to encourage land conservation has been done by the CSIRO and others in the conservation movement. There are examples of how this has been done in the US and Europe to produce quite positive environmental benefits. I think Australia is lagging behind in that regard. There have been good proposals put forward by organisations such as the CSIRO about ways that we can expand on the fairly simple measure that is contained in this amendment, and on ways that we can move even further down the road of providing incentives for improving the conservation of our lands. This is a small measure, but I think potentially it is a very valuable one. I very much urge all senators, and in particular government senators, to take it seriously. As I said at the start, the immediate cost to the public purse would not be a major one, according to some of the work that has been done in this area by organisations such as the CSIRO, but the long-term economic and environmental benefit would be immense.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>11397</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Labor will be supporting the amendment moved and spoken to by Senator Bartlett and subsequent amendments that will come later. I attended the Senate committee hearings on this legislation, and it was obvious that there was a glaring omission from the philanthropic approach of the Prime Minister relating to the environment.</para></talk.start><para>The proposals that we are considering form at least part of an effective approach to conserving the Australian environment. From that point of view, we are happy to support the amendment that is currently being considered. I am disappointed that the Prime Minister, in his emphasis on philanthropy, appears to have a very narrow approach in his principles in this area. The environment is just not on the agenda, it appears. This is one glaring omission from the Prime Minister's approach. We are happy to support the initia 
 tive. I note that the CSIRO is one of the organisations proposing this approach. The CSIRO is an organisation of considerable standing—deservedly so—in the community, and it enjoys significant respect and support from the entire community.</para><para>There has been an argument about the cost. Obviously this will extend the cost, but this philanthropical theme that the Prime Minister is attempting to move the nation on was his idea. If the amendment that we will be moving later to reduce the allowable deduction to political parties is carried, we will actually be saving money, and that would go some way to offsetting the cost. Frankly, I think the environment is a more important priority than massive donations to political parties. Senator Bartlett makes the perfectly valid point that there may be some short-term direct costs that are measured on budget, but we have to look at the savings—particularly longer-term savings—to the environment and the total cost to the community, not just at the narrow costs that are measured on budget with savings to our environment, to the general economy and to our social structure as a whole. They are not easy to measure, but I think it is legitimate to point to that in this debate. For those reasons, Labor will be supporting the amendment that has been moved and the amendments that will be moved later with respect to this and other areas.</para><para>I have made these comments now because I do not want to waste the time of the Senate and repeat them when we get to the later amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>11397</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am delighted to hear that. I also congratulate Senator Hill for providing the opportunity for this legislation to be brought before the parliament. As he said, it is historic legislation. It is marvellous for the environment that we are seeing recognition of the patriotism of people who protect land, ecosystems, wildlife, vegetation, coastlines and desert that they own and want to see protected in perpetuity. They put covenants on the land or they donate it to organisations while they are alive, or they make provision in their wills to ensure that the land will be protected as part of the nation's heritage. As far as human- 
 built property is concerned, this has been in place for many years, but when it comes to the environment it has been missing. This is not so in the United States where, for decades, if you donated land which had environmental value, it was tax deductible. But we are catching up, and this legislation is going to be of very big benefit to Australia's environment.</para></talk.start><para>I was involved with the establishment of the Australian Bush Heritage Fund in 1990, and, although I am not directly involved with the organisation now, it has within the decade become one of the most powerful forces in Australia for protecting the environment. It has been able to purchase critically endangered blocks of land containing rare and endangered birds, animals, orchids, fish and trees from the Bega Valley—where only eight per cent of the original vegetation cover now exists—to Erith Island in Bass Strait, to rare coastal heathland in Tasmania and wildlife habitat in Western Australia and, more recently, to woodland in Queensland where, as we know, there is an utter disaster taking place at the moment. Hopefully, moves by the Queensland government to cut across that will be in place before Christmas.</para><para>So I congratulate the minister for the environment, Robert Hill. I am just sorry he is not here to hear me speaking these words—and the roof has not fallen in. I also congratulate the Democrats and the Labor Party for moving to make some obvious adjustments to the legislation which are going to be important to donors who are doing the right thing by this country.</para><para>The amendment that the Greens are moving in addition—and, I think, the Democrats as well—to ensure that tax deductibility of properties can be spread over five years by the donor, as happens with cultural properties, is a really good one. As it stands under this legislation, if you give <inline font-style="italic">Blue Poles</inline>, which was worth $1 million, to an Australian collection—and I am speaking theoretically; I know it has already been purchased and was not given—or you give a painting worth $1 million to a collection, you can spread your tax deductibility of that painting over five years. Under this legislation, if you give a 
 block of land which has rare and endangered species, water courses, lagoons and wildlife worth $1 million to a collection for permanent protection for this nation's heritage, you cannot do that. Quite clearly, it is very sensible that the donor ought to be afforded that tax deductibility and congratulated for their generosity. So congratulations all around. I feel that this is a marvellous change. It is encouraging rather than discouraging people who do the right thing by the environment.</para><para>Finally, let us look at what we have been debating in the last couple of days in this place. Just yesterday or the day before we were extending diesel fuel grants to people who get into bulldozers and drive through forests, knocking them down—in effect, a deductibility; an extension of largesse from the government. In a way, that this very positive moment for the environment has arrived makes me feel less bad that that legislation went through with only my dissent—with the support of the Democrats on that occasion, but it went through easily. Before I became a senator, I came to Canberra to lobby for this effect, and people had not even started thinking about it. But it is here now. It is excellent legislation. With the amendments it is going to be even better, and I want to congratulate all those involved.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>11398</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Leading up to Christmas, and with that famous story, I feel like Mr Scrooge here right now. It is so sad. I am very happy that Senator Brown is so happy and that Senator Hill has made him so happy. I am sure Senator Hill is sitting in his office sipping a cup of tea and is riveted to the monitor. He could even be clicked onto the Internet, but I do not think so—I do not think the honourable minister is an Internet clicker yet. I do not know whether Senator Brown is being slightly humorous or a little bit sarcastic or he did not hear Senator Hill correctly, but we are not supporting these amendments.</para></talk.start><para>The most interesting thing about the debate in the last few minutes is that it has been such a monument to the Labor Party's policy 
 problems. Less than an hour ago we were informed by a Labor adviser that the Labor Party were not supporting these amendments.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Sherry interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—We were. Obviously, we can have a debate about that, but the Labor Party advised us that they were not supporting these measures. We know as a matter of history—and Senator Brown would reinforce this—that throughout their 13 years in government they did not do this. I am sure former Senator Walsh and former Treasurer Keating probably would have argued with Senator Brown as to the cost of these things—and this is why I feel a bit like Senator Scrooge today. It would be lovely to make Senator Brown happy. We try to do that all the time—it is very hard—but it is nice to see that he has had this moment of happiness. But he should be happy about what Senator Hill said.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Sherry might have been busy at the time trying to find a policy—trying to grope around for something that they believe in. Senator Hill did come in here. He put on the record that the government is seriously considering this whole policy. Maybe that is what Senator Brown is happy about. I think this measure will get through. One hour and 15 minutes ago it would not have got through, but it looks like it is going to get through. This amendment has the numbers on the floor of the chamber. But the government has said that it will not support it. I make it clear now that we will not call divisions on these issues. As the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I personally regard calling divisions when it is quite clear what the vote is and when the parties have made clear their position a waste of debating time.</para><para>But I make it clear that the government is opposed to these measures for the reasons Senator Hill put down. We regard these as important ideas. We regard encouraging philanthropy in relation to giving land for conservation purposes as desirable. We think that can play an important part in a strategy to encourage private landowners to use their ownership and empower them to be part of the national conservation and environmental effort. I think Senator Brown and others 
 would recognise that this government has done more than any other government to encourage that in the past three years.</para><para>If Senator Bartlett and Senator Brown come to my great state of Western Australia, I encourage them—if they have not already done so—to go to Paruna Sanctuary, which is up in the Darling Range. It is an incredible private initiative, funded almost entirely out of the property of Martin Copley. I think he is actually a citizen of Great Britain. He is a great character who spends about half his time in Western Australia. He has created this fantastic sanctuary in the Darling Range—a phenomenal private initiative which has been facilitated by this government.</para><para>Senator Hill came in here today and said, as the minister responsible and therefore on behalf of the cabinet and the Prime Minister, that the government is more than sympathetic to these sorts of measures, has looked at the CSIRO work and other work that has been done in this area, and wants to put together an integrated package. So it is disingenuous of Senator Sherry to say that the Prime Minister is blind to this. The minister and the government have come in here and said, `We are going to bring'—to quote Senator Hill's words—`a serious consideration to an integrated policy package of which these sorts of measures could form part.'</para><para>These measures need to be costed. I guess when you are in opposition you can just say: `We didn't do this for 13 years when we were in government. We don't know how much it is going to cost.' I guess that is a continuation of Labor's policy when they were in government. They did not really care very much about what anything cost. The record of that was $10 billion deficits for nine out of their 13 years, high interest rates, high debt, high inflation, high unemployment. This is Senator Scrooge speaking, but you cannot just create any policy you want and ignore the cost, which is just what the Labor Party have done today. They have said, `We might pick up some money on political donations.'</para><para>The financial impact of the measures in this bill unamended is estimated to come to about $71 million in 2002-2003. We have no costings whatsoever on the amendment that is 
 about to be agreed to by the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party will not be able to get up and say that this will cost $71 million, $100 million or $200 million because they have no costings. They have decided at some stage in the past hour or so, `This is a nice idea. We have no idea how much it will cost. We might be able to claw back some of the cost if you agree to an amendment on political donations. But we do not really know how much it will cost.' There would have to be one hell of a lot of political donations in a year to claw back $71 million.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—The $71 million is your cost.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—The $71 million is the government's estimates, the Treasury's estimates and the tax office's estimates of the measures in this bill.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—That's right.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—Exactly.

You need to look at how you achieve the best outcome for the environment and conservation values within the limited financial resources of the Commonwealth. It was Senator Sherry who earlier said that tax 
 deductibility is an expense to the revenue and that he would like to know where the money is going. Even though the tax office and the previous government never did that when they were in government, the opposition think it is a good idea now. That is good. The opposition seem to be developing some sort of policy. It changes from hour to hour, but at least they are wrestling with the concept of a policy. They have stuck to their old policy of no fiscal restraint. They have said, `If it is a good idea, let's do it and hang the expense. We'll let the next generation pay. Put it on the Beazley bankcard or, if Mr Beazley is not the leader, Mr Crean's bankcard. Hang the expense.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>The issue I am responding to is Senator Sherry's point that the PM and government do not care about it. We do care about it. We have said we will develop an integrated policy approach and that this sort of mechanism will be part of it. Senator Brown should be rightly proud of the fact that it has made it onto the government's serious policy agenda. He will be upset that it will not get through now. The government is not going to agree to these measures. So the strong likelihood of the decision of the Senate to support these measures is that the whole bill will be set aside, which is not a threat or anything; that will be what happens. Senator Brown has been lobbying for this and dedicating himself to this sort of public policy measure at the Commonwealth level for a generation, for his whole time in this debate, so he should feel rightly proud that it has got to this stage. It is now under serious consideration by the minister for the environment and ultimately the government of Australia, as Senator Hill has indicated historically here today.</para><para>This measure is not going to make it today. It is not going to make it into public policy because we do not think the measures have had enough thorough consideration, costing and analysing. Is this the best way to use the Commonwealth's resources? What if this does cost a quarter of a billion dollars, hypothetically? Is that the best way to spend a quarter of a billion dollars? How do you ensure that property owners are best encouraged by the taxation law to gift properties? What balance 
 is there in the use of covenants? What about the life tenancy issue? How do you do this? How do you find the best policy balance?</para><para>We do not think the approach that is taken today on the floor of the Senate is the right one. It could be a perfect approach, but we want to do it in a considered manner. Ultimately we will bring forward a policy. Ultimately it will have the scrutiny of a Senate committee, no doubt. Ultimately, it will be put into a package of legislation if that policy receives the assent. So I will not add to the debate. I am certainly the last person who would seek to extend this debate. But it is very important that people understand where the government is coming from. Certainly Senator Brown seemed to be under some illusion that the government may be supporting this amendment today. We are not.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>11401</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not surprised at the contribution we have just heard.

If that is a valid argument—and I do not believe it is because, as I pointed out, CSIRO says $2 million to $4 million—how on earth has the government costed the contents of the rest of this package and what sort of assumptions has it made? It is not a valid argument from Senator Campbell.</para><para>The points I have made still stand. The CSIRO have given us a costing. This was a glaring omission from the philanthropic approach of the Prime Minister as contained in this legislation. Senator Campbell has as much admitted that by acknowledging that the government will be looking at something like this at some future date. Senator Hill has come in and said that the government will be looking at it. Why didn't they look at it in 
 this particular piece of legislation? So we do not see any particular problem in supporting this at this point in time. We will be moving an amendment to reduce the tax deductibility of moneys to political parties. I did not say that it would save $71 million. I said there would be some saving that certainly would be some offset for the cost of the measure that is being supported and appears likely to pass here.</para><para>Finally, I want to make a comment about our advisers. I have spoken to both our advisers—very trusty, reliable, knowledgeable individuals. Neither of them indicated that we would be opposing this. We only got the final amendments halfway through the debate so I do not know where that information has come from. I think it is inappropriate to refer to private conversations with advisers. It is inappropriate and it should not happen. The conversation, as I am informed, did not occur. Again, I think that was an inappropriate comment and, frankly, irrelevant to the debate.</para><para>I am pleased that the non-government parties have been able to correct a very obvious defect in the Prime Minister's philanthropic approach. If it is good enough for health, it is good enough for education, it is good enough for a range of philanthropic endeavours in this country, and it is good enough for the environment. On behalf of the Labor opposition, as I have said, we will be supporting these amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>11401</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In response, I wish to make a change to the amendments I have moved.

Firstly, in terms of costs, I do not think the Democrats or the Senate are ignoring the costs. My understanding is that the CSIRO have done some costings of measures such as these and indicated they will cost only $2 million or $3 million per year. The government, as I am sure they would agree, have the resources to cost measures such as these and, given that these measures are going to pass through the Senate, I hope that they will use those resources to cost them themselves. Maybe they can do it more accurately.</para><para>I come back to the point that I hope, when they do those costings, they will add in the future savings—even purely in dollars and cents terms, let alone in terms of environmental benefits—of the improvement in land conservation that will occur as a consequence. I can outline lots of the costs of what we are spending now every day to fix up salination, deforestation, erosion and many other consequences of land clearing, and they are well and truly above whatever the immediate cost to the revenue might be from these measures. Whatever costing the government might say these measures have, I can guarantee that the savings as a result will far outweigh them.</para><para>The government also indicated it is better to do these sorts of things as an integrated package. I welcome Senator Hill's indication that the government is looking at doing that and moving that way. I think all people will understand that it is not necessarily the best approach always for everyone just to sit back and wait for the government to deliver on things it is going to do. I should perhaps remind the government that the Senate has a duty and a legislative role in terms of law making in this country. The government can put forward proposed legislation, as they have done, and it is for the Senate to consider that legislation and to amend it or to add in improvements. That is quite a legitimate part 
 of what the Senate is able to do. It is not something that government should attack as inappropriate. It should not be suggested that we should just sit back and wait for the government to deliver an integrated package once they have developed it.</para><para>These are self-contained, clear-cut amendments. They do not preclude the government developing a package of other measures down the line. Hopefully they will be an incentive for them to build a broader package of measures, but to suggest that we should just wait for the government to act is, I think, misreading and misunderstanding the actual role of the Senate as a law making body. Also, I think it is expecting rather too much in terms of the faith we are expected to put in the government to deliver on things. We have delivered amendments here; we believe they are good ones. We believe that whatever costs there are to them will be far outweighed by savings in the future. I urge the government to take that on board when they are considering this legislation as it is finally amended.</para><para>Consideration interrupted; progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title><type>Matters of Public Interest</type><page.no>11402</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Chapman)</name></talker><para>—Order!

That decision was taken after I had provided 
 a comprehensive statement which they discussed. Following that, the state council also resolved that the matter should not proceed.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> article was written by a journalist called Anne Burns and is about Noel Crichton-Browne and me. It was almost entirely incorrect in every way. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> article by Roger Martin implied that I was being criticised for not saying anything. I stress that I have not spoken to either journalist for the sake of the Liberal Party. However, I am now compelled to come into the Senate.</para><para>Crichton-Browne has now mailed the Burns article across Western Australia because it is highly favourable to him and critical of me. The point needs to be made that Anne Burns has a very close personal relationship with Crichton-Browne. I do not have the luxury of such a compliant journalist. I have, therefore, after 14 months of silence, resorted to the Senate.</para><para>I wish to set the record straight on the many statements and allegations contained in the article. It, like so many other articles written by Burns, claims that I have apologised for alleging that Crichton-Browne has made death threats against me. I have not. I have apologised for, and I quote from the apology:</para><para>. . . statements that I had made to various individuals and on radio during 1995 [that] have been construed by some—</para><para>et cetera. There is no person I have spoken to or interview I have done that says anything other than the fact that I sought police advice on security matters following unidentified phone calls in the middle of the night that contained threats. I said to the police that I did not know the origin of the calls but that, given what had been going on in the party at the time, I wanted to know how best I could ensure my safety.</para><para>I at no stage requested police protection, which has been a further claim of Burns. I was also never given it. The article claims that I:</para><para>. . . narrowly escaped expulsion from the Party over the affair when the majority verdict of a discipline committee inquiry found her guilty of four charges of conduct prejudicial to the Liberal Party. 
</para><para>That is plainly wrong. This so-called report was put together by two people, George Cash and Julie Debnam, who are two members of what once was a seven-member committee. The article says that there were originally six members. Wrong again.</para><para>It needs to be noted that one person was removed from the committee, Ric Mincherton, because he was a witness for Crichton-Browne in his case against me by making allegations against me that were simply not true. Julie Debnam is one of the complainants, but she too remained. Two other decent people resigned from the committee when they discovered that it was a witch-hunt to get me. Immediately they resigned, it was clear that the committee was nothing more than a kangaroo court. Last June, when the chairman tried to bring the matter to a conclusion some eight months or so after the matter had started, the remaining members removed a quorum by walking out of the meeting. The chairman then resigned.</para><para>This left three members, but only two of those three—Cash and Debnam—put together a so-called report recommending my expulsion. By this stage, the committee had no chairman and no quorum, but these two still tried to get their fake report accepted by the party. The party refused. As distribution of this document was highly restricted, one has to ask who gave a copy of the report to Crichton-Browne. I am told that he then went to state parliament and shopped it around to get someone to table it in the parliament. He was successful. A former member of the Labor Party, Mark Nevill, obliged.</para><para>Crichton-Browne then distributed this fake report to virtually all senators and members and very widely across Western Australia. He knew that the so-called report had no standing, but that did not stop him. According to the article, Mr Nevill went on to accuse David Johnston, the president of the party, of `nobbling the committee'. How preposterous! David Johnston is a lawyer and a well-respected person who as president has simply sought to have this matter finalised appropriately. He too is now being vilified by Crichton-Browne and his supporters.</para><para>The article claims that Crichton-Browne's destruction came about because:</para><para>. . . he led rebel coalition senators across the floor to vote against then Treasurer John Howard's retrospective legislation to outlaw bottom of the harbour tax schemes.</para><para>What nonsense! He made himself irrelevant because all he ever did was stack branches with the expectation that everyone else should do the same. Burns claims that I:</para><para>. . . had already fallen out with him over her performance as a WA senator.</para><para>I had certainly fallen out with him, but, as so many people who know Crichton-Browne would attest, it was because I would not spend my time stacking branches at his direction. I told him that I wanted to do my parliamentary duties and that I did not have the time to do his bidding.</para><para>If my so-called performance was so bad, why then was I serving as deputy whip in the Senate? Why have I chaired, by prime ministerial appointment, deputy chaired or participated in so many inquiries into policy matters on issues ranging from taxation to social security, health, aged care, child care, education and so much more? Additionally, if my performance had been in question, why was I was preselected to the No. 1 position on the Senate ticket in 1992 at the height of Crichton-Browne's political attack against me?</para><para>The article claims that I told Mincherton that I:</para><para>. . . had received death threats from Crichton-Browne at her homes in Perth and Canberra and was under police protection.</para><para>All I can say to that is that Mincherton is totally dishonest and manipulative and well known for it in the party in Western Australia. His bias against me is unquestioned.</para><para>As for the role of Mr McGinty and Mr Kobelke, two state Labor members of parliament, their claims are pure politicking of the highest order. I unequivocally stand by my claim that I telephoned Mr McGinty and asked him not to ask any question about me as the question that he was proposing to ask was factually incorrect by mentioning death threats and police protection. He said that he wanted to run the question in an effort to 
 embarrass the Premier and that he was not going to identify me. I said that he had to be joking when he said that he would not identify me because the question even had a reference to my dog. He was determined to run the question, but I begged him not to. The rest is history. He and Kobelke have continued to try to damage me and the Liberal Party ever since in relation to this matter.</para><para>Burns claims that the committee found that I had:</para><para>. . . conspired with Mr McGinty and had misled the party's Senate pre-selection committee.</para><para>Wrong. I have never conspired with Mr McGinty or anyone else in the Labor Party and I told the preselection committee precisely what happened. The article claims, `She did not lodge a defence,' referring of course to me. This suggests that I did not prepare one. Wrong again. My defence was presented to Crichton-Browne and he immediately sought to have the matter settled because he did not wish to have it made public.</para><para>My defence details the shocking treatment that I have had to endure from Crichton-Browne over many years. It contains many credible witnesses who were witness to his behaviour against me. I have resisted coming into the Senate over the last year and tabling it for all to see. This could have been done with complete immunity. The only reason I have not is to protect his former wife and children. However, if I have to endure much more harassment from this man, I will be left with no alternative but to table that document along with a copy of his statement of claim so that the facts will be there for all to see.</para><para>Crichton-Browne obviously gave a copy of my defence to the solicitor, Jack Courtis, who is supposedly acting for the division and branch that laid the complaints against me. I am aware that Crichton-Browne was most annoyed that Courtis had passed the defence to the committee sitting in judgment on me. The committee members read it. When Crichton-Browne was informed of this, he immediately issued instructions for it to be withdrawn from the committee. That leads me to another question: why is it that Crichton-Browne is running the case against me by instructing the prosecuting solicitor instead of 
 the complainants? I believe that to be a serious abuse of due process by him exercising complete influence over the deliberations and direction of the committee. I have asked the complainants to sign statutory declarations stating that they, and only they, have instructed Courtis and paid for his services. No such declaration has been forthcoming.</para><para>The question of funding for the case against me is an interesting one because the division and branch that laid the complaints have to declare any such funding to the Australian Electoral Commission. They have a duty of disclosure. If, by any chance, the solicitor is not charging for his time, then he too has a duty of disclosure to the Australian Electoral Commission.</para><para>Burns claims that I did not appear before the party's state council:</para><para>. . . despite a request from Premier Richard Court to give an explanation to the party.</para><para>Wrong. No such request has ever been made to me by the Premier verbally or in writing. He is too interested and involved in running the state and winning the next election.</para><para>Interestingly, this article does not even make an attempt to be balanced. While there is a cursory mention of Crichton-Browne's record of domestic violence, why was there no mention of him being a convicted criminal for fraud against the taxpayer? Burns clearly allowed her relationship with Crichton-Browne to influence the way in which she wrote the article. While she states that I refused to be interviewed for the article—that is true—I did provide her with a written statement which carried a rider stating that it was not to be printed in part without my prior written approval. What did she do? She printed the statement in part without my approval. </para><para>I now come to the newly constituted committee. It has, as three of its members, Mincherton, who is a proactive agitator against me and who was removed from the previous committee; and Cash and Debnam, both of whom wrote the fake report recommending my expulsion. I have appealed that these three members cannot be deemed to be unbiased in their consideration of my case, but they have chosen to remain on the com 
 mittee. One can hardly wonder what conclusion they will draw this time. I am in a situation where I have witnesses sitting in judgment against me.</para><para>Many supporters have asked why I paid $20,000 to Crichton-Browne and have made the observation that doing so gave the appearance of guilt. To that I would say two things. Firstly, given my time again, I would do no such thing. Secondly, I wish to make it crystal clear that I have not pleaded guilty to anything; a casual observation of the events will illustrate that. Crichton-Browne commenced proceedings against me seeking damages and costs. He received no payment for damages and a meagre contribution towards his costs in comparison to what he sought. Once he saw my defence he did not wish to have it made public. He knew it was true. As a consequence he did not wish the matter to proceed to court, where witnesses to his behaviour and attitude toward me would be called to give evidence.</para><para>I most reluctantly agreed to the payment of a contribution towards his costs in an effort, which has clearly proven to be futile, to protect the Liberal Party and to stop his 11-year harassment of me. I wanted to draw a line in the sand and get on with my life and my work without his constant harassment. He and his mates will obviously not allow that. That is why I wish I had my time over again, because I would never make such a judgment.</para><para>The next question that I am asked is: why did I apologise? I already covered this earlier when I mentioned the exact words of the apology. The other question is: why were the terms of settlement not made public until after the 3 October election last year? The answer is that that is what Crichton-Browne agreed to. It is worth also noting that, whenever Crichton-Browne or Burns have referred to various interviews I did that form the basis of his action against me, there have never been full transcripts quoted. When one looks at the full interviews, as I have detailed in my defence, they clearly give a different view.</para><para>The time for me to explain in detail the level and extent of harassment and abuse I have had to endure is just not available. As I said before, that is contained in my defence 
 and will be tabled in the Senate if this harassment continues. Had Crichton-Browne been prepared, as I was, to finalise the whole matter and get on with his life, then I would not have had to take this step. I am enormously grateful for the ongoing support of the Prime Minister; my leader and deputy leader in the Senate, Senator Hill and Senator Alston; my parliamentary colleagues; my staff; members of the Liberal Party; and friends and family. To them I say thank you.</para><para>I will, despite all of Crichton-Browne's efforts, continue to work hard for the people of Western Australia as a senator and to provide Western Australia with strong representation.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Audit</title><page.no>11406</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>11406</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—According to its annual report, the Australian National Audit Office seeks to add value to public sector performance and accountability through the provision of objective, professional and independent auditor advice. The ANAO rightly identifies the parliament as its principal client. One of the key roles of the Audit Office is to undertake performance audits by examining the utilisation of resources, information systems, performance measures, monitoring systems and legal compliance. This is important work. It ensures that the parliament and the Australian taxpayers can see if public money is being properly expended and public services are being provided in an efficient manner. However, when the Public Service is in delivery of a safe and efficient air transport system, the need for a first-class performance from the responsible agencies is not important, it is essential. Anything less potentially puts lives at risk.</para></talk.start><para>For that reason, Audit Report No. 19, tabled at the end of last month—the performance audit of the aviation safety compliance division of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority—was both an important and a disturbing document. The Audit Office investigation found an absence of quality management in the performance of CASA's safety compliance functions. There was a lack of consistent adherence to safety procedures that put at risk 
 both CASA's effectiveness and the resulting public confidence and assurance.</para><para>I was further disturbed by the answers, or indeed lack of answers, I received from CASA during the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport estimates hearings last Wednesday. I asked a series of questions about the training and checking of pilots. Although I am interested in the processes used in training and checking all pilots who operate aircraft carrying fare-paying passengers, my questions went specifically to the checking and training of pilots employed by Qantas.</para><para>I asked the Director of Aviation Safety, Mr Mick Toller, about the checking of simulators in which pilots of high performance aircraft train. I understood that these simulators had to be checked every 120 days in line with Civil Aviation Order 45.0. Mr Toller said the checking of simulators varied, and I look forward to a more complete answer from him on that point in due course.</para><para>I also asked whether pilots were checked twice a year in line with the Civil Aviation regulation 217. Mr Toller confirmed that that was the case although he said the period was more likely to be 13 months than 12. Mr Toller also confirmed that pilots must be checked on-line or actually operating an aircraft in service once a year. Mr Toller told me that the job of CASA was to check the Qantas pilots who ensure that their colleagues are up to the mark. He said CASA checked the check captains to `ensure that they operate the system to a satisfactory standard'. Mr Toller said that normally an airline would develop a check and training program for its pilots in consultation with air safety authority—in this case, CASA. He said that the program must contain performance targets and CASA audits the airline's performance against these targets.</para><para>I asked Mr Toller whether the results of such checks would be held by CASA. I wanted to know whether CASA could at any time tell whether an airline, in this case Qantas, was meeting those benchmarks. Mr Toller responded by saying:</para><para>That would certainly be on file. 
</para><para>I then asked whether it would be possible to supply that information to the committee, to which Mr Toller replied that it certainly would. I asked Mr Toller about the establishment within Qantas of a special unit to undertake pilot checking and training. Mr Toller said that internationally airlines are encouraged to set up operational quality programs and that system is then checked by the safety authority. I asked if any changes were made to this system, like the abolition of this special unit within Qantas, and whether those changes would be monitored and recorded by CASA. He said:</para><para>They most certainly should be.</para><para>He qualified this by saying he was not aware that this unit had been disbanded. He said that if there was change, which was little more than a name change, there would be no need to notify the authority. But he said that such a unit would need to be separate from the operational side that it was auditing, and that makes a lot of sense.</para><para>Mr Toller said if there were new arrangements at Qantas, he was not aware of them and that was why he had called for a special report on the relationship between that airline and CASA. I then asked CASA whether the Qantas testing pilots—that is, the pilots that CASA checks—were in compliance with the conditions of their licences. Mr Toller then said:</para><para>I do not know.</para><para>I was not surprised that Mr Toller could not answer that question on the spot. However, it was asked one week ago and has still not been answered. It should have been dealt with as a matter of urgency.</para><para>I then asked whether, if Qantas check pilots were not in compliance with the conditions of their licence, they would be prevented from undertaking any testing until they met those conditions. Mr Toller replied:</para><para>That is correct.</para><para>Mr Toller said that CASA would not necessarily know whether all Qantas pilots were properly licensed. He said the authority would to a large extent rely on Qantas for that sort of information. This contradicts his earlier evidence that CASA checks the checkers. Mr 
 Toller agreed that if there were unqualified Qantas checking pilots approving their colleagues to operate aircraft, all those pilots' qualifications would be invalid. He said they would all have to be retested and they could not operate aircraft until they were.</para><para>I now have a copy of the terms of reference, protocols and topics for discussion that will provide the basis for the inquiry Mr Toller has launched into the relationship between Qantas and CASA. While the terms of reference appear sound, the matters addressed under the heading `Topics for discussion' are disturbing to say the least. If the questions on this list are read in conjunction with both the findings of the Auditor-General in relation to air safety compliance and the evidence from CASA at last week's committee hearings, it appears that the administration of aviation safety has all but collapsed.</para><para>The terms of reference are: Review of exchanges between CASA and Qantas over the last 12 months; looking at operating procedures, training programs (flight and cabin crew), human factor issues, long haul landing recency and flight time limitations; report on matters where CASA or Qantas appear not to have acted appropriately or in the best interests of safety; identify CASA regulatory procedures that could be improved.</para><para>However, as I said, the issues raised under the topics for discussion heading cause me some concern. I hope the minister might be able to provide me with an explanation as soon as possible. Point 4 of this list states in part:</para><para>Outline of the surveillance program during 1998.</para><para>I would have thought that that program would be well documented and well known both to Qantas and CASA. Under the same point, the brief asks:</para><para>Was a comprehensive program provided?</para><para>I am concerned that there is a need to ask such a question. The existence of such a program is fundamental to the whole surveillance system. I would therefore hope that a comprehensive program developed by Qantas and approved by CASA is in place.</para><para>Point 6 of the document I have referred to asks:</para><para>What is the process for approving check captains within Qantas and is that process satisfactory?</para><para>I had assumed that this process would have been clearly defined and in a comprehensive surveillance program agreed between the airline and CASA. It would be disturbing if that was not the case.</para><para>Point 7 of the brief asks:</para><para>How is cabin crew training monitored?</para><para>I understand the monitoring of cabin crew is not discretionary, as this question suggests, but is specified in civil aviation regulations.</para><para>I go on to point 8 of the document, which asks:</para><para>Has the company submitted a compliance statement?</para><para>I assume that that question relates to the lodgement of a compliance statement as part of an application for the issuing or reissuing of an air operating certificate. I understand that licences are generally issued for 12 months, though, according to the recent Auditor-General's report on safety compliance, CASA is considering renewing licences for up to 36 months, and compliance statements go to the regulatory regime in which airlines must operate exactly to cover the regulatory conditions imposed on them by this regime and in doing so meet the conditions of their licence. I cannot understand why there would be a need to survey CASA officers and Qantas employees to establish whether such a statement has been lodged. I would have thought that the assistant director, aviation safety compliance, would be able to say in a flash whether the largest airline in the country had lodged such a statement.</para><para>Nor should it be at all difficult to determine whether Qantas meets the conditions of its licence, as would be detailed in a compliance statement, if I understand the term correctly. Point nine asks:</para><para>How often does CASA undertake a flight simulator fidelity check?</para><para>Again this should be a matter of fact, not a matter of discretion on the part of officers undertaking this work. Point 10 of the document asks:</para><para>how are changes to the QANTAS training and Checking manual approved?</para><para>and:</para><para>How are changes to syllabuses of training approved?</para><para>and:</para><para>have there been any significant changes in the past twelve months?</para><para>I understand that such changes have to be formally signed off by the Director of Air Safety, Mr Toller. If that is correct, if Mr Toller has not signed them off, they have not been approved. Again this is or should be a statement of fact. I would hope that the minister might clarify the status of the document and the basis on which these questions have been formulated.</para><para>Page 99 of Audit Report No. 19 advises that in 1997-1998 only 28 per cent and 45 per cent of CASA's planned flying operations surveillance activities were completed respectively for the two major operators. The two operators are not identified in the report. Perhaps the minister might also be able to advise me whether, in fact, that data relates to Qantas and Ansett. Further, the report states that between July 1998 and February 1999 planned flying operations surveillance was only 29 per cent and 14 per cent of the previous year's surveillance for the two operators. I understand that to mean 29 per cent of 28 per cent of the target and 14 per cent of 45 per cent of the target. Despite this reduction in planned surveillance to February 1999, only 21 per cent and 37 per cent of planned flying operations surveillance was achieved for these two operators respectively.</para><para>I am advised that the second period, that is July 1998 to February this year, was to enable CASA to get all the relevant data lodged for that period. CASA has argued that the introduction of a new audit system led to a reduction in the surveillance effort, and that is no excuse.</para><para>This data relates to planned surveillance by CASA. This is not about good operators needing less scrutiny. It relates to the surveillance targets CASA sets itself. For the Senate and the travelling public to be satisfied that the aviation system in this country is being properly scrutinised requires someone to take 
 control of the administration of aviation safety in Australia. In this case, that someone must be the Minister for Transport and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tibet: Imprisonment of Monks and Nuns</title><page.no>11409</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>11409</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have with me a report on my visit to Tibet in July and then to Tibetan refugee establishments in Nepal and India last month. I will ask the Senate's permission to table this report later in the day when members have had an opportunity to look at it.</para></talk.start><para>We in Australia are in an ideal position to do something about the plight of six million Tibetans who are in the world's largest militarised colony. Tibet was invaded in the 1950s by the People's Liberation Army of China and it has been under the yoke of Beijing ever since, with a massive abrogation of civil rights involved. More than one million Tibetans have died as a result of that oppression. The oppression, while much more finetuned by Beijing these days, continues.</para><para>In Lhasa, more than 1,000 monks and nuns are in prison as we are here today. These are young men and women who have done nothing violent, who would never have been arrested in Australia, who have simply called either for the freedom of their country or for the return of their spiritual and political leader, the Dalai Lama, from exile in India to Lhasa.</para><para>A third category of default which ends up putting monks and nuns into jail is a refusal to sign a denunciation of the Dalai Lama in whichever nunnery or monastery they may be. The secret police are in these monasteries at the moment and re-education programs were taking place while I was in Tibet. It needs to be noted that great monasteries like Sera and Drephung in the northern outskirts of Lhasa, which I visited, had 10,000 monks each in 1959 when the Chinese Liberation Army, so-called, arrived. The complement in each place can now be numbered between 100 and 300. The 20,000 people who have been evicted have been evicted against their will and in appalling circumstances and, as I said, a number of them are in jail where torture has been the order of the day.</para><para>I will not go into the details, but it is extraordinarily degrading to the men and women, these youngsters, who have a religious avocation to find themselves in that circumstance simply for trying to maintain what they see as the truth. The fact is if the secret police arrive and say, `Write a denunciation of the Dalai Lama' and they refuse to and do not sign it they are, as a minimum penalty, evicted from the premises and as a maximum end up in jail. On the plight of nuns—and I have got this in the report—the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in India quotes:</para><para>Tibetan women have been subject to brutal repression following the severe religious crackdown launched in 1996 and 137 nuns are known to have been expelled from the nunneries. Tibetan women, often nuns, continue to be arrested arbitrarily and subjected to ill-treatment and torture while in prison. Of 1,216 known current political prisoners, 295 are women and 11 female political prisoners are serving more than 10 years. One woman, three months and 17 days pregnant, was kept standing in a cold room for 14 hours in a row the night of her arrest while being interrogated. She told her interrogators that she was pregnant and feeling weak. However, the pleas were ignored and the questions continued. She miscarried her child in the prison toilets shortly afterwards. Ngawang Sangdrol, a Gari nun—</para><para>Gari is a nunnery in the hills about three-quarters of an hour drive north-west of the centre of Lhasa. While I did not go into the nunnery for fear of reprisals after my visit, I saw the nunnery from the parking lot down in front of it. This nun—</para><para>is serving an 18-year sentence, the longest known sentence of any political female prisoner in Tibet.</para><para>This is the Centre for Human Rights reporting. Since this report and since my visit to Tibet, her sentence has been extended to 21 years. It continues:</para><para>Originally she was arrested for taking part in a pro-independence demonstration. She and 13 other nuns had their sentences extended after recording pro-independence songs in prison—</para><para>for singing about their country in prison—</para><para>In March 1996,  Ngawang Sangdrol was amongst a number of female prisoners who refused to tidy her cell, apparently as a protest against the Panchen Lama re-education program being conducted in the prison—  
</para><para>that is, a requirement that the nuns denounce the true Panchen Lama, the second most important religious figure in Tibet.</para><para>They also refused to stand up on one occasion when a Chinese official entered the room. She was sent to stand in the rain as punishment and Ngawang Sangdrol called out, "Free Tibet".</para><para>For that patriotic defiance her sentence was extended for a further three years and as I have said it has gone to 21 years. Here is an extraordinary person. Here is a remarkable woman. I will not go into the details of the other treatments given to female prisoners in these jails, but it is horrific.</para><para>In other circumstances in other countries, this woman would be getting national awards and accolades. But, instead, the world has turned its back on her, her fellow prisoners and her country, and is lined up to fete Chinese leaders, both inside and outside China. I met the ambassador, Richard Smith, in Beijing after my visit to Tibet, and we talked about his visit to Drachi prison, where, indeed, the nun I have just spoken about languishes today. He took tea in the garden with the criminal—that is, the governor of the prison; it is the innocents on the other side of the wall. But the world prefers not to look at this.</para><para>I get the Chinese literature on Tibet, including a glossy journal called <inline font-style="italic">China's Tibet</inline>. It is full of up-beat stories about economic advancement. The point the Dalai Lama has made is that the economic inflow of money to Tibet is nowhere like the outflow through the resources, the forests, the mines, the hydro-electricity that is being drained out of Tibet. But all that aside, we, as parliamentarians, have an obligation to at least know about Tibet. It is the world's biggest military-occupied country and, extraordinarily, it is occupied by a communist regime. It is the West that succours the communist regime in Beijing and ignores the theistic and now democratically elected in-exile regime of the Tibetans.</para><para>I spoke to the Chinese ambassador yesterday, and I thank him for his visit because we had a good exchange. He used the fact that countries around the world do not oppose the Chinese occupation of Tibet and, in fact, 
 recognise that Tibet is part of China, but that is not the case.</para><para>As I said to the ambassador, the independence or otherwise of Tibet is in the hearts of the Tibetans. I laud the extraordinary bravery of those young people who, seeing a westerner standing in a temple or in a street in Lhasa, spoke to me in their halting English and told me consistently two things: we want our country's freedom and we want the Dalai Lama to return to Lhasa.</para><para>I have asked the ambassador whether he would arrange for a trip back to Tibet for me to see the country through the eyes of China. That is not a difficult thing because nearly every other MP who goes to Tibet must fulfil certain obligations, which involve China being the tour guide. I hope that opportunity arises because I do not seek, and have not sought, to be one eyed about this. I have to report to the Senate that I find the plight of the Tibetans an extraordinary blot on the civilised thinking and actions of the global community at the end of this century.</para><para>I went to Nepal and India and visited refugee camps and was amazed to find, among other things, that the flow of refugees south over the Himalayas is increasing. It will be up to 4,000 this year. These people, who are supposed to love the motherland of China but are walking out on it from their own country, do not do so at the drop of a hat. They are not allowed passports. So much for citizenship of China. They cannot leave with a valid passport.</para><para>When they do go to Nepal they choose winter, because that is when the raging rivers coming down out of the Himalayas are frozen and they can walk across them. There are three major passes they use to cross the Himalayas; one is near Mount Everest. They climb through the snows in winter. I ran into a young man in Kathmandu who is now learning how to paint traditional Tibetan art—something he did not have access to in his own country—and he lost both his legs to frostbite. He was caught in a blizzard in the pass. His four companions lost their lives. Yet the government in this country does not recognise people from Tibet as refugees because that might upset Beijing.</para><para>I saw in Nepal and India the hundreds of children who are being smuggled out of Tibet. Their parents want them to have a Tibetan education; indeed, they want them to have some form of education. Time and again I ran into young girls, 16 and 17, who had never been to school in Tibet. Why not? Among other reasons, one has to pay a fee to go to school—up-front fees in a communist country, if you do not mind! Those who cannot pay the fees are the poorest. Who are the poorest in their own country? It is the Tibetans. Who comes last on the opportunity list? I guess it is the girls. But to see the happiness of these youngsters, having got out of the country, is extraordinary, because at last they have an opportunity in life, and their parents are having them smuggled out. </para><para>One 16-year-old girl said, `I was with my brothers and two monks came along and said, "Go and go now." I did. I did not even have time to go home and tell my mum and dad and here I am, I do not know what mum and dad think. I do not know whether they know I am here, but I am here now to get my Tibetan education.' She had to decide whether she would go into the usual education stream, or become a nun herself. She has the opportunity to do that now. She effectively had no such opportunity and no schooling under the Chinese regime. There are thousands of such youngsters in Nepal and India.</para><para>A word needs to be said, because there have been tough times in the past, for the growing attitude of assistance by the Nepali government, as well as by the Indian government in these circumstances. I was able, through the good offices of our ambassador in Kathmandu, to meet the Nepali Minister for Home Affairs to try to get the thousands of Tibetans in Nepal travel documents, so they can go to countries like Germany and Britain—travel documents like those afforded to Tibetan refugees in India. He gave me a good hearing. This is good for business for Nepal as well, because the Tibetans make carpets and export them to the West, but the business people in Nepal have great difficulty getting out to make the deals which will allow this industry to bring an income to the Tibetan community.</para><para>Finally, Tibet will be an item on the agenda while I am in this parliament. I use this opportunity to ask the government, our government, to play a much more prominent role in the interests of Tibet and Tibetans and their thirst for freedom in the future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Australia: Development </title><page.no>11411</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>11411</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is a certain sense of occasion in speaking on a matter of importance in the national parliament's final sitting week of the twentieth century—in fact, the final sitting week of the millennium. The cusp of the new millennium is about as auspicious an occasion as you could want to reflect on our nation's achievements of the past and the challenges of the future. It has been a momentous century for this nation, commencing with the birth of federation. It has seen us commit our troops during two world wars and in other regional conflicts, including Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf.</para></talk.start><para>Our troops have defended our freedoms and defended those unable to help themselves, such as in the current deployment of Australian troops in East Timor. These encounters have undeniably defined our national identity. We are proud of the Anzac spirit, a spirit characterised by bravery, loyalty and mateship. This is the spirit by which Australian men and women have shed their blood to protect the country they love—Australia—and their fellow Australians. It is a spirit which saw a lone soldier, Private Simpson, and his donkey braving enemy fire to rescue wounded mates in that fateful Gallipoli landing. There is also the great sporting tradition that has developed over the years. Over the past century, Australia has produced superb sports men and women, and I am sure that this prowess will be evident in the year 2000 at the Sydney Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games.</para><para>Australia has also been shaped this century by the patterns of migration that have come to our shores. Australia has been a great migrant nation, advantaged by the intake of skill, labour and social diversity. Whether in the days of the gold rushes or Queensland 
 cane growing, or our more recent past in the 1950s that gave us the mighty Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme, migration has shaped our multicultural character. The question, however, remains as to what level of immigration is in the national interest. Our population is unlikely to grow sufficiently without immigration to take advantage of global and regional opportunities, nor will it be conducive to maintaining our national security. We do need to look to a pattern of migration over the next decades that will foster properly thought-out national goals.</para><para>However, perhaps the most enduring symbol of our nation is the Australian bush. For more than 150 years, Australia has ridden on the sheep's back. The bush has provided Australia with a wealth of verse, culture, inventions and history. Bush legends have permeated Australia's identity and Australians relate to these whether they are based in the city or the outback. The bush legend and notions of the bushie with his swag are part of Australia's psyche. It is part of what Australia is today. The bush spirit is the Australian spirit.</para><para>Australia has reached the end of this century in good shape. We can be justifiably proud of our secure democracy, tolerant society and vibrant economy. But along with our prosperity and progress is the growing realisation that not all Australians have shared equally in this good fortune. As a nation, perhaps the greatest challenge we face is to bridge the gap between those who prosper and those who have missed out. Nowhere is this need more pressing than in parts of rural and regional Australia.</para><para>I have spoken often this year on issues relating to rural and regional Australia in this chamber. The themes have varied from youth unemployment to regional development and living standards in rural and regional Australia, policy positions that impact on the bush such as national competition policy, and the impact of agencies seemingly beyond the control of government such as the World Trade Organisation. These speeches have reflected journeys that I have taken within my home state of New South Wales to go to the 
 people most affected and discuss the issues with them.</para><para>This past decade has seen the divide between the city and the bush widen to a chasm. Not only is it a divide between city and country, but also between inland and coastal areas, between the sun belt and the rural belt and between large and small regional centres. In short, it is between those who have prospered and those who have missed out on the benefits of massive technological change and deregulation.</para><para>The impact on the bush has been characterised by political protest and socioeconomic dislocation. The trend for Australia to become two nations flies in the face of our egalitarian spirit. It is simply unAustralian to tolerate the alienation of some Australians from others. The volatility of rural and regional Australia is deeply troubling. It has exercised a great deal of my time and attention this year in my `Senate Goes Bush' series of visits to rural and regional Australia. These visits reflect my belief that we do need to go bush if we are to really know the hardships and, indeed, the strengths of rural and regional Australia and if we are to have any hope of reconnecting with country Australia.</para><para>In each place I visited it was clear that the people of rural and regional Australia have been doing it tough. As recent election results attest, they also feel disillusioned and disaffected with the political processes that impact upon their daily lives. Parts of rural and regional Australia have been hurting. Not only have the regions been fighting drought and shifts in population, but the regions face trying to overcome the tyranny of distance when accessing services that those in the city take for granted.</para><para>However, it has become abundantly clear to me that rural and regional Australia does have the capacity to regenerate itself so long as the conditions are right. Part of the reconnecting process is that the government is addressing the sectoral needs of regional Australia. A suite of programs is designed to turn around the geographical disadvantage in this vast land. There are no quick fixes, but sustained effort, understanding and increased expenditure are helping to address the balance.</para><para>Bridging the gap between the haves and the have-nots may well be the most important policy challenge we face. Any regeneration and development of rural and regional Australia must also grapple with the kind of framework that best suits the purpose. Despite the splendid initiative of the Regional Summit and our desire to recreate the securities of the past, I suspect that we have not yet asked ourselves what rural and regional communities of the future will look like. What indeed is our big picture?</para><para>In a recent ABC <inline font-style="italic">Country Viewpoint</inline> broadcast, the following questions were asked: does the big picture envisage a network of regional centres that are just smaller versions of our state capital cities or does the big picture envisage a network of services that are virtual and accessed only through the Internet? Does the big picture envisage millions of hectares of plantations providing carbon credits for multinational corporations? Does the big picture include the old vision of a food bowl for the rest of the world? Whatever policy mix is used, an issue for the government is to identify and promote strategic investment in the future of the nation that will see the growth of prosperous, well-serviced regions.</para><para>There is a political divide, of course, on how to achieve this. Experience has demonstrated that a top-down attempt to establish major regional centres is unlikely to succeed unless there is significant local leadership and community support. This approach also ignores the need of those in smaller communities who are unable, because of geographic isolation, to access the services of major centres. An enduring impression that I have taken away from the Senate Goes Bush visits is that people of rural and regional Australia do not want hand-outs; what they want is a hand up. This means that there is a leadership role for government to assist local communities to assist themselves, to identify their strengths and weaknesses and, indeed, to find their own way forward.</para><para>It is up to all of us in government, in the private sector, in unions, in regional development organisations and local councils to find a way for regional communities to identify and harness their potential. The government's 
 proposal as part of the rural summit to get some help from the big end of town, colloquially speaking, in setting up a rural trust is a significant step in bridging the gap between the haves and the have-nots. More importantly, it recognises the moral obligation we have to include rural and regional Australia in the nation's prosperity. If we fail to do this, we diminish our achievement as a successful nation.</para><para>Last week, the Prime Minister chaired the first meeting of the government's business and community initiative to promote the notion of a social coalition. It brings together the resources of the government, the private sector, individuals and the Australian business community. Clearly, an integrated approach will maximise our chances for rural and regional renewal. It will also be necessary, I suggest, to carefully consider the impact of decisions imposed on Australia by global organisations such as the WTO.</para><para>No-one will deny that trade is the lifeblood of this country and we need to keep our strategy under review. We cannot afford to drop the ball on this issue in Australia. As a country that overwhelmingly relies on exports for our survival, we must continue our participation in the WTO, but we must also keep our strategy in doing this under close scrutiny.</para><para>The clear lesson from the Seattle round is that people affected by WTO decisions want to have a say in matters that affect them. The protests that we all saw on our televisions and read about in newspapers were not as much about global free trade, I suggest, but rather the way in which this is pursued by the WTO, seemingly without regard to the impact on a local community. The dispute settlement rules are opaque and in need of reform. It is little wonder that those on the receiving end of adverse decisions are often puzzled by and invariably angry with decisions they do not understand. The decision against Australia on the importation of uncooked salmon products is simply a case in point.</para><para>Notwithstanding the matters that I have mentioned today in this matter of public interest debate, I must say that I am buoyed by the signs of regeneration in rural and regional Australia and confident that the 
 innate decency of our fellow Australians will see us face the new millennium with both hope and resolve to meet these challenges. I would like to take this opportunity to wish all of my colleagues, the clerks, the Senate staff and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, who serve us with such distinction throughout the year, the very best Christmas and a New Year filled with promise.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aboriginals: Interpreter Service</title><page.no>11414</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>11414</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in this debate on matters of public interest to raise the need for an Aboriginal languages interpreter service in the Northern Territory. In these days of modern travel it is not unusual for many of us to find ourselves in countries around the globe, for business or pleasure, where English is not the national language. Luckily for those of us who speak English, it has become the most widely spoken language in the world and in most places it is relatively easy to find someone who speaks some English. However, most of us have found ourselves at one time or another in a situation where we do not speak the local language and nobody seems to speak a language that we can understand. Some of us may have even found ourselves in a situation where we have had to deal with government bureaucracies in those countries or seek medical treatment from a local doctor or hospital or even have had to deal with police or perhaps a local court—environments where nobody seems to speak a language we can understand and the proceedings are not understood by us. It is a frightening and disorienting experience, not being able to understand what is being said and being unable to make yourself understood.</para></talk.start><para>For a large percentage of Aboriginal Territorians—and I am sure elsewhere in Australia where we find indigenous Australians from a traditional background—the problems of a lack of understanding in the court system, the health system or government bureaucracies is a regular occurrence, often with dire consequences. Perhaps it is important to place some statistics on the record so we have a picture of what we are dealing with here.</para><para>Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory make up about 27 per cent of the population. Of these people it is estimated that about 75 
 per cent speak an indigenous language, or languages even, and have a very poor or limited understanding of English. In 1997-98, Aboriginal people made up 70 per cent of people who fronted the Northern Territory's court system. In the same period Aboriginal people made up more than 50 per cent of patients in the Northern Territory's hospital system. In contrast, non-English speaking background Territorians—those from overseas non-English speaking countries—made up only 8 per cent of the Northern Territory's population. However, when dealing with the judiciary, the health system or government bureaucracies, NESB Territorians have 24-hour access to free government provided interpreter services. If you are Chinese, you can; if you are Laotian, you can; if you are Greek or Spanish you can. Off the top of my head I think about 150 languages are catered for. That is only fair. Most reasonable people would consider that it is only fair that non-English speakers have access to interpreter services.</para><para>However, if you happen to be an indigenous Australian in the Northern Territory with no or limited English, the situation is vastly different. Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are not automatically provided with interpreter services to help with language difficulties in accessing any community services. Of particular concern is the lack of Aboriginal interpreter services to allow them to access health and legal services. It is outrageous but true.</para><para>Over 20 years ago Aboriginal linguist Gloria Brennan wrote a report investigating the need for an Aboriginal interpreting service, concluding there was a real and urgent need for such a service. Finally, 18 years later, an Aboriginal languages interpreter service was trialled in the Top End over a six-month period. Focusing predominantly on health and legal services, the trial addressed the following four key issues: whether there existed a need for such a service; the feasibility of establishing a permanent service; the most effective means by which a service might run; and how much it was likely to cost. The report, titled <inline font-style="italic">Executive Summary Northern Territory Aboriginal Languages Interpreter Service Trial Evaluation Report</inline>, 
 was circulated to members of a working party looking at Aboriginal interpreter services and other proponents of Aboriginal interpreter services throughout Darwin.</para><para>The findings of the draft report were very clear. It highlighted the need for an Aboriginal service and it recommended that it be administered through the existing Northern Territory Interpreter and Translator Service (NTITS), which would be both cost effective and consistent with the government's position on the mainstreaming of service delivery to Aboriginal people.</para><para>In May 1998 a final report was published by the Northern Territory Attorney-General's Department, titled <inline font-style="italic">Trial Aboriginal Languages Interpreter Service—Evaluation Report</inline>. However, the integrity of the published report has been questioned by members of the working group and proponents of an interpreter service. What happened has been explained by a member of that working group, Mr Russell Goldflam. He said:</para><para>The draft report, which clearly recommended the establishment of the nation's first Aboriginal interpreter service, never saw the light of day and was replaced by a watered-down version several months later, which was prepared and published without involvement of members of the Working Group.</para><para>Interestingly enough, even though they were invited to do so, the Northern Territory Attorney-General's Department did not address this matter as part of the Northern Territory government's submission to the inquiry into the provision of an interpreter service in Aboriginal languages which was conducted by the Northern Territory government under the auspices of the then NT Anti-Discrimination Commissioner, Dawn Lawrie.</para><para>In February this year, Dawn Lawrie, who was the then NT Anti-Discrimination Commissioner, began a public inquiry into the provision of interpreter services in Aboriginal languages. It attracted wide public interest with submissions received from the government, the judiciary, the legal, health and community service providers. Handing down her report some five months later, after considering nearly 100 written and oral submissions, Ms Lawrie concluded that:</para><para>The Northern Territory Government should establish an Aboriginal interpreter service and that the establishment of the service should be given the highest priority.</para><para>Not only that, Ms Lawrie stated that the lack of Aboriginal interpreter services in the Northern Territory is discriminatory, contravening both the federal Racial Discrimination Act of 1995 and also the Northern Territory's own Anti-Discrimination Act of 1992.</para><para>Over the years the Northern Territory government's response has been that an Aboriginal interpreter service would be too expensive. If they are not prepared to accept the argument of justice and equity in providing such a service, they should consider the economic arguments in favour of an Aboriginal interpreter service. Clearly the provision of properly trained legal and medical interpreters would save far more than the cost of such a service by reducing court delays, retrials and incorrect diagnosis and/or treatment in our hospitals.</para><para>A study by Dr Peter Collins for the Northern Territory's Office of Aboriginal Development in 1995 in fact pointed out that the introduction of an Aboriginal interpreter service would be very cost effective. In the health sector a properly funded interpreter service will lessen the potential for claims against medical negligence, misdiagnosis, readmissions and so on. In the legal setting the savings for less court and police time would be enormous. The lack of an Aboriginal interpreter service is placing enormous pressure on our court systems in the Northern Territory.</para><para>Not long after Dawn Lawrie's report was released the federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Herron, was reported as saying that Aboriginal people should take some responsibility for such a service and that ATSIC should provide the funds for it. The minister's comments say a lot about his support for the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and the services they need. As the Reverend Jim Downing succinctly stated in response to Senator Heron's comments later in a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory News</inline>:</para><para>Has he . . . or any other Government Minister suggested that the Turks, Greeks, Italians, Vietnamese, and all the other racial groups provided with a 24 hours interpreter service should pay for their service? No it is the sort of service a government should provide.</para><para>At this point I repeat an earlier point I made: that is, in the Northern Territory there is full-time free interpreter service available to people from non-English speaking backgrounds, but not if you are Aboriginal.</para><para>A recent incident, however, which received much media attention, highlights what can happen and has happened due to the lack of an Aboriginal interpreter service. Recently at the Royal Darwin Hospital a young Aboriginal woman was sterilised without understanding that the procedure was permanent. Traditionally the Northern Territory government has relied on either family members or friends who may speak English to translate between patients and staff. However, they are not trained interpreters. There is no guarantee that they may be around when needed, there are cultural constraints on them in explaining certain matters, and they do not necessarily understand the procedures involved. The chief minister's response to the media attention given to this revelation of the young woman being sterilised without her consent was that he rejected the need for an Aboriginal interpreter service and said:</para><para>to my mind (that) is akin to providing a wheelchair for someone who should be able to walk.</para><para>Speaking in parliament about translators, he went on to say that it was a disgrace that Aborigines still needed them. His comments would almost be laughable if they did not reflect his obvious lack of humanity, his lack of understanding of the cultural principals involved and his lack of understanding of the principals of justice in our legal and health system.</para><para>While Mr Burke has previously acknowledged there was a need for an Aboriginal interpreter service, he said it should be paid for by federal government funding. Obviously he does not consider the introduction of an Aboriginal interpreter service a high priority for his government. It is somewhat ironic really. On the one hand, he considers himself to be the great helmsman steering the North 
 ern Territory towards the holy grail of statehood, yet he is not prepared for the Territory to meet its responsibilities regarding the equal treatment of Territorians. Last week the former Anti-Discrimination Commissioner, Dawn Lawrie, in responding to these comments by the Chief Minister, said what a lot of people in the Northern Territory are becoming increasingly inclined to think. She said, `Denis Burke is a national disgrace', and she is right.</para><para>I conclude my remarks by saying that the debate over the introduction of an Aboriginal interpreter service is not about whether people should speak English. It is about what the reality is now and what impact it is having on many Territorians. This is something Denis Burke does not want to seem to grasp; that is, that a large percentage of Territorians are being discriminated against. They are denied a basic service that is offered to all other non-English speaking Territorians.</para><para>Aboriginal Territorians need an Aboriginal interpreter service and they need it now. Hopefully in the future, non-English speaking Aboriginal people will be as fluent in English as they are in their own languages, and it would be an advantage to them if they were. But at the moment that is not the case, and it needs to be addressed. There is simply no excuse for the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory not to introduce an Aboriginal interpreter service immediately. He is directly responsible for the consequences of not doing so.</para><para>I want to mention the names of some people involved in legal and health issues in the Territory. They include the Supreme Court Judge, the Hon. Justice Dean Mildren; the Director of Public Prosecutions, Rex Wild QC; the recently retired Hon. Justice William Kearney; the Director of Legal Aid, Richard Coates; the Director of the North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service, Gordon Renouf; the Director of Anglicare, Peter Fisher; Dr Ilona DeBella, from the Royal Darwin Hospital; Jackie Vincent, who is the chairperson of the Katherine Aboriginal Language Centre; and Dr Sam Heard. The list goes on and on.</para><para>Why have I mentioned them? Because they all support the introduction of an Aboriginal interpreter service. Why is it that the leaders in the Aboriginal legal and health areas can see what is so blindly obvious, but the Chief Minister, Denis Burke, will not allow the Northern Territory to meet its responsibilities by establishing immediately such a service? I firmly believe that the Chief Minister, Denis Burke, should be held personally accountable for what happens as a result of the lack of an Aboriginal interpreter service in the Northern Territory.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.56 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>11417</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Charitable Organisations</title><page.no>11417</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11417</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp.

We are bringing in a very fair tax system which will be of benefit to charities, of benefit to large and small business, of benefit to taxpayers, of benefit to families and, particularly, of benefit to those on pensions and benefits. We have a tax reform program; we want to make sure Australia has a tax system which will take us into the new millennium and which is fairer and more equitable and which will better enable Australia to compete on world markets—in other words, a tax system which is the world's best practice.</para></talk.start></continue><para>You ask such a question because you have no philosophy, you have no views, you have no policies.

You are good at fly-fishing—no-one in this chamber argues that. You are probably the champion fly-fisher, Senator. But, frankly, this question? We are providing flexibility to charities—that is what we are doing. This means that pie drives, lamington drives, cake stalls, Christmas cake sales and all of those sorts of things will not come into the system unless the particular charity has a turnover on those projects of over $100,000. It is perfectly straightforward. Will charities want to restructure? Charities will obviously make a choice. Charities will work out what suits the particular charity. This is exactly what charities wanted. It might not be what Shayne Murphy wants, but this is what charities wanted and we have delivered to them in spadefuls.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Australia: Initiatives</title><page.no>11418</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11418</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Macca!

It is quite appropriate, as we approach the end of the year, to 
 look on the achievements in each portfolio. The first that I would nominate in this portfolio is the contribution the AFP made in East Timor. They were the first people there. There are 40 that are still there. They gave extremely meritorious service and I would particularly like to mention Alan Mills, a retired AFP Assistant Commissioner who gave distinguished service as the UNAMET commander in East Timor. That I would single out as a great achievement for the Federal Police this year.</para></talk.start><para>The Federal Police and the NCA are of course now properly resourced. They have had increased money, as I was able to mention yesterday, under the Tough on Drugs initiatives. They have had record seizures of heroin, cocaine and amphetamines. We have had the arrests of major international fugitives and, most importantly for the man and the woman in the street, they have been very successful—through the Swordfish reference—in catching up with tax cheats, something that the people opposite when they were in government never did.</para><para>The next achievement that I would like to mention is that of CrimTrac, an extremely overdue need to put together law enforcement information from all the state police services, and we are starting with a fingerprint system that was allowed—over 13 years under Labor—to fall into absolute disrepair to the point that it was effectively useless.</para><para>We have given Customs the resources and powers to do the job, and all we hear from the other side is, `Why don't you peel a bit off, establish a new authority and call it a coastguard?' In contrast to that, the Prime Minister's task force has put $124 million of new money in, including new Dash 8 aircraft, a night capable helicopter and a national surveillance centre. In relation to law reform, this government has initiated and passed sex slavery legislation. It is very important for Australia to be taking the lead in this area to demonstrate that we will not put up with trafficking, especially in women, for use as sex slaves. We have passed legislation in relation to foreign bribery so that our companies when competing overseas compete on quality and price and not on whether they 
 have got money to bribe the person they are getting the contract from. We have introduced theft, fraud and bribery legislation, which is a part of major criminal law reform. We have had a report done by the Australian Law Reform Commission on the confiscation of proceeds of crime, and we will be acting on that report early next year. Crime prevention under this government is getting the money and the attention it deserves.</para><para>There is a whole range of achievements. There is one thing that this parliament could have achieved, not just for itself but for all Australians. But, sadly, because of people opposite, it is not going to happen. Sports drugs is one area in which we could have seen a very exciting achievement by this parliament. Because we have the Sydney Olympics next year, it is important that Australia demonstrates we want a clean Olympics and that we show what we are prepared to do towards that. Customs has legislation at hand to increase the penalties on people who import performance enhancing drugs, to turn them into middle level narcotic penalties. The Democrats are prepared to support us, Senator Harradine is prepared to support us, One Nation are prepared to support us. We could pass this legislation before Christmas and have an effective regime leading up to the Olympics. What does Labor say? `Send it off to a committee.' They have not even thought about it.

In fact, I think we have heard the word `lamington' more in this chamber in the last couple of days than we have heard in the last 50 years. The situation is this: the charities will decide how they structure their activities. Some charities will want to register for the GST, and some will want to remain outside the system. That is their choice. If they believe that they want to be part of the system—and many will—they will be able to claim the input tax credits. If they do not wish to be part of the system, then they can have the option, as the Treasurer has so lucidly outlined, to structure their activities.</para></talk.start><para>Let me quote what the Treasurer said—I thought it was a pretty good quote, and I think we can afford to share it with you again in this chamber.

He went on to say, `Well, they can structure their affairs so they can take advantage of it on an individual fundraising activity.' So, if a charity wants to stay outside the system, it is up to it how it structures its activities. Unless the project is going over $100,000, they can stay outside the system. The point I am making to you is 
 simply this: that particular charity or group will make a decision as to whether they want to remain outside the GST system, in which case they will not be able to claim their input tax credits, or whether they want to become part of the system, in which case they will be able to. So we are providing that flexibility to charities.</para><para>This is what charities want. When they came to see us, charities wanted to have flexibility in this area.

Virgin will provide huge benefits for those on the major trunk routes. I like to think that people are discovering even more places up my way, like Townsville and Cairns.

The A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 provides, in section 40E, for a school tuckshop or canteen run by a non-profit body to elect to have all its supplies of food treated as input taxed. The cost of the GST on inputs will be passed to the students. This will be particularly hard on parents who organise school tuckshops and canteens run on a non-profit basis. Given that the government is now expecting to reap additional revenue through the higher business registration, will the minister consider making a determination under section 38(3) to extend GST-free status to all food supplied to students in school tuckshops run by non-profit parent-teacher organisations?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>11426</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Harris for that question. Tuckshops which are run by a non-profit body at a primary school or a secondary school and which supply only food may choose to be input taxed—that is their choice—and they will be outside the GST system. Where this occurs, the tuckshop will not charge GST on sales of food, but it will not be entitled to claim input tax credits for GST paid on its purchases. In this case, the tuckshop's revenue can be excluded from the annual turnover of the non-profit body for GST registration purposes. People will make their own judgments, but I think many parent associations will choose to be input taxed and not charge GST on food. That is a choice that they will have. That is another area where this government is flexible. We are providing options to people.</para></talk.start><para>The other point I think Senator Harris referred to was a windfall rise in GST revenue. Senator Harris, I think you were probably referring to an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> yesterday. The increase in estimates of GST registrations reflects both the normal increase in new business registrations from year to year, more up-to-date ATO data and, of course—thanks to this government—a stronger economy. They are the economic parameters. Growth factors are already factored into the Treasury revenue 
 estimates for the GST. The growth in business numbers therefore, I am advised, would not of itself result in any increase in revenue over and above the current Treasury estimates.</para><para>The point I want to make to the Senate—and we have had a number of questions today on this issue—is that this government is providing flexibility for non-profit bodies. In the case of school tuckshops, there is a flexibility. You have to view this whole package. Many families will be $40 to $50 a week better off as a result of our tax package. The fact of the matter is, as we discussed with Senator Cook with respect to the voucher issue, that many families are going to be better off. They will have more money in their pockets. This is something that this government is very proud of. I hope that provides the response that you were seeking. We will not be going further, but I think that is a response which shows the flexibility that this government has in relation to making sure that we have a system which is fair to all types of organisations.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11427</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

If the institute's support for research is liable for GST then we have a situation in which there will be 10 per cent reduction in funded research, research which is vital to those living with motor neurone disease. Their fate is a cruel enough one without having the hard raised funding reduced by taxation.</para><para>That is from a leading charitable organisation doing valuable work on a disease that some Australians are afflicted with. The government should show sympathy. There is no sympathy here, other than, `We will teach you how to evade the tax.' Let me come back to that in a minute. Today I have a press report from the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Liberal</inline> , a newspaper in country New South Wales, dated Tuesday of this week, which states:</para><para>"Complying with GST would cost the Western region diocese of St Vincent de Paul at least $40,000 a year," it was claimed yesterday.</para><para>It goes on to say:</para><para>That is what St Vincent de Paul say will be the effect of it.</para><para>This is a tax imposed by the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Democrats. We know that there have been talks going on behind the scenes because their backbench has been stampeded by this insensitive, unfeeling, impersonal tax being imposed on Australian charities. But what sympathy do we get from these parties about the plight of Australian charities and the need to turn every dollar they raise to the benefit of the charitable purposes for which they exist? Senator Murray, the Democrat spokesman on taxation, said today, `The fact 
 is that we agreed charities would be within the new tax system. For those charities who don't want to be in the new tax system, well, they are going to be.' That is an unfeeling, unsympathetic attitude to Australian charities trying to raise a quid by the local raffle, by the lamington drive, by the cake stall, to serve the needs of their charitable organisations. The response from the government is to say, `Restructure your affairs', but restructuring your affairs means a new legal entity, a new set of books, a new auditor, and you people use it on administration, not on services. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>11430</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Cook, you can keep on trying but you are not going to get there.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Address the chair, please, Senator Eggleston.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name></talker><para>—Through the chair, of course, Madam Deputy President.

What does the new tax system mean for the clients of charities and will they benefit? In fact, the clients of charities will be much better off under the new tax system. They will be better off because there will be a real increase in pensions and allowances which will give them more spending power. They will be better off because there will be tax cuts worth $12 billion a year which will benefit low income earners and give them more spending power. 
 The beneficiaries of charities will be better off because there will be an increase in family benefits. There will be a reduction in the incidence of poverty traps, and the new tax system will underpin our social security safety net, provide better education services and better health services.

It is true that the commercial activities of charities will be treated the same as the commercial activities of any ordinary business to ensure that ordinary businesses are not put at a competitive disadvantage. Charities will be entitled to register for the GST if they so desire and if their gross income is above the threshold levels, which will mean they will generally be able to claim back the GST paid

What we have seen this week from this debacle of the impact of the GST on charities is that this government is very strong on taxing the weak and very weak on taxing the strong or the rich members of our society.</para></talk.start><para>We have a government that wants to turn charities into tax collectors. We have a government that is also quite inconsistent about its policies and where it is going. Yesterday Senator Kemp stood up in the Senate and told us that World Vision sponsorship, for example, could be subject to the tax. The GST will be payable on money you pay to World Vision to sponsor a little child overseas. At the same time, in the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister was forced to declare a backdown, whereby a GST exemption for child sponsorships would apply. We have heard a great deal of inconsistency about their policy on the GST. If the ordinary person sitting at home does not 
 understand this policy, you could well understand why. Even the members of this government do not know how this policy is going to apply.</para><para>We now have a GST on compassion. We have a GST on the goodwill in people's hearts. Let us look at the elderly volunteers, for example, who run a stall at the base hospital in Orange. They raise over $200,000 per year, probably using old ice-cream containers or tins such as that for a till, and donate over $100,000 to that hospital because they believe in the cause. They believe that they are trying to raise some money for the hospital. They will now be caught up in the GST bungle.</para><para>The answer today from this government is that charities will now have a choice. They will not have a choice. The choice will be that if you have a turnover of under $100,000, you can opt to be part of the system or not. If your turnover is over $100,000, you are in the system. The choice is either whether they bother with all the paperwork and try to recoup some of the money back that they will be paying on the GST or whether they will say it is all too hard.</para><para>The real essence of this is that there will be a decline in the number of volunteers in this country who willingly give their time to charities and volunteer to bank this money or do the limited paperwork that is now required. Charitable organisations will be relying more and more on fewer and fewer people. No-one will be bothered being a tax collector for this government when they want to spend their time raising money and assisting the charities that they believe are worthwhile assisting. At the end of the day, we will see less money for activities and those people that those charities are designed to assist.</para><para>Nobody in the community believes Senator Eggleston or Senator Kemp when they say that this will be a good thing for people who are poor and struggling and for organisations that need these extra funds. Nobody believes that. I cannot believe that the government is so out of touch with the anger in the community at this time as this GST debacle rolls out before their eyes.</para><para>We have a tax on compassion. We are turning charities into tax collectors. We really want the government to stand up and say categorically that they will be exempting charities and their fundraising efforts from the GST. That is what ACOSS have called for and that is what charities have called for from day one. They want a complete exemption from this debacle and a complete acknowledgment by this government that they play a very valuable role in this community. That role will now be turned into nothing less than a tax collector for the federal government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>11432</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have listened to various senators speak in here today.

If the Labor Party does not believe in the GST, why do they not come out and say that they will get rid of it in the unlikely event they are elected? Not once have they been prepared to say that they will get rid of the GST. With that in mind, one can only assume that they actually support a GST. They will not at any stage get up and say that they will remove the GST in the unlikely event that they are elected.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Crossin will not say it. She makes statements that are simply not true. There is absolutely nothing to substantiate her claim that the number of volunteers will decline. Volunteers have been declining under the Labor Party's wholesale sales tax. They have been declining in number over the years. All these service clubs that have been mentioned today have been declining in number all the time we have had the Labor Party's wholesale sales tax. So do not blame a decline in numbers on the GST.</para><para>In question time, Senator Cook spoke about the value of a $40 voucher this Christmas compared with a $40 voucher next Christmas. Under the sound economic management of this government, that $40 voucher could actually be a voucher worth well over $100 if that person is paying a mortgage on their house. In the time that this government has been in power, we have been able to put more than approximately $100 week per week extra in a house buyer's pocket because interest 
 rates are so much lower than they were when we came to office. They have more spending power now.</para><para>Senator Cook did not say anything about the giver of that $40 having income tax cuts next July. He conveniently forgot that.

He never mentioned anything about the real increase in pensions and allowances that will occur. He never mentioned anything about the $12 billion worth of tax cuts that will flow on to Australian taxpayers on 1 July next year. He never mentioned the increase in family benefits. There was not a word about the positive side of tax reform. There was only the harping negative side as he tried to find specific instances and nitpick. Even then, he did not come up with the correct facts.</para><para>Senator Cook never said anything about reducing the incidence of poverty traps. One of the key planks of this taxation reform is to try to reduce the incidence of poverty traps, something which you did not even attempt to tackle during 13 years of Labor government. I remember Senator Murray saying at one of our tax inquiries that this is the first time any government in recent times has done anything to try to tackle the poverty traps that exist and the disincentives for people to work or to work harder or to earn more. There was not a word from Senator Cook about the new tax system, which is going to underpin our social security safety net, education, health and all of those other things that are so important to all the members of our community.</para><para>My advice to the Labor Party is to stop the scaremongering tactics. Do not frighten 
 Australians. Everything that you have said today is not designed to present the truth to the public, it is designed to try to scare the public into believing something that simply will not happen. We had Senator Crossin saying that the number of volunteers will decline, as though the number has been increasing in the last number of years. We all know that all voluntary organisations over a long period of time have struggled to maintain their numbers. The Labor Party actually like the GST because they have no intention of removing it.

It is not within my constituency but, because of its name and because of what the editorial of yesterday says, it is well worth while reading it into the record to see where this scaremongering is coming from and to see where the facts and the truths, and where the fears of the charitable organisations, are coming from. It will not take very long to read. The editorial says:</para></talk.start><para>The western region branch of St Vincent de Paul Society believes it will cost $40,000 to comply with GST regulations when they come into force on July 1, 2000.</para><para>This particular case, which won't be uncommon among charities and other community non-profit groups, highlights the difference between the current system of exemptions and a system immersed in paperwork.</para><para>At the moment—</para><para>Senator Ferguson should listen to this—</para><para>registered charities and some other groups are exempt from paying wholesale sales tax. It's a fairly simple procedure requiring a registration number and little or no paperwork during the transaction.  
</para><para>Under the Federal Government's GST guidelines there is a significantly more complex system which will tax corporate sponsorships, fetes, food vouchers, refuges and even sheltered workshops.</para><para>The Australian Tax Office has admitted GST compliance costs will eat into charity funds and volunteers will need training to cope with GST paperwork and personally bear the additional out-of-pocket expenses.</para><para>It is a significant quote coming from the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Liberal</inline> . I believe it is quite an accurate portrayal of the fears that abound in our community of those organisations which provide such a service to the Australian community.</para><para>Even Mr Costello has heard of these fears. Yesterday in the House of Representatives Mr Costello tried to calm nerves, but what he also did was to actually tell it like it is. He has told the charities that operate in Australia that, whichever way they turn, they are going to get it in the neck. They are going to get it in the neck because if they register that they have over $100,000 in inputs, they will have all the associated paperwork. If they do not have $100,000 in inputs and seek not to register, then they are going to be hit with the GST on the inputs. So whichever way they turn they are going to cop it—they are going to cop it going and they are going to cop it coming back as well. Today's Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> says:</para><para>And Mr Costello said large charities with big turnovers would still escape the tax by separating their individual activities into units worth less than $100,000.</para><para>But by doing this, charities would still be caught in the GST net because they would not be allowed to claim the rebates for the GST on products they purchase.</para><para>For example, a parent group with a turnover of less than $100,000 would still have to pay the GST on items such as some foods for the tuckshop, raffle prizes and clothes for the uniform shop.

I think this concern and interest is in two parts.</para><para>Firstly, there is the excitement from many people in the general community about the prospect of a third airline operating within Australia and what this new competition might mean in terms of cheaper air fares. I can remember the immense support in my home state of Western Australia for the emergence some years ago of Compass Airlines and the way in which it dramatically altered the cost of interstate flights, which plunged dramatically and for the first time made it possible for many West Australians who previously had not been able to afford interstate airfares to then do so. This jolt to the airline duopoly has had long-reaching effects and the legacy of Compass to today's consumers is a domestic airfares regime that is more accessible and affordable than it was in the past.</para><para>Alongside the understandable interest in the emergence of Virgin Airlines is the very real concern about the cherry picking operations that Virgin proposes to employ. That is, by choosing to work only the main capital city trunk routes—largely Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane—the pressure will almost certainly 
 be applied to both Ansett and Qantas to lower their trunk route fares in response to the competition from Virgin. This will undoubtedly apply equal pressure to both Ansett and Qantas to either increase fares on their less popular and less frequented sectors or perhaps to wind back these services altogether.</para><para>Today's press and the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> report that Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Airlines has crossed its first major hurdle towards establishing a third domestic airline after the federal government granted foreign investment approval. Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, yesterday announced the approval under new rules which allow foreign carriers to establish new domestic aviation businesses provided they are in the national interest. This raises the question of what constitutes the national interest, and it is in this context that I raise my real concerns about the potential downgrading of services to rural and regional areas, or perhaps the more likely scenario of low frequency sectors used by Ansett and Qantas being the subject of price hikes as these airlines continue to service those areas not serviced by Virgin but under the added financial pressure being placed on them by competition.</para><para>Competition in and of itself is not a bad thing, but it can only work fairly if there is a level playing field. In a previous answer on this matter when it was raised by my colleague Senator Woodley, Senator Macdonald said:</para><para>This particular issue is one thing I think the government just has to keep an eye on to make sure there is not any diminution in the bush.</para><para>But this issue is about not only how the emergence of Virgin may adversely affect the bush, but also the way in which less popular sectors such as Perth to Adelaide or Adelaide to Darwin may be affected by potential price increases. The Australian Competition and Consumer Council, the ACCC, would appear to be well placed to monitor and report on this, particularly in terms of potential price increases as a result of what might rightly be seen as unfair trade practices. Again Senator Macdonald made reference to this in a previous answer to my colleague Senator Woodley when asked about the demise of Compass 
 Airlines and the apparent difficulties imposed on it by Qantas or Ansett in terms of airport space and general terminal facilities.</para><para>Today I asked the minister whether the Commonwealth intends to use the prices power of the ACCC and whether it intends to supplement such powers as necessary to ensure that users of regional services do not suffer an increase in relative fare levels arising from the entry of Virgin Australia into the domestic intercapital routes. In reply, the minister indicated that, if any adverse illegal or improper behaviour towards Virgin could be shown, then it ought to be directed to the ACCC. It is a reply that very strongly suggests reaction rather than action.</para><para>I think, however, that I express the views and concerns of many Australians when I say that, to date, the government has not been altogether convincing with its assurances of consumer protection and consumer equity for those travellers in the less popular flight sectors currently serviced, and well serviced for the most part, by the existing duopoly. In a sense what many Australians are asking is: will the Commonwealth establish safeguards to ensure that the quality and frequency of regional airline services operated by Qantas and Ansett are not compromised by the entry of Virgin Australia? While the government has made reassuring noises about the benefits of competition and its professed commitment to rural and regional areas—and by implication to more isolated cities such as Perth—there has not yet been any real tangible action to match these words with particular regard to ensuring equity for domestic airline travellers. The government needs to make clear its attitude towards the prospect of Virgin Australia as a fully foreign owned company. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>11435</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10001</name.id><name role="metadata">CLERK ASSISTANT</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Nuclear Waste</title><page.no>11435</page.no><no.signed>100</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>8U4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Lees</name><name> Sen Meg</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</para><para>The petition of the undersigned strongly opposes any further attempts by the Australian Government

First of all, I want to thank the members of the committee—my Deputy Chair, Senator Crane, and Senators Crossin, Ferris, Mason and Murray—for the productive and committed spirit in which the committee has worked and for the considerable attention to detail which is necessary. They bring a sense of fairness and of what is a proper process to the consideration of the legislation that comes before the committee. It makes for reports which I think are very successful in the light of that approach.</para><para>Secondly, I want to thank the ministers and parliamentary secretaries for the comprehensive and expeditious responses that they have made when the committee has raised issues. That has been very good, and I want to acknowledge that those responses, together with the letters that are written, improve both the quality of the legislation dealt with and the quality of the debate about that legislation.</para><para>There is no Bill of Rights in Australia. We are the only English-speaking country of our particular kind that does not have a Bill of Rights. England, Canada, the United States and New Zealand do. In so far as there is scrutiny of legislation at a parliamentary level, it takes place in this committee, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, and in the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, which is chaired by Senator Coonan. Civil life, civil rights and civil liberties have been considerably enhanced by these two committees. There is probably still a need for a Bill of Rights, but I think these two committees do a sterling job.</para><para>That work has much to do with the efforts put in by the counsel who guides the committee, Professor Jim Davis from the ANU Law School. I want to thank him for his work during the year. I particularly want to thank the secretariat, Margaret Lindeman, Sue Blunden and James Warmenhoven. He has been put last in these notes I have, which were prepared by him. He is a very modest 
 man but a man who is worthy of great praise. I thank him and the staff for their assistance. We look forward to scrutinising legislation in the next year, the next century and the next millennium.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Community Affairs References Committee</title><page.no>11440</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>11440</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>11440</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">Rocking the cradle: a report into childbirth procedures</inline> , together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  record of the committee's proceedings, submissions and additional information.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para><para>I am very pleased to table this report called <inline font-style="italic">Rocking the Cradle</inline> , a report on childbirth practices and procedures in Australia at the end of the millennium.

But I have to also say, colleagues across the chamber, that it allows me to at least admit a certain consistency.</para></talk.start></continue><para>First of all, I want to thank the secretariat—Elton Humphrey, Christine McDonald, Leonie Peake, Ingrid Zappe, Peter Short and, in particular, for the large bulk of the work, Mary Lindsay . I would also particularly like to thank the many hospitals where we held public hearings. Unlike many other inquiries, we held our hearings in the hospitals and that allowed us then to very quickly visit the birthing centres and have a look at the neonatal intensive care wards. There is nothing like going to see for getting our head around the latest developments and to see also the care and effort with which people are assisted in childbirth in this country.</para><para>However, there are some points that emerged during this inquiry which are very important and do need consideration. First of all, the report finds evidence that confirms the caesarean section rate in Australia is very high—unacceptably high, up there with the highest in the world. It varies considerably from hospital to hospital. It varies considerably from state to state and it varies significantly as to whether you are a public patient or have private insurance. It is much higher for people with private insurance and all the evidence given to the committee showed that the numbers of emergency caesarean sections were not too different between public and private patients; it was the elective caesarean section in the privately insured patients that made most of the difference.</para><para>The evidence provided to the committee did not justify that difference. While just about all witnesses providing information might have talked about the women being older—that they tended to be older having a first baby, that there might have been previous complications or what have you—we had no evidence that confirmed justification for the difference between the privately insured and the publicly insured in elective caesarean section. We regard that as a significant concern.</para><para>We found on the evidence that the only thing that lowered caesarean section rates anywhere in the country has been the intention or the attitude of a senior obstetrician, either in a hospital or in a region or in a state—as in Tasmania, where we were told that, or, for example, in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in South Australia, where doctors set out to lower the caesarean section rate and did so with no increase in maternal mortality or morbidity or danger to babes either. So it is quite clear that caesarean section rates are somewhat arbitrary and we believe that there is no real justification for them.</para><para>I certainly found myself dealing quite often with the challenging line: `Well, if a woman really wants a caesarean section, why can't she have one if she demands it?' I found myself torn between my woman self, on one side, and my medical self, on the other, and I had quite an interesting debate in the back of my head. But I must say that I find no best 
 practice guidelines that can justify doing caesarean sections on request or on demand. On the evidence we were given, it is not the best procedure for a babe to be born by caesarean section; it is better if the baby can be born vaginally, and for the majority of women—over 70 per cent of babies that are born are spontaneous vaginal births in this country—the problems are minimal.</para><para>What we were concerned about was the number of times caesarean sections were done for the convenience—it is said—of the mother and certainly for the convenience of the doctor. We did not find either of those reasons sufficient justification. In the end I conceded to my medical self and decided that it is better that we have best practice guidelines that assist all obstetricians and all mothers in making the decision how best to have a baby delivered. There is much more that could be said. I do urge people to read the report for discussion on this matter and to stay to listen to my good colleague Senator Gibbs, who will deal with it further.</para><para>We were also concerned about questions like this. If a mother demands a caesarean section, she may indeed in the end be provided with a caesarean section but, if she should ask to have a baby born in a birthing centre, she is still regarded as distinctly odd by many people, particularly some obstetricians who are not inclined to favour birthing centres or midwifery management of child care. The evidence that we got suggests many mothers really appreciated those options. They would like to see more birthing centres particularly in hospitals. That is the thrust of childbirth in Australia: there are some—a very small percentage—who prefer home births but the majority would like to have their babies born with minimal intervention in birthing centres.</para><para>In Brisbane, in one hospital we were told there are so many people wanting to have their babies in birthing centres that there is a ballot each month for which women will actually get a place in a birthing centre. The community want it—they are very pleased with it. It is satisfactory and it is safe. There is no increased mortality for mothers but there is much less intervention, so there is an argument that says there is decreased morbidi 
 ty for mothers and that babies are born with the same amount of safety and so on. And yet the provision of birthing centres has not kept up with demand, and we urge governments to see that more centres are available so that women can exercise that end of their option.</para><para>We were very concerned about the very large increase in the number of ultrasound tests being done and, on the evidence provided to the committee, in many cases ultrasound tests are being done with no or very little medical benefit. So we have urged that this very expensive area of antenatal care and antenatal screening be thoroughly examined. It is expensive: the Health Insurance Commission figures put the cost of ultrasound at about $38 million—more than a third of the cost of all health insurance figures for the whole of birth.</para><para>Of the whole cost of birth—the whole cost of antenatal care and childbirth—more than a third goes down to the ultrasound screening in the antenatal period. Many witnesses said that it is no more than a very expensive early baby photo. I think that there is no doubt that ultrasound is a wonderful test if properly used with adequately trained providers of the service or the test, with adequately trained people to read it and with some guidelines about the safety of ultrasound. But many of those criteria are not in place. You also need to know how to use the test so as to get good benefit from it. We also appreciated that many people wanted to have the ultrasound but were not prepared for or counselled about the consequences of discovering from the test that maybe there was something wrong with their babe.</para><para>We were also very concerned that, despite the improvements in maternal and child health and childbirth in this country, the Aboriginal maternal mortality rate is still twice that of non-Aboriginal mothers, and the infant mortality rate for Aboriginal babies is three times that of non-Aboriginal babies. Although it has dramatically improved from the five times figure in the early 1980s, it is totally unacceptable to have figures of that height at this time.</para><para>We were also very concerned about medical indemnity. We did not have a term of refer 
 ence addressing this, but time and time again witnesses told us that the cost of medical insurance premiums for obstetricians and for general practitioners practising obstetrics was so high and their fear of litigation was so real that many doctors are now withdrawing from the practice of childbirth. We believe that that is a major concern, and when we sought figures—either from the committee or from specially commissioned work by Fiona Tito—in all cases we were unable to get the information that we needed to make serious decisions about medical indemnity. Even the AMA and members of MDOs were not able to get that information. It is time for a full inquiry into the question of medical indemnity so that the reserves and the practices are open to scrutiny and are transparent. The huge differences in premiums paid—for example, about $42,000 for an obstetrician in New South Wales compared to about $27,000 for an obstetrician in Victoria, compared to about $11,000 for an obstetrician in Tasmania—make no sense at all. We believe we have some explanation for it but it is not at all sufficient to explain why those differences are there. We believe it is time for a proper inquiry.</para><para>My colleague Senator Knowles is going to say in her dissenting report that she thought this report was unnecessary as it deals with matters of professional practice or matters for the state. Any number of witnesses disagreed with Senator Knowles and said they found this inquiry was absolutely important because it is time for national leadership to focus on setting some guidelines, getting some best practice criteria and dealing with the recommendations from five excellent reports in very recent years, including one by the NHMRC. Almost none of the recommendations have been acted on by either state or federal governments. If we want to continue being up there with the best and to improve health for Australian women, we must act on this report. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>11442</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Crowley is quite right—I am going to say precisely that for the very reasons that she just said, that is, there have been five reports into this issue in recent 
 years, and to have another inquiry at huge expense to the taxpayer was considered by government senators to be completely and utterly unnecessary. Much of what was considered was of concern; there is no denying that and the government senators do not deny that. There are areas of concern regarding childbirth in Australia. But we must remember that the overwhelming number of births in Australia are safe, both for the child and for the mother. We were concerned that there were valuable resources of this parliament going to an inquiry which essentially was going to saw sawdust because, as Senator Crowley has quite rightly identified, there have been five reports already undertaken.</para></talk.start><para>The other part of this inquiry that caused government senators concern was the mere fact that it sought to delve into areas that were not the responsibility or under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Funding for hospitals comes from the state governments. There are so many of these areas. It is quite outlandish for medically unqualified members of parliament, at any stage, to try to say that they know better than a doctor. I believe the relationship between a mother and her practitioner is paramount, above political interference.</para><para>While we might all agree that the number of surgical interventions in Australia is high, I do not believe it is up to senators to say it is too high and that they are unnecessary and to override the decisions of medical practitioners. For example, there is a recommendation saying there should be no more than 15 per cent caesarean sections in a year. What I automatically said was, `What happens after 15 per cent has been achieved?' Do you just say to someone who is about have a baby, `Excuse me, can you wait until next year because the allocation of 15 per cent has been met?' So many of the recommendations are very silly in terms of their practical implementation.</para><para>I do not for one moment say that a number of the issues were not important, but so much of the evidence that has been overlooked in the majority report stated that this inquiry was unnecessary. In fact, we had witnesses in Perth—highly qualified medical practitioners, 
 I would suggest—who said, `Why are you doing this again?' And all I could say was, `Hear, hear! Why are we doing it again?' As I said, I do not wish to in any way belittle the case that has been put by so many people or their concerns, but I do submit that it is beyond the jurisdiction of the federal government to have impact on so many of the things that this committee sought to inquire into. Therefore, the government senators have put in a minority report accordingly.</para><para>One of the other things that we put into the minority report was that there has been a complete disregard shown to so many government initiatives, particularly those for people in rural and remote Australia. I could not get over the fact that such a major initiative as the federal government putting in $8.2 billion to fly-in-fly-out female GPs servicing women living in rural and remote Australia could be overlooked by the majority, and they in turn recommend that money be put into such a program. That was announced in the budget not so long ago and yet it was overlooked, as was the fact that they will visit up to 160 locations nationally about four times a year.</para><para>The other thing that was overlooked was that this service is among a raft of federal government initiatives funded by a $200 million budget commitment to improve access to medical care in rural and regional Australia. No-one, least of all the minister or the government, denies that there has been a problem in the past with the servicing of people in rural and regional communities. We are setting about pouring the money into those communities that Labor refused to pour in during its 13 years of government. That has been contained in the budgets but overlooked in the majority report. I think that is a pity. But, as I said, that is the position of the government senators. We believe that the federal government should mind its business while the state governments mind theirs but while, more importantly, patients have communication and contact with their medical practitioners.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>11443</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the report <inline font-style="italic">Rocking the cradle: a report into childbirth procedures</inline> . On listening to Senator Knowles's speech, I 
 would like to remind her that the terms of reference for this committee were approved by the Senate. The Community Affairs References Committee held six days of public hearings in Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth. We received almost 200 submissions, which came from a wide range of organisations and individuals, including hospitals, health services, practitioners, independent and hospital based midwives, welfare and peak organisations, and individual mothers.</para></talk.start><para>Over the past 10 years there have been inquiries and reports about childbirth services in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and one from the National Health and Medical Research Council. Obviously, childbirth is an important issue in this country. Unfortunately, despite there being so many inquiries, few of the recommendations the various reports have made have been acted upon. With more than a quarter of a million babies born in Australia every year, childbirth is a very important part of the health of this nation. Childbirth is the major reason for hospitalisation in Australia, and it accounts for the highest number of occupied bed days. It is important that we make childbirth as safe as possible for both mother and child.</para><para>The committee found that childbirth in Australia is very safe, although maternal and infant mortality rates are significantly higher than average in indigenous communities. Across Australia there are about 5.3 maternal deaths per 100,000 births and approximately 5.9 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. In indigenous communities, the death rate for mothers is double and the death rate for infants is triple that of the non-indigenous community. Some of the reasons for those problems were best summed up in evidence given to the committee in Adelaide by a number of Aboriginal community health care workers.</para><para>Those health care workers told the committee that past policies had created a fear in indigenous women about going to hospital. There was also a feeling of isolation because Aboriginal women were amongst people they did not know, thus creating a sense of shame. 
 The committee heard that many indigenous women have to travel long distances to receive medical attention, further exacerbating the problem. They will visit a doctor or hospital once and usually not return because they see the hospital as a place to go when you are sick, and they do not consider that being pregnant is being sick; they view pregnancy as a natural part of life. One of the specific recommendations that the committee made to combat this problem was that the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health provide recurrent funding to ensure continuity for existing antenatal programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and to establish new programs in areas of need.</para><para> The committee received evidence that Australian women value safety during birth for their babies and themselves above all other considerations. For that reason, the large majority of expectant mothers choose to birth in hospitals. While most women acknowledge the contribution of the medical profession to the low mortality rates, they are concerned about increasing levels of medicalisation of childbirth. Mortality rates are relatively uniform across the country, with the exception of the indigenous population.</para><para>The rates of intervention, however, vary. Intervention rates are highest among women who have private health insurance, women who give birth in major tertiary hospitals and women attended by specialist obstetricians. The rates vary by state, with South Australia recording the highest rate of caesarean section. The committee was especially concerned by the high rate of elective caesarean section in Australia for which, the evidence suggests, there is little or no medical justification. The committee received no evidence that justified the significant variation in caesarean section rates between states, between hospitals and between public and private and patients.</para><para>The committee did receive some evidence that caesareans were on the increase because of a rise in defensive medicine—a practice whereby doctors provide a service that is not needed because of a concern about possible litigation should a problem with the birth occur. The committee is of the strong view 
 that there is a need for national leadership to reduce caesarean section rates. The committee supports the development of best practice guidelines on interventions and other aspects of maternal and infant care. Such guidelines would improve the quality of care, reduce the use of unnecessary, ineffective services and ensure that care is cost effective.</para><para>There is also concern among the committee members about the polarisation of views that emerged during the course of the inquiry. Some witnesses indicated that caesarean sections and other interventions should be available to women on demand, regardless of any medical indication of need. Other witnesses felt that all forms of medical intervention were overused. Many people recognised that an intermediate position was likely to prove most beneficial to women. The committee heard that, where cooperation between midwives and specialists is common, women's satisfaction with the birth experience was enhanced without sacrificing safe and successful outcomes.</para><para>We found that the best examples of this middle ground occurred in birth centres. In birth centres, women considered to be at low risk gave birth in home-like surroundings, attended by midwives but with specialist support available should problems arise during birth. Everywhere the committee went, we discovered birth centres that were oversubscribed. They were full to overflowing because of the desire by women for a less medical approach to childbirth, without sacrificing the benefits of medical advances as they became available. Unfortunately, it seems, there is not much effort being made to move resources from expensive interventions, including caesarean sections, to birth centres.</para><para>The committee found that the current arrangements for antenatal, birth and postnatal care increased the fragmentation of services. The existing funding arrangements break that care into episodes centred on various care providers. The evidence we received indicated that women would receive much better outcomes if they had continuity of carers throughout the process.</para><para>There was also disturbing evidence that a significant and increasing proportion of 
 funding is spent on ultrasound scanning. The committee found that the most recent figures from the Health Insurance Commission, which excludes services provided by hospital doctors to public patients in public hospitals, show that in the period July 1998 to June 1999 expenditure was $38.6 million on ultrasound, almost all of it routine scanning; $27.6 million on labour and delivery, including complex births, caesarean sections and immediate postnatal care; and $30 million on antenatal visits.</para><para>Quite a few witnesses voiced the same concerns as the Royal North Shore Hospital, which told the committee:</para><para>Of particular concern is the cost of numerous ultrasound examinations. It is our current experience that it is not unusual for women to have undergone three ultrasound examinations before their pregnancy reaches 20 weeks of gestation.</para><para>The committee believes the use of ultrasound screening needs to be evaluated as soon as possible. The women of Australia need to know that this procedure is being used properly within clear best practice guidelines. Lowering the use, and therefore the cost, of ultrasound screening may provide a source for funding in other antenatal, birth and postnatal support areas, but I stress that the first step is a full and proper evaluation of ultrasound screening. The committee was also concerned about the increasing trend to discharge new mothers and infants from hospital early.

I will briefly discuss each issue in turn.</para><para>The Audit Report on life cycle costing at the Department of Defence found that there was considerable scope for Defence to further promote and implement its policy of whole-of-life costing. Our report encourages Defence to implement this policy more rigorously.</para><para>Sound costing is a crucial basis for good decision-making. This is particularly relevant for Defence, which has a significant asset base.</para><para>The Defence policy accords with Commonwealth procurement guidelines that purchasing be efficient and effective. However, the JCPAA agrees with the ANAO that its life cycle costing policy should be promoted and implemented more effectively.</para><para>At Defence, life cycle costs are estimated to be between two and three times the value of capital costs. The objective of life cycle costing analysis is to facilitate decisions that achieve maximum value for money over the whole life of an asset. Because acquisition costs at Defence are so substantial, it is vital that the Commonwealth is assured that tax payers' money is spent as effectively as possible. While the Committee understands that life cycle costing is not always easy or cheap, we nevertheless urge Defence to implement it to the best of its ability. In particular, we urge Defence to require tenderers to make contractual commitments regarding life cycle costs. 
</para><para>Audit Report No. 47 investigated the management of Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. This was a follow-up to a previous audit conducted in 1996.

It has provided unprecedented support to the Australian community to protect and plant native vegetation.</para><para>Halfway through the first phase of the Bushcare Program and the Natural Heritage Trust Partnership agreements it is now clear that to achieve these objectives we will need more effective support by the States for integrated regional planning of natural resource management and control of native vegetation clearance.</para><para>Against this background this is an opportune time to review progress, to elicit the lessons learned, and to develop new directions. These longer-term directions will be refined as the Government analyses the findings of the Mid-Term Review of the Natural Heritage Trust in coming months. But to maintain momentum, there are steps that should be taken now to further improve the program:</para><para>.	 Effective State based constraints on broadacre land clearing;</para><para>.	 Institutional reform to ensure implementation through integrated catchment management;</para><para>.	 Building on regional strategies through new `devolved grants';</para><para>.	 Establishing new incentive mechanisms such as revolving funds; and</para><para>.	 Providing information to communities through the internet.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Challenge</inline></para><para>Australia's native vegetation is one of the richest and most fundamental elements of our extraordinary natural heritage. Native vegetation binds and 
 nourishes our ancient soils; it shelters and sustains native wildlife; it protects streams and wetlands, estuaries and coastlines; it absorbs carbon dioxide and emits oxygen.</para><para>Conversely, the depletion and degradation of native vegetation communities threatens the long term health and productive capacity of Australian landscapes. Destruction of native vegetation is the single biggest cause of biodiversity loss;  it is a primary driver of land degradation, salinity and declining water quality;  and it is among the single biggest components of our net Greenhouse gas emissions.</para><para>Land clearing is a central issue but there is much more to it than clearing alone.</para><para>Clearing is compounded by more insidious, widespread, incremental losses of remnant native vegetation. Grazing pressure, old age, insects, disease, weeds, rising watertables and firewood gathering are undermining the quality of bush remaining in rural landscapes.</para><para>Similarly in cities and towns, the precious remnants of native bush are depleted, fragmented and degraded incrementally.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Solutions</inline></para><para>The solutions to the decline in native vegetation cover, and the environmental problems stemming from that decline, are simple:  land clearing should be reduced very significantly;  revegetation of native vegetation communities should be enhanced; and a great improvement is required in the protection and management of the native vegetation which does remain in rural and urban landscapes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Approach and achievements to date</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Natural Heritage Trust and Bushcare </inline></para><para>The Natural Heritage Trust is the largest investment in the environment ever made by an Australian Government. It is tangible recognition of the fundamental importance of natural capital, which underwrites other forms of wealth.</para><para>The Natural Heritage Trust marks the point at which Australia finally started re-investing in natural capital.</para><para>Reflecting the centrality of native vegetation management for many environmental issues, the Bushcare program is among the Trust's largest components, with almost $350 million in Trust funding over six years.</para><para>Bushcare has an historic and ambitious goal:  to reverse the long term decline in the quality and extent of Australia's native vegetation cover by the year 2001. This goal is pursued through three complementary forms of investment:</para><para>.	 Direct investment in on-ground projects at a community level; 
</para><para>.	 Investment in institutional reform aims to improve decision-making and support for better vegetation management at all levels; and</para><para>.	 Investment to build community capacity to improve native vegetation management.</para><para>A central feature in the delivery of Bushcare has been the Natural Heritage Trust `One Stop Shop' process. It enables community groups anywhere in Australia to apply for funding through an integrated process, with community-based assessment of their proposals at regional and state levels.</para><para>Bushcare has funded more than 1800 projects through the Trust's One Stop Shop, in which it has invested over $127 million to date. About 70% of this funding has been invested directly in on-ground works to improve native vegetation management.</para><para>A great diversity of projects is being supported. For example:</para><para>In tackling the daunting problem of salinity in the Western Australian wheatbelt, the Trust is funding a project in the North Stirling area to protect 1,700 hectares of remnant bushland, of which more than 300 hectares is habitat for threatened species. More than 330 hectares of revegetation using locally sourced native species has already been re-established, protected by 1,270 kilometres of fencing;</para><para>In South Australia, to support the clearing legislation introduced during the 1980s, Bushcare has funded the protection of more than 90,500 hectares of high quality bushland covered by statutory heritage agreements;</para><para>Government's effort in urban areas is exemplified by Victoria's <inline font-style="italic">Metropolitan Vegetation Works</inline>  project which focuses on revegetation activities to prevent land and water degradation in high-priority areas along streams and to create wildlife corridors around greater Melbourne. Bushcare funds are helping 47 community groups to establish 110,000 new trees and shrubs in 27 separate projects.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Building community capacity</inline></para><para>Natural resources are sustained or otherwise through the cumulative impact of the countless everyday decisions and actions taken by those with direct responsibility for the land including farmers, indigenous communities, municipalities, government agencies and utility companies. The Bushcare program recognises that attitudes, knowledge, skills and capacities of the people taking these decisions are crucial.</para><para>The Australian landcare movement is unique in its combination of grassroots voluntary community effort with technical and financial support from government and increasingly the private sector. Landcare, Bushcare, Rivercare and Dunecare groups are cleaning up the rivers and beaches, stabilising eroding banks and dunes, recreating wildlife corridors and restoring wetlands. They are 
 controlling feral animals and weeds, and putting back some of the vegetation which their forebears, and in some cases they themselves, have removed.</para><para>Despite the leap in community awareness over recent years, there remains a great thirst for information at a community level, and for hands-on skills and technical support. There also remain significant areas where the knowledge base is patchy or weak.  Moreover, some of the natural resource management issues Australia faces are of such scale and complexity that it is unreasonable to expect community groups alone to tackle them effectively through small-scale local projects.</para><para>The problem of dryland salinity is perhaps the best example. Salinity is a symptom of inappropriate land use and management, often over large areas and long timeframes. Solutions to it are likely to involve far more significant changes in land management practices than hitherto thought necessary.</para><para>We can broadly identify that large parts of south-west and south-east Australia require large-scale revegetation to help deal with dryland salinity. There is a large overlap between areas that have been cleared in the past, have moderate to high salinity risk, have potential for commercial reforestation and are in need of revegetation to restore biodiversity conservation values. The design of appropriate incentive structures and integrated program delivery mechanisms involving the community and lifting its levels of participation at the regional scale will be crucial to generate the investment necessary to achieve the scale of revegetation envisaged. In this way regions obtain a more diverse economic base, farmers get an alternative source of income, and Australians get a significant improvement in environmental outcomes.</para><para>Broad scale community participation is critical to increasing momentum in the transition towards more sustainable land management practices. Through thousands of local projects, the Natural Heritage Trust has provided extra resources, encouragement and technical support to help community groups to invest in their own natural heritage. Around 60% of Bushcare projects are for less than $20,000 per year, and 75% of Bushcare projects to date are being undertaken by voluntary community groups.</para><para>Bushcare has also invested in projects which are national in scope, aimed at enhancing the overall capacity of the Australian community to improve native vegetation management. These strategic national projects include:  FloraBank, which has developed a national framework and protocols for collection, storage and distribution of native seed;  and the new national Atlas of Australian Birds, involving thousands of volunteers generating a national overview and important insights into trends in the quality of habitat across Australia. 
</para><para>Bushcare-funded research has also enhanced our overall capacity to manage native vegetation more strategically, more effectively, and at less cost. Research projects are giving us a much better knowledge base on issues such as more effective incentives for conservation on private lands; opportunities for local government to conserve native vegetation; legislation in States and Territories that facilitates or constrains conservation behaviour; and potential tax incentives for the protection of native vegetation, to name a few.</para><para>Bushcare has also catalysed improved native vegetation management on land managed by Aboriginal people. For example Bushcare funding has enabled the Anangu-Pitjantjatjara Land Management group to institute a program of capacity building for traditional owners. The Community Ranger project is developing a Property Management Planning process that will be used across all Anangu-Pitjantjatjara lands (which make up 14 % of South Australia). The project is currently implementing a program of traditional indigenous land and vegetation management practices, rehabilitating land and controlling feral animals and weeds.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The need for better incentives</inline></para><para>Ninety-three percent of the Australian continent lies outside formal conservation reserves. On the vast majority of this land, much of it privately owned or managed, conservation of biodiversity is not the primary land use or management objective. In most circumstances it is not possible to obtain a cash flow from conservation. Further, taking steps to conserve biodiversity on private land often imposes on landholders a direct cost or loss of opportunity to profit. And because many of the benefits arising from the conservation of native vegetation accrue off-site and to the public as a whole, it is often difficult for conservation to compete with other land use options that provide direct economic returns.</para><para>As a consequence, conservation remains under-valued and under-provided in the market place in which traditional goods and services are traded.</para><para>Governments can support the conservation of native vegetation on private lands through the removal of disincentives and the creation and provision of incentives, to a level commensurate with the public good. Through such mechanisms, the costs of biodiversity conservation and land restoration can be shared appropriately between individual landholders, the local community and society as a whole.</para><para>The most common form of incentive used to date has been grants, such as the majority of community projects funded through the One Stop Shop. Other forms of incentives on a more limited scale include assistance for local councils to introduce differential rating schemes, which allow a reduction in, or 
 exemption from, rates payable on land managed for conservation values.</para><para>A fine example is the Johnstone Shire Council's Rate Rebate and Conservation Agreement Scheme. This Bushcare project aims to develop voluntary conservation initiatives and agreements with private landholders for all critical habitat areas within the shire. By the end of the project 2000-3000 hectares of critical habitat in the Wet Tropics will have been protected and enhanced. Conservation agreements with landholders are tied to the Shire's planning scheme and involve the rezoning of the area covered by the conservation agreement into a Conservation Zone. Landholders are offered a rebate on the general rates applicable to the allotment, and Council undertakes the rezoning process at no cost to the landholder. Johnstone Shire is committed to continue the program after Trust funding ceases.</para><para>The ongoing economic incentive provided to landholders through such schemes is highly symbolic, recognising their contribution to the wider public good. It is also practical in helping to offset  long-term management costs.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">A regulatory bottom line</inline></para><para>Under the Natural Heritage Trust Partnership Agreements, all State and Territories have committed to prevent any clearing of endangered ecological communities, any clearing which changes the conservation status of a vegetation community, and any clearing which is inconsistent with the sustainable management of biodiversity at a regional scale.</para><para>These are impressive commitments, which make an historic pledge to improve management of our natural resources. To further embed these agreements the Commonwealth is working with States and Territories to establish a national framework within which these commitments can be met.</para><para>Through the Australia and New Zealand Environment &amp; Conservation Council (ANZECC, the Council of Environment Ministers), the Commonwealth and State and Territory governments have developed a <inline font-style="italic">National Framework for the Management and Monitoring of Australia's Native Vegetation</inline> . It sets out the national consensus on best practice arrangements in regulation and also planning, incentives, monitoring and evaluation. The framework will encourage cooperation in establishing a comprehensive platform for institutional reform.</para><para>But collective action between Governments can take us only part of the way. A clear lesson from the early years of Bushcare is that the national goal of a net gain in the quality and extent of native vegetation cover cannot be achieved in the absence of effective controls on broadscale land clearing in all jurisdictions. This is not something that can be delivered by landcare groups, or bird observers, or 
 committed individual landholders. It is the business of State and Territory governments.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Further actions and new emphasis</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Improved regional action through Devolved Grants</inline></para><para>Having successfully supported the thousands of landcare groups around Australia to restore and conserve native vegetation, the next great challenge is to assist landholders who are not members of landcare groups to undertake similarly important work. A key vehicle to assist such landholders will be `devolved grant' projects, including fencing incentive schemes and bush corridor revegetation projects. Devolved grants enable a regionally based organisation to administer Bushcare funds to assist many individual landholders to carry out works on their own properties that deliver regional priorities.</para><para>For grant recipients, those doing the work on the ground, there is a minimum of paperwork and delay, and funds are available at the time of year most appropriate to the region. These projects are potentially available to all land users, not just the members of landcare groups, and they concentrate the burden of paperwork on the professional staff of regional organisations, rather than on the volunteers who do most of the on-ground work.</para><para>For example, Greening Australia is now running a large-scale, Bushcare fencing incentives project in Tasmania, which in its first four months approved funding for more than 155 km of fencing, protecting 1876 hectares over 109 sites. Rather than requiring 109 separate project funding applications, this is a single project which allocates funds at a property level against defined criteria, in return for a management agreement with the landholder.</para><para>To date Bushcare has invested about $17 million in focused on-ground works through Devolved Grants. This model shows enormous potential and the Commonwealth will expand upon it. The <inline font-style="italic">Natural Heritage Trust Guide to Applications 2000-2001</inline>  provides potential new participants with new and additional information on Devolved Grants.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Improved One-Stop-Shop Process</inline></para><para>A central feature in our delivery of Bushcare and associated programs is the `One-Stop-Shop' process which enables community groups anywhere in Australia to apply for funding through an integrated process, with community-based assessment of their proposals at regional and State levels. This process has delivered funding to over five thousand projects over the first three funding rounds.</para><para>The One-Stop-Shop process is continuously being improved. This year the guidelines for new applications are easier to follow. While keeping the same basic structure that past applicants are familiar with, the new guidelines are shorter and easier to 
 read. They also make it easy for applicants to get help or extra information if they need it.</para><para>This year has also seen an improvement in the delivery of cheques to community groups. This has been possible with the commitment and cooperation of all parties. The Government will continue to seek improvement in this area.</para><para>But to obtain maximum value for the Government's investment in the Natural Heritage Trust, increased emphasis will be given to funding participants in larger scale, regional projects which are underpinned by integrated natural resource management planning at a scale in which the community is capable of addressing the key issues.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Bush for Greenhouse</inline></para><para>Addressing climate change creates profound challenges and opportunities for native vegetation management in Australia. The Government has established the <inline font-style="italic">Bush for Greenhouse</inline>  program, overseen by the Australian Greenhouse Office. Bush for Greenhouse is designed to facilitate corporate investment in revegetation `sinks' to sequester carbon dioxide and reduce our net greenhouse gas emissions. Delivery of this program is being let through a competitive tender process, the outcome of which I expect to announce over coming weeks.</para><para>Limiting the loss of native vegetation will form a critical part of any long-term greenhouse abatement strategy. There are important synergies to be captured between reducing net greenhouse gas emissions, abating dryland salinity, enhancing water quality and improving wildlife habitat at a landscape scale.</para><para>Through Bush for Greenhouse and through the development of further policy and program measures, the Government aims to maximise the positive effects of these synergies on Australia's native vegetation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Bush for Wildlife</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Bush for Wildlife </inline> is a new initiative to provide a stronger focus on wildlife conservation through Natural Heritage Trust programs such as Bushcare, Endangered Species, Feral Animals and Weeds.</para><para>Through this initiative the Bushcare guidelines now give priority to projects which include a component which protects or restores habitat for endangered native plants and animals.</para><para>The initiative is also supporting State based `land for wildlife' schemes. These schemes provide a support base for landholders interested in protecting wildlife on their properties.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Communication</inline></para><para>The information technology revolution offers major opportunities to enhance access for the thousands 
 of Australians who participate in Bushcare to the information they need to make their efforts a success. I would like a Bushcare grant applicant, school or community group anywhere in Australia, to be able to use the Trust website for obtaining information such as: recommended species for replanting, habitat requirements for endangered and migratory species, management plans for important wetlands, as well as summaries of relevant Bushcare research projects, best practice information, key contacts and other sources of support.</para><para>Work is well underway to enable this in the very near future.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Encouraging Philanthropy </inline></para><para>Community projects funded through the One Stop Shop are critical to providing land managers with the education, information, motivation and resources required to underpin and guide on-ground action and will remain central to the Commonwealth's overall strategy for Bushcare.</para><para>There is scope to provide even greater incentives for conservation management on private lands through the tax system, through recent measures to encourage greater corporate and personal philanthropy announced by the Prime Minister on 26 March 1999.</para><para>Take the United States. There the private sector invests as much in public benefit nature conservation as the public sector.</para><para>Through the Prime Ministers initiative, for the first time donations of property valued at more than $5,000 to any eligible institution, including environmental organisations, will be tax deductible, no matter when the property was purchased.</para><para>The Prime Minister also announced gifts donated as part of a deceased estate will be exempt from capital gains tax.</para><para>These initiatives build on the $80 million Landcare Tax Rebate introduced through the Natural Heritage Trust and are designed to encourage greater philanthropic investment in the future of Australia's natural heritage.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Revolving Funds</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth is committed to the introduction of new <inline font-style="italic">revolving funds,</inline>  in cooperation with other governments and non-government organisations to enable the purchase of land with high wildlife habitat values and its subsequent resale to buyers committed to management for conservation.</para><para>The conservation values of purchased properties will be secured in perpetuity by the placement of a covenant on the title of the land. Resale of the land will enable the capital invested through the Natural Heritage Trust to be revolved to fund further purchases. With appropriate enabling legislation to minimise transaction costs, revolving funds are an innovative, efficient, market-based 
 mechanism through which to provide greater security for conservation values on private lands, at little ongoing cost to the taxpayer.</para><para>This proposal is modelled on the highly successful Trust for Nature Victoria, which has been operating under its own legislation since 1972. The revolving fund operated by the Trust for Nature was enhanced significantly earlier this year with a capital injection of $500,000 from Bushcare. Bushcare will facilitate similar initiatives throughout Australia.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Broader Institutional Reform</inline></para><para>The next phase of Bushcare will focus on tackling the wider constraints to better vegetation management, and on investing where we can exert most leverage on the policies and practices of the key players in vegetation management. It is about highlighting, extending and improving best practice, not just in vegetation management, but also in regulatory, planning and incentives frameworks across all tiers of government.</para><para>Over the last decade there has been a proliferation of regional and catchment-based structures and processes in natural resource management. Many regional/catchment strategies have been and are still being prepared, and are often used as the basis for allocating public resources such as Natural Heritage Trust funds including devolved grants in particular.</para><para>However these strategies are rarely reflected in statutory planning or regulations that have legal force. If they do, it is usually with a narrow focus on a specific issue such as water quality.</para><para>Australia needs to dramatically improve the effectiveness and integration of its natural resource management planning systems. There needs to be much better vertical integration cascading through statewide or regional planning, and given effect in local planning, zoning and rating schemes.</para><para>We also need to deliver better horizontal integration. The management of rivers, catchments, coastlines, vegetation, wildlife, land use and now carbon needs to be addressed as one and planned accordingly. This is both most feasible and most imperative at the regional or catchment scale.</para><para>Now is the time for Governments and communities to work together to create much more effective mechanisms for addressing natural resource and environmental management issues of which native vegetation is a vital element. This must happen in an integrated manner and at a scale which is appropriate to the particular issues being addressed. It must also enable community commitment and participation in discovery and delivery of the solutions.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act</inline>  commences in mid 2000. It will oblige the Commonwealth to pay close attention to matters which will inevitably be the subject of 
 regional strategies and plans. These include matters of national environmental significance such as nationally threatened species and communities of native wildlife; wetlands of international importance; and migratory species protected under international agreements.</para><para>A key objective of the Act is to promote a cooperative approach to protection and management of the environment involving governments, the community and landholders. The Commonwealth looks forward to working nationally to enhance the very frameworks within which we manage Australia's natural resources.</para><para>A further field of genuinely exciting opportunity involves the potential synergies to be captured between reducing net greenhouse gas emissions, abating dryland salinity, enhancing water quality and improving biodiversity conservation and wildlife habitat at a landscape scale. Full realisation of these synergies may depend on the development of effective markets for carbon and, perhaps, salinity credits to generate some of the required long-term investments.

Its purpose was to review the preparatory process ongoing in Geneva for the Seattle Ministerial Conference, which had been making little headway. The Lausanne meeting involved Ministers from more than 20 countries, including the "Friends of the Round" grouping in which Australia has played a prominent role over the last couple of years, plus the United States, the European Union, Japan, Canada and key developing countries. The main sticking point was the scope of a new Round—in other words the breadth of issues which were to be placed on the negotiating agenda.</para><para>From Australia's perspective, I put the case strongly for a round which would be centred on the key market access areas of agriculture, services and industrial products. Research commissioned by my Department estimates that the gains in terms of global welfare from a 50% cut in support and protection in these areas alone would total some US$400 billion annually.</para><para>I expressed Australia's concern that some developed countries, in particular the European Union and Japan, were too ambitious in areas such as investment and competition policy. Also attempts by the United States to put new and controversial issues such as labour standards onto the agenda would not be acceptable to developing countries. I warned that such ambitions could derail the round launch and urged a more measured and realistic approach. I also made the point strongly that a successful launch would require further elaboration of the fundamental reform objective agreed in the Uruguay Round. I pointed to the near universal support for agriculture reform across the WTO 
 Membership except for a small group of countries led by the EU and Japan.</para><para>In the following weeks I was in telephone contact with my EU, US and Cairns Group counterparts on agriculture where a number of sensitive issues were resolved. Regrettably the same could not be said for other areas like labour standards and investment where, despite the efforts of Australia and others for a more reasoned position, attitudes from countries at both extremes remained rigid and unrealistic. As a result Ministers faced a hard job to find compromises at the meeting.</para><para>At Seattle I led a strong Australian delegation representing all industry sectors, interested agencies and including the opposition spokesman on trade. I welcome the strong commitment by the Australian business community to the Seattle meeting. Like the Government, they appreciate the importance of opening new export markets for Australia's continued economic and employment growth.</para><para>Many of the Australian industry organisations in Seattle ran parallel events to support and encourage progress with the agriculture talks. The National Farmers Federation arranged a meeting of farm leaders from Cairns Group countries and the sugar, grains, dairy and processed food industries ran seminars and other activities in support of our agricultural reform objectives. I would like to pay tribute to the outstanding efforts made by the Australian contingent. There was a real sense of "Team Australia" throughout the meeting.</para><para>Through their efforts, and those of Australia and the Cairns Group of agriculture countries, we made significant progress on agriculture. This was also assisted by close cooperation with the United States.</para><para>But similar progress was not achieved in other areas. We had warned in Lausanne that overloading the agenda with new issues like investment, competition, labour standards and the environment would put the round at risk.</para><para>Contrary to many media reports, the riots were not a major problem for the conference. The real stumbling blocks included</para><para>.	 an unwieldy agenda</para><para>.	 unrealistic ambitions in new areas, which were not tempered in the Geneva preparatory process or during the conference;</para><para>.	 an excessive emphasis on labour standards by the United States despite determined resistance from developing countries;</para><para>.	 and strong demands from developing countries which sought to renegotiate Uruguay Round agreements as part of a new Round launch.</para><para>In the end there was neither enough compromise, nor time to achieve it. 
</para><para>Notwithstanding this disappointing outcome, it would be wrong to conclude that no progress was made in Seattle. We made good progress in agriculture and services—and in some other areas. We are hopeful that these results can indeed be "frozen", as proposed by USTR Charlene Barshefsky and Director-General Mike Moore at the final Committee meeting, and that the process can be re-started at an appropriate time.</para><para>It needs to be remembered that agriculture and services negotiations are already mandated and will begin early next year. On agriculture we have established clearly the almost unanimous expectations of the WTO membership to move toward the elimination of export subsidies, to avoid the protectionist banner of "multifunctionality", to achieve substantial and progressive reductions in domestic support, to pursue market access negotiations aimed at the broadest level of liberalisation and to deal with issues like environment and rural welfare in ways that do not distort production and trade. These elements will provide a very positive direction for next year's agriculture negotiations.</para><para>The mandate for the services negotiations has not been controversial. We can expect to make progress on market access in sectors such as financial, telecommunications, professional services and electronic commerce. We will also continue to work on the full intellectual property agenda.</para><para>Australia intends to fight hard to progress the mandated negotiations, in close cooperation with the Cairns Group and with positively inclined services trading countries. We stand ready to incorporate these negotiations in a broader round as soon as possible and will work to that end. In the mean time we are well prepared to start the mandated negotiations on agriculture and services in the new year.</para><para>I would like to make clear that the events in Seattle have not resulted in any change in the Government's support for a market access focused round that includes industrial products in addition to the mandated negotiations on agriculture and services. We will continue to argue for a new round while getting on with the agriculture and services negotiations.</para><para>We will also continue to express our concerns at attempts to overload the WTO agenda with complicated and controversial issues. That does not mean we do not support sensible work programs in the WTO on issues such as trade and environment and on trade and development issues. There are clearly overlaps with other policy domains in these areas which the WTO is already addressing. Despite the misinformation being peddled by the Labor Party, Australia went to Seattle supportive of an ongoing work program of the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment and the Committee on Trade and Development. This reflects our position that it is 
 important to ensure efforts to free up trade are mutually supportive with environmental goals, as well as advancing the broad objective of sustainable development.</para><para>There is misinformation on the trade and labour issue being put around by the Labor Party in recent days. It is a shame to see that Senator Cook, who I might say was a valuable and constructive member of the Australian delegation in Seattle, has had to toe the trade union line on his return to Australia.</para><para>Senator Cook knows what the real situation was in Seattle. The United States was running with a highly provocative proposal to developing countries on trade and labour. He acknowledged the US "had one of the worst records of all countries in the world for following ILO conventions". Australia's position, supported by the Labor Party until recent political expediency got in the way, has been that labour standards are better dealt with in other international forums such as the ILO.</para><para>Australia was nevertheless amongst a group of countries trying to find a way of bridging the gap between the US and developing countries given the importance of finding an acceptable solution to this issue for the final Seattle outcome. It appeared that consensus could have been reached, as part of a Seattle package, around the establishment of a free standing "working forum" suggested by Thai Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Supachai, involving a range of international organisations including the WTO, ILO, UNCTAD and the World Bank. This would have met Australia's objective of not bringing the issue directly within the WTO.</para><para>In addition to pushing for the negotiations on agriculture and services to begin early next year, there are other aspects of the WTO we will also pursue. We will press our dispute actions against the infamous US lamb safeguard tariff quotas and Korea's beef restrictions. We also plan to work, through the WTO Dispute Investigation and Enforcement mechanism I announced in September, to identify and pursue any other areas where our trading interests are being damaged through non-observance of the WTO rules by others. We will also do all we can to see China and Taiwan accede to the WTO early next year, given the sizeable trade benefits in prospect for our exporters.</para><para>The Government adopts an integrated multilateral, regional and bilateral approach to trade policy. The WTO is a vital part of this strategy and the Seattle outcome has not changed that. But the WTO is only a part of our trade policy agenda. Regionally, we will be pressing to invigorate the APEC trade liberalisation and facilitation process when Australia hosts the APEC Trade Ministers' meeting next June. The Seattle outcome means there is a strong case for APEC members to continue regional 
 efforts to build support and momentum for a trade round.</para><para>We will also be investigating, with our New Zealand and ASEAN colleagues, the potential for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) linking CER with the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. In this regard I was pleased to announce earlier today that former Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister, Tim Fischer, will be the Government's representative on the high-level task force to pursue AFTA/CER links. As one of Australia's most successful Trade Ministers, Tim Fischer brings a wealth of experience in pursuing closer economic and trade relations with the ASEAN countries.</para><para>The delay in a Round launch will no doubt also stimulate attention to other possibilities for regional trade liberalisation and greater economic integration. There has been interest expressed in several bilateral and plurilateral combinations, including some which would link North and South America with CER and Asia. The Government is open to concluding free trade agreements where they would give Australia substantial gains in market access which Australia could not get elsewhere in a similar timeframe.</para><para>Bilaterally, the Market Development Taskforce in my Department will continue our efforts to open markets and promote exports in both traditional and emerging markets.</para><para>Australia has an enormous interest in trade, and in protecting and building the global trading system. The Government will continue to put that message squarely to the Australian people. In this regard I will shortly be releasing a new series of regional fact sheets which will highlight the importance of international trade to the prosperity of local communities. This link between our trade performance and our economic livelihood has to be better understood and the Government must play its part in conveying this message.</para><para>We have a huge stake in the global trading system. So in addition to building a stronger domestic support base to the Government's trade work, we will continue to pursue our international trade policies with maximum energy at all levels—multilateral, regional and bilateral.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>11454</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the statement.</para><para>This is a statement by the Minister for Trade, the Hon. Mark Vaile, on the events of the last week and in the preparation leading up to the last week for the Seattle Round of trade talks. I welcome the statement. It does represent an exercise in accountability to the parliament. 
 It enables the issues to be debated by this chamber. They are welcome developments and I consider that no area is more important than trade, because it is our major economic activity and outranks the GST in its significance to Australian working people and ordinary Australians.</para><para>Madam Acting Deputy President, 1.7 million Australians work in jobs that exist because we are an exporting nation. About 21.3 per cent of our GDP is earned in export. Much of our future growth will cause better and more permanent jobs if we develop our exports more effectively. Indeed, in Australia manufacturing jobs in companies that are export companies pay higher wages than companies where there is no export dimension to their activities. So trade is an essential and significant part of our national economy. Anything that can be done to promote it means greater benefits to the wider Australian community, and it is very important to have that strongly stated.</para><para>Now that the empty teargas canisters have been cleared away, the spent rubber bullets have been swept up, and the wastepaper in the conference halls in Seattle have been cleaned out, it is important to consider what last week was about and what the significance of those events was. The WTO itself seems to me to be under challenge from many quarters of the world as to its continued viability and existence.</para><para>I want to say a few things about the WTO and its predecessor, the GATT. The WTO is a consensus driven organisation with 134 governments around the world affiliated with it, and its role is to come down with rules to prevent and settle trade disputes. Before we had the WTO or the GATT, trade disputes went grievously bad at the cost of millions of lives in the world. The First World War is an example of a trade dispute that did not succeed and was conducted on the battlefields. Much of the Second World War was about that as well. As a result of those disputes, and following the end of the Second World War, at the Bretton Woods accords the GATT, the World Bank and the IMF were established as international institutions to try to regulate international economic activity on a non- 
conflict basis and, given the harsh lessons of the Great Depression, to do so in such a way that the world did not slip into economic decline in the way it did that blighted so many lives as a consequence of the Great Depression.</para><para>Those are significant achievements by the world trading system and they cannot be dismissed lightly. They have to be defended stoutly. Freeing up world trade has meant greater economic growth around the world. All countries have benefited, all countries have grown as a consequence, and it is vital for developing countries that it continue. The argument in some quarters is: who benefits most? That is an argument worth having, but it is not an argument to say that the advantages of growth should be easily dismissed. There is not a serious case for comparative advantage to be set aside, because comparative advantage does lead to general economic growth.</para><para>The attacks on the WTO that challenge these facts overlook the basic reasons for having such an organisation. It is not a supra-national, international government; it is a consensus driven body. Outcomes are adopted by governments. The breakdown in talks in Seattle set these principles back to some extent, at a cost to Australia. The cost to Australia is quite significant in that, if tariffs were cut around the world by half, Australia would have gained by $7.5 billion a year. With greater market access, thousands of Australian exporters—including service exporters, manufacturers and farmers—would have been able to establish new markets. There would have been higher wages and there would have been cheaper products for customers worldwide.</para><para>By the round not proceeding, NGOs that opposed the establishment of the round have lost out. They were protesting against the status quo. The best chance they ever had of realising their objectives was for the round to be engaged—if not in the WTO itself, then in other forums associated with the round so that the issues they were really concerned about could be dealt with. The failure of the round comes at the cost of developing countries, which are now without a multilateral forum 
 in which they can address many of their issues. For Australia, having an international rules based, multilateral forum that can settle trade disputes on a fair basis—according to merit, not according to might—is a fundamentally important issue. For Australia as a medium-sized power dealing with the mighty nations of this world, if it can resolve its disputes at a roundtable in Geneva where the rules of fairness apply, rather than by force or by overbearing economic strength, that is a significant advantage for this country and one that should be stoutly and strongly defended by all of us.</para><para>I now want to turn briefly to the manner in which the round closed down. It was said from the podium that they hoped to freeze the results reached in the negotiations at the point that the negotiations collapsed. It was said as a hope. There is no guarantee that the results, as far as they were achieved, will be frozen; and that is unfortunate. There is an important need now to move very quickly to get a round launched, in Geneva or elsewhere, or, failing that, to consolidate the gains that were made to get acknowledgment of those gains from our negotiating partners and agreement on the general outcomes so that the results genuinely are frozen and not frozen only because the chair ordained it. I think that is a vitally important thing, otherwise the results will thaw and degrade, and we will lose the advantage that this round of negotiations gave us.</para><para>That is important particularly for Australian agricultural producers who stand to benefit if we open markets because of the round. Also, although agriculture and services—as a consequence of Labor's negotiation at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round—are now mandated and will continue in negotiation next year, it is important that we have a wide round with other sectors in order to have scope for cross-sectoral negotiation to conclude outcomes.</para><para>Mr Vaile set down in his statement several outcomes for agriculture. Those outcomes now need to be nailed down so that they do not erode. Mr Vaile in his statement also quotes me. I need to correct the quote, because it is incorrect. What I did say was that 
 the United States has the worst record in adopting ILO conventions of many countries in the world. That is a matter of fact. It is a matter of record, and the reason I state it is that there is a need for countries which are putting the WTO ahead of the ILO in terms of labour standards to do their basic work on adopting labour standards in their own countries and to support the work of the ILO. That does not mean that there cannot be debate on labour standards in the WTO, but there is certainly an obligation to work through the ILO. The Australian Constitution is, after all, nothing more than a constitution to ensure free trade between the states. But in pursuing free trade in Australia, we added a labour clause by enabling in the Constitution the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes that go beyond the borders of more than one state. That is a constitutional response by our forefathers, which is a worthwhile thing to bear in mind when this government is trying to exclude a discussion of labour standards from a free trade agreement.</para><para>Our Constitution upheld the principle; there is no reason why we cannot address it in intelligent and constructive ways through the negotiations in the WTO. One has to ask oneself—given that the Reith legislation has been found to contravene ILO conventions—whether there is a guilty conscience in some quarters of the government and whether we have Mr Reith overwhelming Mr Vaile's commonsense in trying to shift trade negotiations to reach an undertaking that would incorporate some recognition of labour standards in some form or at least an off-base discussion of it so that the matter was addressed. Finally, I think the concentration on regional trade openings is welcome but it is not good enough. The bar is too low as far as an AFTA-CER agreement is concerned. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>11456</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek to make a few comments on the same report. I start by commending the Minister for Trade, Mr Mark Vaile, for making his statement today on the Australian delegation to the Third World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference 
 held in Seattle last week. I certainly acknowledge that some aspects of his report are quite interesting, including his claim that:</para></talk.start><para>Contrary to many media reports, the riots were not a major problem for the conference.</para><para>And he goes on to talk about what he considers the real stumbling blocks—in one circumstance, an unwieldy agenda, and there are other issues to which he refers. There can be no doubt that many of the images on our television screens of protesters and riots and of people from a range of different welfare, labour and trade union organisations and indeed environment groups protesting in the streets of Seattle remain with us.</para><para>There are some important lessons to be learnt from the WTO conference. One lesson that we should learn from the failure of these talks is that, if the advocates of further trade liberalisation are to have any success in achieving their aims, they must engage in a full, transparent and accountable dialogue with citizens around the world. Unlike the traditional post-confab happy snap that we normally get from trade conferences, some of the scenes on our television screens and in our papers were quite confronting images, leading some commentators to even claim that this might be the birth of global politics, which I think is an interesting image. </para><para>For almost a decade now globalisation has been part of the international lexicon. However, communities around the world have consistently been denied any meaningful dialogue on the pace or direction of globalisation. Queries, doubts and concerns about the effect of the reforms implemented as a consequence of the Uruguay Round earlier this decade have instead been met with the retort that globalisation is basically inevitable and that we can like it or lump it. So the Democrats welcome this statement as hopefully leading to greater dialogue and transparency on trade issues between government and the people. However, any congratulations must end there.</para><para>We consider the approach of this government on trade issues as narrow and short-sighted. Perhaps the most stark example of this was the so-called Team Australia—the collection of industry representatives and 
 bureaucrats, and I acknowledge that the shadow minister was present. But there were no non-government organisations represented in that official delegation. Team Australia comprised representatives from the `fastest, highest and strongest' members of the private sector, but no representatives of the civil society, the poor or the environment.</para><para>Of course, promotion of our agricultural industry is important—and we acknowledge every right of the minister to pursue these issues—but there was no reason for the Australian agenda to be so limited. We believe the government's refusal to engage in UK or US sponsored discussions on issues of labour standards or human rights at the conference is another stark flaw. It has long been a feature of the international rights debate that developing nations are wary of being subjected to impossible labour, environmental and rights standards. However, the extraordinary reluctance of the Australian government to discuss these issues within the context of trade liberalisation is difficult to comprehend.</para><para>The WTO is often trumpeted as preferable to other international economic and financial institutions due to its democratic working structure and conferral of equal voting rights on all its members. Furthermore, its founding treaty contains an undertaking to protect and preserve the environment and to make positive efforts to assist developing nations. I acknowledge the previous speaker's comments: Senator Cook said a lot of the protesters were protesting against the status quo and that perhaps it would have been in their interests—in his view, not necessarily in that of the Democrats—to achieve change through this forum proceeding and achieving certain outcomes. Yes, this is a very good forum in which to pursue some of these issues, but I guess our concern is that the Australian government does not necessarily see the forum in that broader context.</para><para>So arguments that the WTO is not an appropriate forum for the discussion of these issues is completely contradicted and undermined by the founding documents of that organisation. It is also difficult to see how issues of rights and standards are not linked 
 to trade, when one of the driving forces of globalisation of industry and trade is the lower prices of goods and services across nations and regions caused by lower labour costs. When it is Western multinational corporations that are among those who are most guilty of the perpetration of breaches of human rights and environment and labour standards, arguments that they should not be subjected to the same standards in developing nations as they are in developed nations are hard to maintain.</para><para>The government made it plain on many occasions that it prefers to seek minimalist positions on international standards—as seen in the recent ILO conference in Geneva. Of course, this position is not necessarily reflected when it comes to trade. I was interested to see the comments by Mr Warren Truss last Friday when he stated:</para><para>It would be a tragedy if we were to end up with a weak declaration just so we could get an agreement.</para><para>On the issue of labour standards, the government would prefer the ILO to be the sole organisation charged with their implementation; yet it is well known that the ILO faces some considerable difficulty in discharging this duty and that a permanent dialogue with the WTO would prove beneficial in ensuring that nations adhere to their international commitments.</para><para>Where unanimous international agreement has been secured for a standard, such as the Prohibition of Exploitative Child Labour, ILO Convention No. 182, adopted in June this year by 174 nations, including Australia—more nations than are members of the WTO—every effort should be made to secure rapid ratification and implementation. The WTO is an ideal organisation to assist in this process, and our government's failure to support either the UK or the US initiatives to facilitate this is extremely disappointing.</para><para>The failure of the talks gives nations around the world an opportunity to take stock of the overwhelming protests and anger at the pace and direction of globalisation and to consider the reforms to be made. The Democrats see that there are five key areas for reform of the WTO and urge the government to take these 
 recommendations on board. Primary among these is that trade must be not just free but fair and ethical. The unjust enrichment of the wealthiest nations and corporations should not be part of any international or national agenda. There must be a review of the reforms that have already been implemented, a review of the effect of past trade liberalisation and the development of a permanent dialogue between institutions concerned with the protection of the environment and the implementation of human rights and labour standards.</para><para>There must be a reassessment of the priorities of the international community. Trade is one aspect of life and should not subjugate other values. The enforcement powers of the WTO exceed the powers of almost all other international institutions—bar, perhaps, the UN Security Council—and thus give it inordinate strength. There must be greater transparency if the faith of civil society is ever to be won. The demonstrations in Seattle were not evidence of a lack of faith or a loss of faith but of disgust with a regime that has flourished despite worldwide opposition. There must also be democracy so that communities can have a stake in the process of globalisation, and I do believe that the WTO processes need reform.</para><para>Not only did Team Australia exclude NGOs in the trade liberalisation debate in Seattle; by supporting the Green Room process Australia acted to exclude many developing G77 interests. The Green Room facilitates discussion between only 30 or so countries, and this is clearly inadequate when developing countries need to get differential trade liberalisation and other measures which are sympathetic to the G77 countries' different needs onto the agenda. </para><para>The delegates of developing nations expressed concerns after the talks broke up that the process had not been fair and did not address their concerns. NGO releases at the end of the round in Seattle describe the process as `undemocratic, unjust and unbalanced'. It is clear that the talks failed due to the way the WTO conducts itself. The protesters' messages were very similar. The WTO needs to reform its processes so that trade policy is 
 made in a way that is transparent, fair and balanced.</para><para>I would also like to take the opportunity to raise some of the issues that surrounded the discussion on the creation and use of and trade in GMO products in Seattle—a particular area of concern, no doubt, given the debate on the ANZFA legislation today. The WTO must assess where it is at. Environmental and ethical trading issues should be represented not only at the meeting but also outside on the streets. I do not think we can disregard those demonstrations in Seattle. The demonstrations were telling of a wider shift in global community attitudes in which environment, health, labour and, of course, G77 issues are of top concern. Trade liberalisation is not an end in itself; it facilitates other ends. I think Australia and the Australian government, as well as other countries that participated in the WTO round in Seattle, would do well to remember that.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>11459</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title><page.no>11459</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>11459</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>11459</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the government's response to the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on its enquiry into commercial utilisation of Australian native wildlife.

Key issues which should be foreshadowed within such a study would include: the species most likely to form the basis of sustainable and profitable industries; the management regimes and codes of practice necessary to ensure long term ecological sustainability and long term economic viability and to minimise animal welfare concerns. Key issues would also include marketing, processing and quality control; the range of incentives available to encourage improvements in natural resource management practices; identification of government and other institutional impediments to such changes and the necessary monitoring and evaluation of the impacts resulting from the changes.</para><para>Depending on the outcome of the feasibility study, the Government would work with key stakeholders in one or more rangeland regions to develop a detailed proposal for an on-ground trial in a form suitable for Natural Heritage Trust investment.

The Government considers that any review should encompass all invasive species control programs and recognises that in two years time, more detailed information will be available on various control options and should enable comprehensive cost effectiveness analyses to be undertaken, including with regard to commercial harvesting of pest species.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that the Government monitor the environmental, social and economic impacts of commercial utilisation of wildlife so that a balance sheet can be constructed to assess the full impact of wildlife industries on the Australian economy.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Accept in principle. The use of a balance sheet assessment that incorporates environmental, social, and economic impacts of commercial wildlife use could provide essential information for managing industries that evolve from increased access to wildlife resources.</para><para>Indicators would be an essential component of a balance sheet approach and would need to be agreed by stakeholders and be consistent with existing initiatives. Governments are currently undertaking work in a number of areas that would assist the development of such balance sheets. This includes the Australian Bureau of Statistics' natural resource accounts, the National Forest Inventory and reporting against the Montreal Process criteria and indicators for forests, State of the Environment reporting and the development of environmental indicators. Using the work already being undertaken could contribute to the development of management regimes that recognise the commercial values of wildlife use and assist in the management of broader biodiversity values.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that the Federal Government investigate ways in which private sector investment in biodiversity conservation can be supported and encouraged. In particular, the Committee draws attention to the model of sustain 
 able use of wildlife as used in southern Africa, whereby in some areas ownership of wildlife is transferred to local landowners, and recommends that the Government examine the appropriateness of such a model to biodiversity conservation in Australia.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Accepted. The investigation of increased private sector investment in biodiversity conservation is strongly supported. Systems of management need to be underpinned by analysis of the species concerned, the local environment, determination of the property rights and incentive regimes to support conservation and sustainable use objectives. These will involve investigation of measures to manage risks such as erosion of the gene pool in remnant populations.</para><para>Model systems for private sector investment currently exist in industries based on wildlife use, for example, some fisheries management regimes. The development of an access right regime will enable a market to develop for species of commercial value. This will occur through the incorporation of the necessary conditions to ensure an efficient and effective market for the commercialisation. Flow-on implications for other species will also need to be taken into account. Significant benefits to increased biodiversity conservation values could lead to flow on benefits to other species through habitat improvement, increased availability of funds, improved knowledge and incentive mechanisms for sustainable use.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that State and Federal Governments together review all administrative procedures relating to commercial utilisation of wildlife in Australia with a view to increasing their efficiency so as to ensure that there are no unnecessary hindrances to industry.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Accepted. A review of administrative procedures under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports &amp; Imports) Act 1982 is already underway, with a view to eliminating inefficiencies. This review will include consideration of administrative costs and fees charged to the industries, in line with the Commonwealth's policy on cost recovery.</para><para>The Commonwealth will continue to work cooperatively with State Governments to streamline administrative procedures relating to commercial utilisation of wildlife. Through relevant Ministerial Councils, the Commonwealth will seek the cooperation of the States and Territories to develop more integrated and efficient procedures in this area. Statutory obligations may also be reviewed, where appropriate, to remove duplication. 
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6</inline></para><para>The Committee believes that governments should make greater efforts to recognise the contributions made by amateur biologists. The Committee recommends to Federal and State Governments that they review wildlife regulations with a view to facilitating the work of professional and amateur scientists, so that they can actively contribute to biodiversity conservation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>The Government is strongly supportive of, and encourages broad community involvement in, all aspects of biodiversity conservation. Through the Natural Heritage Trust, funding and other support is provided for a broad range of activities which target the full range of environmental and natural resource issues facing Australia. Scientific research can have significant long-term benefits to biodiversity conservation, and the government is keen to ensure that professional and amateur scientists can actively contribute to biodiversity conservation. The Government also acknowledges that indigenous people have considerable traditional ecological expertise and that this knowledge should be respected.</para><para>Through the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council , the Commonwealth Government will encourage the States and Territories to review wildlife regulations and amend any that inhibit legitimate scientists and others in the community from contributing to our knowledge of Australia's biological diversity. However, in undertaking such a review it will be necessary to ensure that biodiversity conservation is maintained, access to biological resources is equitable, and that where access gives rise to private benefit, the community receives an appropriate share of that benefit.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 7</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that codes of practice relating to wildlife industries should: (1) be in place prior to approval being given for an industry to commence operations; (2) have a clear connection between licensing conditions and compliance with a code of practice so that failure to comply results in a withdrawal of the licence; (3) be consistent between the states; and (4) where several codes apply to the same industry, be consistent between codes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Accepted. It is noted that this recommendation accords with the general thrust of discussions in the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare on this issue. The Government recognises that codes evolve over time and that a code introduced at the time of approval of an industry will need to be reconsidered in light of new knowledge, including that gained as a result of the operation of 
 the industry. Codes must also be broadly based so they do not favour or penalise particular industries. It is also recognised that a number of animal use industries are including animal welfare codes into Quality Assurance Programs. This is an effective mechanism to ensure best practice and compliance with codes of practice and will be encouraged.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 8</inline></para><para>The Committee believes that these factors point strongly to the conclusion that the current prohibitionist policy does not work to protect wildlife from illegal activities, although the extent to which it does not work, is difficult to ascertain. The Committee notes that the Federal Government is currently undertaking a review of all environmental legislation. The Committee recommends that the Government include in that review consideration of other policy options for Wildlife Protection.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Accepted in principle. The Consultation Paper on the Reform of Environment Legislation, released in February 1998, included proposals to amend the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. However, these proposals were not included in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill, pending the report of this Senate Inquiry. The Government has, in its election platform, made a commitment to amend the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. The reforms recommended by the Senate Committee, including implementing administrative arrangements that protect wildlife from illegal activities, will be carefully considered in drafting amendments to this legislation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 9</inline></para><para>The Committee believes that the Government should act wherever possible to support legitimate small businesses in Australia, and therefore recommends that Environment Australia give priority to resolving problems relating to the sale and export of coral and shells, so as to assist industry.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Accepted. The Government is in the process of implementing new arrangements for trade in corals and shells. These arrangements will assist the coral industry to legally harvest and export its product, and will substantially decrease the administrative burden on the shell trade without reducing the level of control of the trade in species of shells vulnerable to overharvesting.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 10</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends a remote Aboriginal community be invited to carry out a trial survey of the levels of subsistence wildlife use, and its impact on biodiversity, supported by a grant through the Natural Heritage Trust. 
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Considerable work has already been conducted to investigate subsistence use of wildlife, particularly in northern Australia, primarily focused on the identification of utilisation patterns. What is now needed are strategic studies to set utilisation patterns in an ecological context, including an examination of the long term impacts upon biodiversity of various utilisation patterns, and impacts other than subsistence use by traditional communities. It is also desirable to measure the effects on biodiversity of the absence of traditional use. Studies should include analysis of the full economic benefits, and the cultural importance to society of subsistence use. In addition, any study needs to be undertaken with the full cooperation of the community, respecting their rights, and agreement with the community about use of information gained during a study is essential. Commonwealth assistance through the Natural Heritage Trust could be made available for appropriate studies.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 11</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that Aboriginal people should be consulted where commercial opportunities are identified on lands where there are communities that have strong traditional links to the lands.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Accepted. On lands owned or managed by indigenous communities it is well accepted that any commercial use should occur only after consultation. The Government considers it important to fully involve indigenous communities in any proposals where commercial opportunities are identified on lands where there are traditional links.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 12</inline></para><para>The Committee believes that the importance of intellectual property rights of Aboriginal people in relation to the use of wildlife has not received sufficient recognition, and the Committee recommends that the Federal government give greater attention to this issue.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>Accepted in principle. Traditional knowledge of biodiversity has benefited Australian society and continues to do so, but historically, the value of indigenous peoples traditional knowledge could be perceived as having been largely ignored, with the sources of knowledge often not acknowledged, and rarely benefiting. Current intellectual property rights regimes may not offer sufficient protection to the holders of traditional (indigenous) knowledge because the two concepts are largely incompatible under Australian law. There may also be tension between the publication requirements of statutory intellectual property rights and any desire indigenous communities have to keep knowledge secret. 
</para><para>The Government supports efforts to engage key stakeholders, including indigenous communities, in widespread discussions aimed at resolving this issue. This may include using the intellectual property system to protect traditional knowledge; eg confidential information, protection and recognition through contract law, and the possibilities of developing a new class of proprietary rights, or new classes of transfer agreement.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Statement by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator the Hon Robert Hill, in relation to the Report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on `Commercial Utilisation of Australian Native Wildlife'.</inline></para><para>I am pleased to present to the Parliament, the Government's response to the recommendations contained in the Report of Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee Inquiry into Commercial Utilisation of Australian Native Wildlife.</para><para>I am indebted to the Committee for their significant efforts in providing a constructive contribution to the consideration of this issue. The Committee received over 340 submissions, and took evidence from over 100 witnesses and groups of witnesses at 14 public hearings around Australia. The submissions and evidence presented to the Committee clearly highlight the wide divergence of views within the Australian community about the ethical desirability of the commercial use of wildlife. Despite this obvious lack of a broad consensus amongst Australians, the Committee has developed a series of recommendations that seek to balance the sometimes-competing demands for conservation and ecologically sustainable use of our wildlife resources. The recommendations also seek to streamline government regulation of these activities to make it more efficient and effective.</para><para>Not surprisingly, the Report identifies that the future of biodiversity conservation in Australia now depends very much on finding mechanisms to ensure that natural habitat on private land is preserved and restored. Valuing natural habitat as an economic resource will certainly assist it to be fully respected and conserved. It concludes that, if appropriately managed, commercial utilisation of wildlife may be a mechanism of achieving that respect and conservation. This is consistent with the principles accepted by all Governments in Australia through the adoption of the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia's Biological Diversity in 1996.</para><para>The Report also correctly identifies that the challenge for government agencies, entrepreneurs, and conservation groups is to manage wildlife use so as to minimise the environmental risks and maximise the benefits to biodiversity conservation. It notes that proposals for harvesting and ranching of our 
 wildlife need to be considered on a case-by-case basis, and comprehensive management plans developed which take into account a cost benefit analysis of other land uses, and other mechanisms for preserving habitat. In keeping with the predominant view expressed to the Committee, animal welfare considerations must factor highly in any utilisation regime.</para><para>One key area highlighted by the Report as requiring attention is the issue of property or access rights to wildlife. It notes a lack of clarity as to what constitutes rights (including indigenous or Native Title rights) in wildlife, and that these rights are in practice difficult to define and are not consistent across Australia. It suggests that by assigning property or access rights, wildlife would become an asset rather than a liability to the landholder, and that if landholders receive a financial reward for living with wildlife and bearing the cost to society of maintaining natural resources this may encourage conservation. This view is consistent with the draft National Principles and Guidelines for Rangeland Management.</para><para>The issue of Native Title rights is of fundamental importance in considerations of wildlife use systems. While the scope of every native title right in Australia has not yet been clarified, the Native Title Act 1993 essentially provides a framework for the recognition and protection of native title rights and interests, rather than replacing the common law with some statutory scheme of rights to land. The Government recognises that access, and knowledge and input to the use of resources on the land is important to native titleholders, and agrees with the Committee's recommendation that indigenous people be consulted and given the opportunity to express their views about certain proposed land use activities.</para><para>The Report examines a number of established wildlife industries, such as crocodile and emu farming, kangaroo and wildflower harvesting, aviculture and bush food, and makes a number of constructive proposals for their management. It also alerts Governments to the fact that, if the `user pays' principle is not kept firmly in mind, industries based on commercial utilisation of wildlife have the potential to impact on the public sector in high administrative costs. It notes that mechanisms are needed to ensure that commercial utilisation of wildlife does not result in a net economic loss to society, and that there is a need to fully and publicly monitor all costs.</para><para>The Committee has made 12 specific recommendations aimed at streamlining government regulation of the commercial use of wildlife and ensuring ecologically sustainable use of our wildlife resources. The broad thrust of the Committee's recommendations is endorsed by the Government and will be achieved through the responses outlined 
 in this document. Implementation of the recommendations will remain consistent with Australia's international obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity, and also the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.</para><para>The Committee has recognised that regulation of wildlife use lies mostly within the ambit of State government control, and that any implementation of its recommendations can only occur with State government cooperation. Through relevant Ministerial Councils, the Commonwealth will encourage the States and Territories, and work with them to implement those recommendations that require cooperative action.</para><para>Some of the Committee's recommendations are already being implemented or can be implemented in the near future while others, because of the extent of the work involved in their development and/or higher priorities requiring more immediate attention, are of a medium to longer term nature.</para><para>The improvements that will be gained from the Government's response to this report include improved efficiency and responsiveness of operations under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act, greater public transparency, and ensuring that world's best practice standards and methods are employed in managing the commercial use of Australia's native fauna and flora. The Government has already given an undertaking to review the Wildlife Protection Act to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. The Senate report provides a well-defined framework within which this review will occur.</para><para>Through its response to this Report, the Government has demonstrated that it places a high priority on wildlife conservation and on ensuring that it is addressed in a transparent, responsive, efficient and scientifically rigorous way. It has also demonstrated its commitment to improving administrative efficiency and removing unnecessary hindrances and constraints to legitimate industries.</para><para>I am confident that the approach outlined in the Government's response will not only maintain our strong record in protection and conservation of Australia's native wildlife, but will also ensure improved protection for those species into the next century.</para><para>In closing, I would like to express my gratitude to the members of the Committee for this comprehensive report, and for the insightful comments and recommendations made in relation to wildlife harvesting and regulation in Australia.</para><para>I commend this response to the Parliament.</para><para>ROBERT HILL</para><para>Minister for Environment and Heritage

 responses to Senate and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.</para><para>The practice of presenting this list to the Senate follows the resolution of the Senate of 14 March 1973 and the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the then Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the then incoming government. The then Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently, on 16 October 1991 the former Government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The current Government in June 1996 affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation.</para><para>The list does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the following Senate Standing Committees: Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Privileges, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances and Scrutiny of Bills. However, such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes which are tabled by the committee. Where a response has been made by way of Finance Minute, the date of presentation has been appropriately annotated.</para><para>Legislation committees report on bills and on the provisions of bills. Only those reports in this category that make recommendations which cannot readily be implemented through the bill, and therefore require a response, are listed. The list also does not include reports by legislation committees on estimates or scrutiny of annual reports.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">A guide to the legend used in the `Date response presented/made to the Senate' column</inline></para><para>*	 See document tabled in the Senate on 8 December 1999, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Government Responses to Parliamentary Committee Reports-Response to the schedule tabled by the Deputy President on 30 June 1999</inline> , for Government interim/final response.

the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Estonia and Sweden, which took place from 24 October to 29 October 1999. In doing so, I would like to pay tribute to the members of the delegation: my deputy, Senator John Watson; Mr Laurie Ferguson, the member for Reid; Mrs De-Anne Kelly, the member for Dawson; Mr Gary Nairn, the member for Eden-Monaro; Senator the Hon. Nick Sherry, a senator for Tasmania; and the parliamentary committee secretary to the delegation, Mr Richard Selth, who is from the Senate committee on the environment. This was a short trip of six days in total to the two countries, but it was a very busy, enjoyable and interesting one. It was only the second delegation from the Australian parliament to actually get in to visit the parliament of Estonia—the first one was led by Mr Stephen Martin about four or five years ago—since the recommencement of independence in 1991 following the with 
 drawal of the former Soviet Union from that country.</para></talk.start><para>This was a country that was left rather impoverished by the former Soviet Union and its regime, but the people there are making great strides in their efforts to catch up. They have applied for entry into the European Union. They are one of five countries that are in a group involved in discussions and negotiations that are taking place that may result in their getting next entry into the European Union. They regard that as a very important milestone. They regard having an economy that enables them to make the choice as to whether they become members of the monetary union or not as very important to them as well.</para><para>We were extremely honoured in Estonia to be given an audience with the President of Estonia, Mr Meri, and to hear the stories not just of Mr Meri but of other people who had suffered and been incarcerated and exiled because of their opposition to the Soviet regime and because of their great love of and desire for freedom and democracy. Their stories were almost chilling for us, as we come from a democracy where no blood has been spilt and no hardship has been endured to gain democracy, and where we regard elections as a bit ho-hum and run-of-the-mill. For them, an election is very important. For them, democracy is sacred and of the utmost importance.</para><para>We also had the honour to be escorted by the Honorary Consul-General of the Republic of Estonia to Australia, Dr Malle Tohver, who spent the time with us when we were in Estonia. We appreciated her making the effort to come back to Estonia to accompany the delegation. One of the highlights was that, as entertainment on the Monday night, they arranged for us to attend a piano recital by Vladimir Ashkenazy, one of the world's noted pianists. It was really fantastic. We were all 
 rather tired and jet lagged but were kept awake by this beautiful music and wonderful pianist. We certainly appreciated the honour of attending that recital.</para><para>With a guide, we were able to explore the old town of Tallinn, which is a medieval city surrounded by all the old buildings from the Soviet time, so there is a huge contrast. The weather was cold but the hospitality and welcome were very warm. We certainly appreciated that.</para><para>The contrast between Estonia and Sweden is very marked. Sweden is a democracy—it is a monarchy—and has been for many years. It is one of the original democracies. The political system is established and is very much a consensus style of democracy. They regard their style of consensus as very important. We spent a day at the Riksdag, the parliament of Sweden, and observed proceedings of the parliament, as we had done in Estonia. Also, we were able to meet with a number of the parliamentary committees, of which there are many, and hold discussions with them. The amazing thing about both Estonia and Sweden was the very limited use we made of interpreters. The command of English by all members of the committees was high. I think some of them spoke better English than did the Australian delegation.</para><para>We did not spend all of our time in Sweden in Stockholm. We went down to Orebro and were able to inspect a lead and zinc mine, Zinkgruvan, owned by North Limited, which is, of course, an Australian company. It was very interesting to see that mine and, for me, to contrast that with the silver, lead and zinc mine at Broken Hill. It is a huge contrast and was very interesting for us all. We also met the Governor of Orebro and had luncheon with her in her castle, which is quite magnificent. She is also a very interesting lady to talk to.</para><para>On the final day, we had a half-day trip up to Uppsala, which is the home town of Birgitta Dahl, who is the Speaker of the Riksdag. It was very interesting to see her home area, to visit the university there—it is the major university in Sweden—and also to visit the library and look at some of the original botanical drawings by Solander, who 
 came with Banks on the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> voyages. It was a very interesting time.</para><para>We were accompanied throughout by Stephen Brady, the Australian Ambassador to Sweden; in both Sweden and Estonia by Rick Nimmo, who is the first secretary of the embassy; and also by Andrea Gleason from the embassy, who was very much involved with the program for the spouses in Stockholm and the Swedish side of the visit.</para><para>I would like to pay a great tribute to our embassy in Stockholm. It is only small but covers something like six or seven countries in that region. From the reception that our embassy officials were getting, it is quite obvious that they work exceedingly hard. They are on top of all the issues and are making sure that Australia's presence is felt and that Australia's point of view is raised. We were certainly able to hold discussions with the two countries about the commitments of other countries besides Australia in East Timor. We should be very proud of the work of our embassy in Stockholm because it is a very hardworking embassy. I commend the embassy staff for the efforts that they made to make sure our trip was very enjoyable.</para><para>The report, I am pleased to say, is out in a speedy fashion. I thank Richard Selth for the many hours he has spent on it. I would also like to pay tribute to the hospitality that was extended to us and arranged by the Speaker of the Riksdag and the Speaker of the Riigikogu in Estonia and to say thank you to them for the efforts they made. It was a very enlightening trip. We learnt a lot more about those countries, and I think they learnt a lot more about us. With those remarks, on behalf of everybody I would say thank you for this timely report to the parliament.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Italy</title><title>Inter-parliamentary Conference, Berlin</title><page.no>11474</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>11474</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I present the report of a parliamentary delegation to Italy on 2 to 8 October 1999 and to the 102nd inter-parliamentary conference in Berlin on 9 to 16 October 1999. I had the unexpected honour of leading the Australian parliamentary deleg 
 ation to Italy from 2 to 8 October and to the 102nd inter-parliamentary conference in Berlin from 9 to 16 October 1999. I stood in for the designated leader, the Hon. Alex Somlyay, who unfortunately became ill on the way over to Rome and could not continue with the delegation. His presence was greatly missed on the delegation. The delegation closed ranks and achieved its aims and objectives in a way that brought great credit to Australia.</para></talk.start><para>In speaking this afternoon, I take this opportunity to embarrass Mr Neil Bessell, who is sitting at the table in front of you, Madam Acting Deputy President. Mr Bessell is a wonderful individual with an extraordinary ability to remain calm in sometimes volatile situations. I mention Mr Bessell because he was the secretary to the delegation. He performed that duty in an extremely diligent fashion, which was a credit to him and the Senate in general. His good counsel, which was sought by many during our visit to both Berlin and Italy, was much appreciated by all who received it.</para><para>If he was not such an asset to the Senate chamber, I suggest that Mr Bessell might make a wonderful diplomat for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I publicly take this opportunity to thank Neil for the assistance given to this delegation and other IPU delegations. I am sure that you will agree, Madam Acting Deputy President, what an asset he is to the parliament, to these delegations and to the IPU. He will be missed by the IPU itself. Well done, Neil. It is a credit to you. We will miss you on the next delegation for the IPU conference, which will be held in Oman and Jordan.</para><para>I will return to the report while Neil recovers his composure. The visit to Italy was productive, highly informative and indeed enjoyable. There is no doubt that relations between Australia and Italy, based as they are on trade and migration, are well-established and harmonious. This relationship is reinforced by the fact that Italy has committed 600 defence personnel to the Australian-led INTERFET mission in East Timor. I can assure senators that the delegation took every opportunity to express the appreciation of the 
 Australian parliament and the people of this nation for this commitment and to reinforce the need for a sustained commitment over the coming years so that East Timor takes its place in the international community. In this regard, the delegation was encouraged by the comments from Senator Toia, the undersecretary for foreign affairs.</para><para>The Italian program for the visit focused initially upon Florence and Tuscany, a regional area with strong links to Australia. Florence has sister city status with Sydney. Yarn and fabric manufacturers import fine quality Australian wool and wine and olive oil producers export to Australia and closely liaise with our local manufacturers. The program then moved to Rome, where arrangements had been made for the delegation to meet the speaker of the Italian Chamber of Deputies and hold extensive discussions with the chairs and members of six parliamentary committees.</para><para>The delegation also participated in a public audience and was received by His Holiness Pope John Paul II at St Peter's Square in the Vatican. On a personal note, with my interest in migration and citizenship matters, I found most interesting our meeting with Senator Toia, the undersecretary for foreign affairs. We discussed in detail constitutional reforms in Italy to establish a parliamentary electorate for Italians abroad and its implications for Australia.</para><para>While this meeting was occurring, other members of the delegation were meeting with Monsignor Migliore, the undersecretary for relations with states for the Holy See. I know that my colleague Senator Hogg particularly found this a valuable opportunity to explain Australia's position on East Timor. The delegation is very grateful to a number of people, including the Italian parliament and the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, for the hospitality rendered to the delegation whilst there. We are also very grateful to the Australian ambassador to Italy, His Excellency Rory Steele, and particularly Mr Phillip Stonehouse and other staff at the embassy. We thank them sincerely for their assistance during our visit to Italy.</para><para>The report I have just presented also records the delegation's contribution to the work of the 102nd inter-parliamentary conference in Berlin. I am pleased to indicate that the Australian delegation took a leading role in the IPU's deliberations and resolutions. This contribution is summarised on page 26 of the delegation report and includes Australia submitting a memorandum and draft resolutions on the need to revise the current global financial and economic muddle. Mrs Gallus, a member of the delegation from the other place, participated in the debate and chaired the drafting committee on the topic.</para><para>Australia submitted a memorandum and draft resolution on the contribution of parliaments to ensuring respect for, and promoting international humanitarian law on, the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Geneva conventions. I participated in this debate. For my sins, I ended up chairing the drafting committee on the topic.</para><para>Senator Hogg participated in the debate on the supplementary item to the agenda. This involved the contribution of parliaments to the peaceful coexistence of ethnic, cultural and religious minorities, including migrant populations, within one state marked by tolerance and full respect for human rights. Mrs Crosio and Mrs Gallus participated in the meeting of women parliamentarians. Mrs Crosio and Mr Barresi contributed to the general debate held during the conference. Both of them spoke on the situation in East Timor. Finally, I was elected to the vice-presidency of the second committee on parliamentary, judicial and human rights questions.</para><para>The IPU is about dialogue and goodwill between parliamentarians. The delegation was pleased to hold specific meetings with members of the Yugoslav and Indonesian IPU delegations. The level of participation was certainly in keeping with the commitment and contributions of previous delegations. We are actively exploring the possibility of expanding Australia's profile at this important international parliamentary forum. The report rightly acknowledges the contributions of many people in Australia, Italy and Berlin who assisted the delegation. There are a couple of 
 people apart from Mr Bessell that I will single out for special mention.</para><para>I would particularly like to acknowledge on the record Rosa Ferranda and Janice Scarrabotolo, officers of the Department of the Senate, who translated into Italian a three-page brochure including biographies on the delegates. The brochure was greatly appreciated by our hosts and assisted the delegation so much that we ran out of them on the second day of our visit. It is a lesson for the future. I would also like to recognise the continuing assistance that delegations such as ours receive from Brenda Herd in the Parliamentary Relations Office and Judith Kelly in Senate finance.</para><para>Delegations cannot be successful if members of the delegation do not work together, particularly in circumstances such as when we lost our leader on the way over. I thank the acting deputy leader of the delegation, Mrs Gallus, and my other colleagues Mrs Crosio, Mr Barresi and Senator Hogg for their cooperation and commitment. I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>11476</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title><page.no>11476</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>11476</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>11476</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I wish to return to the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the commercial utilisation of Australian native wildlife. I missed the call by about 10 seconds. If I had continued my tennis on a Thursday morning, I would have made it. That is life, as they say.</para></talk.start><para>I wanted to speak briefly on this report because it is one where the Democrats welcome very much the government's response in this area. I certainly welcome the way in which the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Robert Hill, and his office have dealt with this report and their positive response to it. It is good to work with the government or with anyone in this place when you get such a positive response and a response that is not necessarily political, al 
 though politics play a part in everything. The Senate report's recommendations were taken at face value and were responded to in terms of what was proposed.</para><para>The inquiry was conducted over 18 months and took over 300 written submissions. It reported in June last year. The report called for an overhaul of wildlife protection laws, stronger animal welfare codes of conduct and study of indigenous subsistence use of native wildlife. I chaired the committee and it was, at times, a very controversial committee. The report did not please everybody, but it is an ongoing issue. That is why I am very happy to respond to the government's response to this report.</para><para>I believe that Australia's native wildlife populations are our most precious assets, but the laws on native wildlife protection across the various states and between the states and the Commonwealth are a dog's breakfast. That has been recognised. I note that the federal government has accepted eight of the Senate report's 12 recommendations. It has not rejected the other four. This is a real chance to fix the problems which the report highlighted. I am glad to say it is one report that has not gathered dust on the shelf but has been responded to in a very positive way. I would like to highlight three of the issues that were raised to illustrate what I am saying.</para><para>One of the recommendations was that the federal government should conduct a feasibility study for a trial of large-scale native wildlife farming to see whether large-scale native wildlife farming could replace domestic species in the Australian rangelands. This was a recommendation from Dr Graham Webb of the Northern Territory. I am glad that the government has proposed a series of steps whereby this could be taken up.</para><para>Another one of the recommendations was to encourage private sector investment in biodiversity conservation. Senator Lyn Allison from the Democrats has already visited a number of the sanctuaries run by Dr John Walmsley, specifically Warrawong in Adelaide and Yookamurra in South Australia. This has been with the encouragement of Senator Hill so that we can begin to take up that particular recommendation.</para><para>Finally, we recommended that there should be inclusion of indigenous people where commercial opportunities related to wildlife were identified on those lands where indigenous people have strong traditional links to the land and also that there should be a discussion of the intellectual property rights of indigenous people aimed at resolving the flaws in existing legislation. In relation to that, there has been the High Court decision in the case of Murrandoo Yanner about his right to hunt traditional animals on his traditional land. That is a very controversial decision of the High Court which highlights the need for the government to pursue this issue.</para><para>I am glad that the government has responded positively. I am very happy to receive the government's response. I will have to study it in much more detail. This is an initial response. If I have any criticisms, I guess there will be an opportunity later on to raise those. But my initial response is a very positive one in terms of what was tabled by the minister today.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>11477</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>11477</page.no><name role="metadata">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Knowles)</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President has received a letter from a party leader seeking variations to the membership of certain committees.</para></talk.start><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Minchin</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><para>That senators be discharged from and appointed to committees as follows:</para><para>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation and References Committees—</para><para>	 Participating member: Senator Hutchins</para><para>Legal and Constitutional References Committee—</para><para>	 Substitute member: Senator Crossin to replace Senator Ludwig for the committee's inquiry into the Government's response to the recommendations of the report, <inline font-style="italic">Bringing Them Home</inline></para><para>	 Participating members:</para><para>	 Senator Crossin for the committee's inquiry into matters arising from the introduction of the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999

The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Robert Hill, has indicated that there are difficulties because of the complexity of costing the amendments, which would, for example, extend tax deductibility to any value lost on a property or reasons of covenanting to protect native vegetation and so on. There is 
 also some assessment to be done with the proposal in amendments coming next that the tax deductibility be allowed to be spread over five years. If a donor of a block of land for environmental purposes values that land at $1 million and the land is of high environmental value, it is logical that they get the same benefits as somebody who donates a painting which is worth $1 million. Under legislation, the person who denotes the painting will be able to spread tax deductibility over five years, obviously gaining benefits from that, but the person who donates the block of land—part of the national heritage—will not get that advantage.</para></talk.start><para>Let me reiterate how important this legislation is and my earlier commendation of Senator Hill for bringing it into this place. It is breakthrough legislation, because for the first time it means that a citizen who donates a block of land—which has rare and endangered species or which is of great heritage amenity to the nation—to an entity like the Australian Bush Heritage Fund or the several trusts in various states set up specifically to look after land in perpetuity, with the purpose of protecting an ecosystem or some feature or living entity—wildlife or plant life—will know that it is going to be protected forever. The idea here, to shorthand it, is to ensure that people who make donations towards private national parks where there is a guarantee that they are going to be protected in perpetuity will get a tax advantage from that. Two days ago we were discussing in here and I was opposing a change in the diesel fuel grant system—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Well done!

I was opposing a change in that system that gives a tax break if you want to put diesel in your bulldozer and go ripping into the forests. How much more important it is from my point of view that we give a tax break to somebody who wants to protect forests and donates land to an entity like the Australian Bush Heritage Fund. I support the amendments, but I am concerned that this process may lead to us seeing, tomorrow, a rejection of these amendments in the Reps—not because they are not meritorious but 
 because the Treasury has not yet worked out how to do the assessments of what this will cost.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Hill has flagged that he has amendments that next year will cover much of this field. Maybe we could hear a little more about what is intended there so that it is on the record and we have some more concrete reassurance that the excellent measures involved in these Democrat and Green amendments are not simply going to be consigned to oblivion. There it is. On the one hand, I do not want to see the legislation fail. On the other hand, I do not want to see the amendments, which obviously have the majority support in this committee, dismissed and put on the sideboard. I think that in the next 24 hours we have to come to a pretty honest arrangement about that so that all interests are best served and, in particular, this breakthrough legislation is not consigned to oblivion. It is too important for that. Once again—it is rare that I am in the position of being able to do this—I congratulate the minister for bringing the legislation forward.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>11479</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Following on from the comments Senator Brown has made, I note that he did challenge the government that Senator Hill amplify and clarify his earlier statement.

That is an important issue because the costings on this measure under this legislation are $71 million or $72 million—that is a fair amount of money—and it is a broad new principle that the Prime Minister has personally championed and it is important to be able to identify what the value for money is.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So, from a Labor perspective, it is important that we are able to see that X amount goes to education, X amount goes to health, X amount might go to land conservation and are then able to look at the cost in terms of expenditures in the budget.

This is an important question for the opposition. I raised the issue of what occurs in the United States. When organisations receive some sort of philanthropic contribution, the information is readily accessible. The organisations that have received the donations are required by law, as I understand it, to provide that detail publicly if requests are made. I think that is a reasonable approach. It adds to transparency and to the community's knowledge of where the 
 money is going. I also think it would assist in minimising misuse, evasion or tax minimisation schemes that could possibly emerge as a consequence of this approach. Again, I wonder if the government has thought any more about this issue of greater transparency and access to information. It is related to the issue of the tax office doing some sort of examination from its perspective, from a government perspective, of where the money goes to.

If the minister is willing to give those categorical assurances, I have indicated that the matter is finished.</para></talk.start><para>Perhaps the Treasurer could write a letter and make this absolutely clear. I think very many Australians would be concerned if today we find that we are dealing with important legislation in  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999  which leaves another loophole through which the Liberal Party or the Greenfields Foundation—for that matter, perhaps any political party—could do this. Unfortunately it is the Liberal Party that has the form on this. It is the Liberal Party that has used a vehicle known as the Greenfields Foundation. Wouldn't it be a most appalling development in Australian public life if, in the name of philanthropy, the Liberal Party exploited this provision? All I want is to be assured that that is not going to happen.</para><para>If you can give that assurance now, Senator Kemp, as the responsible minister at the table in this debate, the matter is finished. That is all I want—an assurance that we are not going to have the Greenfields Foundation, which is a charitable trust, exploit the provisions in the bill in the way that I have outlined. It is very possible, because you have said that a charitable trust can receive a tax deductible donation. That is what you indicated clearly to the chamber. You have told us that; I accept that.</para><para>We also know that the Greenfields Foundation is a charitable trust, and I want to be assured that, under the terms of this legislation, the Greenfields Foundation will not be a prescribed fund for the purposes of this act. The reason I want to be assured is that I do not want individuals or corporations donating money or gifts to the Greenfields Foundation and receiving tax deductibility for that, and for this to be effectively a money laundering exercise for the Liberal Party. This would mean that not only would these entities not be 
 disclosed—which of course is the intention and purpose for the establishment of the Greenfields Foundation in the first instance—although they should be if you are interested in defending the integrity of the Electoral Act and of the electoral law in this country, but also the donors would receive tax deductibility.</para><para>This is an important issue and I hope that other senators in the chamber share my concerns. I know that in the past Senator Bartlett, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, and Senator Brown have shared the concerns that have been expressed by the opposition. All you have to do is give us an assurance, Senator Kemp. That is all I want: an assurance. If you cannot give it, then I want you to get the assurance from the Treasurer, Mr Costello. If we receive that assurance, I think that will put many minds in the community at rest.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>11486</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is a fantastic proposition.

As I see it, the issue is not so much about how much tax deductibility a particular foundation might be able to get if they give money to a political party but that people who give money to that foundation may be able to claim substantial tax deductions.</para></talk.start><para>Perhaps we could move away from the Greenfields Foundation and Senator Kemp could think of it in the context of perhaps the Labor Party being back in office and having the `Redfields Foundation' established and using it in ways that he might be concerned about.

If I understand it correctly, that seems to be the concern that Senator Faulkner is raising.

</para><para>So do not start talking about $100 donations or any other form of donation. The Greenfields Foundation claims—take my word for it—let me quote again:</para><para>The Foundation has not and cannot make payments to political parties—this is prohibited by its deed.</para><para>Those are their words. I will be seeking leave to table that in a moment. Recently the Greenfields Foundation—on its letterhead, C/- Post Office Box 52, Deakin West, ACT—under the signature of Mr Anthony J. Bandle for the trustees, wrote another letter to the Australian Electoral Commissioner. They are getting into deeper water here all the time. Senator Kemp might not know that but I think a lot of other Australians do. They wrote this letter to the Electoral Commissioner, and one of the paragraphs said:</para><para>Your letter appears to assume—</para><para>this is from the Greenfields Foundation to the Australian Electoral Commissioner, `your letter' being the Electoral Commissioner's—</para><para>that the obligations of associated entities extend to the Trustees of the Foundation. However, that assumption is based on a misconception as to the purposes of the Foundation. The Foundation is a Trust Fund, established for charitable purposes, administered by the Trustees.</para><para>That is what they claim to be—a charitable trust: `A trust fund established for charitable purposes administered by the trustees.' These are not my words; these are the words of Mr Bandle for the trustees. So what we are dealing with here, to try to explain this to you, Senator Kemp, is a foundation called the Greenfields Foundation which, to get around the disclosure provisions in the Electoral Act, has loaned to the Liberal Party on the most generous of commercial arrangements a very large amount of money. It has also donated to charities a very small amount of money. So it is not making direct donations—as you and I would understand the dictionary definition of `donations'—it is loaning massive amounts of money to the Liberal Party. That is the way it tried to get around the disclosure provisions of the act. That is why what you are saying is a total and absolute nonsense. Perhaps you might now understand that particular point.</para><para>But let us go on. What I am concerned about is the capacity for either a private individual or a corporation to provide a donation or a gift to the Greenfields Foundation and for that organisation or private individual to be able to benefit under these provisions as a prescribed private fund not only to cover up the fact that it has made the donation but to actually receive tax deductibility for the donation. That is the issue. The more I hear Senator Kemp respond, the more I become worried that there is something here to cover up. First of all, what I came in here to do, you would be interested to know, Mr Temporary Chairman, was to get an assurance from this minister. But, of course, it has not been forthcoming. It is hard to believe the minister could be as dopey as he is, trying to pretend to the committee that he does not understand either the bill that he is responsible for shepherding through the committee today or the electoral law in this country.</para><para>That is the issue. It is on that issue that I want to receive a commitment from the minister at the table because the Greenfields Foundation says it is a charitable trust, and that means—and the minister made it absolutely clear—that it can receive tax deductible donations. All I want to do is ensure that the Treasurer, who can quite clearly declare in writing the Greenfields Foundation not to be a prescribed fund for the purposes of the act, will do so. All I want to hear is that the Treasurer will do so, so that we do not have a further effort from the Liberal Party of Australia or any of these shonky, dodgy front organisations, like the Greenfields Foundation, to subvert the disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act. It is easily done. </para><para>The Treasurer can declare in writing in relation to the Greenfields Foundation that it is not to be a prescribed fund. That is all that has to happen. If the minister at the table will give that commitment and if we see that from Treasurer, it will certainly satisfy me. And from the spirit of what I heard from Senator Bartlett, who is engaged in the debate, I assume it would satisfy him also, who nods. That is all you have to do, Minister. If you can do that, we can get on with it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>11489</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have just had another pathetic rant from the discredited Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.

I quote from this letter directly:</para></talk.start></continue><para>The foundation is a trust fund established for charitable purposes administered by the trustees.</para><para>That is what the trustees themselves say on their own letterhead in a letter dated 15 January 1998 and sent to the Electoral Commissioner.</para><para>That has been reinforced in a range of other publicly available documents by the trustees of the foundation. It has also been a matter about which the trustees have speculated publicly. One trustee, Mr Bandle, is quoted as saying that the Greenfields Foundation is set up as a charitable trust. That is one reason why this organisation has raised so many concerns in the public arena.</para><para>We know that the Greenfields Foundation is a charitable trust; it says so itself. We know that there is now a capacity, if this bill is passed unamended, for a prescribed private fund to be prescribed by the income tax assessment regulations. This will mean that there will be tax deductibility for donations and gifts for such organisations. I am concerned about that. It offends a number of very important principles that I think are matters of great concern for the chamber.</para><para>I have sought a categorical commitment from the minister to try and get over this problem. I have sought a categorical commitment from the minister that the Greenfields Foundation will not be a prescribed fund for the purposes of this act. I have sought confirmation from the minister in those terms—he would not give it. I have tried to seek confirmation from the minister, given that we are aware that either the Treasurer or the Assist 
 ant Treasurer would have to regulate. I asked him a question about that, though he claims I did not raise the issue of regulation. I asked him who would regulate and he indicated to us that either the Treasurer or the Assistant Treasurer would make the regulations in this regard. He has forgotten that, but that is all right. We know he is a bit off the ball on some of this stuff.</para><para>We also know that the Treasurer can declare in writing that a fund like the Greenfields Foundation not be a prescribed fund for the purposes of the act. If we got that commitment, we could move on. The Assistant Treasurer would not give that commitment. We made it clear to the Assistant Treasurer, eventually, after some time behind the play on the bill—and I think it was understood—that the prescribed funds, the charitable trusts in this instance, would be identified by name in a regulation. I suggested we have a separate regulation for the Greenfields Foundation so that if it was regulated under the Income Tax Assessment Act regulations, then that could be disallowed by the Senate. Again, it was just another way of moving on.</para><para>How many times do you have to offer the Assistant Treasurer a bit of help? How can you help someone who appears unable to help himself? These offers have been made. The Assistant Treasurer, on behalf of the government, is willing to accept none of them. It is very difficult to come to any other conclusion than that the government's intention is to try and shonk its way through in relation to the Greenfields Foundation and to allow a vehicle for either private individuals or major corporations or companies to provide donations to a shonky organisation like the Greenfields Foundation. The donors themselves receive tax deductibility and, of course, there is no public transparency in this. There is no disclosure of those donations and the donors get tax deductibility. That is not good enough. No-one who would defend the integrity of either our electoral laws or our tax laws could accept such a situation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>11492</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not want to detain this stage of the committee any longer. 
 Senator Faulkner has already wasted most of the afternoon building this enormous construct over some particular angst he has with regard to a particular body. The comments he made were, as usual, laced with errors, as we have come to expect with Senator Faulkner. We all know that his political judgment, when it comes to the count, has always been rather poor. That is the reason he is in opposition. That is the reason key responsibilities were removed from him when he was environment minister. That is the reason he lost the environment vote. The truth of that matter is that this guy has got form.</para></talk.start><para>Let me get a couple of things on the record so that Senator Faulkner and maybe his advisers can be assisted. The mere fact that a trust calls itself a charitable trust means nothing in terms of whether gifts to the trust are tax deductible. It must satisfy the gift provisions in division 30. I understand that Senator Faulkner, having wasted our afternoon, has decided to walk out of the chamber. Why wouldn't he? Tomorrow he has to build the argument that somehow we have not got time to consider the legislation which is coming through.</para><para>He has wasted this whole afternoon on a total nonsense about a particular body which may well call itself a charitable trust. Just to repeat myself: a body calling itself a charitable trust means nothing in terms of whether the gifts to the trust are tax deductible. I know nothing about this particular body. I have no information on it. We have had a total waste of time this afternoon. If Senator Faulkner was so worried about it, the truth is that to determine a prescribed agency requires a regulation to be brought in, and a regulation can be disallowed.</para><para>We have wasted all of this afternoon. Let us say that the paranoia of Senator Faulkner has some particular merit in the sense that perhaps someone will try to prescribe an agency which he does not like. The facts of the matter are that it comes before this chamber in a regulation and it can be disallowed. That is what we had all of this big debate about this afternoon. We had time wasting and an attempt to table documents. It was a total construct and a total farce. It shows you 
 why the Labor Party is so hopeless. It is so hopeless that rather than Senator Faulkner getting down to do some decent policy work, the man cannot climb out of the gutter. That is the problem. The man cannot rise from the gutter. We have just seen another example of the way Senator Faulkner goes on in this chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>11493</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are a couple of points that should be made about Senator Kemp's contribution.

We want the Senate to have the capacity to disallow one of the organisations if we believe that it does not fit the stated aims and intentions of encouraging philanthropy. This is a very important issue.</para><para>I would suggest that the minister, the advisers and the Treasurer turn their attention to this matter overnight so that it can be resolved, because we do not want to hold up the committee stage. But this is a concern we have that the minister has failed to satisfy us on. We should not be seeing, in the guise of philanthropy, fancy ways of obtaining significant deductions at public expense in order to pass it through to political parties. That is not the intention of this legislation. I am confident that we can come up with a solution to this particular problem. Perhaps the Assistant Treasurer could have suggested we adjourn our consideration of these particular amendments, and we might have been able to work out some solution to the logjam that we are now faced with.</para><para>In concluding, Senator Faulkner was not raising allegations. He was drawing to the attention of the Senate and the government a legitimate concern about what is clearly now a subterfuge—a contrived entity to avoid the electoral laws by Greenfields. Senator Kemp 
 might not want to recognise that this has occurred, but it has occurred—the Australian Electoral Office has investigated the matter and has said that it has occurred. We are not making allegations about members of the Liberal Party or of this legislation being used to subvert the electoral law, but we want assurances that this cannot happen.</para><para>Our reading of the legislation, as it is presented to the Senate, is that there is a significant possibility that a subterfuge can be entered into with respect to Greenfields-type organisations. Labor believes that no political party—the Liberal Party, the Labor Party, the Democrats, the Greens—should be able to enter into those sorts of contrived arrangements in the name of philanthropy. This legislation is all about encouraging philanthropy in areas such as health, education and, with the passing of the earlier amendments in respect of encouraging environmental protection through various mechanisms, environmental protection for land in this country. That is what philanthropy is about.</para><para>It seems to me that, if the government is fair dinkum about its approach, it would be very happy to give us the assurances we have been seeking and to agree, if it cannot give the assurances, to get the appropriate advice and to agree to an amendment to assure us that the type of scenario that Senator Faulkner has outlined cannot occur. I am sure that Senator Kemp's approach and that of the advisers with him is that they do not intend operations like Greenfields to come within the ambit of this legislation. I am not so sure about some of the other people in the Liberal Party hierarchy. But this is our major concern. It is an issue that has come to light in the course of this debate, and these matters should be addressed. This is what the Senate is for; it is for looking at these sorts of issues and dealing with them.</para><para>As I say, it is regrettable that the minister has not been able to satisfy our concerns about what is a very fundamental issue: attempts to circumvent the electoral laws of this country. It is perfectly legitimate and I believe in the public interest for Senator Faulkner to be raising concerns of this type. The last thing I think the Prime Minister 
 would want, with his stated goal of encouraging greater philanthropy, is this bill and the outcome of this bill getting caught up in some sort of controversy over political donations. I really cannot understand why, if the minister cannot give us the assurances, we could not have moved on. He could have obtained some advice and we could have resolved this behind the scenes and not wasted a great deal of time, instead using the time more effectively and efficiently in dealing with other provisions of this bill or other pieces of legislation. I believe that our concerns should be satisfied. They have not been satisfied to date, for the reasons that Senator Faulkner and I have briefly outlined. These concerns should be satisfied.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>11494</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Temporary Chairman—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—What a waste of time.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name></talker><para>—Well may you laugh, Minister.

There have been a number of contributions from senators. The new superannuation investment rules were announced in the 1998-99 budget. The investment rules are designed to reduce risk to superannuation savings and to ensure that superannuation is preserved for retirement. The bill will ensure that the fundamental principle that superannuation funds cannot borrow is maintained. This serves to limit the risk to superannuation savings from geared investments and will also ensure that superannuation savings are used for retirement purposes. In doing so, the bill will benefit the community as a whole by ensuring that billions of dollars of superannuation tax concessions provided each year are used for their intended purpose, thereby reducing the burden on future age pension outlays.</para></talk.start></continue><para>An important aspect of the bill will be to enhance the ability of small business owners to use their superannuation savings to invest in their own premises by allowing a small superannuation fund to invest up to 100 per cent of its assets in business premises that are leased to members or to the employer sponsor of the fund. The bill contains a number of transitional arrangements to assist superannuation funds in adapting to the new arrangements. The government has consulted with key industry and professional groups on the bill. The bill was referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services, which reported on 25 November 1999. After careful examination of the report, the government has decided to respond to some of the issues which have been raised.</para><para>Firstly, on non-geared trusts: a number of groups such as ASPA have argued that, while the broad thrust of SLAB4 is appropriate, there should be some scope for investments in non-geared related trusts. For instance, it has been argued that this is a means of jointly owning property with a related party as an alternative to a tenants-in-common relationship. To meet this requirement, the government will move an amendment to create a 
 power to make a regulation to exempt particular classes of assets from being in-house assets. The exception will apply only to a superannuation fund with fewer than five members that invests in a company or trust which meets specified requirements.</para><para>These requirements include that the company or trust does not borrow; it does not invest in or loan money to individuals or other entities other than deposits with financial institutions; it does not acquire assets from a related party of the superannuation fund other than business real property; it does not lease assets to related parties or enter into lease arrangements other than a legally binding lease of business or real property to a related property on an arms length basis; and it conducts all other transactions on an arms length basis. The government will consult with accounting and other industry bodies in developing a definition of non-geared company or trust that meets these requirements.</para><para>As to the start date, concerns were expressed about the lapse of time since the original announcement on 12 May 1998. In response the government will move an amendment to ensure that the change to the in-house provisions will apply only from the date of introduction of the legislation—11 August 1998. The change to allow a small superannuation fund to use 100 per cent of its assets to acquire business real property from a related party will continue to apply from 12 May 1999.</para><para>Let me say in conclusion that, by limiting the risk to superannuation savings and ensuring that superannuation is used for the intended purpose of retirement income, the bill will set a sound framework for superannuation savings for decades to come. As I have already mentioned, some government amendments will be moved at the committee stage. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>11497</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>11497</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move government amendments Nos 1 to 4:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Schedule 1, item 13, page 6 (lines 14 and 15), omit "any of paragraphs 71(1)(b) to (f) or paragraph 71(1)(h)", substitute "paragraph 71(1)(b), (ba), (c), (d), (e), (f), (h) or (j)".</para><para>(2)	 Schedule 1, item 28, page 12 (after line 31), at the end of the item, add:</para><para>	 ; or (j)	 an asset included in a class of assets specified in the regulations:</para><para>			 (i)	 not to be in-house assets of any fund; or</para><para>			 (ii)	 not to be in-house assets of a class of funds to which the fund belongs.</para><para>			 For this purpose, a class of assets may consist of, but is not limited to, assets that are investments in entities that undertake, or do not undertake, specified activities.</para><para>(3)	 Schedule 1, item 34, page 14 (line 24), omit "(i)", substitute "(j)".</para><para>(4)	 Schedule 1, page 14 (after line 27), after item 34, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">34A  Subsection 71(5)</inline></para><para>	 Omit all the words from and including "may" to and including "was", substitute "or regulations under paragraph (1)(j) may be expressed to have taken effect at a time earlier than the time when the determination or regulations were".</para><para>Note:	 The heading to subsection 71(5) is altered by inserting "<inline font-style="italic">or paragraph (1)(j) regulations</inline> " after "<inline font-style="italic">determinations</inline> ".</para><para>These amendments will allow a regulation making power to be used to make an exception.

Government amendment No. 2 will allow the government to make regulations to exempt certain assets or classes of assets from being treated as in-house assets. This is an enormously wide power and, without having seen the regulations, how can the Senate be sure of what the government is doing? There is absolutely no need for the government to do this, and Labor is opposing this amendment. Government amendment No. 3 is a consequential amendment. Government amendment No. 4 relates to section 71 of the superannuation industry supervision legislation, known 
 as SIS, which determines the meaning of in-house assets. Currently section 71E allows for the commissioner to make a determination—not a regulation but a determination, which is an important point—as to whether an asset should be taken to be an in-house asset. That determination is a disallowable instrument under section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.</para></talk.start><para>Section 71(5) allows for the determination to be retrospective. That is, the commissioner's determination given in writing to the trustee of a super fund may be expressed to have taken effect at a time earlier than the time when the determination was made. That is seen as being positive, as it means that if a superannuation fund asks for clarification of the status of a particular asset, it can be given in-house asset status from the date the super fund acquired it rather than from the date the commissioner makes the determination. However, the government's amendment No. 4 is asking that regulations be included. That is, the government is asking the Senate to allow it to make regulations that can operate retrospectively. We ran into this type of request from the government in a previous debate on the recently passed so-called surcharge tax amendment bills, and the Senate made a clear decision, supported by the Australian Democrats, that the government should not have a power to make retrospective regulations.</para><para>Firstly, it must override the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to do so, and I ask the government whether or not its amendment is correct. Senator Kemp will recall that the opposition has previously corrected his amendments. Section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act specifically relates to the timing of the regulations and states that a regulation has no effect if it takes effect before the date of notification if the rights of a person would be so affected as to disadvantage that person. Secondly, liabilities would be imposed on a person in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the date of notification. That is, regulations shall generally not be retrospective, particularly if they disadvantage a person or impose a liability. It could be argued, if regulations were made about the status or 
 otherwise of in-house assets, that they would always be positive and that section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act would not come into play because no-one would be worse off.</para><para>However, how does the Senate determine whether regulations which it has not seen yet are positive or negative? How can we make this decision? In the case of the so-called surcharge tax bills which were recently passed, the Senate acted decisively to take the offending provision out of the bill. These provisions were to allow the government the capacity to override section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act. Retrospective regulations should not generally be allowed to be made. Certainly the Labor opposition and the Australian Democrats have acted on this before, and I call on the Australian Democrats to act in the same way as we did on the previous occasion and not to support government amendment No. 4.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>11498</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to indicate that the Democrats will support this and other amendments.

There is a question I want to put to the minister, and it relates to the fact that this amendment allows the regulations to specify assets. I want to ask how the minister will proceed to develop definitions of real property and with whom he will consult.

Apparently the Democrats have entered into an agreement with the government in respect of the regulations that we are considering. I point out to the Senate that the changes to the amendments that are being presented to the chamber, as a result of the deal between the government and the Australia Democrats, do not satisfy Labor's central concerns and principles with this legislation. They do not deal with the issues or the concerns that were raised by the witnesses that came before the Senate committee. We received some of the strongest submissions and evidence that I have ever seen before any committee in my time in the Senate opposing the central principles of this legislation</para></talk.start><para>I will make it clear for the record: the amendments that the Democrats, together with the government, have drafted do not deal with those problems. They do not deal with the five key criteria that I outlined in my speech during the second reading debate. They do not deal with the first point: that the government has provided no substantive evidence of a systemic abuse by DIY super funds of the current investment rules. They do not deal with the point that, if there are concerns in this area, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), which was passed with the support of the opposition, will largely address the problems, if there are problems. There are other ways of tightening existing laws that will better address the perceived problems. For example, the tax office will now be regulating in this area. They do not deal with the difficulties that this legislation will cause for some small businesses. They do not deal with the difficulties of some people in rural and regional Australia. Whilst some of these amendments may have 
 improved the situation slightly, they do not go to the heart of the problems that Labor has with this bill.</para><para>I would like Senator Allison to explain why, on this occasion, she is supporting retrospective regulations when we have not seen the regulations. She is taking the government on trust. On a previous occasion when we considered this approach, we were not prepared to do it in respect of superannuation. I do not want to extend the debate, but this government has a pretty patchy record on superannuation. I am being mild in my criticism because I am aware of the time constraints we are under. I would not be taking anything on trust in respect of this government and superannuation. 	We do not believe there should be an overriding of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. There would need to be extraordinary circumstances for that to occur. On the argument advanced by the government to date, we are not faced with any sort of reasonably extraordinary circumstance to warrant the Acts Interpretation Act being overridden in a way that is occurring here. I would like a response from Senator Allison. These amendments do not satisfy our concerns about the legislation and we will still be opposing the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>11499</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think it has already been pointed out to Senator Sherry by the minister that the regulations are a disallowable instrument of the Senate.

The reason that that needs to occur—amongst many other matters that unfortunately are not occurring—is that it took so long for the government to present detailed legislation to the parliament. It took 18 months after the budget announcement, and this caused enormous uncertainty within those sections of the superannuation industry handling do-it-yourself superannuation. I know the minister on a number of occasions has said, `We consulted widely and we consulted for this time.' I point out to the Senate that we have some different provisions from the original budget announcement because there was such a backlash. But it took 18 months for the government to bring in the legislation. That is why we are considering this date.

It is American, previously edited by the late John F. Kennedy Jr, and has both Democrat and Republican columnists. So if you read an article in <inline font-style="italic">George</inline>  about the impact of the Internet on politics, you know that IT has moved beyond the realm of specialised interest and into the mainstream.</para></talk.start><para>In fact, a casual browse of the Net demonstrates how seriously those involved in US politics take the power of the web. From George Bush Jr's presidential campaign to Hillary Clinton's run for the Senate to Donald Trump's campaign for the Reform Party nomination, American politicians are delving into this medium with unbridled enthusiasm. Even the Stop Hillary campaign gets a guernsey here and there. Each of these has a significant presence on the web—providing information, soliciting support and donations, and giving browsers the opportunity to ask questions or make comments. I can only imagine that, as the US presidential race heats up early next year, web presence will become increasingly important.</para><para>As important as IT is in US politics, so too is it in the Australian environment. The 1990s explosion of the Internet has already had enormous implications for political communication. The use of the World Wide Web, email, bulletin boards and other means of Internet based communication has increased enormously in what is really a relatively short period of time. After all, the Internet as we know it effectively only came into existence in recent decades. Whilst Her Majesty is said to have sent the first royal email in 1976, the advances of contemporary browsers, online 
 shopping and audio are really developments of the 1990s.</para><para>As politicians, political parties, lobbyists, community organisations and individuals have all started to use these techniques, the impact that the new form of communication will have on politics, on communities and on the way we interact has also been considered. There are some very significant issues at the heart of this—issues like availability, access, skill renewal, and of course the impact on politics and politicians. Perhaps the most fundamental question for us is whether new technologies will somehow change the way that we interact with our constituencies. Some people believe that communication facilitated by IT between politicians and the community can introduce a more equitable relationship, allowing politicians and citizens to contribute equally.</para><para>Lawrence K. Grossman, former President of America's NBC News, says that new forms of communication based on IT will change contemporary politics. He said:</para><para>Gutenberg made everybody a reader, Xerox made everybody a publisher, and interactive telecommunications is making everybody a lobbyist.</para><para>That is a compelling proposition for anyone interested in engaging more people in the process of politics. But studies conducted in the United States indicate that whilst the new mediums of exchange on the Internet and email will have a great impact on political communication, they are in fact more likely to reinforce the existing structure of American politics than to change it. So whether the Net and email actually change the way people think about politics and politicians remains to be seen. Certainly there are differences between the American and Australian scenarios.</para><para>As most members and senators could attest—some more positively than others—the introduction of email facilities for members of this parliament has been greeted enthusiastically by our constituents. Certainly over recent times I, like all senators, have been on the receiving end of a number of email campaigns, from Jabiluka, to Internet censorship to, more recently, the situation in East Timor. The number of people using email to contact parliamentarians is increasing. What is undeniable is that devices like email and 
 Internet sites are important tools for politicians and their constituents alike—and therein perhaps lies the difference with some of the historical comparisons I have made.</para><para>Perhaps the real test of this method of exchange will be how we as parliamentarians choose to respond to emails. The delivery of a message via electronic means does not change the validity of the message or make it more or less important than a letter or a fax, but it might actually change the expectations of the person who sends the message. The issue of how to respond to email messages is being considered right across international politics. People who email the US President get an email confirmation of their message and, if it is appropriate, a letter in response. The Prime Minister encourages members of the public to leave comments on his web site but to pursue detailed matters through other means, like contacting their local member or senator.</para><para>An ongoing challenge is dealing with the global nature of the Internet. As senators who represent a particular state, or members who represent an even more specific constituency in the lower house, the way in which the Net and email open up access to people from all over the world is a challenge that I suspect will be met in different ways by different members. Some might just hit `delete' whilst others might view email as they would a letter or a telephone inquiry from someone outside their constituency. The most important thing in all of this is that members and senators do not ignore the opportunity that the Internet and email create for us, and that constituent contact generated through new technologies is embraced enthusiastically.</para><para>In the Australian context, both federal and state parliamentarians have taken up the IT challenge with enthusiasm. Many members of this chamber have a Net presence, and many others are following suit. I think it is fair to say that members of the coalition are leading in many ways in the trend. To provide a central registry of all individual coalition members' home pages, I have published a directory that profiles the personal home pages of my coalition colleagues from the New South Wales and Commonwealth parlia 
 ments. It is called <inline font-style="italic">Insite</inline> and a copy has been provided to the Parliamentary Library. It was launched recently at an event I organised in Sydney to celebrate both the growth of the IT industry and the important role of Australian women in this growth.</para><para>Two speakers addressed the launch of <inline font-style="italic">Insite</inline>. The first speaker was Barry O'Farrell, the New South Wales state member who is Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for information technology. His portfolio passion is IT innovation in New South Wales and the potential boost for our state. He is a keen follower of a range of IT issues, including Internet content, Y2K challenges and IT training.</para><para>The second speaker that we enjoyed hearing from was Ruby Blessing. She has seen the average web browser go from a simple, text based interface with grey backgrounds and no animation to a fully integrated multimedia delivery tool. She is one of the world's leading web designers and has been a regular recipient of awards for her work. Acknowledged as the most prolific female web designer in the world, she has designed more than 100 corporate, institution and cultural web sites. Inducted into the Australian Business Women's Hall of Fame in 1999, she now operates a consultancy for businesses and cultural institutions wanting to take full advantage of the Internet and all forms of IT.</para><para>Ms Blessing shared a number of her experiences and thoughts in this area and, when remarking on the launch of <inline font-style="italic">Insite</inline>, said:</para><para>Browsing through . . . <inline font-style="italic">Insite</inline>  I was impressed by the number of members embracing the Internet to inform and communicate with their electorates. Most were extremely up to date with a diverse range of content and features. Regardless of political persuasion, it's hard not to get excited about this sort of dynamic use of the Internet.</para><para>For politics in 1999 and beyond, the Internet and personal home pages offer a huge range of opportunities and advantages for parliamentarians, and <inline font-style="italic">Insite</inline>  seeks to harness the growing involvement of members of the coalition in that area. I was pleased to see, for example, in putting it all together, that many Senate colleagues are keenly involved in leading the charge in engagement on the Net. Senators Boswell, Calvert, Gibson, Knowles, 
 Troeth and Tambling and many of our lower house colleagues have extremely impressive sites. Since the publication of <inline font-style="italic">Insite</inline>  even more have been raised with me or are under construction, and they will be in there as well. In commenting on the publication of <inline font-style="italic">Insite</inline> , the Prime Minister said that this initiative might act as a tool to `grow and encourage our colleagues to use online tools to keep in touch with our customers, the Australian public'. Hopefully, that is an opportunity everybody will take up.</para><para>At the same time as I launched <inline font-style="italic">Insite</inline>, I also took the opportunity to launch a new redeveloped web site of my own—easily found at www.marisepayne.com. It has already seen huge amounts of new traffic and I am very pleased with its progress. It is particularly interesting to hear from the people who are logging on—ranging from young people at school to professionals and retired workers from New South Wales, Australia and internationally. There is a huge diversity of interest, and that diversity is something I think we should encourage and facilitate.</para><para>Even my political party—the Liberal Party of New South Wales—is engaged in a major redevelopment and review of its web site. Under the guidance of Country Vice-President Robyn Parker it has been completely overhauled. Now if you log on you get information on the party, its parliamentary representations, regular publications and different parts of the organisation. The New South Wales Young Liberal Movement has gone through a similar process and has a very dynamic site that I think makes it comparable to any other youth political organisation in Australia.</para><para>Most importantly, though, in this whole process, the coalition and I, in particular, recognise the importance of  utilising the new technologies to maximise our community interaction—to maximise our contact with our constituents in the most advanced and technologically progressive way. I can say with great assurance this evening that the coalition—in the parliament and in the states and territories—is taking up huge opportunities offered through the Internet, which is very commendable indeed. I think it is a fundamental part of our jobs as senators, and as 
 members in the other place, to maintain an active interest and an active presence in this regard. I look forward to continuing to do that and to hearing from a lot more young people in particular through my web site.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Salmon Industry: Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee Report</title><page.no>11504</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>11504</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I would just like to say a few words about the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee interim report on the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the importation of salmon. The report is an interim report, and I am very pleased to see that the committee is taking this issue as seriously as it is. But, having said that, I would like to make a few comments with regard to evidence given to the committee, particularly by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</para></talk.start><para>I was somewhat amazed at evidence given by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on what is a very important issue for this country, being an agricultural producer in very significant terms, and it in turn being a very important part of our exports to other countries around the world. The quarantine matter that goes to salmon relates to the sanitary and phytosanitary agreement—or the SPS agreement—that has arisen out of the World Trade Organisation. We as a country played a very significant role in the development of the SPS agreement, so one would have thought that we would have had some degree of expertise in its application. But you certainly would not be able to glean that if you were to look at and take account of our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's performance before the committee. It would seem that they know very little of its workings.</para><para>I have spoken on the issue of salmon on a number of occasions with regard to the restrictions on the importation of not only Canadian salmon but also salmon from around the world. As we know, there are many diseases that occur in a range of species of fin fish. Arising out of the setting up of the World Trade Organisation, countries were required to bring into line the levels of pro 
 tection—or the ALOP measures—that they would have in place.</para><para>As I said from the outset, we, AQIS and DFAT would lay claim to being major players in the development of the World Trade Organisation's sanitary and phytosanitary measures that relate to animal and human health. If that is the case, I have to say that I am just amazed that we have not been able to proceed appropriately. Back in 1994, we received applications from countries with regard to the restrictions that we had in place for the importation of salmon meats. AQIS, under WTO rules, was required to proceed to conduct an import risk analysis—and it did. In 1995 it brought down a draft report. The draft report contained recommendations to lift the existing restrictions which had been in place since 1975. Subsequently, it brought down a report in 1996 that recommended the maintenance of the restrictions.</para><para>There is a total inconsistency in that. What changed between 1995 and 1996? Little, I would suggest. What new scientific evidence came to light? None, I would suggest. That gave cause for concern at the WTO. The fact that when AQIS prepared their draft report in 1995 they gave copies of it to the Canadians in particular, who were joined by the US in their application to have our restrictions removed, is surprising, to say the least. It was a draft report. Little or no consultation had been conducted with recreational fishing people here, or even with those who are involved in farming of salmonoids in this country, not just in Tasmania. As I said, in 1996 they bought out a final report that recommended the retention of restrictions. Of course, it was quite obvious that the Canadians would actually take us to the WTO disputes panel. If we look at the WTO process in that respect, we can see that the panel of experts put together by the WTO when they were considering the processes that AQIS used in the conduct of its risk analysis raised questions about whether or not AQIS conducted their import risk analysis appropriately, and I think rightly so.</para><para>The very relevant point about that is this: we lay claim to being major contributors to the development of the sanitary and phytosan 
 itary measures that relate to import restrictions that can or cannot be used by countries in respect of trade. Since these measures have been in place, other countries have sought to use them. I think one of the biggest economic traders in the world, the US, has on a number of occasions sought to use them very blatantly as trade restriction measures and their applications have been defeated on at least two occasions at the WTO. But we proceeded to actually present something and, of course, when the 1996 report was submitted, Canada disputed its finding, the disputes panel upheld Canada's position and there was an appeal. But we still did not proceed down the road to fulfil even one very important part of an import risk analysis—that is, to actually outline the communication process for many of the diseases that salmonoids would be susceptible to that were found in other parts of the world but not in Australia. Can I say also that the WTO itself had yet to finalise an import risk analysis process. It had yet to lay down the strict rules upon which a country was expected to develop or write its risk analysis.</para><para>If we look around the world to see how salmonoid diseases have been communicated from one place to another, it is very interesting. Nobody really knows how many of these diseases, which really started out in parts of Europe, were communicated to the United States, to Canada and to other parts of the world. Nobody really knows, but what you always get is the line that there is no evidence to demonstrate that this occurred as a result of a trade in product. In Europe in particular, and even now in parts of the United States and Canada, you have a salmon farming industry that is very significant. That is not to say it is not a good industry, because it actually can be a good industry. They have the basis of all of the scientific data that has been developed because it has been in their interest to develop it. Of course you would not expect them to come up with answers that say, `We have a problem with regard to the transmission of disease and it actually can occur through the transport of product.' Things like whirling disease have gone almost right around the world. It started off in Europe and has gone to the US and to Canada. 
 It was never found in New Zealand but is now found in New Zealand, and nobody wants to acknowledge how it got there, but you will always get the excuse.</para><para>We have heard from the government that we do not have the capacity to enter into a trade war with Canada over salmon. That is simply not the point; it misses the point altogether. The reality is that there are trade laws. If the WTO is to function appropriately, we as a country have every right to take up the arguments in accordance with the trade laws, and we should do so. It does not mean that the government has to readily accept, as it has on this occasion, an outcome from the WTO. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Psychotic Illness</title><page.no>11506</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>11506</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to talk once again about the lack of adequate support for Australians with psychotic illnesses. Psychotic disorders cover a diverse group of illnesses that are characterised by distortions of perceptions, thinking and responses. Psychotic illness is usually linked to a loss of the ability to enjoy life and to mood disturbance and depression. Schizophrenia, bipolar and delusional disorders are included in this group and the symptoms debilitate many members of our community. The point I want to make tonight is that they are not receiving adequate care and support.</para></talk.start><para>The National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, established by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care back in 1996, painted a bleak picture for over 100,000 Australians living with long-term psychotic illness. It told us just how common mental illness is in our communities. SANE Australia was invited by the mental health branch to respond to a follow-up study of over 1,000 people and it published the results in a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">A SANE response</inline> . These members of our community are suffering and they are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of violence. They are often homeless and they are missing out on suitable accommodation and much needed rehabilitation and recreation.</para><para>As most people now receive treatment for psychotic illnesses outside a hospital setting, 
 the report says that effective management procedures should include in-patient and outpatient hospital care, specialist community treatment and support services. It is also important for these people to have regular and ongoing contact with a general practitioner and they should be encouraged to be active participants in community activities.</para><para>We should be able to expect that government health services will help people with psychosis to manage their illness. Yet half of those surveyed reported that when they needed a particular government service in the past 12 months they were unable to receive assistance.</para><para>SANE also found that services provided by government agencies were not as helpful as church based and other non-government ones. There is an increased need for community based support and education programs. Drop-in centres, day programs, mutual support groups and places where people can work together to reduce stigmatisation and isolation are all essential for the chronically ill to build their social skills. This support is extremely important to people with psychotic illness, especially as they grow older.</para><para>Thirty per cent of people with psychotic illnesses rent; others live in hostels or group housing. Ten per cent of those people are homeless at any point. Funding for more rehabilitation programs is absolutely essential, as only 19 per cent of people with a chronic illness attended rehabilitation programs during the past year. Yet we know that these programs are important to complement much needed clinical care and provide assistance with accommodation needs.</para><para>Funding for a range of specialist supported housing is essential. Constant shifting is detrimental to recovery or maintenance of psychotic illness. People with physical illnesses receive government funded care in their home, but only 25 per cent of those surveyed by SANE receive advice on looking after themselves at home. Forty-three per cent of those surveyed say that they are never free of symptoms and 75 per cent of those on medication suffer side effects severe enough to impair their lives. Yet disturbingly, only 19 per cent had taken part in rehabilitation 
 services and one in 10 surveyed was homeless or living in marginal accommodation.</para><para>Many people have welcomed the closure of substandard supported residential services. However, many of these unfunded accommodation homes in Victoria, my home state, are facing closure due to increasing costs and room size restrictions being placed on them by the state government Department of Human Services. Their closure has driven many psychotically ill people out onto the streets. Where building regulations are maintained and adequate support is provided by properly trained managers and staff, these accommodation homes provide stability in what is a very fragile world for people with psychotic illness. They offer far more security than caravans or homelessness to people who are solely reliant on the disability support pension.</para><para>This year, during September-October alone, SANE identified 189 people needing full-time care. Considering that this figure did not include such heavily populated areas as the Mornington Peninsula and Mildura, this paints a grim picture indeed. People were found to be bouncing between hostels, community homes, generic hospitals and nursing homes.</para><para>SANE points out that there are not enough psycho-geriatric beds available for older people suffering from a psychotic illness. If they are placed in a nursing home, they find that other residents resent them. At Mont Park, just north of Melbourne, 26 beds are available and SANE found that beds in acute admission wards are often used. In these places, many patients were overdosed and readmissions are frequent.</para><para>It is not a pretty picture. Once again I call upon all tiers of government to recognise the needs of Australians living with psychotic illness. Like any other group, people affected by persistent psychotic illness should be consulted in the development of programs and service management plans designed for them.</para><para>SANE encourages government departments to work closely together to improve the links between existing services and to build on them so that as these people age they receive the care they need. In many older people, the symptoms become unstable and the coping 
 strategies people have often fail as they grow older.</para><para>The matter is urgent. If we do not act now, in five or 10 years time, as SANE points out, the problem will be much worse. Again, I congratulate SANE on another important report and I urge the government to make sure the findings and recommendations do not just sit on shelves gathering dust.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Christianity</title><page.no>11507</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>11507</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As we face the end of 1999 and celebrate the commencement of the year 2000, it is appropriate for us as a nation and as a people to reflect. Tonight, I do not want to concentrate on when the new century and millennium will actually start. No doubt that will be an interesting debate that many people will have over their family barbecues, around the table, at the bar, at meetings and at Christmas parties. It will make for interesting discussion and I am not sure whether it will be resolved as to when the new century and millennium should be celebrated.</para></talk.start><para>Tonight, the chance is that this is my last speech in this parliament for 1999 and, therefore, possibly this century or millennium. I invite the Australian people to reflect on why we will be celebrating the year 2000. Why is it the year 2000 and not 2001 or indeed the year 3000? What was the commencement point for the counting of the years?</para><para>Next year, we commence the year 2000 AD, the year of our Lord. The years before AD are known as BC, or Before Christ. No other person in the history of the world has had such a significant impact on the world or, indeed, had their birth as the commencement date of the counting of years. We in this place often consider what the place in history might be for us, our political party, a particular leader and particular ministers and backbenchers, all of whom make their own individual contribution. In fairness, I simply say that none of us will even be a footnote in the history of the world in comparison to what eventuated with the birth of Christ.</para><para>The Christian faith is, of course, embraced by the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. Statistics tell us that 71 per cent of people in our Aboriginal community identify themselves as Christian and as embracing the Christian faith. An overwhelming number of migrants similarly adopt the Christian faith. Indeed, the Christian faith has had a great impact on the development of this nation. Many of our founding fathers, such as Alfred Deakin and Henry Parkes, were quite open about the role the Christian faith played in their life.</para><para>Indeed, on 1 December, when reading the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>, I saw an article by a former very distinguished minister of this parliament, James Killen, about why Ming, or Mr Menzies, is his No. 1. One of the interesting things that Sir James Killen pointed out was that Mr Menzies, in his view, had three great strengths. Allow me to quote from the article:</para><para>When he opened the National Memorial Bible House in Canberra in February 1960 he said: "The Bible is the repository of our faith and inspiration. It is the great source of faith, and that is why we should read it."</para><para>Sir James Killen then went on to say:</para><para>The spiritual strength commanded by Robert Gordon Menzies has virtually passed unobserved.</para><para>Its existence in my view . . . was vital in the building of the Menzies era.</para><para>It was also vital for, as I said before, our founding fathers, such as Alfred Deakin, who will not be known by many Australian people. They prayed and fasted for so many days to get the wording of the Australian Constitution right. Henry Parkes, who is seen as the father of our federation, said:</para><para>As we are pre-eminently a Christian people, our laws, our whole system of jurisprudence, our constitution are based on and interwoven with our Christian beliefs.</para><para>It was also important for many of the great explorers, such as Leichhardt, Sturt and Eyre, and people such as Reverend John Flynn—Flynn of the Inland—of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, who had the words painted on his plane `For Christ and country'. So many people in the development of our nation have acknowledged the importance of their faith in their endeavours.</para><para>The overwhelming embracing of the Christian faith is, unfortunately, ignored by commentators today. Indeed, there has been a trend of late to belittle the Christian faith, especially by commentators and certain writers and journalists. Indeed, sometimes even in this place, an odd interjection is made to members of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. One wonders whether that same lack of understanding and compassion to the Christian faith would be accepted if it were to be shown about other faiths within the community. I think not. People would be labelled as politically unreconstructed. It seems that at the moment it is fair game to be highly critical of the Christian faith, which is embraced by well over three-quarters of the Australian people. </para><para>The Christian faith has been a liberating force and a force for good. The life and example of Christ is a life that we should all seek to emulate. I fully admit—I am sure a lot of my colleagues would understand—that I fail in that regard. Madam President, you would be aware of that from time to time, especially during question time, when I may not necessarily be as unreservedly forgiving as I ought to be. As an example of leadership through service, the life and example of Christ, I believe, is one that we can all learn from.</para><para>Suicides and some of the social problems that our nation faces often have their roots in a lack of spiritual dimension in the lives of the people concerned. People see no hope or purpose beyond the immediate problem. They often see themselves as an accident, as some would have us believe this whole world is, that is, it just happened as a result of some big bang theory; they are here as a result of an accident; and if the ride is not too good, they might as well put an end to the accident they are currently experiencing; and, therefore, there is no future and no hope for them.</para><para>On the other hand, the Christian faith tells us that we are all unique and special, and that there is a purpose for us in the scheme of things as designed by the great architect of the universe. As we reflect on the last 2,000 years and the last 200-plus years, there is no doubt in my mind that the Christian faith has 
 been an overwhelming force for good. So the purpose of my rising to my feet this evening is to invite the Australian people to consider the basis of the real reason why we will be celebrating Christmas in 17 days time and, indeed, a new year in 23 days time. Let us remember the real reason we are celebrating. I am sure that if we all do that as individuals and as a society, the future of Australia will be blessed and it will be great. My hope is that, as the new year, the new century and the new millennium commence, we do not forget the importance of the Christian faith and the Christian roots of our nation.</para><para><inline

The authorised decision-makers are either SES officers or senior legal officers. In most cases, the initial decision on access to documents is made 
 by the SES officer whose area has jurisdiction over the documents in question. An internal review decision on access to documents is made by an officer other than the one who made the initial decision on access. As a general rule, internal review decisions on access are made at the division head level. The Secretary has issued a Departmental instruction which is designed to ensure that FOI requests are processed in a timely manner. The Department has provided its officers with FOI training and its legal sections coordinate the Department's FOI requests and provide advice on the proper handling of those requests. The qualifications, experience and employment grades of FOI decision makers are not recorded on the Department's FOI files.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of Industry, Science and Resources: Internal Staff Development Courses</title><page.no>11520</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1502)</subtitle><id.no>1502</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11520</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 20 September 1999:</para></talk.start><para>(1) How many internal staff development courses has the department, or any agency in the portfolio, conducted since 3 March 1996.</para><para>(2) What is the cost of internal staff development courses the department, or any agency in the portfolio, has conducted since 3 March 1996.</para><para>(3) How many staff have attended internal staff development courses the department, or any agency in the portfolio, has conducted since 3 March 1996.</para><para>(4) (a) How many internal staff development courses conducted by the department, or any agency in the portfolio, since 3 March 1996 have

</para><para>(a) and (e)</para><para>Investment in on-ground revegetation and remnant protection projects across Commonwealth programs, for the period 1989-90 until commencement of the Natural Heritage Trust, is estimated to have been approximately $6.5 million per annum. This figure covers those programs which are broadly comparable with Bushcare, and does not include investment in commercial forestry and farm forestry projects.</para><para>Since commencement of the Natural Heritage Trust, investment through Bushcare in projects for which the primary activity was on-ground action (revegetation, regeneration and remnant protection for both biodiversity conservation and sustainable production) was approximately $14.6 million for 1997-98 and $26.3 million for 1998-99.

It is estimated that a similar area has been revegetated and protected under the National Landcare Program. Note that these figures are from project reports written prior to January 1999, and there has been significant activity since then. In addition, this data comes from the first six months of what are often three year projects, so the bulk of the outputs are yet to be achieved. There has also been significant revegetation through programs such as the Murray-Darling 2001 Initiative, Rivercare, and the Endangered Species Program.</para><para>(c) and (d)</para><para>No information is available on the survival rates of vegetation established by pre- Natural Heritage Trust programs.</para><para>For Natural Heritage Trust funded programs, a proportion of projects has been assessed each year by State Natural Heritage Trust Evaluation Teams, Bushcare State Coordinators and Regional Facilitators and Bushcare Support (Greening Australia) staff.

Since many Polisario representatives also hold Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) positions, Australian Ministers do not formally receive them, because to do so might be presented as Australian acceptance of the SADR as the government of Western Sahara.</para><para>(3) (a) There was a press report of incidents at that time which indicated that a number of demonstrators were injured. Although it was reported that no-one was killed, the article stated that 27 Moroccans were given jail sentences of 10-15 years for their actions. The Australian Government is not aware that the UN has made any formal reference to the incidents, nor to its knowledge, has any of the major international human rights bodies drawn attention to them. The Australian Government remains concerned over the human rights situation in the Western Sahara as part of its overall commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights internationally.</para><para>(b) The Government has made representations to the Moroccan authorities on individual cases of alleged human rights abuses in the Western Sahara which have been brought to its attention, including through a longstanding arrangement whereby Amnesty International "Urgent Action" cases are considered and, where appropriate, pursued by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on behalf of the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group. The Australian Embassy in Paris, which has responsibility for Morocco, has made representations to the Moroccan authorities on these cases and will continue to do so where appropriate.</para><para>(4) The Australian Government has no plans to provide assistance to the Saharawi refugees in Algeria.

Several aspects of the project proposal have evolved since designation. Preliminary discussions regarding the environmental assessment of the project have been held between the relevant government authorities at officer level. However, no formal agreement has yet been made regarding cooperative assessment arrangements. It is expected that a formal agreement about cooperative environmental assessment arrangements will be reached once the details of the project are finalised.</para><para>(2) (a) The conditions relating to the transfer of Deal Island from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) to the Tasmanian Government were defined in a Heads of Agreement dated 9 April 1998.</para><para>(b) Yes. (i) The terms of the agreement essentially provided for the transfer of the island to the State for the sum of $1 with the State agreeing to conserve and manage the property under terms prepared in consultation with the Australian Heritage Commission. (ii) An extract of the agreement has been provided to the honourable senator. Further copies are available from the Senate Table Office.</para><para></para><para>(3) (a) The transfer of Deal Island from AMSA to the Tasmanian Government was not contingent on the creation of a marine reserve in the surrounding waters.</para><para>(b) The Commonwealth understands that the waters surrounding Deal Island are currently being evaluated for protection as a marine reserve by the Tasmanian Government. Further information about this process should be sought from the Tasmanian Government.</para><para>(4) No funds were provided by the Commonwealth to the Tasmanian Government for managing Deal Island in association with the transfer agreement.</para><para>(5) Several actions by the Commonwealth could trigger environmental assessment of the proposal under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. These include the potential need for approval in terms of the Government's foreign investment policy, and the provision of a pipeline licence for the Bass Strait section of the proposed pipeline. Environmental assessment of the proposal in this case has been triggered by the decision of the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources to grant the project Major Projects Facilitation Status.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Flags: Members of Parliament Requests</title><page.no>11535</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1712)</subtitle><id.no>1712</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11535</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 2 November 1999:</para></talk.start><para>(1) How many requests by each individual member and senator have been received for Australian flags in the 1998-99 financial year.</para><para>(2) Were any of these requests turned down; if so: (a) on what basis; and (b) in relation to which requests.</para><para>(3) What has been the cost to the Commonwealth of the provision of these flags.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>11535</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Requests for Australian flags by each individual senator and member in 1998-99 were as follows:</para><para></para><para>SENATORS</para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><thead><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Name</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>No. of

The facility to which the question relates is presumably the media room that was set up during the week ending 4 September 1998 in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Offices at 70 Phillip Street, Sydney, which is on a different floor to the Prime Minister's Office. I am advised that it would not be accurate to describe the facility as a studio, since it consists of a normal office equipped with a broadcast quality telecommunications line and portable audio broadcasting equipment. This equipment can be connected to the line to enable a person in the room to give radio interviews as arranged with radio stations.</para><para>The lease cost of the line is $143 per month, which is paid by the Department of Finance and Administration. 
</para><para>Most of the current equipment dates back to October 1995, when it was purchased as a replacement for older equipment dating back into the 1980s. The purchase cost in October 1995 was $3,328. I am advised that the current and original equipment was used by the two previous Prime Ministers to participate in radio interviews from either the Lodge or the Prime Minister's office in Parliament House.</para><para>When the current equipment was set up in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Offices in September 1998, the General Manager of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Services Group, Department of Finance and Administration wrote to Ministers and Shadow Ministers informing them of the media room's availability and advising them of the booking procedure to make use of this facility.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>East Timor: Allowances to Departmental Officers</title><page.no>11542</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1751)</subtitle><id.no>1751</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11542</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 3 November 1999:</para></talk.start><para>(1) What allowances are paid to departmental personnel currently working in East Timor.</para><para>(2) Do the above payments vary with seniority; if so, what is the range of these allowances.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>11542</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>According to records held by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the answer to the Honourable Member's question as follows:</para><para>(1) Departmental personnel currently working in East Timor receive Overseas Living Allowance, Difficult Post Allowance and Settling-in Allowance.

That is the quantum of the ETPEA varies according to the total of other allowances payable but caps the maximum to $125 per day.

 compensation for loss of capacity to remain in the ADF.</para><para>Under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 they are entitled to disability pensions for injury or disease caused by that service and lifetime medical treatment for any such disability. The determination of the casual connection is on the more generous standard of proof applicable to operational service. The Statements of Principles of the Repatriation Medical Authority apply to all claims.</para><para>There is a general and universal rule that compensation under both schemes are matched against each other to achieve the best outcome but avoiding a doubling of benefits.</para><para>Dependants' Benefits</para><para>Should any of our personnel lose their lives a widow/er would be eligible for the full benefits of a widow/er's pension, including health cover, and financial support and full health cover for dependant children through the Veterans' Children Education Scheme (VCES). There are also VCES benefits, but not health cover, for those dependants whose veteran parent may become entitled to Special Rate of EDA.</para><para>Service Pension</para><para>Members of the ADF International Force in East Timor (INTERFET) will have eligibility for a service pension in case of invalidity or later at age 60 subject to normal means testing provisions.</para><para>Health issues + Access to treatment for difficult to diagnose illnesses</para><para>On 5 July 1999, I issued a media release concerning ADF personnel involved in deployments overseas.
