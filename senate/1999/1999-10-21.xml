This return to order represents a serious mistake of judgment. Those who have been associated with the process of an aviation safety investigation know that the purpose of such an investigation is to identify human or systematic errors and to recommend changes to regulations and practice. Above all else, the aim of the investigation is to avoid the allocation of blame, lest future investigations become impeded by legal efforts to shield interested parties.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the central elements in avoiding the casting of blame is to move from a draft report—which outlines all that the investigators have found and provides their best initial effort at piecing together the story—to a final report which may, following the processes of consultation with interested parties who have an involvement or interest in the incident under investigation, be different from the draft.</para><para>The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation procedures manual identifies that interested parties, and only interested parties, get draft reports in order to identify errors, to allow natural justice and to promote confidence within the industry that reporting is open and accountable. Great care is taken in the final report to avoid references which are unfair or inaccurate.</para><para>Senator Woodley is proposing that the Senate should abandon this established and successful process and turn the class G airspace investigation into a series of media opportunities. He does not seek to await the completion of the report to its final stage but instead seeks the production of what I cannot 
 emphasise too strongly is a draft report. Senator Woodley's motion would make it extremely difficult for the air safety investigators to do their job properly, and I believe it would not be either appropriate or responsible for the Senate to agree to it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>10130</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—The opposition is supporting Senator Woodley's order to produce the draft report concerning the class G airspace trial. This is not a matter which would normally be pursued in this manner by the opposition. However, there are special circumstances relating to this draft report, and I am sure that if Senator Woodley was in the chamber at the moment he would outline them. They are that the matter of the class G airspace trial is a matter before a committee of this Senate, the Rural, Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee.

The Act rewrote substantially the provisions of the Corporations Law dealing with, among other things, the registration of companies, company meetings, share capital and financial reporting by companies.</para><para>Prior to its enactment, the Act underwent an extensive process of parliamentary scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities (PJSC). In fact, the PJSC tabled two reports in November 1996 and March 1998, having examined the provisions of the Exposure Draft Bill and the final Bill that was introduced into the Parliament.</para><para>The Act incorporated many of the comments and amendments recommended by the PJSC as a result of its examination of the Company Law Review Bill 1997. During debate on the Bill in the Senate, the Australian Democrats and the Opposition moved a number of amendments which the PJSC had not had the opportunity to examine. This was 
 regrettable because many of the amendments were passed into law without having undergone a process of public consultation and the rigours of parliamentary scrutiny.  While a number of amendments and revised amendments to the Bill were passed by the Senate, additional amendments and issues not resolved during the debate were deferred until these could be examined in detail by the PJSC.</para><para>The PJSC commenced its review of the late amendments and proposed amendments to the Company Law Review Act in July 1998 following a request by the Treasurer. In general, there was considerable criticism of the process and of the lack of public consultation in respect of the late amendments to the Act which necessitated the PSJC review.</para><para>The submission of The Law Society of Western Australia reflects the views expressed by a large number of companies, business groups, professional bodies and practitioners of the Corporations Law: (and I quote)</para><para><inline font-style="italic">"The Society wishes to express its concern at the amendments which were introduced into the Act at the last moment. The Society recognises that the Parliament has the power to amend pending legislation. In the circumstances, the Society contends the power ought not to have been exercised in this case. The Company Law Review Bill, and its predecessor, were the subject of very extensive public consultation and comment, in which the Society and many of its members participated, both before and after release of the draft legislation in June 1995.  Such a long and extensive public consultation was then abandoned without opportunity for further input at the last moment. The last minute amendment undermines the integrity of the consultation process by demeaning the efforts of those that participated and endangers their further participation. It is true that certain amendments had been the subject of discussion by some. However, without advance knowledge that the proposals were to become law, there was neither incentive nor opportunity to comment on them."</inline></para><para>The Committee's review was interrupted by last year's Federal election and then resumed earlier this year. There is insufficient time to outline all of the amendments and other matters considered by the PJSC so I will confine my comments to the more controversial amendments and issues. One of the main areas of concern raised with the PJSC was section 299(1)(f) which requires listed companies to report on environmental compliance with federal and state laws. The PJSC was told that the provision was vague and uncertain, with practical effects which were limited and counter-productive. For example, the requirement does not apply to the 
 operations of Australian companies overseas, where many listed companies have substantial investments.</para><para>Section 299(1)(f) also requires entity rather than project reporting for mining and exploration joint ventures. Consequently, a stakeholder with only a nominal share in the joint venture is obliged to report on environmental compliance.  The PJSC concluded that it was inappropriate for the Corporations Law to provide for environmental reporting in this manner and accepted the almost total unanimity of view on this point of submissions from the Australian business and legal communities. The PJSC is satisfied that a voluntary reporting system, as opposed to a statutory obligation, will encourage companies to achieve best practice in the area of environmental reporting. Accordingly, the PJSC recommended that section 299(1)(f) should be repealed.</para><para>A second controversial amendment was the requirement for listed companies to disclose in their annual reports the company board's remuneration policies, a discussion of the linkage between remuneration and the company's performance, and the disclosure of the details of the remuneration of directors and senior executives.  While the PJSC agrees with the objectives behind the new disclosure requirements under section 300A, the drafting of that section was deficient in many respects. In fact, many submissions argued that the disclosures required under section 300A would produce only general statements of the obvious and would result in inaccurate and misleading information being disclosed.</para><para>A further point was that section 300A did not require the disclosure of a valuation of options granted to directors and executives as part of the remuneration package, although during debate on the amendment it was intended that the Law should require this.  The PJSC found a large disparity in practice between companies in the degree of compliance with section 300A which was the result of the unclear drafting. This outcome was not the result of an unwillingness by companies to comply with the Corporations Law. Very simply the Corporations Law was unclear.</para><para>Given the increasingly large amounts involved where options are granted to directors and executives, the PJSC concluded that the Corporations Law should require the disclosure of the value of options in the total remuneration. To resolve the drafting inconsistencies and the inclusion of the value of options in the remuneration package, the PJSC recommended various amendments to section 300A and section 300 of the Corporations Law, which will have the effect of requiring the disclosure of directors' and executives' remuneration in all its forms. The PJSC has also recommended that the new accounting standard on directors' and 
 executives' remuneration should require a statement by the board that discusses its remuneration policy and the relationship between that policy and the company's performance.</para><para>Another significant issue was the extension of the period of notice of shareholders' meetings from 14 to 28 days. In its March 1998 Report on the Company Law Review Bill 1997, the PJSC did not support the calls for extending the period of notice from 21 days to 28 days. The PJSC had considerable sympathy for those concerned that the 14 days was too short but was not convinced that the doubling to 28 days was either justified, necessary or in the interests of the company.  The Committee recommended that the clause in the Bill requiring a minimum 21 days notice of meeting should proceed. The evidence put to the PJSC during the inquiry has reinforced its earlier view and recommendation. The 28 days notice has placed greater demands on directors and company management and has increased costs without any measurable corresponding benefit to shareholders. The PJSC concluded that the amendment which doubled the period of notice from 14 to 28 days has added considerably to costs and inefficiency in company meeting cycles. The PJSC also concluded that the increased use of electronic communication provides a more appropriate solution than extending the notice period for shareholders' meetings. Accordingly the PJSC has recommended that the notice period should be reduced to 21 days.</para><para>The final issue I want to address is the threshold requirements for requisitioning a shareholders' meeting. This matter was referred to the PJSC by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation. The current position is that 100 members of a company, who together may hold only a small economic interest in the company, may requisition a meeting of shareholders, with the resulting costs being met the company.</para><para>The PJSC was told that this provision in the Corporations Law was open to abuse and inappropriate, given that the requisitioners may represent only a minuscule proportion of the company's members. In addition, the company is disadvantaged by the distraction of its directors and senior management from their core functions.</para><para>The PJSC also found that the proper purpose test in section 249Q of the Law did not provide adequate safeguards against the potential abuse of the requisitioning power. The PJSC endorsed the view expressed by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee that a 5% issued share capital test would be reasonable and conforms to overseas practice.  The PJSC therefore recommended that the Corporations Law should be amended to provide that the sole test, to requisition a meeting of shareholders, is 5% of the issued share capital 
 to be met collectively by the requisitioning members.</para><para>The PJSC also has made other significant recommendations in relation to a director's power to call a meeting, the disclosure of information relating to proxy voting intentions, the receipt of proxy appointments and other matters affecting company administration.</para><para>Before I conclude my remarks I would like to thank all of the individuals, companies, professional bodies and organisations which made submissions to the PJSC and witnesses who appeared before the PJSC during its public hearings. I would also like to thank all members and former members of the PJSC for their contributions to its deliberations on this important review of Matters Arising from the Company Law Review Act. May I also thank Committee Secretary David Creed and his dedicated staff for their efficient running of the Committee and this Inquiry and for their erudite assistance with my Chairman's first draft of this Report, which was well received by all Committee Members.</para><para>I welcome the general support of all members of the PJSC for the Report.

The Committee held a public hearing in May this year to discuss these issues with the relevant Commonwealth agencies. I will briefly discuss each issue in turn.</para><para>The Audit Report on aviation security noted that the department had established a regulatory regime which ensured Australia's compliance with international standards. However, the report also identified areas where Australia's aviation security regime 
 could be strengthened. The JCPAA focussed on risk management practices and auditing and compliance procedures. It is vital that security procedures address the danger presented by criminal behaviour at airports. Currently, the focus is on politically motivated violence but criminal activity is actually more of a problem. Our report recommends that security arrangements be reviewed by relevant Commonwealth agencies so as to maximise the effectiveness of police forces and airport authorities in combating crime.</para><para>The Committee also examined <inline font-style="italic">Audit Report No. 19</inline> , into the planning of aged care. The quality and availability of aged care services is a very important issue for many Australian families. It is critical that the Commonwealth plans effectively to provide these services where they will be most needed. This is why the JCPAA has recommended that the input of local communities be harnessed when planning is undertaken. Local communities, particularly local councils, are uniquely qualified to advise the Commonwealth of their future needs in this area.</para><para>Currently, state offices of the Department of Health and Aged Care can choose whether to consult local communities. The JCPAA believes that this approach is inadequate. We have recommended that local council input become an integral component of the planning process.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Audit Report No. 21</inline>  reviewed the costing of services in Commonwealth agencies. With the adoption of accrual budgeting and the increasingly contestable environment in which agencies operate, it is vital that Commonwealth services are costed appropriately. The audit report found that there was scope for substantial improvement. Indeed, Committee members are concerned that costing systems are not sophisticated enough for the new public sector environment.</para><para>The JCPAA has recommended that the Department of Finance and Administration actively facilitate the development of appropriate costing methodologies. We support the contention that each agency should prepare a methodology that is suitable for its business needs. However, in the interests of both quality and consistency, we also encourage the Department of Finance and Administration to provide a suitable level of assistance.</para><para>May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking on behalf of the Committee those people who contributed their time and expertise to the Committee's review hearings.</para><para>I am also indebted to my colleagues on the Committee who have dedicated much time and effort to reviewing these Auditor-General's reports. As well, I would like to thank the members of the secretariat who were involved in the inquiry, Dr Margot Kerley, the Committee secretary, Ms Rose 
 Verspaandonk, Ms Maureen Chan, Ms Tiana Gray, and Ms Maria Pappas.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the Report to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>10134</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>10134</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I  ask that general business notice of motion No. 359 standing in my name for today relating to the failure of the United States Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban treaty be taken as a formal motion.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Is there any objection to the formality of this motion?</para></talk.start><para>Leave not granted.</para></interjection></speech><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title><page.no>10134</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>10134</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Pursuant to contingent notice and at the request of the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Lees, I move:</para></talk.start><para>That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Lees moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely, a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 359.</para><para>I understand that this is to be supported.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Procedural Motion</title><page.no>10134</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lees</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That general business notice of motion No. 359 may be moved immediately and have precedence over all other business today till determined.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Motion</title><page.no>10134</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>10134</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 That the Senate:</para><para>	 (a)	 notes that:</para><para>		 (i)	 the failure of the United States Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty sends a strong negative signal to the global community regarding progress toward nuclear weapons disarmament and international security, and

The proposal by the First Committee of the UN General Assembly—agenda item 76(R), which is referred to in the motion—began back in March 1998, when the Middle Powers Initiative was established by a network of international citizen organisations to encourage leaders of the nuclear weapons states to commit themselves to the immediate practical steps and negotiation needed for the elimination of nuclear weapons. The goal is to build the political will to achieve a nuclear weapon free world. On 9 June last year, the foreign ministers of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden launched a joint declaration called `Towards a nuclear weapon-free world: the need for a new agenda'. This group is known as the New Agenda Coalition. On 4 December last year, the UN General Assembly adopted this as resolution 53/77 Y by an overwhelming majority. The Australian government intended to vote against the resolution but ended up abstaining. I must say that this action encouraged others to do the same, and it turned out to be a crucial vote.</para><para>Now the New Agenda Coalition has drafted resolution 76(R) and is seeking the support once again of the General Assembly to create a nuclear weapons free world by putting the heat on weapons states. That resolution says, amongst other things, that it notes the many negative developments in the proliferation of 
 nuclear weapons and notes a small number of positive steps taken on the road to nonproliferation. It draws on all the existing conventions, treaties and initiatives, and it calls on the United States and Russia to bring START II into force. This is the second strategic arms reduction treaty, which seeks by the year 2003 to limit the US and Russia to 3,500 warheads each, of which no more than 1,750 may be deployed on multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle equipped submarine launched ballistic missiles, with the balance on single warhead ballistic missiles and/or bombers. On 26 January 1996, the US Senate ratified START II. However, the Russian Duma has not done so, and a substantial body of opinion in Russia views the treaty as giving the US a nuclear advantage. It calls on nuclear weapons capable states that have not yet done so to accede to the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. It calls on states that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and it calls on states that have not yet done so to adhere to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and to work towards its further strengthening.</para><para>It is useful at this point to have a look at the current state of nuclear arsenals around the world. By the end of 1997, estimates of the number of nuclear weapons in the five nuclear states were as follows: Russia had 22,500 weapons; the United States had nearly 12,000 in the US, 150 B-61 bombs and 10 NATO air bases in Belgium and Germany, and Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and the UK also had US bombs; France had 450; China had an estimated 400; and the UK had 160. There are over 30,000 nuclear warheads alone in the world today. Two or more states have crossed the nuclear threshold now—India and Pakistan, to name those two. Approximately $780 billion is spent every year on global military expenditure. Nuclear weapons continue to be very attractive to some states. There is an illusion of security and no doubt prestige, and the doctrine of deterrence continues to be upheld in many places. </para><para>The standstill of the START treaty process between the US and Russia is of great con 
 cern. Also of concern are: the deadlock in the conference on disarmament; the 11 announced nuclear explosions in South Asia in 1998; the persistent concerns over North Korea's nuclear program; the impending sale of a nuclear reactor by Canada to Turkey—Canada sold Pakistan and India their reactors; the failure just last week of the US to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; and Russia's continuing adherence to the policy of nuclear deterrence, which began in 1993.</para><para>I would argue here today that not only should the Senate support this motion but in doing so it would recognise that there is enormous public opinion out there that says: (a) we are spending far too much money on nuclear weaponry; and (b) it does not have widespread support and people are very concerned about this issue. In the US and the UK, opinion polls showed that 87 per cent of those people polled wanted their governments to help negotiate a nuclear weapons convention. I have no doubt at all that, were such a poll to be conducted in this country, we would achieve the same kind of feeling in opposition to nuclear weapons.</para><para>In 1996, the International Court of Justice gave an advisory opinion that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all of its aspects under strict and effective international control. The antiballistic missile treaty is regarded as the cornerstone of strategic stability. It limits the US and Russia to two antiballistic missile deployment stations. Their thinking is to not advantage one over the other, thus allowing for a reasonably equal penetration by both arsenals in the event of war. Of course, that antiballistic missile treaty is now under threat with recent Russian complaints.</para><para>So I think the world is not a safe place from nuclear weapons, and I strongly urge the Senate to support this motion. I think we are not much closer than we were during the Cold War to seeing peace and seeing a nuclear free world. We must revitalise this issue in this country and we must act on the international stage. My motion calls on the Australian government to strongly support agenda item 76(R)—and I have outlined what that 
 means—presented by Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden, particularly in the light of the above, and that the text of this resolution be conveyed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, and to the Australian Ambassador to the UN and to other UN delegations.</para><para>It is an important ask and not something that I believe the coalition or the opposition should be afraid of. It is important because Australia must state its position very clearly on the world stage in respect of nuclear weapons. Clearly we must go forward instead of reverting to a situation where nuclear weapons become a serious danger to the future of the entire world. I strongly recommend support for this motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>10136</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I say at the outset that the intentions behind the honourable senator's motion are applauded by the government. I think the disagreements around the chamber on this are relatively marginal. The government has, of course, made it clear that we are deeply disappointed over the failure of the US Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. One need only look a little bit below the surface to see the domestic political issues that are always in play around the Congress, particularly as we approach yet another round of congressional and presidential elections. I guess when you have got two-year cycles in congressional elections they are always not too far away. I have heard, I think, the Prime Minister and certainly the Foreign Minister making it very clear internationally that we are deeply disappointed.</para></talk.start><para>But I think it should be pointed out that, although the US Senate vote was a setback to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, it was no more than that. It is certainly not an end to the treaty. We should not forget that there are already 154 state signatories to the treaty. It is rapidly approaching the status of a universal treaty. Furthermore, because all five nuclear weapon states have signed the treaty, under international law there is an obligation 
 on those states not to frustrate its purpose before it enters into force.</para><para>President Clinton has made it quite clear that he and his government will continue the United States' commitment, a commitment that has been policy in the United States since 1992, to not conducting nuclear tests. As Senator Allison pointed out, in the vote on the New Agenda Coalition resolution on nuclear disarmament in the First Committee at the United Nations General Assembly Australia last year did abstain. The government's position at the moment is that we will look very closely at this year's resolution, but we do continue to have concerns about it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—What are they?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—I will outline what the concerns are. They are not so much on the individual elements of the resolution. Many of these are capable of support from the Australian government. It is in fact the resolution taken as a whole. The basic premise is to call into question the commitment of the nuclear weapon states to the undertaking they made in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, that is, to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament. We as a government believe that by calling for a new agenda the resolution also presupposes that the existing nonproliferation regime has failed, and we do not accept that as a contention. More importantly, we do not regard that as helpful. Australia and the international community derive fundamentally important security benefits from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and we do not want the treaty to be damaged by further polarisation and debate over nuclear disarmament putting at risk the security benefits of the nonproliferation norm which has been clearly established by that treaty.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We do, as always, support practical, realistic proposals on nuclear disarmament which are capable of winning the support of all states and, very importantly, the nuclear weapon states. But the New Agenda Coalition has clearly failed to do this. We do want to see reductions in nuclear warhead numbers. We should not forget the progress that has been made. We should applaud that progress. I think at the peak the numbers, between the 
 US and Russia, were 69,490 warheads back in 1986. That has been reduced to 36,100 in 1997. Under START II, total deployed warheads should fall to 3,500 each, with further cuts envisaged under START III. That is significant progress, and of course we want to see that go further.</para><para>In terms of the current negotiations and discussions, Australia is working with New Zealand and Mexico to bring a resolution on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. That resolution will call on all countries which have not yet done so to sign and ratify the treaty as soon as possible. I think that demonstrates what I said at the outset, that is, there is very little disagreement around the chamber on what the outcome should be and that it is very much a matter of how that is achieved. I think those words clearly demonstrate the government's bona fides and position on this issue. For that reason, because there is a disagreement on how we move that forward, particularly at the UN General Assembly First Committee, the government will not be supporting the motion as it is currently worded.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>10137</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The motion that is now before the Senate does two things. In part (a) it makes a number of observations about, in the first case, the failure of the US Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and observes that sends a negative signal to the global community. It then refers to agenda item 76(R) of the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which calls on nuclear weapons states to discharge their article 6 nuclear nonproliferation treaty obligations without delay. They are the observational elements of this motion.</para></talk.start><para>The action elements of this motion ask the Australian government to take a stand and to strongly support agenda item 76(R)—presented by Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden—in order to have the United Nations carry a detailed and comprehensive resolution asking for international action to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and to start to wind back 
 nuclear stockpiles. It specifically would, if carried, request the President of this Senate to convey the text of this resolution to the foreign minister, to the Australian Ambassador to the UN and to other UN delegations.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party support this motion and we will vote for it. What is particularly important in this motion is its action elements. There are now some 36,000 nuclear warheads in the world that we know about. That is an excessive ability to demolish the globe several times over. Australia is a non-nuclear weapons power and Australia is committed bipartisanly—and I acknowledge this from the Howard government too—to remain a non-nuclear weapons power.</para><para>Therefore it falls to us to exert our influence in world forums, such as the United Nations, to curb the influence of the spread of nuclear weapons and to reduce the threat to world harmony and peace that they pose, and to make the world a safer and kinder place to live in, one in which economic growth and the wellbeing of the peoples of the world can proceed without the shadow of the nuclear weapons silo falling over them. If we do not take that stand, we derogate our own self-interest as a non-nuclear weapons power and we remove from ourselves the ability to influence global debate on this central question. Therefore the opposition strongly believes that Australia should mark the spot as to where it stands and should use its influence in the world by building coalitions of like-minded nations to push for an end to nuclear testing and a winding back of stockpiles.</para><para>Since the end of the Cold War and the stand-off between Russia and the United States on nuclear weapons—or between the East and the West, as it was often described—global attention has wandered from the threat posed by nuclear weapons. It seems that since the end of the Cold War and the dramatic representation of that threat by the two reigning superpowers at that time, there has been an assumption that the world is a safer place. It is not. The threat is more dangerous now than perhaps ever before.</para><para>That is because there has been the emergence of a number of new nuclear weapons powers that do not have the ability to scruti 
 nise each other's actions, arsenals and operational directives and that do not have the early warning devices. It has to be fairly said that these weapons belong to governments which are inherently politically unstable. Because of that, the prospect of nuclear war by accident is more real now than it ever was. And because of that, the prospect of nuclear war by precipitate action—or to make some ideological, religious or developing nation's point to the rest of the world—is more possible now than ever before. As a consequence, Australia, as a responsible country in this debate, should assert and use its influence to try to bring some coherence, organisation, scrutiny and, ultimately, control to that situation.</para><para>The item that the Senate is being asked to support is a long one. I think most senators are aware of it and I do not intend to read it; it would take too long to do so. It has a number of provisions in it which call upon the UN to take particular action. Again, these are too long to exhaustively quote into the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> this morning but a number of them deserve particular emphasis. Let me turn to a couple of those. Part 4 of this item calls for the examination of ways and means to diminish the role of nuclear weapons on security policies so as to enhance strategic stability, facilitate the process of the elimination of these weapons and contribute to international confidence and security. It goes on, in part 5, to call upon the nuclear weapons states in this context to take early steps to reduce tactical nuclear weapons with a view to their elimination as an integral part of nuclear arms reduction, and to examine the possibilities for, and to proceed to, the de-alerting and removal of nuclear weapons from delivery vehicles.</para><para>It calls for the states to further examine nuclear weapons and postures, to demonstrate transparency on their nuclear arsenals and fissile material inventories, and to place all fissile material for nuclear weapons declared to be in excess of military requirements under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards in the framework of the voluntary safeguards agreements in place. It goes on to talk about the nuclear nonproliferation 
 treaty—full scope safeguards, a moratorium on tests and the physical protection of nuclear material.</para><para>The last is not an insignificant item in the list of issues that should be taken up here. The possibility of the suitcase nuclear bomb being smuggled across borders, not just by international terrorist organisations but by international criminal organisations, with nuclear weapons being at large and traded on the black market due to the decommissioning of some of the former Soviet Union's nuclear stockpiles, is a real threat to international security and requires global action to prevent it.</para><para>A lot of comment and most of what the government have said—and I acknowledge they said it fairly; I disagree with their conclusion, but the facts they put down are a fair representation in many respects—about this debate centres on the rejection by the US Senate of the 1996 nuclear nonproliferation treaty signed by the President of the United States, Bill Clinton. I want to deal with the US Senate and the rejection of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in a moment. In talking about the United States and its role in global military and strategic leadership—more importantly perhaps, in this context, its role in global moral leadership on the weapons issue—one tends to overlook other responsible nations in this debate.</para><para>We know that in the last two years nuclear weapons have been tested in Pakistan and in India. They are nuclear weapons states. They are building stockpiles. They may lack sophisticated means of delivery, but they are rapidly acquiring those. We know that North Korea and Iran are widely suspected of being secret nuclear weapons states or being close to achieving nuclear criticality. Those nations bear a major responsibility in this debate, too. The debate should not just focus on the superpowers but focus on those nations as well. They all share some characteristics. One of them is that the emergent nuclear powers tend to be developing countries described fairly as `poor' nations in the world that are diverting scarce economic resources to the acquisition of sophisticated nuclear technology, which comes at a very high cost. It is 
 money which could be spent on lifting the living standards of people in those countries. In this debate it is always worth while making this point—it is a salutary one.</para><para>In the early 1970s, international intelligence agencies strongly suspected that Argentina and Brazil were engaged in a parallel nuclear race. The suspicion was that neither country had designs on the world but they feared each other. In order to prevent war between them, so the theory went, they acquired secretly the capacity to build nuclear weapons. In the mid-1980s the cost to their economies of diverting scarce economic resources to do that was so great that they could not bear the weight. They diverted back and a trade treaty was signed which integrated regional economic development between South America's major economies of Argentina and Brazil. As a consequence of choosing trade not war, the economies and living standards of those people has dramatically improved.</para><para>If there is a lesson here for the cross-border conflicts between Pakistan and India, it is: make love not war. Engage in cross-border trade, grow your economies and offer a better living standard to your people. Do not divert scarce economic resources into the acquisition of nuclear weapons. It comes at a high price that your country cannot afford. The consequent knock-on effect is that millions of Indians and Pakistanis live in poverty.</para><para>At the back of this resolution is a higher purpose. It is indeed a worthy purpose to achieve global nuclear disarmament. The effect on the world would be better living standards, fewer people in poverty, less tension between nations and less envy between peoples as to the material standards of wellbeing, and wellbeing at moral levels as well. That is a fundamental question that needs to be remembered here.</para><para>Let me now turn to the debate in the United States Senate in which the US Senate repudiated the US President and declined to endorse his signature on the 1996 nuclear test ban treaty. I have here an excerpt from the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> magazine of 16 October 1999. Their opening paragraph reporting this development is worthy of repeating for this debate. The <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> says:</para><para>The Senate's defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a humiliation for the Clinton administration, a pyrrhic victory for the Senate and a disaster for America's foreign-policymaking process.</para><para>That does sum up the outcome. It seems the numbers were mobilised on the floor of the US Senate for a host of reasons. People who had wanted to impeach the President earlier but had failed to get the impeachment up now sought revenge by repudiating him over a motion that he was seeking to move. With base political motive they voted in this direction. Others voted for a whole series of reasons that the government referred to as a post-presidential election focus on internal domestic issues—nothing to do with what the treaty was about or what the global significance of the treaty was about but rather about positioning in a presidential race due to start next year.</para><para>One hopes that, once that political baggage has been cleared off the stage—and I do express this as a genuine aspiration—the US Senate can again approach the issue of endorsement of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and find within its ranks the numbers to provide a backing for the administration of the President in adopting such a treaty binding the United States. Let me express as a postscript to that sentiment another view—that I think Australia should intrude into this debate. If that vote is taken to be a vote for the increasing sentiment one sees reported in US domestic politics for isolationism and for higher protectionism in the US economy—that is, a moving away from participation in the world to isolating and trying to insulate yourself from the globe—then that is a negative direction for the United States.</para><para>As one of the US's eternal friends in the world, Australia should, as a mate, say clearly to the United States, `Do not go down the isolationist road. As a friend, you have an obligation—as indeed we do—to play a role in world affairs and not to isolate yourself from them. That means providing military and strategic leadership in nuclear weapons control and disarmament as well as providing global moral leadership on that issue. That is an attitude not just confined to weapons but 
 broadly expressed across a range of global issues, including integrating your economy with the world and opening up your economy to fair and free competition.'</para><para>We support this motion, which, if adopted, will advance the cause of nuclear weapons control at a time when the globe needs such an effort to be made. Nuclear weapons and arms control has ceased to be an issue that attracts public attention. As the world has become more complex, other issues have taken centre stage as the arms race and the Cold War have ended. As I said earlier in my remarks, while the most obvious manifestation of Cold War hostilities is off the international stage, the arms race is continuing around the world in a range of ways, which means that there are more nuclear weapons now in the hands of countries which are politically unstable and have axes to grind than ever before. The best advice the United Nations can give them, urged on by Australia, is to disarm and direct their attentions to growing their economies and benefiting materially the welfare of their people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>10140</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree with the sentiments that have been expressed in favour of this motion and congratulate Senator Allison for bringing it forward. It sadly shows a division between the majority sentiment in the Senate and the position of neutrality at best that the Howard government represents in world fora as well as in this place. This is simply not good enough, because it sells out public opinion in Australia. There is no country in the world where public opinion is in favour of nuclear weapons. The world's people are opposed to nuclear weapons. If there were a plebiscite around the world tomorrow, nuclear weapons would be outlawed by the sentiment of something like 80 per cent of the people on the planet. We have nuclear weapons because there is greed, belligerence and a failure of imagination, not amongst ordinary people but amongst those who hold the power and exercise it. That includes democracies and dictatorships alike.</para></talk.start><para>The recent vote on the United Nations resolution on nuclear disarmament, `The need for a new agenda', was hosted by, amongst 
 other countries, our neighbour New Zealand, which is the only country to have comprehensively prohibited nuclear weapons and nuclear activities on its soil. There was a preponderant 114 votes in favour, there were 18 votes against, from the nuclear countries and their acolytes by and large, and there were abstentions from 38 countries who could not make up their minds that nuclear weapons should be outlawed, and that includes Australia—no doubt part of the result of a very strong lobby, including emissaries from the United States and elsewhere, coming here to Canberra to lobby to not have this resolution go through.</para><para>One of the things we have to be clear about here is that this government is influenced by the fact that the uranium miners want to expand their exports into the world nuclear fuel cycle, and that is indivisible from the propensity for making nuclear weapons. It is an immoral process that we take part in there. The sale of uranium out of this country compromises governments in their ability to take a stand comparable to New Zealand's in opposing nuclear weapons, which is the wish of the majority of Australians.</para><para>There is a consistency in polls elsewhere around the world on such things as nuclear disarmament, support for UN resolutions on the abolition of nuclear weapons and so on. In Canada 92 per cent of people support it. In India, even following the media coverage of euphoria about the explosion of their nuclear bomb last year, 73 per cent of people do not want the country to develop nuclear weapons. In Norway support is 92 per cent; Germany, 87 per cent; Belgium, 72 per cent; and in Russia, 61 per cent of people want nuclear weapons abolished altogether.</para><para>In the United States, 87 per cent of people want their government to negotiate a nuclear weapons convention. But the Senate, calling on and abusing Christian sentiment, amongst other things, have decided—for reasons including those outlined just a moment ago by Senator Cook—to vote against the wish of the rest of the world that we move towards a comprehensive test ban treaty and the abolition of nuclear weapons. In the United Kingdom, 87 per cent of people supported a 
 nuclear weapons convention; in Australia, 92 per cent; in Japan, 78 per cent—and so on.</para><para>The sentiment is extraordinarily strong. And why not? The World Court itself in its advisory opinion of 8 July 1996 cited the uniquely appalling characteristics of nuclear weapons:</para><para>. . . in particular their destructive capacity, their capacity to cause untold human suffering, and their ability to cause damage to generations to come.</para><para>It added that only they:</para><para>. . . have the potential to destroy all civilisation and the entire ecosystem of the planet.</para><para>But there is a mind block among the powers that be that is not able to relate to life on the planet in the future. It is an armageddon fault in the brains of those people in power who seem to think that they have some form of immortality or that, if they press the button first, there will be no repercussions and that they will in fact be the last ones left on the planet when the nuclear weapons explode. It is an enormous dilemma. It is one of those things that causes me to be in favour of a world parliament so that there can be a better reflection of the feelings of the people around the world through a democratic system, rather than the current system which leaves that world opinion at the mercy of multinational corporations that have an investment imperative in much of what they do and that do not think about the wider human and ecological components essential to proper political decision making.</para><para>It is interesting to read what retired US Air Force General Lee Butler had to say about nuclear deterrence, which is the driving force for the stockpiling or the maintenance of nuclear weapons, both in the NATO countries as well as in Russia and China. He said:</para><para>(T)he theory of nuclear deterrence, the bedrock principle of US national security during the Cold War, is costly, wrong-headed and dangerous.</para><para>(Deterrence) evolved from an increasingly convoluted morass of unwarranted assumptions, unprovable assertions and logical contradictions.</para><para>This is the best thinkers in the United States having their thinking dissected by one who was part of their military establishment. He goes on:</para><para>By the end of the first decade of the Cold War, it had effectively served to suspend rational thinking 
 about the ultimate aim of national security: to ensure the survival of the nation.</para><para>The United States alone has spent $A7 trillion or $A8 trillion on developing nuclear weapons. That outstrips such things as education, local security and the delivery of a lot of social security services in the United States. It is an indictment, again, of the way in which the world has failed, after more than half a century of nuclear weapons, to come to grips with this blight on our collective reputation.</para><para>I hope we get far enough in history that the world will be able to look back on this period and note not only the fight of those who wanted nuclear weapons but also the extraordinary public feeling against them and the ongoing campaign that is coming from a grassroots level. On that, I would like to note this book, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Fast track to zero nuclear weapons</inline>, which outlines the middle powers initiative, which Australia abstained from at the United Nations. It was disseminated widely in this parliament just last week by that noted former Western Australian Greens senator Jo Valentine, who was here to lobby for sanity as far as nuclear weapons are concerned.</para><para>I am appalled that we have a government that cannot come out against nuclear weapons testing insofar as they cannot come out in favour of this new middle powers initiative in the United Nations. We should be part of the driving force for this instead of, at best, sitting on the sidelines saying, `We are unable to make up our minds.' That is what the government are saying here today: they cannot make up their mind to support this extraordinarily reasonable motion. It is not an outspoken motion; it is simply calling for a message to come from this place to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Australian Ambassador to the UN and to other UN delegations to say that the Senate wants Australia to join the other middle power nations, for goodness sake, like Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden.</para><para>Notably, South Africa had nuclear weapons and got rid of them. It is one of the four countries that has actually done what the rest of the world wants countries like Russia, the 
 United States, China, Britain, India, Pakistan, Israel and Iran to do. I also note at this point that, at the moment, we have at the Lucas Heights reactor in Sydney at least 16 scientists working on a laser enrichment program which is going to diminish the cost of enriching uranium by about 90 per cent, if it fulfils its promise—to use that word in a contrary or strange context. This means that nuclear weapons, for those who can get hold of this technology, will be much cheaper to produce. So not only are we exporting the raw materials out of this country; we are also engaged in and licensing experimentation which is ultimately going to flow on to help those who want to abuse nuclear weapons and who could hold the world in thrall of unimaginable terrorism in the next century, because we are not acting now.

I thought that the government's arguments were very weak. For the government to say that it was supportive of individual elements of resolution 76(R) but not the resolution as a whole, seems to me to be an extraordinary statement to make, particularly given that we are one of those middle order states which have no nuclear weapons and that we entered into legally binding commitments not to receive, to manufacture or to otherwise acquire weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. Those undertakings were made in the context of a corresponding legally binding commitment to the pursuit of nuclear disarmament by the nuclear weapons states, including the US, which seems to be the country which Australia is most afraid of upsetting.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Ian Campbell also said that the government applauds the progress so far on 
 disarmament, coming down from 60,000 nuclear warheads to 36,000. A fraction of 36,000 nuclear warheads would be enough to wipe out most of humanity on this planet. So it is not good enough. We must use whatever means are at our disposal and we must join with other nations when initiatives such as this come up and do our utmost to see that that 36,000 arsenal of nuclear warheads is gotten rid of completely. That is the only way we can guarantee a safe and peaceful future for this planet.</para><para>Even though Australia is not a major player on the world stage in terms of nuclear activities, it must use whatever means are at its disposal to influence other countries. To say that this would call into question previous treaties and that the new agenda presupposes that the existing convention has failed is really quite absurd. Is Senator Ian Campbell saying that those other states—Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden—have got it so wrong; that they have presupposed that the existing convention has failed? I find that an extraordinary argument to put.</para><para>It is disappointing. I hope that the government can come up with some other measure, some other step, that will allow us to go forward on this and to really make a stand. Whenever I see New Zealand's name amongst the number of countries which stand up against nuclear weapons in the world, I feel very proud of New Zealand because it is such a close neighbour to us but very sorry that Australia cannot follow the example of what is a very small nation but one which is unafraid to stand up to the rest of the world and unafraid to speak out about this issue. I often wish that Australia could find the courage to do what New Zealand does. Again, I urge the Senate to support this motion and I urge the government to change its mind about what I see as an intransigent position.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10142</page.no></debateinfo><para>Messages received from the House of Representatives agreeing to the amendments made by the Senate to the following bills:</para><para> Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999

The most visible impact of the new system so far has been the price reductions for goods including TVs, video recorders, stereos and cameras as a result of wholesale sales tax on those items being reduced from 32 per cent to 22 per cent on 29 July.</para><para>Since the legislation came into effect, many industry groups and practitioners have identified and brought to the government's attention a number of issues. We have noted where improvements could be made, and we have taken on board constructive suggestions concerning the legislation.</para><para>This bill includes amendments which the government considers are necessary to ensure that the original intention of the law has been enacted and to ensure smooth implementation of this historic tax reform. Further consultations are continuing, and in particular areas—for example, financial services—the need for further amendments is being considered. However, I can inform the parliament that, 
 barring unforeseen events, it is the government's intention to have further finetuning completed and legislated by the end of the year. This will provide business with a clear six-month period before implementation of the GST on 1 July 2000.</para><para>Turning to the specific changes, the amendments in this bill provide some necessary and worthwhile concessions, amendments to clarify the existing rules, and some revenue and consumer protection measures.</para><para>The government has always been concerned to ensure that the GST is not used as an excuse by unscrupulous operators to unfairly increase prices. While we have provided the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission with powers to monitor prices and tough penalties for exploitation, we have been made aware of a view that the ACCC's powers do not cover situations where prices are unfairly increased prior to 1 July 2000. To put the issue beyond any doubt, the government will amend the Trade Practices Act 1975 to ensure that, in addition to their post 1 July 2000 powers, the ACCC's powers enable it to take immediate action in respect of any unreasonable price rises before 1 July 2000.</para><para>During the negotiations with the Democrats over the initial package of tax reform legislation it was agreed that a charities consultative group would be established with the Australian Taxation Office. This group is assisting in clarifying the effect of the GST on the sector and will develop rulings well in advance of the introduction of the GST.</para><para>As a result of these consultations, this bill will extend the definition of non-commercial supplies of residential accommodation by charities. The market value and cost of supply tests will be extended for the non-commercial supplies of residential accommodation by charities from 50 per cent to 75 per cent.</para><para>The measure only applies to non-commercial supply of residential accommodation by charities, because the client income based contributions associated with residential accommodation are often only marginally above the current 50 per cent market value test. To not meet this test would make the supplies input taxed as residential rents or taxable as commercial accommodation for some boarding houses, which would significantly increase compliance costs. This is an important measure which will reduce compliance costs while maintaining the principle that all commercial supplies should be subject to GST. The 50 per cent market value test remains for other non-commercial supplies.</para><para>The government will also take this opportunity to insert measures to provide further assistance to small business. In particular, the government will provide special rules for retailers with a mixture of 
 taxable and GST-free supplies so that the Commissioner of Taxation will be able to determine alternative, simpler methods of calculating GST liability for retailers selling such goods. This provision for simplified accounting methods is an important measure to reduce compliance costs of small business. In addition, the Treasurer has already announced that the government will extend the cash basis for accounting for GST by doubling the existing cash accounting threshold to $1 million.</para><para>The government has also decided to provide relief for vehicle lessors in certain circumstances. Currently, motor vehicle lessors with operating leases are required to pay GST on the disposal of vehicles acquired before 2 December 1998--that is the date the GST bills were introduced into parliament--and sold after 30 June 2000, without any ability to recover that tax from lessees. To alleviate this problem, we will allow a notional input tax credit on the sale of these vehicles to offset the GST imposed. The cost to revenue of this measure is $150 million over four years.</para><para>Amendments in this bill also clarify the operation of the GST in several areas. We will make clear that exports acquired by an overseas business in Australia will be GST free even when ownership of goods passes to the overseas purchaser, who is not registered or required to be registered, before the goods are removed from Australia. This amendment will be welcomed by a wide range of industry bodies who have raised the GST treatment of free on board exports with the government.</para><para>We will also clarify the definition of wine products so that the wine equalisation tax extends, as was intended, to fruit or vegetable wines and grape wine products such as wine cocktails, flavoured wines and a range of cream drinks.</para><para>As an important revenue protection measure, this bill clarifies the application of the transitional measure denying input tax credits for the GST on business insurance premiums. The current legislation allows businesses to choose to claim an input tax credit on their business insurance premiums at the end of a quarterly or monthly tax period.</para><para>The government will amend this to make the election prospective rather than retrospective. The option to elect to claim the input tax credit would be available at the time of registration or subsequently at the time of lodging the business activity statement. The option will be confined to one election per entity, rather than per policy, to minimise compliance costs. The revenue consequences of the amendment are nil because it essentially gives effect to the intended policy. However, if the measure were not adopted, then the cost to revenue would be significant.

</para><para>The amendments are aimed at achieving genuine equality of opportunity for women in Australian workplaces. The bill seeks to bridge the gap which currently exists between the provision of equal opportunities for women in the workplace, and the ability and inclination of business managers to provide those opportunities. The bill will make the act more business-friendly and flexible, ensuring that organisations covered by the act are not subject to outdated and overly complex paperwork and costs associated with compliance. It will also assist in meeting the government's commitment to cut paperwork for business.</para><para>The Affirmative Action Act has now been in force for 13 years and, last year, its role and performance was reviewed by an independent committee. The committee unanimously found that the act had delivered substantial gains to women and desirable outcomes for business, and was still fulfilling a valued and valuable role. However, it was also found that amendments to the act could make it more efficient and more effective.</para><para>The committee also recommended the establishment of an Advisory Board under the existing provisions of the act. I was particularly pleased to endorse this recommendation, with the Advisory Board first meeting on 19 August 1999. I am confident that the Board will provide a proficient and valuable link between the Agency, the organisations covered by the act, and me. This is an important aspect of ensuring that the act is responsive to business, and to women, and is at its most efficient and effective.</para><para>The focus of this bill is to modernise the existing features of the Affirmative Action Act to allow it to more clearly reflect today's workplace procedures and practices. The bill endeavours to deliver genuine flexibility to employers in how they achieve equal employment opportunity for women in their workplaces, acknowledging that the previous `one size fits all' approach to equal opportunity for women in the workplace does not serve the best interests of women, business or the Australian economy more generally.</para><para>This bill proposes a fair and contemporary law which complements and positively reinforces the major objectives of our revitalised workplace relations system. It puts workers and businesses first, not institutions; it is relevant to modern Australia; it builds on the common interests which exist in the workplace; and it provides for fair and productive outcomes reflecting our national economic and social goals.</para><para>Most importantly, in achieving these outcomes, the bill retains and promotes the importance of equal opportunity for women in the workplace. Employers who currently have obligations under the Affirmative Action Act will be the same employers who have obligations under the amended Affirma 
 tive Action Act. The bill will simply change the nature of some of those obligations, making it more conducive for employers to provide genuine equal opportunity for women in the workplace.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The name of the Act, Agency and Director</inline></para><para>The bill clarifies the true intention of the Act. Unfortunately the term `affirmative action' is too often misconstrued as pertaining to `reverse' or `positive' discrimination based on preferential treatment and quotas. `Affirmative action' has been a misnomer, because the substance of the existing act has required `equal opportunity' in employment, rather than `affirmative action'. This is an appropriate direction for the act, and one which the government will continue, with both the substantive and nomenclature changes achieved by the bill.</para><para>This bill therefore proposes a change in name to the act, Agency and the Director's title to dispel, once and for all, any misunderstandings about the essential aims of the legislation. The bill seeks to rename the act the `Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act', the Agency will be known as the `Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency' and the Director will be the `Director of Equal Opportunity in the Workplace'.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Inserting an objects clause</inline></para><para>To support the name changes, the bill also introduces an objects clause. This reflects contemporary legislative practice and further elucidates the genuine objectives of the act.</para><para>The new objects clause states that the principal objects of the act are to: promote the principle that employment for women should be dealt with on the basis of merit; promote, amongst employers, the elimination of discrimination against, and the provision of equal opportunity for, women in relation to employment matters; and to foster workplace consultation between employers and employees on issues concerning equal opportunity for women in relation to employment. In short, this bill aims to facilitate equal opportunity for women in the workplace, recognise the importance of merit, and promote dialogue between employers and employees on matters relating to equal opportunity for women in the workplace.</para><para>The objects clause will provide guidance to employers and the Agency about the interpretation and administration of the act. With respect to consultation, this will mean that employers will be encouraged to ensure adequate dialogue between employers and employees on matters relating to the act. The Agency will take into account this objective in the full range of its activities including its educative and promotional activities.</para><para>The insertion of this objects clause will not detract from the Agency's existing role with respect to the promotion within the wider community of the understanding, acceptance and public discussion of 
 issues relating to equal opportunity for women in the workplace.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Definition of `employment matters'</inline></para><para>The definition of `employment matters' is broadened by the bill. In addition to those matters already covered by the act, such as selection processes and conditions of service, the bill adds `work organisation' and `arrangements for dealing with sex-based harassment'. These matters were identified by the review committee as being of importance to women in achieving equal opportunity in the workplace. These changes will bring the act up-to-date with respect to matters relevant to the workplace of today. This list of employment matters is not intended to be an exhaustive account of matters relevant to the act. Indeed, the revised definition of an equal opportunity program means a program designed to remove all forms of discrimination against women in relation to employment matters at any particular workplace. This means that direct, indirect and systemic discrimination can be considered within the context of this act.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Equal opportunity for women in the workplace programs</inline></para><para>Under the existing provisions, employers are required to develop affirmative action programs based on a prescriptive and complex `8 step' process.</para><para>The revised approach, as introduced by this bill, is simpler and more straightforward. Its aims are outcomes oriented, rather than being process-driven, allowing and encouraging employers and employees to put in place programs that are tailored to the needs of their particular workplaces.</para><para>The new workplace programs will require the preparation of a workplace profile. This profile will be based upon data relating to the occupational and gender characteristics of the workplace. In collecting data, employers can choose to use standard ABS categories, or employers can use any other categories relevant to them. Some organisations have their own very specific classification system, while others use industry or occupational standards.</para><para>This provision supports our objectives of greater flexibility and the alleviation of unnecessary processes and paperwork.</para><para>Once an employer has a workplace profile, the employer will then be required to undertake an analysis to identify issues that the employer would need to address to achieve equal opportunity for women in the employer's workplace.</para><para>Once the analysis is undertaken, the program must then provide for actions to be taken in relation to priority issues, and for an evaluation of the effectiveness of these actions.</para><para>The new emphasis is squarely on actions and achievements. It provides opportunities for employ 
 ers and workers to be genuinely innovative, and encourages real and appropriate measures to be put in place and gains to be made.</para><para>The new program requirements also encourage organisations to take into account the broader business context, putting equal employment opportunity firmly in the context of good business practice, and integrating it into more general management strategies.</para><para>This also means that employers will not have to duplicate activities that are undertaken for another purpose, but that also meet requirements under this act. In particular this relates to the collection of data for the purpose of the workplace profile.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Reporting requirements</inline></para><para>To reflect the revised program requirements, the bill also introduces new reporting requirements.</para><para>As with the existing provisions, employers will still be required to submit reports to the Agency concerning their programs. However, the new reports will afford significantly more flexibility to reporting organisations, focusing less on processes and more on outcomes. The integrity of the reporting system will be maintained with organisations required to analyse, describe and evaluate the actions taken in the previous reporting period, and also to provide a forward-looking plan for the next reporting period. Workplace profiles are to be submitted with respect to each reporting period.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Reporting periods</inline></para><para>The new reporting cycles will be more firmly aligned with strategic workforce planning.</para><para>The bill introduces a two-year cycle, as opposed to the existing one-year cycle. This will significantly reduce the paperwork burden on employers and will again soundly place the emphasis on quality program development and genuine achievement of equal opportunity for women in the workplace. During the review process, a number of organisations sought longer reporting cycles to enable equal opportunity for women in the workplace to be embedded in corporate planning. One year was considered too short a timeframe to put in place actions aimed at achieving real and sustained change.</para><para>A two-year cycle will enable equal opportunity for women in the workplace to better sit beside strategic human resource development issues.  Savings realised by employers with the reduced reporting burden will allow resources to be redirected towards measurable progress.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Waiving of reporting requirements</inline></para><para>The bill introduces a revised waiving arrangement.</para><para>The Agency will have the power to waive reporting requirements, for a specified period, where it is satisfied that the employer has taken all reasonably 
 practicable measures to address the issues relating to employment matters that affect equal opportunity for women in their workplace.</para><para>The phrase `reasonably practicable' is a commonly used expression in Commonwealth statutes. This test contains an objective standard that is balanced by the capacity to consider the particular facts of an employer's situation. The test is objective in that the Agency will consider whether the measures taken are of the type that would be taken by  a reasonable employer when addressing issues that affect equal opportunity for women in the workplace. The reference to `practicable' also provides for consideration of the actual constraints and limits that face the employer in deciding what measures will be taken.</para><para>To meet the requirements for waiver, employers must satisfy the Agency that they have taken all reasonably practicable measures to address each identified issue relating to each defined employment matter. If the organisation has no issues concerning a particular employment matter (for example, an all-female workplace that has had no experience of sex-based harassment), then no actions in that area need be taken. Of course there may also be cases where, by addressing one issue, other related issues are subsequently resolved.</para><para>It is likely that the revised waiving criteria could mean that certain smaller companies, who do provide equal opportunity for women in their workplaces, are not necessarily disadvantaged simply because they cannot meet the standards of sophisticated equal opportunity for women in the workplace programs put in place by their larger, and wealthier, counterparts. There will be more scope for genuine effort and innovation to be rewarded, and more room for genuine constraints to be recognised.</para><para>The new Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Advisory Board has been asked to examine this provision in more detail, and to develop guidelines on how it should administered. However, it is anticipated that this revision will enable a wider range of organisations to be rewarded for their efforts.</para><para>There is also provision for the Agency to waive the reporting requirement, for a specified period, on its own motion. Regardless of whether an organisation is waived by applying to the Agency or on the own motion the Agency, they will still have to meet the same standard—that is that they have taken all reasonably practicable measures to address issues affecting equal opportunity for women in the workplace .</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Agency may request information</inline></para><para>To ensure the probity of reports under this act, the bill also introduces a provision allowing the Agency to request the employer to provide informa 
 tion concerning any aspect of the employer's workplace program or the preparation of the report, or the report itself.</para><para>This counters any implication that the revised reporting requirements in any way diminish employers' responsibilities with respect to equal opportunity for women in the workplace. The Agency can, at any point in the reporting cycle, seek verification of information supplied to the Agency about the workplace program or report.</para><para>This provision also assists employers. Previously the Agency could only seek information once non-compliance had been determined. The proposed amendments allow the Agency to ask for information at any time, thereby assisting employers to comply with the act at an early stage, and ensuring that they are not subject to the retained sanctions associated with non-compliance.</para><para>Mr Speaker, the introduction of the bill implements the legislative aspects of the government's response to the independent committee's report on the regulatory review of the Affirmative Action Act  as well as undertakings made by the government in `More Jobs, Better Pay'.</para><para>The committee's report followed an extensive consultation process, including the seeking of submissions (of which over 180 were received), the convening of roundtable discussions in each State and Territory capital city, and the survey of all organisations covered by the act. I thank all those who constructively participated in these consultations.</para><para>The bill has had significant input from the Board, and been the subject of valuable comments from the Office of the Status of Women.</para><para>The proposed changes to the Affirmative Action Act support the government's, and Australia's, commitment to equal employment opportunity for women by ensuring that the act is fully and effectively meeting its objectives.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Quirke</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>10147</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title><page.no>10147</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>10147</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>10147</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the Australian dairy industry, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  record of the committee's proceedings, submissions and documents received by the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to move a motion in respect of the report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para><para>I believe that this is an outstanding report and that it reflects very clearly the evidence received from every state in Australia.

We believe it is important to hear that voice.

The specific matters included:</para><para>(a)	 future domestic and international marketing conditions facing the Australian dairy industry and those factors which are influencing Australia's competitiveness in these markets;</para><para>(b)	 the pressures on the current industry regulatory arrangements such as the introduction of new 
 technologies and competitor supplier countries such as New Zealand;</para><para>(c)	 the impacts associated with the removal of the Domestic Market Support scheme on:</para><para>(i)	 the dairy industry and rural and regional communities; and</para><para>(ii)	 state marketing arrangements; and</para><para>(d)	 measures which may be taken by government to facilitate the transition to a less regulated environment.</para><para>Following significant public response and 116 submissions, including many from individual farmers, the Committee undertook a series of public hearings in all states of Australia to hear first hand about the potential effects of deregulation and the options to be pursued.The major considerations for the Committee during its inquiry were:</para><para>.	 the drivers of deregulation;</para><para>.	 the impact of National Competition Policy on the deregulation of the dairy industry;</para><para>.	 the specific impacts of deregulation on individual farmers and rural and regional communities;</para><para>.	 whether deregulation could be delayed or whether deregulation was inevitable and what an appropriate time frame for deregulation might be;</para><para>.	 the adequacy of the re-structure package in the event of deregulation on 1 July 2000;</para><para>.	 the role of the Commonwealth Government and the States in setting the deregulation agenda.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Committee Findings</inline></para><para>The Committee considers that the following threshold questions need to be addressed by Government in terms of the debate on deregulation:</para><para>.	<inline font-style="italic">Could a case be made on national interest grounds to continue or discontinue intervention?</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">.	 In any event, will market forces, sooner or later, force deregulation?</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">.	 If they do, is a managed outcome with a soft landing preferable to a commercially driven crash;</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">.	 Is the proposed adjustment package, big as it is, enough?</inline></para><para>The Committee has concluded that at some point the market will force deregulation and that a managed outcome is preferable to deregulation cold turkey. On a personal note, I am disappointed that there is not more political will to confront those market forces which are so destructive of farmers' income and rural communities. Deregulation of the dairy industry will have significant impacts on individual farmers—both in terms of falls in income and in a drop in the value of capital assets—and the communities in which they live. These impacts must be addressed by Government. 
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Drivers of Deregulation and National Competition Policy</inline></para><para>Deregulation is principally supported by the large Victorian co-operatives, Murray Goulburn and Bonlac, and the United Dairyfarmers of Victoria. However, because Victoria dominates dairy production in Australia, producing two thirds of the total milk produced in Australia, Victoria's press for deregulation is of considerable weight. However, even within Victoria, there seems to be considerable disquiet amongst the dairy farming community about the advantages of deregulation.The Australian Dairy Industry Council has been proactive in alerting governments and the farming community of the consequences of deregulation and in proposing a means of dealing with those consequences in order that the industry will be able to withstand the fallout from total deregulation, if it occurs on 1 July 2000. The ADIC comprises industry and farmer representatives from all over Australia and their membership reflects the degree to which Victoria dominates the industry.</para><para>The Committee was also interested to undertake an assessment of the degree to which National Competition Policy was a driver for deregulation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Committee concerns</inline></para><para>The Committee has a number of specific concerns about the proposal to deregulate the industry, including:</para><para>.	 the application of the public interest test in the State based legislation reviews under the terms of National Competition Policy;</para><para>.	 the precise impact on farmers income and the adequacy of the re-structure package;</para><para>.	 the failure to date by state governments to address the issue of compensation for quota, where appropriate; and</para><para>.	 the impact on rural and regional communities.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">National Competition Policy</inline></para><para>The Committee's concerns in relation to the application of National Competition Policy principles, especially the interpretation of the net community benefit/public interest test and its application in the varying legislation reviews include:</para><para>.	 there has not been a thorough investigation of the national consequences of deregulation with State reviews being undertaken piecemeal;</para><para>.	 assessment of the public interest in the reviews has been less than comprehensive and appears to favour narrow sectional interests.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">The re-structure package</inline></para><para>The Committee is further concerned that the consequences of deregulation for individual farmers, their businesses and communities are not being sufficiently addressed. The impacts for farmers include: 
</para><para>.	 an abrupt loss of income by farmers across Australia as farmgate prices drop;</para><para>.	 a reduction in the value of capital assets;</para><para>.	 a loss of the value of quota entitlement in some states;</para><para>.	 the disappearance of countervailing market power by farmers who will be subject to the force of the major processors and retailers.</para><para>Should deregulation take place on 1 July 2000, the adequacy of the re-structure package is problematic, especially:</para><para>.	 Whether the amount to be received is adequate to cover the loss of income the package is intended to address;</para><para>.	 The lack of any compensation by the States for loss of quota entitlement;</para><para>.	 The administrative arrangements for the assessment and dispersal of funds under the scheme.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">The Impact on Rural and Regional Communities</inline></para><para>The impact of deregulation will be felt severely in most dairying communities around Australia, given the flow-on effects which will manifest within those communities—the farmers themselves will be affected, as will be the businesses which rely on dairying. In the Committee's opinion, the social and regional impacts will be severe and will need to be given detailed consideration in terms of any structural adjustment assistance, once deregulation occurs.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendations</inline></para><para>The Committee has recommended a series of actions, including most importantly that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Government call, as a matter of urgency, a meeting of state Agriculture and Regional Development Ministers to determine a framework, and a timeframe, for the co-ordinated deregulation of the Dairy Industry.</para><para>The Committee considers that this is a critical action which must take place to promote certainty within the industry and an appropriate framework for continued operation.</para><para>The issues of quota compensation and rural and regional adjustment schemes are also critical. The Committee wishes to draw attention to the Bega Valley Social Impact Study, a study funded by the local community raising the funding and which developed a detailed snapshot of the community and was able to demonstrate in a highly specific way the impact that a fall in the farmgate price of milk of different degrees would have on the local community. The Committee considers that this is a fundamental piece of work, demonstrating very clearly the potential impacts of deregulation on a community such as the Bega Valley. 
</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—I would like to make some general comments that flow from this overview. The first comment I want to make is that I am appalled that we are once again faced with a decision which will further erode rural communities and reduce the profitability of farming businesses. I say I am appalled because it seems that there is little political will to resist the forces that are driving this process. It is a process that has been going on for decades and no political party, including my own, has been able to stop it. We have seen a decline in rural populations for some decades; we have seen, with some outstanding exceptions, the profitability of farms declining.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the reports and the evidence which we received, these market forces were identified as national competition policy, the global market and commercial realities. I am concerned that we, as politicians, put ourselves forward to represent rural communities, and then we have to say that there are forces which we cannot resist. One has to ask the question: if that is so, if we are unable to resist forces which are driving a process of degradation of rural communities, surely we should question whether we should put ourselves forward. If these forces are irresistible, perhaps we should stop pretending that we have any solutions and allow the processes to simply continue.</para><para>However, I believe that there is political will in all of the political parties, particularly those that are most concerned about rural communities. I believe that the recent Victorian election showed that there was political will amongst ordinary country people who are prepared to change their vote if they believe that they are not being represented by those whom they have elected. Country people are understanding that they must take control of their own futures and that politicians must take account of the concerns they express. If politicians do not take account of those concerns, if we cannot resist the forces that are doing this to our country areas, then we should perhaps get out of the road. No wonder people ask, `What is the point of electing people to either the peak farmer organisations 
 or to parliament?', if we cannot do anything for them.</para><para>Let me underline, in the time I have left, what the committee report says about those commercial pressures. It is clear from the report that part of the pressure is coming from the big milk manufacturers—the processors. Our report indicates that much of the drive for deregulation comes from Bonlac and Murray Goulburn in Victoria, which have the majority of the market. I find it interesting to read a recent <inline font-style="italic">Weekly Times</inline>, which indicates that the Chief Executive of Bonlac, Mr Scanlan, is now a million dollar man. In other words, with his base salary and bonuses added to it, he now receives just over $1 million a year in salary. Yet he is asking farmers to live on welfare. I believe that is an obscenity.</para><para>There is no doubt that there is commercial pressure coming from the large processors. There is also no doubt that there is a transfer of income out of farmers' pockets into the pockets of the processors and the big supermarkets. I believe that we ought to indicate very clearly to this country where those pressures are coming from and whether or not that is the way Australia wants to go. It is about time we made very clear what is happening.</para><para>Another part of the commercial pressure is said to be the pressure from the global market, particularly the pressure for exports. Let me underline the fact that we are talking about exports of a low value product such as skim milk powder which makes up the bulk of the exports and in order to sell skim milk powder into a corrupt world market we are asking farmers to supply the milk for that product at below the cost of production. That makes no sense to me. It makes no sense at all and it certainly does not make any sense to those farmers who in some cases are now receiving below the cost of production for the milk they supply to the manufacturers in order to manufacture a bulk but low value product. A much larger proportion of the milk supply from states such as Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia goes into whole milk. There is no doubt that the premium price they receive is certainly under threat from the milk processors in Victoria, where 
 over 60 per cent of the total milk production in Australia comes from, and that those commercial pressures will continue.</para><para>This parliament needs to clearly indicate where that pressure is coming from. We also need to indicate that we believe it is about time the federal government and state agricultural ministers got together and recognised those pressures themselves and, if they cannot be resisted, put together a package which is more adequate than the package being offered. That package does not address the issue of the loss of quotas and their values and it does not address the regional impacts which in some cases will be very severe. In conclusion, I draw attention to the Bega study—which was paid for by people in Bega themselves—which shows that there will be a very significant impact on that community if deregulation does go ahead.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>—I understand that there is an agreement to divide the remaining time available in this debate and I ask the Clerk to set the clock accordingly.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>10151</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—First, I echo Senator Woodley's comments in relation to the activities of the secretary of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in the conduct of this inquiry and the preparation of the report, particularly the work of Robina Jaffray, whose work in coordinating the submissions, organising hearings and the compilation of the report has been absolutely essential to the efficient functioning of this committee. Let me pay my compliments. This work is a substantial reflection of the effort and diligence of Robina and other members of the committee secretariat in the performance of their duties.</para></talk.start><para>Let me also say that this committee travels through rural and regional Australia and we are indebted to Hansard for the enormous effort they put in in carrying equipment to hearings, setting up, getting information from witnesses so that the record can properly reflect who is giving evidence, and generally doing the hard slog that is not apparent from the report that the committee lays down. Without the efforts of Hansard, the members 
 of the committee and the secretariat would be extremely hampered in the performance of our work. This report also reflects the diligence, the hard work and the professionalism of Hansard in the performance of its important duty as part of the Australian parliament.</para><para>There is always a temptation in areas such as this to tell people what they want to hear. There is also a temptation just to present both sides of the argument but not draw any conclusions. These approaches have not been a feature of this committee in my experience, and this report is no exception. This committee also has a record of bringing down unanimous all-party reports and recommendations, and again this report on the Australian dairy industry is no exception. I must say that we have tested the boundaries of our ability to reach agreement. In some respects there would be passages in this report with which I would agree but others might not and I am sure other senators would say the same thing. That situation has arisen in respect of many reports handed down by this committee. We believe that it is important to have a view that reflects the totality of the views of members of the committee rather than seeking simply to pursue a set of words that a particular senator wants.</para><para>We have considered 116 submissions, we have taken evidence from 99 witnesses and there are nearly 700 pages of evidence. The evidence is that the industry has performed exceptionally well over the past two decades. It has made considerable changes over that period and, with the support of government, it has managed the process very effectively. Over the last 20 years we have had the Kerin plan, the DMSS scheme, and the Crean plan, which varied that scheme. So this industry has been the subject of considerable interest from the Australian government.</para><para> There is no doubt that there is a long-term future for the Australian dairy industry and in my view it will be a positive one. There is no doubt as well that the Australian dairy industry will be fully deregulated over time. As this report finds, the real issue is its timing and how that process is managed. It is essential that the process is coordinated and it is clearly the responsibility of the minister, Mr 
 Truss, to manage that process. This is not simply a matter for the industry or individual states. Unfortunately, to date Mr Truss apparently has not accepted that responsibility. I am advised that in relation to the government's approach to the industry package he has now told the industry that they need to go out and sell that package to the states and that it is not a job for the federal government. That certainly is not my view.</para><para>It is also the view that, while there may be some benefits from a staged approach to deregulation, the best approach is a one-off, properly designed, adequately resourced and fully coordinated approach. It is clear that in the short term farmers and the regions in which they live will suffer under deregulation and that the position of consumers at best will not improve. In the long term the industry as a whole will benefit if further reforms are achieved in the international marketplace and, I say again, it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth government to deal with these short-term costs and maximise the potential for long-term gains.</para><para>In relation to evidence that we have received that there is some support for a proposal that there be a national plebiscite of farmers to determine what course the government and industry should take in managing the dairy industry's future, the committee believes that a simple plebiscite would not be helpful at all. However, perhaps a proper survey covering a wide range of important issues may be helpful. I have to say that this inquiry has been exhaustive—and in some respects, exhausting—and we think that the body of information that has flowed from the inquiry is a sufficient basis for governments to properly develop and implement appropriate measures to manage the process.</para><para>It is my view that the Commonwealth government has failed in this regard. It has failed to act in a timely and proper manner and, as a consequence, the industry and state governments are now forced to address these important issues in a very short time frame. That is to be regretted. Unfortunately, I have had a very limited time—which is about to expire—in which to speak on this matter, and I will deal with it again later.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>10152</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the opening remarks made by my colleague Senator O'Brien concerning the fantastic effort put in by our committee during this inquiry. I give my thanks in particular to Robina Jaffray. I have been involved in many committees and the work she did on this report was outstanding and of the very highest class. She has done a great deal of work on this report on behalf of the members of the committee and has produced a very comprehensive and fairly large report that really gets to the nitty-gritty of the key issues. I commend the spirit in which my colleagues on this committee have worked through the issues, because they are not simple or easy and go far beyond the dairy industry itself.</para></talk.start><para>Before I walked into the chamber I was talking on the telephone to a friend of mine who is a dairy farmer in Harvey in Western Australia. They are now trying to work out how they will restructure the town because of the impact this will have on them. There is no doubt that over the next two or three years in rural dairy communities—as Senator Woodley said—there will be an enormous restructuring, not only of farms but also of businesses, support industries, service industries and schools. Sometimes people in this place do not have any perception of what happens when three or four children happen to leave an area. That area often loses a teacher or a nurse from the hospital or some other aspect of the service industry in the area is affected. I agree absolutely that the deregulation of the dairy industry is inevitable. In fact, I believe it is already here, even if the states do not deregulate. The DMS scheme is going and we will have across-the-border trading. The impact of that will be quite devastating to dairy farmers in the initial stages.</para><para>As a member of the government I will not accept everything that is said in this place, but, while I supported the recommendation in the report, there is some inherent criticism of the fact that the job has not been got on with quickly enough. There has not been enough attention given to it, but the states themselves, particularly New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia—although I do not list 
 them in any particular order; I can start with Western Australia first—have not been helpful. We have a conservative government in Western Australia and when we started this process Victoria had one too. The states have not been as helpful as they could have been.</para><para>As a matter of extreme urgency—as we reflect in recommendation 1—the states together with the Commonwealth must now pull their weight and get on with what is required to refine the package put on the table by the Commonwealth government and deal with all the other associated issues. One of the problems you have with a situation like this is when the states have the `head of power' under the constitution to deal with quotas while the Commonwealth has an overall responsibility. Some particular states have been tardy when it comes to dealing with their quotas and what they are going to do. You are then left with a situation which invariably ends up being totally unsatisfactory. I say to all the state ministers and to us in government that we need to put a lot of urgency into the next two, three or four months and come to conclusions that will meet the issues head on.</para><para>This has highlighted a chronic problem which we have with the agreement on competition policy. I could criticise the former government for that because they put it together with the state government, but I am not going to do that. I am going to set the challenge to this parliament that we must deal with competition policy or what I see as a gap in it, and that is looking at the national net benefit. When you go around the states individually and you get one report in one state and another report in another state, it confirms the status quo on what is happening, that there is a net public benefit. In one particular state—in this case, it happens to be Victoria by virtue of the fact that a different recommendation came out of that state—and that is not their fault; I think it is a weakness in the system—there is no consideration of the Commonwealth net benefit. That has to be addressed.</para><para>There are not many industries like the dairy industry in Australia in the way it is structured, where it has a joint responsibility. 
 Nonetheless I think it needs to be addressed and there needs to be some form of national test as well. Things might get handled a little differently if that were there.</para><para>Concerning the package, I want to raise a couple of concerns which I have. It is not the size of the package—I think it is enormous—but I am concerned about the distributional effects that that could well have in terms of what may happen regionally, within a state, and also nationally across the various states. If we analyse some of the figures which we received very recently, I think we will find that, unless there are some disciplines put around that particular package, the states—particularly Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales—are going to find it very hard to accept it because the effect will be that those states will be assisting Victoria to export milk across the border into bigger states and undermine the market milk operations there. That is a real concern which obviously the government and we in this parliament have to deal with so that we get the right result out of the package that has been put up and not one that merely shifts the problem across borders and creates further enormous social problems. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>10153</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This report on deregulation of the Australian dairy industry is very significant. It is comprehensive and, as previous speakers have stated—and I endorse their remarks—the comprehensive nature of the report is due very much to the hard work of the secretariat, particularly Robina Jaffray, who worked with the committee throughout its hearings and deliberations. The committee had the opportunity to visit regional areas of Australia, which provided us with first-hand experience of what can be the very serious and in some cases possibly devastating effects of unbridled deregulation and competition policy upon the people working and living in those regions. All colleagues on the committee were very impressed with the evidence that was brought before us, albeit that there were different points of view put from time to time.</para></talk.start><para>Time is short and I am sure there will be much more to say about this report on future 
 occasions. The dairy industry is a significant industry, both domestically and internationally. It has been restructuring since the 1970s, when it suffered a major blow due to the entry at that time of the United Kingdom into the European Community, or Common Market as it was then called. Over those years through the various plans that Senator O'Brien referred to, such as the Kerin plan and the Crean plan, the industry has had to restructure. It has improved its efficiency, and unfortunately that has come at some cost. For instance, today there are some 30 per cent fewer dairy farmers in operation than there were in the 1970s. Still the industry is characterised by some 95 per cent of those farmers being family farmers. When you visit the regions and talk to those farmers, to community leaders and to other people, as we did, you experience first-hand the concerns that they have about future deregulation, particularly the impact that reduced farm gate prices for market milk will have upon them.</para><para>While there has been a feeling of inevitability about future deregulation because of the abolition of the domestic market support scheme from July next year, that does not lessen the impact of the problem. For instance, Senator Woodley has referred to the study that was done in the Bega area in my home state of New South Wales. I urge senators and others to look in detail at that study. It demonstrates the problems that can impact upon a regional community with decisions such as this which not only directly affect the industry but have a much greater multiplier effect throughout the community. That experience could quite possibly occur in other areas of New South Wales and in other states. That is why we have recommended that there needs to be a specific focus on regional adjustment assistance within a total package.</para><para>The package that has been developed addresses particularly lost income for dairy farmers as a result of deregulation, but there is a range of other issues which also need to be addressed. We have recommended that in particular there has to be consideration given—in fact, there has to be a commitment by state and federal governments—to finding 
 ways to assist those regional communities that will be affected by what happens in this industry. As we have seen, the impact of national competition policy is not confined to just this industry.</para><para>I have to say—and I agree with Senator O'Brien—that the federal government could have picked up the ball a lot quicker and run with it a lot harder than it has done to date. I recall, in a debate in this chamber on 29 September, Senator Troeth interjecting at one point in a speech of mine and saying, `This issue is a matter for the states.' It is not a matter just for the states. Whilst regulation of the market milk industry resides with the states, the fact is that this is a national industry and a national issue and it requires national leadership. Unfortunately, I think that has been lacking. You cannot expect to just leave it to the individual states, who have different competing interests, as we have seen, to try and coordinate the final approach. What we are urging as a matter of urgency is for the federal government to coordinate, develop and implement ultimately a nationally agreed package of measures that addresses these issues, not just those that are addressed by this package. In conclusion, I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10154</page.no><id.no>r717</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>10154</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 20 October.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Schedule of the amendment made by the Senate to which the House of Representatives has disagreed</inline>—</para><para>(17)	 Schedule 2, page 40 (after line 6), at the end of the Schedule, add:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">	 55  Application</inline></para><para>	 The amendments made by items 48 to 53 (inclusive) do not apply to a person who, on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, is receiving parenting payment at the rate applicable for a person who is not a member of a couple.

The measure that the amendment related to sought to change the entitlements for CDEP Scheme recipients. Broadly speaking, it was a good measure which increased availability for most scheme recipients to various add-ons that social security recipients normally receive, such as rent assistance, but it also had a flow-on effect of reducing payments for about 4,000 people, mainly women on sole parents pension. That was of concern to the Democrats.</para></talk.start><para>We were willing to accept the intent of the change that the government was putting forward in relation to sole parents, which was to ensure consistency of treatment across all 
 income support recipients, but we did feel that it was inappropriate for the approximately 4,000 people that were already in that circumstance to have their income reduced by a fairly significant amount. Thus, we moved a grandfathering related amendment to protect those people whilst ensuring that any people in the future in receipt of the lone parenting payment would be treated differently under the new regime.</para><para>It appears, as the House of Representatives and the government have indicated, that they do not like the concept of a grandfather clause, at least in relation to this particular amendment, and also that the original amendment did not meet the purpose for which it was intended.</para><para>Following some communication with the Clerk and also with assistance from the government, I think we have come to an amendment which does have the intent that the Democrats had initially. I suppose this is starting to be an indication of how complex the Social Security Act is becoming and how difficult it is to get amendments that have the intent that one desires reflected in them. But I think we have got it this time. Obviously, as part of that, we would like to indicate that the original intent of the Democrats to have a grandfathering amendment to protect those lone parents currently on the CDEP Scheme to retain their current income treatment is something the Democrats wish to pursue and continue with. Having now, I think, got an amendment which we believe will achieve that, I will move that amendment, which has been circulated, at the appropriate stage in the debate.</para><para>I will speak to it briefly without going through all the arguments that we went through last time we discussed the bill. The Democrats believe, as I have just stated, that it is appropriate that those people who are already in the situation do not have a significant reduction in their income. There are two things I would like to emphasise in support of that.</para><para> Firstly, in terms of the concept of grandfathering itself, it was pointed out in this chamber on Tuesday, when the government was putting forward some changes to the 
 Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (1999 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1999, that those changes include a grandfathering clause for some people, so that they would not be negatively impacted by the changes that were proposed to shared caring arrangements. I think that in itself demonstrates that inserting grandfathering arrangements is not calamitous public policy that will cease to enable the effective operation of the entire income support system.</para><para>As I stated the first time around, I think it is a legitimate transitional method to try to smooth the effect of change so that any changes that are made do not impact too severely and suddenly on people. The government itself obviously had the same view in relation to another change it was proposing with that other piece of legislation, so I think that in itself shows that there is nothing inherently unacceptable about grandfathering.</para><para>I would also like to mention some comments that the Democrats have received from ATSIC. As was stated the first time around, the Democrats quite willingly conceded that ATSIC as a body have expressed their support for the changes the government is proposing to ensure equitable treatment for all CDEP participants. They have stated that and they are keen to get the measure up and running. A letter dated 30 September from Gatjil Djerrkura to the Democrats stated:</para><para>I am advised that the Democrats are proposing a grandfathering amendment, which would enable those lone parents currently participating on the CDEP scheme to retain the current income treatment whilst they remain as CDEP participants. ATSIC supports this proposal because it protects the present income of those lone parents currently participating on the CDEP scheme.</para><para>I would like to read that into the record as an indication that the government have made some play on the fact that ATSIC supported their amendments, which is quite appropriate for them to highlight. I would also like put on the record that ATSIC has indicated support for the Democrats' proposal to have a grandfathering amendment as part of that changeover.</para><para>I think those are sufficient arguments, certainly from the Democrats' point of view, 
 to persevere with our original intent of having a grandfathering component as part of this change and with the hope of an amendment which I believe does meet that purpose. I could ask Senator Campbell, who has an extensive knowledge of the Social Security Act 1991, to outline that in greater detail but I have actually discussed it with his advisers already. I am satisfied that it does meet the aim of the intention that the Democrats had in relation to this. That being the case, I would like to eagerly dispose of the government's motion and then move my amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>10156</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Labor opposition, we will be obviously supporting the government motion because it disposes of the Democrats' original amendments, and we will be supporting Senator Bartlett's amendment as circulated in the chamber. It seeks to give legislative effect to the position that they originally proposed. In the original debate in this chamber, Labor had a proposition that the benefit for single parents to access CDEP payments was to be supported. The Democrats did not support that view, and they put up a compromise position, which was that we grandfather the entitlements of those currently in receipt of CDEP.</para></talk.start><para>I said during that debate that I thought that was a second best option, but that, reading the numbers in the chamber, the Labor opposition was prepared to support that. It had the advantage of at least protecting the entitlements of those people currently in receipt of the single parenting payment and CDEP. We would prefer to see the situation that currently exists continue because we do not think there is any good reason for reducing the payments made to some of the most disadvantaged people in our community. We are talking about single parent Aboriginal people supporting children and also working in the CDEP program. We think they are some of the most disadvantaged members of our community.</para><para>These are people who are making an effort to contribute to their society. We believe the current arrangements give them the same entitlements as other single parents in terms of earning a tax-free income which allows 
 them to supplement their parenting payment. Sure, this is a supplement that is going from another Commonwealth funded scheme, but we believe, given the isolation of these communities and the absence of any other employment opportunities, that it is not unreasonable to say that they ought to be able to access both payments. This in effect would be their equivalent of obtaining part-time employment in the private sector. There is virtually no part-time or full-time work available in these communities outside the CDEP program. They do not have the opportunities that people living in other communities have. Given that they are single parent Aboriginal people, living in remote communities and trying to bring up children, we think that the current arrangements are not overly generous and that it is a mistake to seek to reduce the entitlements that these people currently enjoy. We think doing so in the name of uniformity is not sufficient justification.</para><para>But we have had that argument. We have put that case. The Democrats are putting up a compromise proposition, which is the grandfathering proposition that is before us today. We supported that during the original debate and will support that again as a second-best option. We accept the government's advice that the original amendments did not achieve what we sought to achieve in terms of the legislative outcome. It is obviously important that we get it right. Senator Bartlett has now circulated an amendment which seeks to give effect to that proposition. We will support that again today, and we hope that the government will accept that as a reasonable compromise between what they set out to achieve and the interests of the people affected, which we think ought to be given some priority in this debate. So we will be supporting the motion moved by Senator Ian Campbell to not insist on that original set of amendments, but we will also be supporting Senator Bartlett when he moves the new amendment which establishes the grandfathering provision for single parents who are CDEP participants. We believe that is a much better alternative than the complete removal of those benefits, as proposed by the government.  </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>10157</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Schedule 2, page 40 (after line 6), at the end of the Schedule, add:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">55 Benefits of single parents who are CDEP participants not to be reduced</inline></para><para>	 (1)	 Section 1188C inserted in the Social Security Act 1991 by item 53 does not apply in respect of a person who, immediately before the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent:</para><para>		 (a)	 was in receipt of parenting payment at the rate applicable for a person who is not a member of a couple: and</para><para>		 (b)	 was a CDEP participant.</para><para>	 (2)	 However, if such a person ceases on or after that day to be a CDEP participant, subitem (1) ceases to have effect in respect of the person whether or not he or she afterwards again becomes a CDEP participant.</para><para>I spoke to this amendment at length before when I thought I was moving it.

In addition, it also proposes to enact a protocol—an amendment—to the existing DTA with Malaysia. These are generally consistent but do have some differing provisions because of the specific domestic tax arrangements of some jurisdictions. DTAs exist to clarify taxing rights between jurisdictions for income derived in one jurisdiction by a resident of another jurisdiction. 
 They attempt to ensure an equitable distribution of taxing rights between jurisdictions and to avoid double taxation, so as to encourage trade and investment between entities of the jurisdictions.</para></talk.start><para>Australia has a large network of DTAs mainly because Labor, when in office, significantly expanded the network of DTAs that Australia is a party to. We did this in order to create a better environment for Australian business to operate internationally and to encourage productive investment in Australia. This approach has been built upon by the current government and these latest agreements are the results of the continuation of Labor's successful policies.</para><para>I might say in passing, at least in respect of the Slovak Republic, that it is a new nation as a result of the fall of the former Soviet Union and the break-up of the old Czechoslovak communist state. I will make no comment about the break-up of the Czechoslovak state obviously caused by the creation of a new nation in Europe.</para><para>I will turn to the specific provisions. Australia's DTAs are all broadly similar in their design. They are based generally on the OECD model convention but they also reflect the particular economic circumstances of Australia, namely Australia being a large capital importer, and the domestic tax rules of the other jurisdiction on some occasions. For example, the taxation of some annuities under the South African DTA differs from the normal agreements Australia is a party to because of the specific treatment of this income under South African law. Similarly, the withholding tax limits for interest, royalties and dividends under the Argentinian DTA vary from the normal practice, as does the inclusion of the specific branch profits tax provision. These variations reflect the reality of negotiations with differing tax jurisdictions and are not opposed by Labor.</para><para>However, Labor is concerned at what it sees as the continuing slowness by the government on two fronts concerning our international agreements network: firstly, putting Australian firms on a level playing field where they invest overseas, compared to the generous deal Australia gives foreign investors here; 
 and, secondly, the negligence concerning international tax avoidance through the use of these treaties which the current government has, at least to date, not rectified.</para><para>Let me deal firstly with the unfairness of current dividend withholding tax arrangements. The recent Ralph committee's final report covered this issue at pages 677 and 678. The recommendation is:</para><para>That in negotiating double taxation arrangements, Australia endeavour to reduce dividend withholding tax rates on non-portfolio investments.</para><para>Non-portfolio investments are those where the investment represents 10 per cent or more of a business. So Mr Ralph has recommended to the Liberal government that it undertake specific action concerning DTAs to overcome situations where Australia is more generous to foreign investors than the particular foreign nation is to Australian shareholders. I emphasise that we need to be overcoming the situations where Australia is more generous to foreign investors than the particular foreign nation is to Australian shareholders.</para><para>Certainly, in the debate about business tax reforms, it is often emphasised that Australia is less competitive compared with many of our trading partners and international competitors, and at least in some situations Australia is in fact more generous than many of these overseas countries. As Mr Ralph notes at page 678:</para><para>Since 1994 Australia has sought lower foreign dividend withholding tax rates on non-portfolio dividends . . .</para><para>So Labor started to address this problem. The treaties before us today do deal with this issue because they are following the policy established by Labor. For example, proposed article 10(2)(A) of the South African agreement does obtain fair treatment for Australian shareholders with investments in South Africa. This is because the Liberal government is following Labor's policy lead.</para><para>The real issue—the most important aspect of this anomaly—is with the nations with which Australia has the largest investments. The two major nations are, of course, the United Kingdom and the United States. The United Kingdom has fixed the problem through its domestic law but not through the 
 DTA, so at least at the moment the problem does not occur in Britain. But in the United States it is still happening. In the US the current DTA arrangements allow the unfair situation whereby a 15 per cent dividend withholding tax is imposed on Australian businesses remitting dividends from taxed profits from the United States, whereas Australia does not levy such a withholding tax on US investors out of taxed profits from Australia. This is a clear example—despite the often repeated claims, most of which are generalised in the Australian community—that we have less competitive tax arrangements than the United States, for example.</para><para>What are the government doing about this anomaly? To date they have been completely silent on this matter. I would just emphasise this again. In respect of the United States, we have the unfair situation where a 15 per cent dividend withholding tax is imposed on Australian businesses remitting dividends from taxed profits from America. Australia does not levy such a withholding tax on US investors out of taxed profits from Australia. This is an example of where Australia's economic interests are being damaged by the poor international relations conducted by the Howard Liberal government. There have been some other examples of this in recent times, but they relate to other matters and I will not go into them here today.</para><para>We should have more clout in Washington than we have at the present time. If we did, perhaps we could make some progress in renegotiating this treaty. Unfortunately it seems that the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, does not have a great deal of clout, at least with the current administration in the United States. This is an area to which urgent attention should be given because of the disadvantage to which Australian businesses are being put. Furthermore, the Treasurer's introduction to the United States, which I think most would recall, where he inappropriately and publicly talked about his meeting with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve had the unfortunate side-effect of diminishing our credibility with some of the key economic policy makers in the United States.</para><para>Secondly, the Liberal government has not legislated to close the enormous loophole under Australia's DTAs which has arisen because of the decision in the Lamesa Holdings case in 1997. This decision means that foreigners can take free capital gains on holdings of Australian land and mining ventures through utilising a simple chain of companies. Let me emphasise the central concern about this case again. The decision means that foreigners—not Australians—can take tax free capital gains on holdings of Australian land and mining ventures through utilising a simple chain of companies. There has been no legislation, despite the fact that the Treasurer issued a press release promising to do something about this loophole on 27 April 1998—approximately 18 months ago.</para><para>Let me deal, in some small detail at least, with the decision in respect of Lamesa Holdings. The Lamesa decision was handed down by the full Federal Court on 20 August 1997. It dismissed an appeal by the tax office concerning a significant loophole in Australia's ability to tax gains arising from Australian real property, including mining rights. The court held that the existing double taxation agreements, DTAs, which give Australia the exclusive right to tax profits arising from the alienation of real property situated in Australia—and this includes shares in companies that hold interests in real property—did not apply in the situation where multiple layers of subsidiaries were interposed between the non-resident holding company and the Australian real property. The disposal of the interest in the Australian asset was accomplished indirectly through selling one of the interposed companies rather than the asset itself.</para><para>The effect of this decision, if unaddressed, is to make simple the avoidance of tax on gains made by the non-resident through holding Australian real property. All real property assets held by non-residents can be restructured into a multiple, interposed structure and a significant Australian tax base would then be at risk. It is not just this; there is also the particular problem of the unfairness with respect to Australian resident taxpayers, who do have to pay the appropriate level of 
 capital gains tax. Yet we have the continuing situation where, potentially, the foreign owners—the non-residents—can minimise or even eliminate their capital gains tax on property and some mining interests.</para><para>Rather belatedly the Treasurer issued release No. 39 on 27 April 1998 which announced that, from that time, indirect alienations of Australian real property, as occurred in Lamesa, would be subject to Australian tax. This was justified, and quite correctly, as being a move to shore up Australia's existing taxing rights rather than create a new tax base. The result was announced as being achieved by Australia unilaterally amending its international tax legislation in respect of all DTAs rather than individually renegotiating each DTA. I would just remind the Senate that we do not have the legislation yet that deals with the commitment and the announcement made by the Treasurer, by press release, promising to do something about this loophole—and this announcement was made on 27 April, 18 months ago.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Lightfoot)</name></talker><para>—Order!

This agreement adds to that and adds to the large network of DTAs that were negotiated when the Labor Party were in government.

Firstly, it adds members of the Western Australian Anti-Corruption Commission and the Queensland Crime Commission and authorised staff members of those commissions to the list of people who may apply for interception warrants. Secondly, it removes from the 
 Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Act 1997 the sunset clause on the provision that allows members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue interception warrants. The Australian Democrats have no concerns in relation to the granting of the power to apply for warrants to members of the Western Australian Anti-Corruption Commission or the Queensland Crime Commission or to authorised staff.</para></talk.start><para>The reason that I want to speak briefly to this bill today is to recount our views in relation to members of the AAT issuing interception warrants. This issue was debated in September 1997. The view of the Australian Democrats at that time was that, rather than reposing this power in members of the AAT, we would have preferred that it be reposed in state Supreme Court judges. Additionally, we took the view that, before a member of the AAT was nominated to perform this function, the minister should have first made an assessment whether the number of judges performing the function was sufficient or insufficient. The Australian Democrats are still of the view that it is preferable for this function to be performed by judges rather than by members of the AAT who are, with respect, ultimately, administrative officers of the executive government.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party did not support either of the amendments I have outlined when my colleague Senator Murray first moved them in 1997. They have again indicated informally that they would not do so on this occasion if they were moved again. I will not be moving those amendments again, but I would like it to be noted for the record that the Australian Democrats very much retain a preference for warrant applications to be dealt with by members of the judiciary rather than officers of the executive. The 1997 amendment act included a requirement that the annual report for 1999-2000 include a review of the amendments by the act. The Telecommunications Interception Policy Review, prepared by Mr Peter Ford of the Attorney-General's Department, makes the comment that, by all accounts, the conferral of the power on nominated members of the AAT 
 had worked well in practice and that the AAT members who have been nominated have a high status and are independent of the executive. He stated that they bring to the task a seriousness of purpose and commitment to principles of accountability which serves the public interest well.</para><para>The Australian Democrats are pleased that this is the case, and I am unaware of any specific problems arising out of the decision to allow members of the AAT to issue interception warrants. That report goes on to refer to the proposed new Administrative Review Tribunal, which will replace the AAT, and to suggest that members of that tribunal will continue to perform the function of issuing warrants. I understand that amendments will be required to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 before that can occur, and I would ask the minister or his representative to inform me if my understanding of that is correct.</para><para>I submit that the government are being very presumptuous if they think it is a foregone conclusion that members of the new ART will simply pick up where the members of the AAT left off in terms of issuing warrants. I signal to the government that the Australian Democrats would be very careful in assessing the nature of the role of members of the ART and their qualifications before we would even consider allowing those members to perform this extremely important function.</para><para>The report also refers to the creation of the federal magistracy and the potential for federal magistrates to be nominated as persons who will be able to issue warrants. Again, I understand that this would require an amendment to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, and I again note that the Democrats would be very careful in ensuring that nomination of federal magistrates in that circumstance would be appropriate. Subject to these comments, the Australian Democrats support this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>10163</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to very briefly indicate that the opposition support the <inline ref="r917">Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1999</inline> . I want to make a couple of comments as to why we are dealing with it now and not at 12.45 p.m., 
 given that it was intended that we deal with a message relating to the <inline ref="r646">Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998</inline> . There was an exchange in this chamber because that bill was pulled by the government with, apparently, as I have subsequently ascertained, some consultation with the opposition in the House of Representatives. I will acknowledge that Senator Ian Campbell was correct when he said that there had been consultation, and I wish to put that on the record.</para></talk.start><para>It should be on the record that there was a request from Mr Tuckey's office for the opposition to agree to pull the bill—or the message, I should say—today. The opposition's position is that it is a matter for the government to arrange their business in this chamber, and the government have done so by making a decision to pull the consideration of the message relating to the Regional Forests Agreement Bill. It is a matter for the government as to when that bill proceeds. I indicate that the opposition is ready, willing and able to deal with that bill at any time. As I say, it is a matter for the government to decide when that bill is dealt with and it is a matter that the government will be obliged to clarify should there be any question as to whose decision it was to pull the bill. I say again: the bill was pulled by the government and the opposition has acceded to their request, as it is the government's decision to proceed or not with the message, and the opposition is ready, willing and able to proceed with that matter. In relation to the bill before the chamber, the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1999 , my understanding is that the opposition is supporting that bill and obviously, if the Democrats are not proceeding with amendments, we do not need to consider those matters now. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10163</page.no><id.no>r750</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>10163</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 29 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>10164</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r750">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999</inline>  makes a number of amendments to the National Health Act 1953 and seeks to address various concerns raised in the Industry Commission's report No. 57 into private health insurance by making changes to the operation and powers of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. The main elements of the bill relate to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. The proposals that are now before us extend the regulatory powers and the independence of PHIAC from the department and the minister in all but matters of policy. Schedule 1 of the bill will transfer further functions and powers from the Department of Health and Aged Care to PHIAC to enhance its role as an industry regulator, and this includes the power to register funds, cancel registrations and approve mergers.</para></talk.start><para>Schedule 1 also has a number of other amendments that give PHIAC further functions, including (1) requiring health funds to be incorporated as companies—this will ensure a professionalism in the health funds and will ensure that funds are subject to the financial rigour that members could legitimately expect in any membership arrangement; (2) amending the act to require health funds to hold health insurance as their primary business so that health fund moneys are spent on health insurance matters; (3) making sure that business decisions must now be made acting in the interests of members, and this also gives the courts powers to set aside transactions which are not in the interests of members of the fund; (4) there will also be a new civil penalty regime for directors where serious contraventions have occurred without them taking reasonable steps to avoid them.</para><para>The opposition supports all of these amendments because we believe they will make the industry more accountable and more in line with the expectations of their membership. However, we believe the government should go further, and that PHIAC should be made a stronger and more independent authority. The huge rebate the government is now pouring into private health insurance adds 
 weight to that argument and that there needs to be effective monitoring of the spending of that rebate.</para><para>The powers in relation to the prudential regulation of registered funds are dealt with in schedule 2 of the bill. At the moment the minimum reserve requirements do not adequately reflect the reality that a number of funds have operated within these for a number of years. It is proposed to strengthen PHIAC's role by giving it increased power of oversight and the power to order the appointment of an administrator or the wind-up of a fund. It is worth noting that, as at 30 June last year, PHIAC reported that five out of 44 funds were in breach of the solvency standards—down from nine in the previous year. It is unsettling to the opposition that this number of funds are in breach of these requirements. This bill will require PHIAC to set a standard, which may differ between various health benefit organisations, in writing. PHIAC is required to consult with the Australian Government Actuary in that process, and these standards would be a disallowable instrument of this parliament.</para><para>The involvement of the Government Actuary is a key to the success of these arrangements in the view of the opposition. We believe it is the appropriate body from which PHIAC can draw advice over capital adequacy and solvency standards, but under the legislation there is no requirement for PHIAC to actually follow the actuary's advice. Again I am drawn to my point relating to the experience and skills base in PHIAC currently. The opposition has put forward an amendment to require the council to publish its reasons if it decides to reject the advice of the Government Actuary, so that the council's decisions will be transparent.</para><para>With regard to schedule 3 of the bill, these measures deal with a number of changes that arise out of the defects and unforeseen consequences of the 1998 private health insurance rebate legislation. This bill will remove the requirement for annual registration for receiving the rebate—meaning that, while we may have some incorrect payments, the administration becomes much simpler. In keeping with Senator Harradine's amendments, should 
 a fund not offer no gap or no gap policies by July 2000, the minister will have the power under these amendments to have them wound up. The Health Insurance Commission will be required to pay claims within 14 days. Fund members who have had a claim rejected will be able to seek a review by the Health Insurance Commission before having to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as currently applies.</para><para>While we agree with these amendments, this serves to underline for us the rather ham-fisted and excessively hurried approach the government has had to the health rebate legislation. The point that needs to be made is that the government keeps making change after change to private health insurance without ever planning out what it wants to do or how it will get there. I refer the government to the Industry Commission report No. 57 into private health insurance. On page 364 of that report it states:</para><para>The overriding purpose of any regulatory regime should be the protection of consumers and not the protection of inefficient funds.</para><para>This is one of the key objectives of the opposition in relation to the private health insurance legislation, and I am pleased that the government has accepted the opposition amendments to give a stronger set of consumer rights for those with health insurance. Under the opposition amendments, the council will have a clear set of objectives which require the protection of consumer interests and the minimisation of premium increases.</para><para>Other important changes include: public reports will show the price increases for each fund and each state, which will allow consumers to shop around between health funds; rule changes will no longer be allowed to be made in secret; all members will receive an explanation of changes in plain English before they become effective; appeals will be allowed against decisions of the Health Insurance Commission to recover overpayments of the 30 per cent health rebate; and a waiver will be allowed where the overpayment is due to incorrect information or administrative error. These changes will give consumers more power and will force the industry to be more competitive.</para><para>We have also proposed amendments to improve the accountability of the industry regulator, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. Council members will no longer be able to be drawn from people managing or working for a fund in order for it to operate at arms length from the industry. These changes will make the bill stronger, and this will be good for the long-term health of the private health insurance funds. I indicate that we will support the bill, and we hope that other senators will support the amendments we move today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>10165</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This piece of legislation, the <inline ref="r750">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999</inline> , proposes a significant revamp of the responsibilities of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council, also known as PHIAC. The Democrats support this piece of legislation and congratulate the government on the work in it. We will also be supporting the ALP amendments. We believe that the role of PHIAC is particularly important, given the large amount of money that is now finding its way into private health insurance through the rebate—I understand it is around $1.6 billion a year. We certainly support the independence of PHIAC from both the government and the private health insurance industry, to ensure that it can operate in a transparent and accountable manner, free from any political interests and free from any pressure from the health insurance industry. We therefore support the provisions of this bill, which will protect consumers by strengthening the prudential regulation of the private health insurance industry.</para></talk.start><para>We will also be moving some amendments to this bill to further strengthen the accountability and transparency of the regulation of private health insurance. These amendments relate to the appointment of members of PHIAC and the appointment of the Private Health Insurance Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner. The Democrats are concerned to ensure that, wherever appointments are made to public authorities, the process by which these appointments are made is transparent, accountable, open and 
 honest. The practice of `jobs for the boys' should be well and truly behind us as we move towards the year 2000, but unfortunately not much seems to have changed. Certainly in the public perception of how appointments are made, there is still a lot of work to be done. The perception is still very much one that appointments are based on anything but merit. The perception of how appointments to boards such as this are made can damage the bodies, as, in the public eye, they are seen as having in their membership people who lack the appropriate independence and possibly the appropriate skills as well.</para><para>It is still the case in Australia that appointments to statutory authorities are left largely to the discretion of the minister who has the relevant portfolio responsibility. In the absence of umbrella legislation to correct this situation in a systematic fashion, the Democrats have moved these amendments time and time again, arguing for them as each piece of legislation that deals with such bodies comes before us. We are attempting to set up an accountable regime concerning appointments made by ministers. I have forgotten how many times my colleague Senator Murray has moved a similar batch of amendments, but he has done so on many occasions.</para><para>The Nolan committee, which reviewed the process for making public appointments in the United Kingdom, led to the establishment of an Office of Commissioner for Public Appointments. That allowed for external scrutiny of how these appointments are made in the United Kingdom. The commissioner subsequently developed a code of practice for public appointments, which came into force in the UK over three years ago, on 1 July 1996. The code regulates appointments to non-departmental public bodies and sets out seven principles on which such appointments must be based: ministerial responsibility, merit, independent scrutiny, equal opportunity, probity, openness and transparency and proportionality. The code provides mandatory guidelines for the application of these principles.</para><para>A comparison of these reforms with the current practice here in the federal sphere of Australia shows very clearly that we lag well 
 behind the United Kingdom in this respect. Not only do we lack the external scrutiny mechanisms, in the form of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, but, more fundamentally, we do not even have basic procedural safeguards. The Democrats believe that this should be addressed by government as a matter of high priority. The public must have confidence that ministers will not allow improper procedures and will not allow largely irrelevant considerations or, perhaps, personal interest to get in the way of their decisions or to influence public appointments. This relationship is, in some respects, analogous to those of a financial nature, such as the relationship between a trustee and beneficiary, in that it is founded on a high degree of trust and confidence. Where a breach of duty occurs in a fiduciary relationship, the person to whom the duty is owed has access to a range of remedies, but this is not the case where the minister acts in an improper way. There is no avenue for redress. This omission is addressed in the amendments that I will be moving and I look forward to support from other senators for these amendments.</para><para>Also in the amendments is a further provision, which requires that, even where the code of practice has been adhered to in determining an appointment, the minister be further obliged to consider the impact of the appointee on the overall complexity of the authority. In the case of PHIAC, this is particularly important. The provision prevents the capturing of a body by a particular sectional interest. Certainly the risk here is that the private health insurance industry—which has a lot to gain or, perhaps, lose—has considerable influence, and there is considerable potential for vested interest to seek to influence this regulatory regime. I say again clearly that our amendments further increase the transparency and accountability of prudential regulation of the private health insurance industry.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>10166</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>10166</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In order to ensure timely passage of this legislation, the government will not oppose the amendments from the ALP.

The minister for forests would have us believe this is the be-all and end-all for everything related to forestry; that it will guarantee Tasmania will get a pulp and paper mill; and, indeed, it will guarantee that somehow we will have sustainable forestry as a result. The minister's representative, the parliamentary secretary, Senator Troeth, said a number of things in here yesterday. She said:</para></talk.start><para>. . . the consequence of the opposition's amendments would be the immediate cessation of woodchip processing in all areas except those where RFAs were signed before 1 March 1999, because the exporters would have no guarantee that their product could be shipped. 
</para><para>Nothing could be further from the truth. If I did not already know that the parliamentary secretary knows very little about this matter, I would accuse her of deliberately misleading the Senate.</para><para>The fact is that woodchip exports are dealt with under the Customs Act. There is no way that a delay of this bill, its non-passage or the amendment of it will have any impact on the government at a Commonwealth level or state governments getting approval for woodchip exports. That is simply the fact. Nothing that the parliamentary secretary said yesterday could be further from the truth, but I forgive her because I know she does not really know the processes relating to the granting of export woodchip licences. She went on to say:</para><para>The mere fact that Senate approval was required would prevent a woodchip exporter from processing residues.</para><para>Again, this is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts; no way is that the case. She further said:</para><para>Timber mills would either close or lay off workers, and contractors would be unemployed. These impacts would hit hardest in small mills where sales of residue play a larger part in cash flow.</para><para>She got the last part right, because residues do play an important part in the cash flow of small sawmills.</para><para>Nothing in this bill, amended or otherwise, will have any impact on that. The biggest impact on small sawmills in this country are the decisions made in the boardrooms of North Forest Products, Boral and others. That is where they stand to lose, because those people take decisions about the amount of money they pay them for residues. Indeed, even under the Customs Act, there is nothing that can prevent the domestic processing of wood in this country. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth has no control over the domestic processing of wood, that is, the processing of timber in this country.</para><para>I am sure some senators would recall the debate about the Wesley Vale pulp and paper mill. If they do recall, they will understand what the facts are in respect of this matter. The  minister said that unless we passed this legislation Tasmania would not get a $2 
 billion pulp and paper mill. What a load of rubbish. The parliamentary secretary said:</para><para>There would also need to be a freeze on industry development . . . </para><para>Even with RFAs there has been a freeze on industry development. There are a whole range of other reasons, which I will go into further if I get the opportunity. The parliamentary secretary further said:</para><para>Therefore, the only thing that these amendments are achieving is delaying the bill until after all the RFAs are signed and preventing the government from getting on with the job of restructuring the industry under secure RFA regimes.</para><para>Nothing in the RFAs will allow the Commonwealth to get on with the job of restructuring the industry.</para><para>Although this legislation may claim to do a number of things, essentially it is designed to do one thing. It commits the Commonwealth to the payment of compensation should the Commonwealth breach a regional forest agreement. That is essentially all it does—nothing more, nothing less. A regional forest agreement is a signed agreement between the states and the Commonwealth and it is already in place in some states. It is an agreement regarding the conservation and preservation of certain areas, and other areas which are available for commercial forestry.</para><para>I say to the parliamentary secretary: read the bill. That is what it does. The parliamentary secretary says that the effect of the amendments proposed by the opposition will bring the forestry world to an end. What a load of nonsense. It has no effect. It is a disapproval process. A constitutional question was raised by the parliamentary secretary. As I understand it, the Constitution indicates that the Commonwealth cannot make a law for part of a state or a law that has different application to other states or parts of other states, but in this case the amendments would not have the effect of making a different law. There is nothing wrong with the parliament reviewing a process. We do it with a number of other acts and processes when we review what is proposed to be put in place. With regard to the constitutional aspects of this matter, at the end of the day a state or a region within a state gets an RFA. It may not 
 be the RFA that was initially proposed for whatever reason, and I have my own personal views about that process. However, the reality is that we ought to deal with the facts in this place.</para><para>Finally, I did not think I would ever hear this statement, but somehow the $2 billion trade deficit in the pulp and paper industry has been thrown up at us. If the government is really serious about doing something about that, it would not be worrying about a major debate on this piece of legislation. It would get on with the job and actually give this industry some direction. The government would take the sort of direction that can be taken at a Commonwealth level in conjunction with the states and bring about some real industry development.</para><para>This piece of legislation will not guarantee that. We have had a regional forest agreement in my state for 12 months. Despite the grand claim made by the former minister—I think it was Anderson—along with the Prime Minister that a thousand jobs were going to be created, not one has been. In fact, we have probably lost 500 or 600. Let us not try to concoct stories about how important this piece of legislation really is. It is important for one reason; and at the end of the day it is not all that important for that reason, because the opposition in this place, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, cannot stop the government from paying compensation to a state.</para><para>Remember, it is the government that has to make the decision to take action against the state if it feels it has not complied with the regional forest agreement. It is the government; not the opposition, not the Senate. If you read the bill, there is a certain process even for the Commonwealth to terminate a regional forest agreement. But at the end of the day it is the government that makes that decision, as it is the government that will make the decision to issue woodchip licences, if it deems fit, for the export of woodchips from areas that are covered by a regional forest agreement, whether or not it is certified by regional forest agreement legislation in any form. </para><para>It is about time that this minister and a few others around this place stopped saying that somehow this legislation is the fundamental underpinning of the future of the forest industry in this country—because it is not. We proposed an amendment other than the one for disapproval, and that was to set up a Wood and Paper Industry Council. To my mind, it was one of the most important aspects of this legislation because it would have put back into regional forest agreements something that would have had some effect, to actually lead this industry to some appropriate development. But, oh no, we could not get that. The Democrats—some of whom indicated to me that they would support that proposal and who I thought were going to support the proposal—did not support it.</para><para>Senator Brown did support it. Despite the fact that I have had many disagreements with Senator Brown over time, his environmental credentials are way ahead of those of the Democrats. He at least was able to grasp the nettle in respect of the relevance of having an industry council that actually, from my point of view—and I know he understood this—gave workers the opportunity to have a say, albeit limited, in the future direction of the development of their industry. But that was lost on the Democrats. So we now propose another amendment which goes to the setting up of another form of a council.</para><para>I have to say to Senator Greig that he has to understand that despite the fact that he may have a view—and I know Senator Brown has the view—that we should not be harvesting wood from native forests, the reality is something different. If we are going to have harvesting of native forests—and whether you or I like it, at this point that is not going to change—what we ought to do is put in place a mechanism through which there is some say about the utilisation of the wood that we take from those forests. That is what we ought to do. That is why we ought to have a Wood and Paper Industry Council in the legislation—not a stupid advisory council proposed by the government that is not unlike the one they set up before, even though they gave a commitment to the national forest policy process that they would adhere to the council 
 to which we, when last in government, gave a commitment. I say to the Democrats that that is why we want a Wood and Paper Industry Council—because it is the one small aspect of this whole process whereby you might be able to drive some appropriate utilisation of a very valuable resource that in many respects right now is being wasted.</para><para>I ask the Democrats to think about that because it is an important aspect. I agree with the Democrats that in looking at the use of commercially available forests, that is, where you harvest forests, be they native or plantation, then environmental issues ought to be taken account of. That is an important aspect of it. That commitment is even in the government's bill in terms of ecologically and sustainably managed forests.</para><para>So I have no problem with any suggestion about including environmental representatives on an industry council, but what is important is that we move towards sustainable utilisation of the wood that we take from our forests. We have no guarantee that that will be the case in a regional forest agreement. We have no guarantee in this legislation, without an amendment that goes to the setting up of a forest industry council. That is why, when we proposed our amendment, we wanted it in legislation—not something that the government proposed to set up by regulation, because it will not work. It did not work before; it is just another farce. I say to the Democrats: think very long and hard about that because fortunately we have been given the opportunity to move the amendment again and I would hope that after consideration you will support it.</para><para>I say to the parliamentary secretary: you had better understand clearly what this bill is proposing to do because I think at the moment you do not. We will question the government. I will ask you at some point where you think one of the amendments that we propose to move will block export woodchips. I want you to provide some evidence of that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>10174</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are here today, of course, because the House of Representatives, having returned its message to us, has stated that at this point 
 in time it will not tolerate the amendments which the Senate made not so long ago. Ultimately the question before us is: are we going to persist with those amendments?</para></talk.start><para>I had the opportunity to make what was my first visit to Tasmania last weekend, having been invited there by a range of industry and community groups to discuss issues within my portfolio responsibilities with the Australian Democrats. It took me, in part, to the dockside of Burnie and the breathtaking beauty of the Meander Valley, where some local landcare management people showed me the hillsides and hilltops of such places as Mother Cumming's Peak and Quamby, where for the first time I had the opportunity to view for myself the obscene destruction of the rainforest within that region and, more appallingly, the environmental damage that has resulted.</para><para>I was taken, amongst other places, to what was a small creek known as Dunning's Rivulet, which would now be more appropriately named Dunning's Canyon because of the disgraceful environmental damage that has clearly resulted from clear-felling in that region. And while the logging industries continue to deny that they have had any effect or impact on that, it is blindingly obvious to anyone who goes there that there is a direct cause and effect between the destruction of the rainforest in that region and the subsequent destruction of the surrounding lands. The further result of that through environmental degradation is that the run-off from this region is now depositing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of silt into the Tamar River and surrounding regions.</para><para>I make this point because it continues on from my personal experiences of the destruction of both the forests and the biodiversity within the south-west region of my home state. Ultimately, the point I am making is that I think we are losing sight of the issue. For we Democrats, the issue before us is not so much jobs, although we accept that that is important, but that the best way to appropriate jobs within what is the logging industry is not through the continued destruction of our native forests.</para><para>Senators have said here this afternoon that Democrats must accept the reality that logging of native forests will continue whether we like it or not. I guess in part we accept that. It is clear that both the government and the opposition continue to support the notion that destroying our native forests for logging and/or woodchipping is acceptable to them. It is not to us.</para><para>It has been proposed that Labor will again seek to introduce the amendment to establish its Wood and Paper Industry Council. Well, we have had that debate and, at that point in time, we Democrats proposed a raft of amendments in which we agreed to the notion of having such a council to investigate and utilise the best use of natural resources in regard to timber, but we argued then, as I argue again today, that no such council has any mandate from the Australian people unless it is genuinely and sincerely balanced with regard to logging and industry and environment and biodiversity. Labor's proposal does not do that.</para><para>It was suggested in the chamber yesterday by Senator Forshaw that we Democrats ought to accept Labor's proposal for their council because, if we did not and if that were to fail, then it would support the government's proposal. Well, then, so be it. If that is the concept to which you want to sign up, it is all yours; we want nothing of it. Having said that, if Labor were to accept the Democrats' amendment to make such a council and a proposal genuinely environmentally responsible and genuinely accessible to the people and their concerns in relation to biodiversity, ecotourism, water catchment and so on, then we would support such a council. So I am indicating that the Democrats have absolutely every intention of reintroducing our amendments to Labor's amendment such that any proposed Wood and Paper Industry Council is genuinely balanced.</para><para>In that sense, I guess there are—unless the debate continues further and tangents again—essentially two questions before us. Firstly, what, if anything, will be the nature and structure of the opposition's proposal for an industry council? Secondly, what has the Senate to say on the House of Represen 
 tatives' refusal to accept its amendments? In summary, I state that our argument on the question of an industry council is unchanged. If our original amendments to be resubmitted were accepted by the opposition and such an industry council can become a genuinely balanced and environmentally responsible body, it would have our support.</para><para>The bill as a whole regarding the regional forestry agreements is, of course, as I have said before, an obscenity. It is built on a lie. Anybody who has been to either Tasmania or East Gippsland or the south-west of Western Australia can see for themselves that the alleged argument of sustainability within our native forests is utterly ridiculous. Our resolve is unchanged. We Democrats remain utterly committed to the preservation of our ancient and native forests and continue to argue for reasoned debate and reasoned legislation with regard to the logging industry as it relates to alternatives, most particularly regrowth and plantation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>10175</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I appreciate those comments from Senator Greig, but I echo the interjections from the Labor Party that it was the Democrats who, before Senator Greig came, supported the RFA legislation and the majority of the impact of it by giving their numbers to the government to put through, in June, the environment legislation which effectively strips the minister of the power to protect Australia's forests. This legislation is not going to undo that; it is going to compound it.</para></talk.start><para>I will take this opportunity to also put to the parliamentary secretary the question I was going to ask yesterday afternoon about the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on Tuesday, 5 October 1999, headlined `An odd choice for sponsor' by Mark Butler. It is a reference to Mission Australia, the latest in the `Australia on CD-ROM' series, which is funded by the federal government to showcase Australia's multimedia talent. It says that, as one of the few surviving legacies of the Keating era, the series aims to provide eight entertaining but thought-provoking pathways into Australia's environmental problems, their causes and possible solutions, with an overwhelming 
 emphasis on the role individuals can play in causing and repairing the damage.</para><para>The article goes on to point out that a sponsor of this particular CD-ROM is North. It then says:</para><para>Other members of the development team were Landcare Australia, Environment Australia and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, but North's influence is evident throughout. Mr Butler says, `I could find no discussion about the devastating environmental effects of mining in Australia in the past hundred years, for instance. Rather, the emphasis is on the benefits mining brings to all of us. `Mining always has been and continues to be an integral part of Australian life.' End of quote and end of discussion. He says that North's involvement hopelessly compromises the integrity of the disc as a whole. In fact, North scores its own entry in the Mission Australia database, which is a collection of texts, narrated video and stills relating to key environmental topics.</para><para>Mr Temporary Chair, if you look at the game options, you see you can choose one of eight zones on a landscape: estuary, farm, coast, city, rivers, wetlands, rangeland, arid and mountain. The related character for the zone gives a brief overview of the situation, which can be replayed. No mention of forests there. But, as we know, North is the biggest woodchipper in the Southern Hemisphere.</para><para>I have a question for the parliamentary secretary: why is forest not mentioned in this production? Why is mining given such a particularly favourable run? What amount of funding did North put towards the production of this CD-ROM? What support did the federal government put into it? And what arrangements were made to have this co-host process with the other entities I have mentioned proceed? On the face of it, it is North, which is also a major contributor to the government's electoral funding, having influence on a government production, an influence which is entirely unwarranted and unacceptable. It means having an environmentally based production in the hands of one of the most environmentally damaging corporations in the world, North Ltd—from its mining of uranium at Jabiluka to the destruction of the world's tallest hardwood forests in Tasmania. An explanation is required. I will be pursuing this matter in the parliament until the facts about the production of this CD- 
ROM and the influence of North come to light. I will be pursuing that further in this committee stage, and I hope that, in the meantime, the parliamentary secretary will be able to produce some answers.</para><para>I want now to add to the contribution I made yesterday about amendments. I do prefer the council proposal that has been put forward by the opposition. I have one amendment to that, which has not been circulated yet but which would put a member from the Australian Conservation Foundation onto the Council. That was acceptable last time around, as I recollect, so I hope it will be this time. Senator Murphy will know that I am not an avid proponent of this council because I believe we ought to be having the sort of council that the Democrats are putting forward, one that really looks at all the ecological factors, the opportunity lost, the tourism industry's interests and those of local councils. But I can count. We are going to get some sort of council somewhere down the line, and I want to see that there is an environmental voice on that council because of the enormous importance that people right around the country put on the environmental component of forest management in this country.</para><para>Finally, I thank the staff for making this quickly available. I make reference to the Saturday Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> and the item, `End of a long haul for truckies as mill jobs go.' Twelve Tasmanian log truck owner/drivers are going to the wall after the Prime Minister made a promise, inherent in signing the regional forest agreement, that these true servants of the woodchip corporations would be looked after. They have been dumped. What does Mr Tuckey have to say about his failure to protect these jobs? Has he gone to Tasmania to reason with the logging corporations that have dumped another 12 people who put a great deal of faith and investment into the machinery which saved the log corporations like North Pty Ltd from running the financial risk?</para><para>Why is the Hon. Wilson Tuckey, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, silent on this one? Or is it that he is prepared to dump anybody, including the people he says 
 he is going to defend, if it is expeditious to do so in the interests of a few woodchip corporation heavies sitting in their velvet-lined chairs in St Kilda Road? That is how I would put it. It is pretty disgusting. But that is the problem that riddles this whole industry; that is the problem with this legislation. It is not here for the workers. They are not going to be compensated. The compensation clause in this legislation is here for North Broken Hill and the big entities that regularly make big donations to the government as they go down the line. I will be looking forward to seeing the votes that are coming down the line and to following this debate as it unfolds in the next couple of days.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>10177</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the committee report progress and seek leave to sit again.</para><para>It is appropriate at lunchtime on Thursdays, where people have made plans, that legislation that is controversial not be dealt with during this timeslot.

Jumbun is a community of about 110 people located about 200 kilometres north of Townsville, where my esteemed colleague, Senator Ian Macdonald, has an electoral office.</para></talk.start><para>While the Army has now completed a number of very successful projects in remote communities in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, Jumbun is the first Queensland community to be assisted under the government's $40 million ATSIC Army Community Assistance Project. The Army involvement at Jumbun has proven to be just as successful and popular with the local indigenous community as all the other pilot projects. This is great news considering that the initial $15 million project, when it was announced by the government in 1997, was dismissed by some as `a whitefella solution'. I am pleased to say that the outstanding success of the initial project prompt 
 ed the government to expand it in last year's budget to a $40 million project over the next four years. This program is bringing much needed infrastructure and training to indigenous communities through major improvements in basic living conditions.</para><para>The major focus of the Army's 17th Construction Squadron and the 19th Chief Engineers Works was the upgrading of the Jumbun sewage treatment system and water supply with funds provided by Townsville Regional Council. Members of the Aboriginal community are being trained to operate the plant and a maintenance contractor has been engaged for the first two years to ensure successful continued operation. The Army also upgraded the wet areas of community housing, which included the replacement of floor coverings. The close cooperation between ATSIC and the Army has enabled ATSIC to coordinate maintenance work funded under other ATSIC programs with work undertaken by the Army engineers. The community houses will be repainted later in the year, with the work going to a local contractor.</para><para>The Army is constructing a medical clinic in the community, with funding for the building materials provided by the Queensland health department. It is hoped that the clinic will be fully operational by the end of the year, leading to measurable improvements and health outcomes for all residents. Throughout the project, the Army ensured that trade training was provided for community members. These skills will ensure there is a skills base to maintain the upgraded infrastructure and it is expected to enable some members to obtain employment outside the community. Nine community members took part in traineeships in Jumbun, with training in water supply and sewerage and in housing repairs and maintenance.</para><para>There is no question that ACAP has been a tremendous success by any measure. For that reason, I am delighted to inform the Senate that the Army, despite its heavy commitment to East Timor and the Olympics, will be able to fulfil its obligations to complete another two projects next year. As I have already stated, we have committed $40 million to the project and we will stand by 
 that commitment, even if we have to consider extending the program for another 12 months should that become necessary given the Army's current commitments. While I cannot commend the Army enough for its commitment to this program, I would also like to praise the staff within ATSIC and the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health within the Department of Health and Aged Care for their hard work, management and dedication.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: MRI Scans</title><page.no>10179</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10179</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, my question is directed to Senator Herron, the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care.

I think your question suggested that we should not pay for this sort of advice and that somehow we should either expect it to be given for nothing or we should have had it offered more cheaply. This is all in aid of this broken record line from the Democrats: with that wonderful 20/20 hindsight, when anything rises in price after the float, by definition you sold it too cheaply. If you were listening to Mr Fahey in question time yesterday, you would have heard him when he gave the example of CSL which Labor managed to float for $2 and which is now at about $18. Quite clearly the Labor Party would not be pleading guilty to having deliberately underpriced it.

Mr Fahey quite rightly draws attention to the conflicts that prevail, but the challenge is really to separate those out and to understand where people are coming from. He certainly gave a proper account of the process and one that the government very much defends. None of that 
 in any shape or form justifies this line that Senator Allison has been peddling for years.

School age children covered by this visa are educated within the safe havens in which they live. There has been no waiting period for access to these education services. Since 1992, however, a number of East Timorese have entered Australia on short-term visitor visas and subsequently applied for protection visas and permanent residency. These people accepted the conditions that applied to the other holders of such visitor visas, including a condition that holders of visitor visas will not undertake more than three months study while on that visa. This is a normal condition for visitors and is noted on the visa.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With over 3.5 million visitors to Australia each year, it clearly would not be in Australia's interest to offer unrestricted study opportunities to visitors. To do so would have enormous implications for Australia's full fee paying overseas student program. It is also consistent with the government's approach to entry to Australia that the primary purpose for being in Australia should be reflected by the visa issue. Where a person applies for a protection visa, the Department of Immigra 
 tion and Multicultural Affairs issues a bridging visa which provides the applicant with the capacity to remain in Australia lawfully while their application for protection is considered. It is important to note that about 80 per cent of applications for protection visas are rejected on the grounds that applicants do not meet the criteria to be considered as refugees. It would therefore not be sensible policy to offer free access to the full range of government services to visitors who may apply for this form of permanent residency while onshore.</para><para>There is a body of litigation before the courts affecting the East Timorese asylum seekers holding temporary visas. The majority of East Timorese on bridging visas are currently residing in Victoria. The Catholic Education Office in Victoria has indicated that schools do accept enrolments on compassionate and humanitarian grounds in individual cases which may from time to time include school age children from East Timor. The decision to charge fees or not depends on individual circumstances and can involve community or church sponsorship of children or families.</para><para>The Department of Education in Victoria has indicated that government schools are able to accept the enrolment of school age children on bridging visas provided supporting documentation from DIMA is provided to verify that the student is part of an application for a protection visa.

The Senate appreciates the fact that they provide that information. It is a courtesy to honourable senators that they provide that information.

That was the politics for the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. What is extraordinary is that, when the minister comes in here and seeks to provide the additional information, the Labor Party now attempts to prevent him putting that information before the Senate in full today so that the defence of Dr Wooldridge can be broadcast to all honourable senators interested in the matter today.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—On the point of order, Madam Deputy President: I have indicated informally to Senator Hill after the last couple of question times my concern about the practice that has been occurring in relation to the way ministers have been providing additional answers to questions. I have indicated to him—and I made this point procedurally through the device of a point of order on a previous sitting day—that the normal way this has occurred is for answers to be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> . I do not believe they should be tabled, and I think most senators would agree it is appropriate that material be incorporated. That is true on this occasion. It should be incorporated.</para></talk.start><para>This is an abuse of process. If there is a view that there is some other matter in relation to my question or my behaviour or anybody else's that should be taken further, there are other forms of the house that can be used to allow that to take place. This is an abuse. It is not the ordinary practice. It is not the normal practice, which I am very keen, as I think the record shows, for ministers to conform to, that is, to incorporate answers. Probably this minister has indicated informally, because he does not care about accountability, that he will not provide an answer if he can only incorporate it. So be it. That is a matter for this particular minister. But I believe he requires leave for this. If a minister is to behave in this way, I think that you, Madam Deputy President, should seek the view of the Senate in relation to whether leave should be granted. When you do that, on this occasion leave will be refused because the minister is abusing the forms of the house.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">HILL</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—On the point of order: if Senator Faulkner wants to express what he understands to be acceptable practice, I want the same right to do so myself. In relation to these answers, ministers, as we know, have a right to table them. Honourable senators, however, generally prefer that the content be incorporated so that there is more ready access to that information. I think that one should meet that reasonable request of honourable senators. Where an answer or additional information is brief, it is also common practice for that simply to be read in rather than incorporated. Where it is lengthy, it would normally be incorporated. But where it is an answer to an implicit attack upon the personal behaviour of an individual—in this case, Dr Wooldridge—I would have thought that Senator Ellison would have every right to read into the transcript Dr Wooldridge's answer, and to do so at the first available opportunity.

 Some might have called it a lecture that the minister sought to give to the opposition—to Senator Chris Evans and to anyone who dared to ask the minister a question about the financial situation in her portfolio. Frankly, the figures from her own department indicate that what the minister has been telling the Australian people about expenditure on child care and on the availability and utilisation of child-care places is absolutely wrong.</para><para>It was not so long ago, in fact it was 10 August, that the minister released a glossy publication regarding child care in Australia which extolled the alleged virtues of this government in relation to their administration of child care in this country. One can say that the publication released by the minister, <inline font-style="italic">Child care in Australia</inline>, was totally self-serving and, when compared with her own department's publication, the 1998-99 annual report of the Department of Family and Community Services, it is an absolute misrepresentation of what has been occurring in child care. It is quite clear from her own department that the estimated expenditure, on an accrual basis, from appropriations was $868,831,000 and the estimated full year effect was $818,619,000—in other words, a difference of over $50 million.</para><para>The minister sought to explain that away and said we would have to go to some other portfolio—I think it was the Department of Health and Aged Care—statements and annual report and that might give us the total picture. Isn't it incredible that her own department would publish statements on expenditure relating to child-care support without an annotation for the department of health. I see here that some of the amounts do refer to the department of health but they say they cannot get the figures at this time. The minister is prepared to go public and claim, in her own publication, <inline font-style="italic">Child care in Australia</inline>, that marvellous things were being done. But in terms of her own department's document, they show a reduction of $50 million and the figures from the department of health are not available.</para><para> When I asked the minister a supplementary question, I think all was revealed. One could see it in the face of the minister when I asked 
 the supplementary question, which was to answer the second part of my question which related to the utilisation of child care in long day care places in this country. The minister had no idea. Her own department's publication, on page 187, in table 2, entitled `Number of operational places by service type in Australia', shows absolutely clearly, without one question of a doubt, that the number of those operational places between June 1998 and June 1999 fell from 194,600 to 190,300.</para><para>Let me break it up for you, just so there is absolutely no question about it: community long day care, 51,700 to 50,600; private—and this is the area the government claims is doing so well—129,700 to 127,100; and employer and non-profit, 13,200 to 12,600. She is damned by the figures of her own department, because the glowing picture that the minister has sought to portray is shown to be clearly false. It is shown to be untrue. If her own department says that the number of places has fallen by 4,300, then the minister is effectively playing a confidence trick on Australia in her publication <inline font-style="italic">Child care in Australia</inline>.

We are talking about the future in child care, which will begin on 1 July 2000 in party with this government's tax reform package.

Today we heard again from the minister that there has been no reduction in child-care funding by this government, but we know from facts released in the annual report from the Department of Family and Community Services that child-care funding has fallen from $999.438 million to $935.692 million over the last two financial years. That is a fall, which is in direct contradiction to what Senator Newman said today in this place. </para></talk.start><para>There are a couple of other pertinent facts I would like to draw to Senator McGauran's attention—given his comments in this debate—including the number of long day care places, which has fallen. In offering this information, again taken directly from the annual report, it is worth noting that previous information provided in this place by Senator Newman is completely exposed as a doctoring of statistics.</para><para>Let me explain to the Senate exactly what I am talking about. The number of places for community long day care fell in the last year by 1,100. In private long day care the number of places fell by 2,600. That is a total of 3,700 places. Explanations previously afforded by Senator Newman used a rounded figure which incorporated the number of out of school hours care places to boost that figure. You cannot deny the fact that the number of long day care places in this country has fallen, and you cannot deny the fact that funding has fallen.</para><para>These two issues, I think, do make Senator Newman look as though she has continued to persist with her efforts to be misleading with respect to the government's position on child care. Her determined efforts today and the massive confidence booster, the artificial mirth, that emanated from behind her every time she responded to a question—which was then completely exposed and I think reiterated by Senator McGauran's acknowledgment that maybe we should turn our attention in this motion to take note to that confidence boosting afforded Senator Newman today—show one thing and one thing only: that Senator Newman is weak not only on child care but also on all issues of policy that affect women in this country. For the last two weeks we have seen Senator Newman stumble and fall over very simple, basic questions relating to women in this parliament, the role of women in Australian society and the capacity of the government to deliver what they need within the community.</para><para>Let us reflect on a couple of these issues. First of all, there is the reduction of support by the government, through the Office of the Status of Women, for grants to incredibly important community organisations that are 
 run by women for women. The government have shown an appalling persistence to defund and disarm groups in our community that stand up for women and that oppose their policies. We saw the most blatant example of that most recently with the defunding of a number of women's organisations. Today, I heard those organisations excluded from the women's roundtable, including the National Women's Justice Coalition and the National Network of Women's Legal Services, tell their stories about how they have been defunded and about how they have been excluded from consultations. And the minister comes in here and pretends that the government have done something worthy for women and worthy for child care. Come on! What we saw today was a pathetic effort by the minister to try to throw back something at this side of the chamber. In fact, she has been so completely undermined through questioning in this place and by her appalling performance in representing women in the federal parliament that she is obviously taking the coalition government to a place of complete and utter disrepute on their record of representing women.</para><para>I would like to finish on a positive note, and it relates directly to child care. I had the great privilege of attending a wonderful event just recently here in Canberra, when the inaugural ACT child care awards were presented and brought much needed recognition to workers in the child-care sector. I would like to acknowledge the work of Judy Small and her committee, who took the initiative to stand up and be proud for the services that these women, these people, provide to Australia—to children, to women and to their families. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>10202</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think it is rather a pity that someone like Senator Lundy should deliver such unmitigated rubbish at the same time as denigrating one of the best ministers that this parliament has ever seen with respect to child care.

He said that we, as a government, were `playing a confidence trick on Australia with respect to child

You lived off plastic credit. You put it on the tick. You left a $10 billion debt for us to fix up. We not only fixed that up but also delivered—we deliver in all areas and we deliver in all areas of child care.</para><para>It goes on:</para><para>For a family receiving maximum CCB, this loading will provide an additional $11 per week where there are two children in full-time care and an additional $32 per week where there are more than three or more children in full-time care.</para><para>And you say that we are going backwards.

 us to get a clear sense of her views of correct behaviour in such a way that allows her not to have to actually address the questions that are before the chamber at the time. She was asked whether or not her own department's report had in fact now identified that actual Commonwealth expenditure on child care had fallen again this year. She was also asked whether or not the number of long day care child-care places in both the private and the community sector had fallen again as well. She could not address those issues, other than to try to criticise members of the opposition in, as I say, a very condescending manner.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The truth of the matter is that the reports of her own department reveal the facts on these questions. This is a government that is into its second term. Quite clearly, it has had a policy over the life of both those terms of government of reducing support for child care, of reducing the opportunities for working Australians to enjoy the benefits of child care and of reducing the benefits to children. Of course, the whole point about child care is that it provides benefits for the entire family and especially for children. The fact that the quality of provision is falling as a result of the budget cuts that this government has imposed is all too clear for anybody who has any experience of this industry—and many of us do, not just as legislators but as parents.</para><para>We all understand what is occurring within the child-care industry in this country. We all understand what is happening in child-care centres across the country. The opportunities for children are declining, as parents are obliged to pick up more and more of the costs that were once borne by the taxpayer on the basis that this government believes in the user pay principle. That is fine if you have plenty of money, but the whole issue here is whether or not the government has an obligation to ensure that these services are provided on an equitable basis in such a way as to make sure that the community benefit is exercised, because this goes to more than just individual benefit.</para><para>This government has confirmed in its own reports that the funding for child care has fallen and that the number of child-care places available to Australian families has also 
 fallen—the number of long day care places has fallen from 194,600 in June 1998 to 190,300 in June 1999. My recollection is that in the first term of this government there were spending cuts of about $800 million in the child-care area. There were cuts of about $600 million with the withdrawal of the operational subsidies for child-care centres. That, of course, had a direct bearing on the quality of service that was provided. We now have before us the evidence, the official confirmation, that the government is withdrawing not only money but also places—and of course one follows the other. Federal government budget cuts to child care have been forcing the child-care industry into decline. The impact of the withdrawal of support for and investment in child care is now showing up in the official figures.</para><para>When Senator Newman goes on TV and says, `We now have to sort out the differences of interpretation of figures,' she patronisingly claims, `Trust me, I'm from the government.' What the government is now saying is that she cannot be trusted. Her own department is saying that her views cannot be relied upon. Her department's annual report demonstrates that the minister cannot be relied upon to provide the public with a proper reflection of what is occurring. And what would one expect? If you cut the budget and the services, of course the opportunities are going to decline. If the government cuts child-care assistance, it will hurt Australian families and they will increasingly be forced into the informal, casual forms of child care. They will be forced into the unregulated, unaccredited and the lower levels—the bottom end of the market—where the qualifications are not available to be seen to demonstrate that the quality of care can be maintained. As a consequence, the children of this country are going to miss out. I think the minister ought to be condemned for that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>10204</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to participate in the debate this afternoon because so many misleading statements have been made that the record should not be allowed to remain uncorrected.

What we have seen this afternoon is a disgraceful attempt to mislead the Australian public.</para></talk.start><para>Page 187 of the annual report that was quoted during question time and referred to during debate on the motion to take note of answers tells only half of the story. What in fact has been omitted from the information that has been given to the Senate is that, whilst there is a very different mix of the way in which child care is now put together, the overall numbers have increased from 399,400 to 422,100. We have not heard one single word about the fact that the overall numbers have increased; we have only heard that some of the categories have been adjusted yet other have been increased. The total number of child-care places available to Australian families has in fact gone up every year since the coalition came to office. That is a point that really needs to be emphasised. It is a point that the government is not given credit for when the opposition picks out some isolated figure and seeks to mislead the Senate on what the true position is.</para><para>The opposition is doing a very little other than cooking the books in choosing to add up only those figures in the table which might suit their claims and completely overlooking and ignoring those sectors which have increased: family day care and out of school hours. You might wonder why family day care and out of school hours numbers have increased. It is because that is where the need is. That is where the research showed the need was and where the need was not being met. These are the services that families both need and use, and that is the reason why the overall numbers have gone up and why there has been an adjustment in some of the categories of child care. It is simply more flexible and suits more children to have a different mix.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Into the backyard!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name></talker><para>—Senator Carr, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would not

That is a pretty impressive figure, no matter how you look at it. From July 1996 to March 1999, there was an increase of 272 child-care centres across Australia: 491 private child-care centres opened, while 204 closed in areas where there was either no need or where the resources could be otherwise better deployed.</para><para>Labor simply failed the child-care sector while in government and is now playing politics. This is not a very sensible thing to do. Growth in child care under Labor was simply unchecked and unsustainable, and those on the other side know it. There was no formal planning system for child-care centres, resulting in some areas having an oversupply of child-care places and others having none. The operational subsidy was focused on community-based centres instead of where there was need. Babies were barely catered for; children with disabilities were not properly catered for; children in remote areas were not properly catered for.

Interest will also be paid on agency cash balances to encourage optimal cash management practices.</para><para>Annual `Administered' appropriations, typically for subsidies and grants administered by agencies on the Government's behalf, will be for full accrual expenses and will be appropriated by `outcomes' sought by the Government. Where expenses have accrued against these appropriations but payments not yet made, the unspent amount will not lapse and remains available for payments in future financial years.</para><para>To the extent relevant expenses did not accrue, these appropriations will lapse. Consequently, agencies will generally no longer be able to make payments under these appropriations where the relevant goods and services weren't received, and 
 hence expenses weren't incurred, in that same financial year.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>10206</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of the Parliamentary Library</title><page.no>10206</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UNKNOWN</name.id><name role="metadata">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Sherry)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Sherry)</name></talker><para>—In accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Act 1922, I present the annual report of the Department of the Parliamentary Library for 1998-99.</para></talk.start></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>10206</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Privileges Committee</title><page.no>10206</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>10206</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>10206</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Knowles, I present the 80th report of the Committee of Privileges, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Persons Referred to in the Senate (Board members and staff of Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc.)</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to move a motion in respect of the report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That the report be adopted.</para><para>This report is the 28th in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be accorded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified, in the Senate.</para><para>On 13 October 1999, the President received a letter from Mr Kimberley Heitman, Chairman of Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc., relating to remarks made by Senator the Hon.

Senator Alston also stated that we approve of offensive material being forced on children and adults and that we are the cause of a problem the Internet Industry Association and the Government have in negotiating a code of practice.</para><para>All these allegations are unsubstantiated and false. The Senator's remarks impugn our individual good characters, reputations and credentials, and those of the thousands of members and supporters of the organisation we represent. In addition, the Senator's remarks are factually incorrect, and we seek this opportunity to set the record straight.</para><para>The following facts are pertinent: 
</para><para>1.	 Senator Alston's description of EFA as "low grade, undergraduate political activists" is factually incorrect, and falsely deprecates the breadth of academic and professional expertise of the EFA Board. The majority of EFA Board members completed degrees in fields including law, education, science, engineering and economics more than ten years ago. None are undergraduates. Three-quarters are over the age of forty. All have been active users of the Internet for at least the last five years, and several are professionally involved in managing Internet services.</para><para>2.	 Senator Alston's statement that we are "not in the slightest bit interested in the welfare of the community, whether parents have concerns or anything else" is incorrect. Members of the Board and staff of EFA include responsible parents with a total of 10 children between them ranging in age from 1 year to 27 years. EFA's website has a section entitled "Advice for Parents—Information to guide and inform parents on ways to protect their children in using the Internet". This includes the "Australian Internet Parental Control Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)—A guide to assist concerned parents, legislators, educators, and the public in learning what is available today to protect children". This was compiled by EFA in 1996, long before any government agencies developed an interest in assisting parents. This document was drawn to the attention of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards in our submission of March 1997 and an earlier version was included in our response to the Department of Communications' "Consultation Paper on the Regulation of on-line Information Services" in August 1995. Our concern is for the future of Australia's children and grandchildren—that we as a society not bequeath them with a censorship system that would be a totalitarian regime's dream, enabling the suppression of any dissenting voices on the Internet. The planned regime enables the suppression of voices following one complaint and empowers a statutory authority to suppress voices without a complaint being lodged. EFA has consistently argued that a Government serious about protecting children from online dangers must commit funds to parental education and police resources.</para><para>3.	 Senator Alston's statement that "there are these maniacs—these electronic frontiers outfits—running around stirring up trouble, using quaint expressions" is incorrect.</para><para>The Oxford Dictionary defines "maniac" as "person affected with mania" and "mania" as "mental derangement marked by excitement and 
 violence". Senator Alston's allegation as to our mental stability has no basis in fact. Moreover, we have not advocated or engaged in violence. Last year Senator Alston's office invited EFA's current and then Chairperson to participate in the E-Commerce Enabling Australia Summit in Canberra. Senator Alston's office was aware of EFA's position on Internet regulation having received our detailed written response to the framework issued for public comment in August 1997. EFA's position on the matter has remained stable. The Government's has not.</para><para>Senator Alston's disparaging reference to EFA as an "outfit" is misleading. EFA is a non-profit national organisation formed in January 1994 and incorporated under South Australian law in May 1994 to protect and promote the civil liberties of users and operators of computer based communications systems. EFA members come from all parts of Australia and from diverse backgrounds.</para><para>Senator Alston opines that our expressions are "quaint". These are no more quaint than those contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The ICCPR was signed by the Australian Government in 1972, came into force in 1980 and reservations to Article 19, and to other articles, were retracted  in 1984. The ICCPR forms Schedule 2 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. Article 19 of the ICCPR "quaintly" states: </para><para>	 "2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice."</para><para>Our comments on this matter are contained in our submission to the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies' inquiry of April/May 1999.</para><para>4.	 Senator Alston's statement that "they got themselves over to the recent Berterlsmann Conference and made a big noise there along the same lines" implies that there is something untoward about EFA's attendance at the Conference. This is not so.</para><para>Mr Jens Waltermann, Deputy Head, Policy, Media Division of the Bertelsmann Foundation invited EFA's Chairperson to attend. In his letter he said, inter alia: "It is with great pleasure that we invite you to be our guest in Munich, Germany. Your participation would be an honour for the Bertelsmann Foundation."</para><para>Furthermore, EFA Board members have previously been invited speakers and/or panel participants at national and international conferences such as: 
</para><para>.	 OECD Seminar: International Co-operation Concerning Content and Conduct on the Internet, March 1998, Paris</para><para>.	 INET 98 Conference: The Role of Non-Governmental Organizations in Developing Internet Policy, July 1998, Geneva</para><para>.	 E-Commerce Enabling Australia Summit, April 1998, Canberra, on invitation from Senator Alston's office</para><para>.

AUUG Conference, September 1999, Melbourne</para><para>	 iSEC Australia 99 Conference, September 1999, Sydney</para><para>Furthermore, if "made a big noise" refers to speaking out on issues of concern, we prefer to call that civic duty. It is the purpose of our organisation, and the expectation of our members, that we do so.</para><para>5.	 We reject Senator Alston's allegation that we have no interest in sensible and responsible regulation of the Internet. We believe the Government's approach to content regulation has neither of those qualities. Over the past six years EFA Board members have freely contributed a considerable amount of personal time and expert advice to inquiries concerning Internet regulation conducted by Senate Committees, the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Department of Communications and the Attorney-General's Department. Current Board members were invited to give testimony to Senate Committees at public hearings concerning regulation of the Internet in 1997, 1998 and 1999. EFA has consistently warned that Australian Internet censorship legislation will not protect children but will unfortunately give parents unfamiliar with the Internet a false sense of security as to their children's safety. We note that Senator Harradine acknowledges this is a matter of concern, although Senator Alston will not.</para><para>6.	 Senator Alston's allegations as to our views on "mousetrapping" are based on either incorrect 
 information given to him by his staff, or a misinformed guess, not on our statements. Senator Alston stated: ". . . mousetrapping is an issue. . . it is entirely appropriate to put pressure on host countries to clean up their own backyards. That is precisely what we are doing. We are not just saying that we hope that end users, parents, will block these sites. We think it is offensive, the community thinks it is offensive and the industry thinks it is offensive. Electronic frontiers do not".</para><para>We have never condoned, nor would we condone, pagejacking or mousetrapping or any other means of forcing content on persons who do not wish to view it. Senator Alston's allegation that we do not object to such practices is utterly without foundation. Furthermore, the Senator's implication that the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act is necessary to deal with such problems is demonstrably incorrect. It will not have the slightest effect in protecting children or adults from being caught in such traps. The USA FTC and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have dealt with the recent instance using existing laws. Evidently, no new laws are necessary to deal with such problems.</para><para>7.	 Senator Alston's allegation that we were or are "feeding lines to that woman from the Civil Liberties Union" has no basis in fact. Presumably Professor Strossen reads Australian news reports and media releases, probably both Senator Alston's and EFA's, which are equally accessible around the world on the Internet.</para><para>8.	 Senator Alston states that he does "not find industry opposing [the government's] approach" and that "[t]he industry itself accepts that there should be these codes of practice and this form of regulation. We have been trying to negotiate it for the last three years with the Internet Industry Association. Their problem is that there are these maniacs—these electronic frontiers outfits—running around stirring up trouble".</para><para>We reject the allegation that we are the cause of any problem the Internet Industry Association (IIA) may have. If IIA has a problem, it apparently arises from IIA's attempts to develop a "self-regulatory" code that "the industry" supports as well as meets with the approval of the Government. Only 60 of Australia's 700 Internet Service Providers are currently members of the IIA according to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman as reported by Fairfax I.T. News on 5 October 1999.</para><para>We also reject Senator Alston's allegation that we are not "responsible players". The persons Senator Alston quotes as not opposing the government's approach are generally persons 
 outside Australia who will not be affected by the legislation. Silicon Valley stands to gain as Australians and their businesses move offshore. In addition, persons such as the USA CEO of Lotus are computer software developers, not obvious members of the "Internet industry". Moreover, APC Newswire reported on 7 October 1999 that Bryan Simmons, Lotus vice-president of worldwide corporate communications, said that comments by the CEO of Lotus "were meant only to communicate deference to the government's sphere of sovereignty, not support of any government's particular policies". Yahoo have previously denied supporting the legislation. With regard to Senator Alston's reference to a second press release by The National Australia Bank, Arnold Bloch Leibler and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu indicating that they are "happy with the current legislative framework", APC Newswire also reported that "A spokesperson for the group said the second press release had not expressed support for the legislation, but for the Internet Industry Association's (IIA) latest draft code of the Internet Industry Code of Practice". In fact no industry group supports the legislation except the IIA, and its endorsement is conditional upon its Code being accepted.</para><para>9.	 Senator Alston states that  "[s]eventy-four per cent of Australian respondents [to the Bertelsmann survey] said that the courts and legal authorities, politicians and other agencies all have a part to play in the appropriate supervision and selection of Internet content" and "That is why I find it fascinating that somehow there is this notion that the community is opposed to what we are doing. They certainly are not."</para><para>Senator Alston's reference to seventy-four percent of Australian respondents is incorrect. As multiple responses were allowed to the question, the only accurate figures that can be taken  from Table 13 of the report are each of the individual percentages. Nevertheless, Senator Alston or his staff have added some individual figures: 9 per cent believe that politicians have a role to play, 26 per cent—courts and legal authorities, 39 per cent—other agencies, to find a total of 74 per cent. However, 52 percent believe Internet users themselves are best able to control unwanted content. Adding the figures from different responses makes them meaningless; it wrongly implies that 220% per cent of Australian respondents have an opinion.</para><para>10.	 Senator Alston goes on to say "where is this concern, apart from those maniacs I mentioned earlier?"</para><para>As stated above, the Senator's allegations as to our mental stability are groundless. Senator Alston does not appear willing to listen to the 
 widely expressed concerns. It is a well-known fact that the Senator's advertised email address has returned messages unopened to citizens attempting to make their concerns known. Senators and/or their staff from various political parties have advised constituents that they received an inordinate amount of email expressing concern, a considerable majority of the 100 submissions to the Senate Select Committee inquiry opposed the government's approach, a petition signed by 12,140 persons was tabled in the Senate on 30 June 1999, some 50 pages of comments expressing concern were received in response to a survey conducted by The Age, the list could go on. It is not that Senator Alston is unaware of the wide concern expressed. It is that Senator Alston chooses to disregard such concerns and exercise his Parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech in an irresponsible manner to mislabel persons expressing concern as "maniacs".</para><para>In summary, Senator Alston's allegations as to our characters, views and intent are incorrect, unjustified and utterly without foundation. Despite his attempts to malign us, we intend to continue to make the "big noise" that Senator Alston obviously finds discomforting until such time as the government's approach becomes, in our opinion, reasonably and appropriately adapted to serve a legitimate end.</para><para>We tender the above in good faith and request that our response be incorporated in the parliamentary record.</para><para>Kimberley Heitman, B.Juris Llb, AACS</para><para>Chair, Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc.</para><para>on behalf of the Board members and staff of Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>10209</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would also like to speak to this motion.

It reads:</para><para>In summary, Senator Alston's allegations as to our characters, views and intent are incorrect, unjustified and utterly without foundation.

The amended act expressly recognises command and discipline issues and distinguishes them from matters relating to employment. The character of the AFP as a disciplined organisation is emphasised in the Commissioner's power to issue binding orders. The obligation to obey lawful orders is now placed in the act. It was formerly in the Regulations. The Commissioner's power to deploy AFP employees and to assign duties is reinforced as an important element of command in a police organisation in relation to both domestic and international policing activities.</para><para>The Australian community has a right to expect that the highest standards continue to be maintained by all AFP employees and that the organisation has 
 strong anti-corruption measures in place. Accordingly, the bill provides for employees to submit financial declarations and cooperate with drug and alcohol testing.</para><para>The bill builds on a range of initiatives introduced by the Commissioner across the AFP's management and operations and establishes a framework through which more flexible and efficient workplace arrangements can now be implemented. In this way, the bill complements, and further facilitates, the Government's AFP reform program.

The government rejects this bill. It relates to the some 30,000 reservists we have in this country. When this matter was being debated last Thursday, Senator Mason, from the govern 
 ment side, said there has been a long link between the reservists and the regular forces going back to 1901—right back to Federation—when Australia had a military force comprised of militia and volunteers of some 27,000, which is not much different to the figures we have today.</para></talk.start><para>We had a permanent force then of only 1,500, so you can see the weights were very much on this particular type of training and force and that the reserves were critical to this country's defence way back in those times. The reserve forces comprised about 96 per cent of Australia's total force. Today they represent far less—about 30 per cent.</para><para>I should note when taking figures and statistics from Senator Mason's speech that indeed his brother, David, was in the Army Reserve. Senator Mason also said that Senator Ludwig on the other side of the parliament also belonged to the reserves. This honourable profession takes in all sorts of people from all walks of life wishing to do their patriotic duty in our armed forces.</para><para>Members of the Army Reserve generally spend between 20 and 40 days a year training with their units. However, there is a minimum obligation of 14 days per year for most of the reservists. These reservists need to be on individual alert and readiness at all times. The members must maintain a very high standard of individual readiness. They must demonstrate continued competency in their basic military skills. They must demonstrate continued competency in their trade, maintain high levels of physical fitness and maintain their medical and dental fitness with limited support from the Army health services. In a sense, while they are away from training they must maintain a readiness and alertness. They may be part-time soldiers, but they have full-time skills nevertheless.</para><para>In her second reading speech, Senator Collins said that this bill aims to amend the legislation so as to give back to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the power to include leave for reservists to participate in the activities necessary to be a member of the Australian Defence Force. In essence that is what the debate is about today. I have outlined the utter professionalism of our reserve 
 forces and the close historical links we have always had with them. Senator Jacinta Collins is pushing—on behalf of the opposition, no doubt, because this was tabled in the other House by Mr Beazley—something different again. This matter is clouded in patriotism and heartfelt emotion for the reserves, but if you strip it all away, they are just pushing an ideological industrial relations line. Regrettably, the opposition is cloaking this in patriotism. It is the same old political and ideological push to increase the numbers of allowable matters above 20 in the awards. It is an attempt to undermine the government's industrial relations reforms which have been an unmitigated success in modernising the workplace and breaking down the grip the unions have over their own members.</para><para>Mr Beazley in the other place linked this issue to the situation in East Timor when he said:</para><para>Now it is critical. It is not going to be possible to sustain this deployment for any length of time without recourse to reserves. Reserves must now be recruited and given certainty in terms of their employment and their capacity whilst in their employment to be trained properly for circumstances of danger in which they may find themselves.</para><para>To the extent that this statement is true, it in no way relates to the necessity as outlined by Senator Collins' bill to amend the industrial relations laws. The government is blatantly aware the importance the reserves play in the East Timor situation. We do not need the opposition to use it in regard to industrial relations laws. I would have thought it was a little more serious and important than that.</para><para>In fact, we already have reservists serving in East Timor. Some 38 officers and 49 other ranks are in the Army alone. They are medical specialists, logistics personnel and they hold staff positions. In regard to Mr Beazley's comments that our reserves need to be properly trained for circumstances of danger—and you cannot disagree with that on the face of it—I do not think that the professionalism of our trained armed forces, either reserves or full-time, needs to be questioned in this way. Their performance in securing Dili and subsequently other parts of East Timor has been highly successful, professional and admired 
 by all the contributing nations under Australian authority.</para><para>Although there are unknown dangers ahead, we are secure in the thought that our Army—that is, the reserves and the full-time personnel—is prepared. Given that Australia's  deployment in East Timor will continue for some time—and we  truly do not know how long—there is no doubt that the armed forces will rely on our reservists in one capacity or another, as they are now. They will either support in East Timor or support at home. We are reacting accordingly to meet these new and unexpected demands which will inevitably lead to increases in the defence budget. The government's seriousness in regard to our future commitments to East Timor should not be doubted or used as a pawn in an industrial relations game.</para><para>We will use the reservists who volunteer for full-time service where we need their skills to supplement regular personnel, or where they complement regulars. Reservists who volunteer to serve are paid a full-time military salary and, should they be deployed as part of the peace enforcement mission, they should receive the same tax-free salary and allowances as their regular counterparts. Where the government does not need to call out the Army Reserve to defend Australia, current laws allow reservists to be used on deployment overseas only if they volunteer for full-time service. Should they volunteer, then our preference is to negotiate with their civil employer to allow the reservist to serve. If in a given high priority case this fails, and an employer refuses to release an individual reservist who has volunteered to serve and whom Defence requires, then we would be able to invoke sections 8 and 9 of the Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965 to prevent the employer from penalising or prejudicing their employee because of their service.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">COLLINS</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—It is inconsistent with earlier advice.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—Whose advice?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">COLLINS</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—That is; earlier government advice that that wasn't available.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—Senator Collins, I can assure you that it is the backstop that we

There is no hindrance, and nor should there be.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have not seen any evidence from the other side on this. I read Mr Beazley's contribution in the second reading debate on this matter. He spent half of it complimenting our troops in East Timor, which is worthy but hardly pertinent to this issue. He never mentioned that employers are discriminating against our reservists. Look at Labor's record in this regard in its 13 years in government. You had the chance to implement what you are saying we should implement now. When you were in government 152 out of 3,000 federal awards had written into them a reference to reservists. Of those awards, about 50 per cent were in the public sector. Under Labor, there was no comprehensive coverage of reservists and their leave entitlements.</para><para>I would venture to say that of all the agreements—enterprise agreements or award agreements—there is greater reference now to reservists' leave than there was when Labor was in government. It is also a matter of consciousness too. Let's face it: we have the issue before us now. Employers are going to be far more conscious than they were. Foreign affairs and defence were off the political agenda up until recently. They were not the centre point of politics or even of employers' thinking—industrial relations was, tax reform was. Now it has come to centre stage, I think you will find that this issue will be taken up by employers. They will see the sense in writing reservists' leave into enterprise agreements.</para><para>I think you are being unfair to the employers. Not only can you not show that they may be discriminating against reservists but, what 
 is more, it is an issue that has just come to the fore and it does not need this sort of bill to push cooperation. We have evidence that the Queensland government and the New South Wales government—Labor governments—support this government's approach in regard to reservists' leave. They have sent messages to this government that they cooperate in regard to our approach, that there should be a cooperation between the reservists and the employers, that there should be encouragement, but not written into awards.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">COLLINS</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—They have not said that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—They have said that.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">COLLINS</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—Prove it.

There is a greater spirit in the community than Senator Collins would allow us to believe. Employers are not two-headed monsters. In fact, I think they would see it as an advantage to their employment. I have already listed the number of big companies that see it as an advantage and would encourage people to join the reservists. It adds to their workplace and to the nation as a whole.

We will protect you.' We were not there to be protected in any case; we were the protectors. We were going to protect the people of Australia. We did not need the interference of the ACTU. This is about trying to weaken the Workplace Relations Act to the detriment of Australia. I recall reading in history where unions went on strike and interfered during the Second World War in Darwin and other places and forced officers of the very highest rank to unload cargo so that those fighting ships could defend Australia. This is about the old numbers game—number crunching.</para><para>When I was in national service in the 1950s, 60 per cent of the Australian work force was unionised. Today it is less than half.

At one stage I got a bill from the union movement that I could have built a large double story house for. I had to pay this bill because I did not know where to resign. I was, not surprisingly, in Actors Equity. I was in the Australian Workers Union. I was in the Plasterers Society, as was one of the esteemed members of the Whitlam cabinet who served here, Jim Cavanagh. So I have that background.

Never before has Australia employed so many people. There is corres 
 pondingly less unemployment, down considerably from the peak of the appalling Hawke and Keating years. Senator Collins talks about the government's obsession with industrial relations. She may only be reading the same speech the Hon. Kim Beazley read in the other place; I do not know. But let me give some facts about reservists and the government's approach to reserve leave and workplace relations. The document I have says:</para></talk.start></continue><para>We are working with employers to ensure reservists' availability for training and service, and employers are willing to cooperate.</para><para>Senator McGauran mentioned those major companies that are cooperating. Why would we need superfluous amendments like this when we have that level of cooperation from our major employers? To go on:</para><para>They appreciate the government's constructive approach to let them manage their businesses while contributing to the defence effort.</para><para>When I was in National Service, my job was guaranteed when I got out. My job was guaranteed when I had to go away on bivouacs or camps. These were compulsory, you must remember. These were not volunteers. Senator McGauran mentioned those volunteers who are in the danger zone, an active service zone, a volatile zone in any part of the world—East Timor.</para><para>He mentioned Telstra. They have instituted flexible reserve leave arrangements and, following recent discussions, the Victoria Police are considering leave applications on a case by case basis, remembering the important role that they undertake in protecting the people of Victoria. It is not as if they could afford to lose something like 100 or 200 people, so it has to be on a case by case basis. Working with employers and reservists, we are making an effective reserve regime. I was in a reserve regime for 25 years and took it very seriously.</para><para>In contrast, we have seen the Leader of the Opposition in the other place propose award based, compulsory paid reserve leave, along with other ill-considered amendments. Why would you want to be in a unionised regime if the system is working so well? You on the 
 other side obviously have ulterior motives for doing it. Mr Beazley was asked:</para><para>Can you understand why employers even more so then would be upset because they say, `Well, all right, I'm losing employee X for two weeks and I've got to replace that person and pay someone accordingly?'</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition then said:</para><para>Oh, yes. And that's why it's important that it be incorporated in an award.</para><para>There seems to be some kind of madness about everyone having to be tied to an award. We are protected by minimum wage regimes. They are protected by the armed services itself with respect to awards.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">COLLINS</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—But not their jobs.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name></talker><para>—Their jobs are protected. As I just explained, many of our major employers do cooperate with the armed services. In other words, Mr Beazley—and I suppose Senator Jacinta Collins is the same—is quite open about the fact that his model of reserve service relies on simply forcing employers to comply with his rules. That is diametrically opposed to the highly successful reservist scheme that we have now.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I do not understand the logic behind it. There must be something ulterior. There is something hidden here, and what is hidden is obviously not for the benefit of the people of Australia in defence terms. It is obviously not to the benefit of those young men and women who are serving and protecting us, fighting for us and helping us maintain our standard of living, which is envied throughout the world. It is not helping them. This is an attempt to get the numbers in the ACTU up. That is what it is about. It is number crunching in the armed services.</para><para>I think you should leave them alone. I do not think that Senator Collins, Mr Beazley or anyone else in the union movement should tamper with our armed services. They are running very well. They are a well-greased machine. They do not need the likes of Senator Collins interfering with them and causing them concern, concerning the officers who run that marvellous organisation concern and causing the parents of those men and

With the award system under Labor, only 152 out of 3,000 federal awards referred to leave for reservists. Of those awards, about 50 per cent were in the public sector, with the rest being principally single industry awards. Once again, I am at a loss to explain why, after 13 years in power, it was not rectified then. Why do you want to do it now? Because you want the numbers now. That is all it is about. I think that is a pretty low way to go about treating our armed services people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In contrast, our workplace relations regime is working. This is voluntary cooperation. Some examples of the major companies that it is working with are: Telstra, which I think my colleague Senator McGauran mentioned; the Commonwealth Bank, the bank that lives here, the icon that you were never going to privatise but you did—you could not wait to get your hands on the money and your sticky fingers in the Commonwealth Bank till; the Northern Territory government; Wesfarmers Dalgety, a great institution in the great state of Western Australia, which has also agreed 
 to voluntarily reimburse and re-employ without loss of seniority those people who choose to take the voluntary reserve path; and Serco Gardner Merchant.</para><para>There seems to be confusion about whether or not you people want employers to pay their reservist employees while on defence training leave. Perhaps when Senator Collins answers, she could take that on board, because Mr Beazley confirmed he did not really understand the amendments that he was proposing. They cannot be very important or high up in the pecking order if Mr Beazley admitted he did not know what the amending bill was all about.</para><para>I do not think those opposite have any interest in having an effective reserve for our defence force. I think the opposition's argument is outdated, ideologically driven, about numbers and about embellishing the failing ACTU. You failed your people in the trade union movement. The union movement lost people like me because the union became superfluous. You failed your people. If you proceed with this bill and if you, God forbid, augmented by others in this place, do get it passed, I tell you this: you will also fail those young men and women in our armed services. You will fail those reservists. This is not a bill that assists them; this is a bill that assists the trade union movement and has little or nothing to do with enhancing the employment prospects of those young men and women who so gallantly choose to serve us in the reserve system. They should be applauded and not tampered with, as you people in the trade union movement are attempting to do by amending the Workplace Relations Act.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>10220</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Viewed in isolation, I think that the matter introduced today by Senator Collins in her private member's bill, the <inline ref="r931">Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill 1999</inline> , seeks to address a discrete issue.

 reserves is an allowable matter which may be taken to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for conciliation or arbitration. As Senator Collins has been so gracious to me, I will return the compliment by saying that it actually appears after subsection 89A(2) of the draft, which reads:</para></talk.start></continue><para>Insert additional allowable award matter: service and training in Australian Defence Force Reserves.</para><para>Subsection (2A) then says:</para><para>Leave for service and training as a member of the Australian Defence Force Reserves is an allowable matter for the purposes of subsection (1).</para><para>That relates to it being able to be brought to the commission for conciliation and arbitration. But one would have to say that it has much wider ramifications, and the debate that has ranged widely over the last couple of weeks is worthy of wider discussion in this place.</para><para>Not the least of those points is the timing for the introduction of the bill, which I think deserves attention. Without wishing to sound too cynical, it does seem that the Labor Party is at its opportunistic best in seeking to elevate this matter into one of high principle at this precise time, especially when our troops are on an overseas engagement and when sensibilities are aroused. The reason why I think we in the government, and indeed the Australian people, are entitled to draw an adverse inference against the Labor Party for raising this issue at this very sensitive time is that, during 13 years of Labor government, only some 152 out of 3,000 federal awards referred to leave for reservists and actually dealt with the topic. Of those 152 awards, 50 per cent were in the Public Service in any event. I do not think Labor could claim that it has comprehensively addressed this issue when it had the opportunity to do so and was in a position to be able to review the matter. If I get time later on, I will return to the fact that it actually received a report from the unions recommending that there should be a comprehensive review and did nothing about it.</para><para>So it hardly behoves the Labor Party to now bring to this place a bill which seeks to address issues which they could have addressed had they chosen to do so. Had the 
 Labor Party really wished to champion this cause because of a principled belief in its place in the award system, they could have done so, rather than to use it as a one-off, politically motivated effort. Surely in those circumstances they would have turned their minds to the issue when they could actually have constructively addressed it.</para><para>The issue at the heart of the matter is the fundamental question whether Defence Force leave is already an allowable matter under section 89A(2)(g) of the Workplace Relations Act. I think we have to say that there might be some doubt about it. But, in the absence of a definitive ruling by the commission, the second question is whether there ought to be an amendment to the Workplace Relations Act to make Defence Force leave an allowable matter. The third question is whether the subject is already adequately dealt with in any event by a provision in the Defence Act and the Defence Re-establishment Act 1965 prohibiting employers from acting to the detriment of, and prejudicing reservists because of, their need for military service and need for leave.</para><para>I will take these questions in reverse order. It is clear that legally enforceable protection does exist in the legislation to ensure that the employment of those undertaking military training leave is in fact protected—that is, in the Defence Re-establishment Act 1965. I note that there has been some unwarranted criticism of the fact that there have been no prosecutions under the legislation. That is supposed to indicate some weakness. I would have thought that, on the contrary, it points to the opposite conclusion—namely, that it is an effective legal sanction and that people in fact abide by it. I believe that most Australians, and that includes by definition Australian employers, recognise the invaluable contribution that reservists do make to our national defence effort and respect the arrangements that are necessary for related leave. It is a matter of pride, I think, that we can contribute to the national interest by encouraging the support of our reservists and allowing them to be properly trained.</para><para>As speakers did last week, I wish to take the opportunity to restate, on behalf of all 
 Australians, our support for our troops who continue Australia's proud and distinguished tradition of service overseas. I think it is indeed a shame that we are having anything like a political argument about some of the conditions of reservists. The next question is whether there is any need to have any different approach towards reservists and employees from that of the government's cooperative approach, and I have to say that Labor's attempt to turn back the clock to make defence leave an allowable matter is simply redundant. Not only is it redundant; it also fails to acknowledge the fundamental shift in the way that industrial relations operates now in this country and the way that employers and employees relate to each other.</para><para>I am the first to acknowledge that it must indeed be very irksome for Labor to have to recognise, even if they do not acknowledge, that the new workplace relations regime—with a streamlined, pared down awards system and the emphasis on voluntary workplace agreements—is actually working, and working very well. Quite simply, the balance in the system has been restored to better reflect the incontrovertible fact that unions now represent only about a fifth of the work force in the private sector. It was a major initiative to pare back dozens of conditions to 20 allowable matters, and this government is not about to agree to additional allowable matters being snuck back in under whatever guise.</para><para>By now it must be obvious, even to the opposition, that flexibility in negotiation actually allows employees and employers to come to arrangements that suit their particular circumstances, rather than to shoehorn them into a prescriptive straitjacket that suits no-one other than the unions. I know that might not be a fact that the opposition likes to hear, but the figures bear it out.</para><para>The fact that the government's approach to reserve leave and awards is working can be seen in a number of factors and a number of actual positive outcomes. Telstra has instituted flexible reserve leave arrangements and, following recent discussions, the Victorian police have in fact agreed to look at a case-by-case basis for considering leave applica 
 tions, taking account of Defence's need for particular reservists.</para><para>Working with employers and reservists is in fact building an effective reserve regime. This is something that the government has done deliberately and constructively, and it is a record that the government is proud of. In contrast, the Leader of the Opposition's proposals for award based, compulsory, paid reserve leave—along with other ad hoc amendments to the act—seek to just turn back the clock. The Leader of the Opposition was asked in a recent radio interview this question:</para><para>Can you understand why employers, even more so then, would be upset because they say, `Well, all right, I'm losing employee X for two weeks and I have got to replace that person and pay someone accordingly?</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, said:</para><para>Oh, yes, and that's why it is important that it be incorporated in an award. You take a thing like that out of awards and it is very unlikely that people are actually going to be supportive of it.</para><para>In other words, Mr Beazley is quite open about the fact that his and Labor's preferred model of reserve service relies on simply forcing employers to comply with his rules.</para><para>We know that, if you have to force people to comply, often that does not work at all. In fact, the cooperative and flexible approach that has been taken is working very well. Under a more cooperative approach, we have seen some very major organisations actually address this issue constructively. Organisations such as Telstra, the Commonwealth Bank, the Northern Territory government, Wesfarmers Dalgety and Serco-Gardner Merchant are just some examples of employers with flexible reserve leave. Admittedly, some of these have negotiated arrangements on different conditions—they are not all identical—but each of these organisations has sought to comprehensively address the need to be able to allow reservists to have the training they need.</para><para>In Mr Beazley's confused remarks about whether or not he wanted employers to pay their reservist employees while on defence training leave—in the self-same interview— 
Mr Beazley confirmed he did not really understand the amendments he was proposing: he did not know whether it was going to be paid leave or unpaid leave. He is not interested in an effective reserve as part of our Defence Force, which is extraordinary for a member of parliament who has professed for some years a great passion about the Defence Force. Not to have actually addressed this issue and had it clear in his own mind is quite extraordinary.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">PATTERSON</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—He was the Minister for Defence.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name></talker><para>—How it fades from memory, Senator Patterson. He is interested, of course, in bringing back nothing other than an outdated ideologically driven award system that certainly did not work then and it will not work now.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I said a little earlier, I have a note here that the ACTU wrote to the government in mid-October this year with a suggestion on reserve matters. It said that reservists called out for the defence of Australia should be allowed to have an allowable award to cover that issue. But, of course, the document was dated May 1995, so certainly the ACTU has not addressed the huge shift—the fundamental shift—in the way industrial relations actually now operate in this country, nor does this document even attempt to address the fact that the successes under the streamlined government system have to be taken into account in looking at any adjustment to the Workplace Relations Act.</para><para>For the last year of the Labor government this policy suggestion that had come from the ACTU was in their possession, yet no action was taken. I think that really speaks volumes about the bona fides of this particular bill and it speaks volumes about the former Labor government given the fact that this was obviously brought to their attention and yet no action was taken. It simply confirms the suspicion that this current profession of concern for reservists is really nothing much more than crocodile tears.</para><para>The fact that the government's approach is preferable and that it is working can also be seen in recent messages of support that have been received by none other than each of the 
 premiers of Queensland and New South Wales regarding the reservists. We know that the current deployment to East Timor has seen many reservists volunteer for full-time service in the ADF, and that is the only way, if they did volunteer, that they would be sent. In many cases they have negotiated leave arrangements with their employer and that has been an arrangement that has been allowed. It illustrates the point very well. The messages from the Labor premiers reflect this government's cooperative approach towards reservists and employers, using encouragement and negotiation rather than the opposition's confrontational approach. As I said, a number of organisations are responding positively to requests for leave from their reserve employees to allow them to contribute a period of full-time service.</para><para>An example is that reservists in the Department of Defence who wish to transfer to full-time services in connection with INTERFET may apply for leave under their industrial agreement. In some circumstances, leave granted for this purpose will be with pay for the first 14 calendar days of service and without pay for the remainder of the posting period. In other circumstances, leave will be granted without pay for the entire period of service. The leave without pay component will count as service for all purposes except annual leave. That is a pretty comprehensive arrangement that does address the need.</para><para>Reservists on full-time service with the Defence Force will receive a military salary. Interestingly enough, in Queensland and New South Wales the governments have recently outlined leave provisions for reservists wishing to volunteer for full-time service in the Australian Defence Force. That does not sound to me as if Labor governments in Queensland and New South Wales are very supportive of the bill and the initiative that is presently before this house.</para><para>A number of national and government departments at both state and federal level have expressed their support of employees wishing to join the Australian Defence Force, and around 90 reservists are already serving as part of INTERFET. It illustrates the point pretty clearly when state Labor governments 
 encourage employees to come to these arrangements with their employers. They recognise that cooperative arrangements work, they send messages of support to the federal government for the approach that they are taking and they believe that it will build a competent, trained and cooperative reserve regime.</para><para>Yet another reason to suspect that the need for this bill is absolutely otiose is the fact that military training can already be reinserted into public sector awards through arbitration, at least for the most part for payment at award rates. So we have to ask ourselves, and indeed speakers from the government are asking: what is the real agenda here? Why is the Labor Party seeking to do this now when they could have taken this initiative years ago to make it comprehensive throughout awards if it really occupied such a prominent place on their agenda? They simply did not. There was no comprehensive coverage. Today in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> entitled `Undermining the unions' the author, Brad Norington, makes a very interesting point. He says:</para><para>Unions, not surprisingly, have resisted the mandatory stripping back of awards amassed over many years and are still mounting legal challenges—</para><para>and in the next paragraph—</para><para>Begrudgingly, however, most admit that their members have not been hurt much by the award-stripping process because the central provisions on minimum pay, annual leave, sick leave, overtime and penalty rates remain untouched.</para><para>This is a try-on; it is not necessary. I commend to the Senate the approach that the government has taken in a flexible arrangement that is actually meeting the need for our young men and women to get the leave they need to undertake their military training.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>10223</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="s231">Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill 1999 (No. 2)</inline>  which the opposition, through Senator Jacinta Collins, is seeking to put through the chamber. I am disappointed that this is the way in which the ALP is going about their first 
 attempt at policy making. It is a patch of policy. We have not seen anything from the policy free zone opposite. I heard them say recently, `Oh, well, you didn't have your policies out.'

As Senator Coonan said, they are attempting to politicise an issue which is untimely and inappropriate in the current situation. I think it is also very cynical. Rather than trying to constructively fill the policy vacuum in their party platform, Senator Jacinta Collins's bill is an attempt to attack the reform of workplace relations via the backdoor of politicising Australia's peacekeeping commitment to East Timor.</para><para>One can see how ridiculous this is. It is just plain crazy. Despite the apparent intention behind Senator Collins's bill, it is a plain old-fashioned attack on the initiatives undertaken by this government in promoting flexible workplace agreements. It is clear that the Labor Party—the dinosaurs on the other side—want to step back in time and go back to the Dark Ages of mass legislation and the coercion of employers rather than allowing employees and employers to come to flexible agreements on things like Defence Force service.</para><para>Senator Coonan and a number of my colleagues have pointed out that in the bad old days of the Accord, the then industrial relations system—152 federal awards out of a total of 3,000, of which 50 per cent were in the Public Service—had some reference to reserve leave entitlements. That is approximately five per cent of all awards. The Labor Party come in here now and indicate what they want to do, when they had 13 years in government. If they were so concerned about the rights of reservists, especially with regard to pay, they would have done something about it in 13 years in government.

Small business after small business came to us saying, `We can only employ our families because, under the current industrial relations system, we cannot afford to employ other people. It is too costly, it is too difficult and we are not prepared to do it.' So they held back from creating jobs, except for family members basically, and they ran their small businesses on the smell of an oily rag because the industrial relations system under Labor was so unworkable for small business. Labor would have us go back to record business collapses, high inflation, low productivity and record high levels of industrial disputes.</para><para>People on this side of the chamber, and those who have supported us, do not want to see those dark days again. This bill put forward by the Labor Party will put us back to those dark days.

As I was saying, this act, along with the Defence Act 1903, ensures the protection of Australia's workers by imposing fines under the criminal law against employers who seek to take action against them because of military service. This, coupled with a workplace relations system that allows employers and employees to negotiate flexible working arrangements, ensures that workplace agreements continue to meet the need for reservists to have Defence Force leave with the full support of their employers. I want to refer to a comment made by Minister Bruce Scott in the other place. He said:</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Labor Party are saying that we should have made reserve leave part of the Australian workplace agreements. The fact of the matter is that there are now more reserve leave provisions in those agreements than there were in the awards. When I talk to the people out there in business, many of whom 
 employ reservists, they say, `We would rather cooperate with the government and cooperate with the Defence Force than be coerced into employing someone and give them that leave through the award system. We would rather work cooperatively with the reservists rather than be coerced.' That system is working.</para><para>We know that the Commonwealth Bank have it in their Australian workplace agreements. Telstra have it in their agreements.

But what about the ALP? What are they doing to provide policies which will provide similar outcomes? Absolutely nothing. As I said, they are still in a policy vacuum.

And that's why it's important that it be incorporated in an award.

Its purpose is, purportedly, to ensure that leave for participation in service and training as a member of the Australian Defence Force reserves is one of the matters which may be taken to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for conciliation and arbitration. I said `purportedly' because the real purpose of this bill is of course quite different from what its subtitle describes. Let me say at the beginning that the Liberal Party has always acknowledged and cherished the contributions and 
 sacrifices ordinary Australians have made and are continuing to make for the welfare of our nation by service in defence of it. Defence of the realm is a fundamental issue to this party and this government.</para></talk.start><para>It is a historic fact that when the Howard government came to office in 1996 it was presented with a gift of a $10 billion black hole in the budget, courtesy of the Labor government and its last Minister for Finance—none other than Mr Beazley, now the Leader of the Opposition and the proud sponsor of this bill. I draw the Senate's attention to this coincidence of Mr Beazley's participation. It is actually not a coincidence at all, because there is even more to it than that. Mr Beazley was in fact the Minister for Defence in a previous Labor government, when he presided over the decimation of Australia's defence capability on the basis that Australia was not under any foreseeable military threat. I understand `foreseeable' is a term referring to 50 years.</para><para>The situation has changed. We can understand that Mr Beazley would now be desperate to be on record as a person who cares about the members of our defence forces. What better way to do it—a totally costless and totally irresponsible way—than to put forward a legislative proposal like this bill. He does not have to pay for anything. He does not even have to make sure it goes through. What we have here is a caring, want-to-be national leader. All he wants for the nation is to make sure that the jobs of reservists are protected. Who would not be moved by his concern? However, the right of a reservist is already protected by legislation—by sections 8 and 9 of the Defence (Re-establishment) Act of 1965. Mr Acting Deputy President, I draw your attention to the fact that it is an act of 1965. Under this act, employers are prevented from penalising their employees because of their service in the armed forces reserves. Under this act, employers would be charged with a criminal offence if they attempted to do so.</para><para>It is important to note that not only is this legal protection provided but also it is an historic fact that these sections of the act have never needed to be relied on before. In other 
 words, Australian employers are much more compassionate about our nation's defence than the Labor Party is prepared to credit them with. Charity has never been a strong suit with the Labor Party, has it? It is more a case of `If you see a head, kick it as hard as you can.' But let us be charitable about it. Is the Labor Party merely being misguided in their enthusiasm to provide additional legislative protection? Not at all. This bill actually proposes to add an allowable matter to the awards. This is the real purpose of the bill: not concern over the welfare of the reservists but the addition of another matter to be considered in the awards.</para><para>The real purpose of this bill is to perform another last-ditch act of sabotage against the government's workplace reform program—reform that is urgently needed to bring Australia into a position where it can face global competition in the 21st century. I might add that the need for this reform was recognised by the Labor Party, even though they will be hard pressed to admit it, because this reform process was commenced—albeit in a half-hearted and half-cocked manner—back in 1991 by the Labor government. What this government proposed in the 1996 Act, unlike the current bill before the parliament, takes that reform process to its logical conclusion.</para><para>This reality is highlighted by Mr Beazley's obvious confusion about the actual status of a reservist's job. For Senator Collins's peace of mind, I will not repeat Mr Beazley's performance on Radio 6PR, in case she is moved to complain again. But the reality is that the issue brought up by this bill is not at all that of the welfare of the reservists.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>—I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President.

It won't be paid' and the people waving at him from outside the broadcasting booth.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like to talk about something that is a little more serious. I do not want to take the Labor Party to task about how inadequately they are trying to represent the people of Australia, because I understand that the function of an opposition party is to make noise rather than to actually propose policy which the nation can follow. I want to come back to this question of workplace reform. It seems to me that the fundamental issue of the Workplace Relations Act 1996—I know Senator Collins is an expert in this area so I will not try to match her on the intricate details of it—is quite simple. Australia has an almost unique system of workplace relations. It is something that has been built up over the years and it has a history of which we can be proud—regardless of which party we come from.</para><para>It has given workers good protection during periods of difficulties. However, employers and employees have relied for too long on a centralised system where third parties rather than workers themselves take the initiatives and make decisions about wages and working conditions. If you put into the formula that the employees and employers themselves do not form the first and second parties but each of them is actually represented by other parties, you have a system in which there are not just two players who work in partnership to carry out economic activities to their mutual benefit; you have three, four or five parties all working in their own private interest.</para><para>As we go into the new century, this system is putting a burden on Australia's ability to compete in the world. One of the elements of the reforms put in place by the Workplace Relations Act 1996 is to define different levels of agreements which would guarantee workers' welfare and also productivity for employers in the workplace. The award system, which has formed the bedrock of guarantees for workers' conditions, has been redefined to its proper purpose as a safety net. 
 The nature of a safety net is that it covers the basic requirements that guarantee workers' conditions.</para><para>When the 1996 act was passed we had more than 3,200 federal awards in the Australian workplaces. Each of these awards applied to different conditions, different industries and had different complexities. The 1996 act provides for the award system to be simplified. According to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, under the act these 3,200 awards were reduced to about 2,000 awards by July 1999. Also, about 1,200 awards have been identified by the Industrial Relations Commission as being in the process of being simplified. So the process is well in hand. Within the next few years we should have a very good safety net in place which will enable employers and employees to embark on proper enterprise bargaining which will guarantee workers good conditions and employers good productivity.</para><para>Although this process is developing natural momentum, we find the Labor Party trying to add items to the award process. As I pointed out earlier, this is quite unnecessary because protection for Defence Force reservists is already in place. There is no need to add to it. I would suggest that this is only a mischievous attempt by the Labor Party to, on the one hand, redirect attention from their inadequacy in the past and their inability to make proper provision for Australia's defence and, on the other hand, without drawing attention to it, slow down the process of reform to help their mates in the union movement who see all this reform process as something to be feared because it will either do them out of a job or require them to acquire new skills in representing workers and fighting for workers' needs. As I said at the beginning, what better way to achieve your end than by introducing some elements which have nothing to do with what the nation actually needs? In looking at this bill, let us look at the real purpose behind the proposal. I urge the Senate to reject it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>10230</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the couple of minutes available to me before the time for this debate

I really could not put it any better than the erudite way in which Senator Tchen has just said it—that this legislation is really a subterfuge. It is a disgraceful subterfuge to reinstall an industrial relations system that might have been all right in the 19th century but certainly had no place as the 20th century progressed and most definitely has no place in Australia as we enter the 21st century. The Labor Party through this legislation is making a disgraceful—Senator Tchen said mischievous; it is certainly mischievous but it is more than that—attempt to misuse Australia's support for East Timor to reestablish this outdated, passe awards system of wage regulation in Australia.

It is interesting to look at note 
 16 on page 187 of that report which sets out executive remuneration. I note that because the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has a great deal of responsibility in looking at the probity of the actions of Australian companies.</para></talk.start><para>I noticed that a report of the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities was tabled by Senator Chapman this morning. His media release on that report says:</para><para>The Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities has recommended that company annual reports must disclose directors' and executives' remunerations in all its forms, including the value of options granted, exercised and lapsed during the year and their aggregation in the total remuneration package.</para><para>The table at note 16 of the ACCC report does not attend to their executive remuneration in the same way. Having said that, I am reminded of a contribution I made on 22 September with regard to Airservices Australia—an authority of this government—in which I asked questions of Minister Anderson in relation to a document that had been published which purported to set out the salaries of managers and other staff. I asked Mr Anderson for a copy of a report on the salaries and increments of those staff and that was refused.</para><para>In the context of the statement by the committee and the media statement by its chair, Senator Chapman, today, it is hard to understand how Minister Anderson can refuse to reveal to the public details of the salaries of the executives of Airservices Australia. It is the case, as with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, that this statutory authority has as its effective shareholders the people of Australia. Senator Chapman said in this regard today:</para><para>The committee has recommended that new disclosure requirements should apply to listed managed schemes to ensure that the same levels of accountability and transparency apply to these entities.</para><para>He pointed out that many directors and executives were seeking to use the law as they did not feel compelled to comply with it and felt that the law could be contested. In the case that I mentioned, it is not a question of the law; it is a question of the discretion of 
 the minister. The minister is using that discretion to decline to reveal to the Australian people the very information that the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities has recommended be required of directors and executives of companies in the private sector.</para><para>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission should follow the same standards. Much more detail on remuneration should be supplied than is set out in this table, which is merely a list of bands of salaries and the number of officers who lie within them. We were told in the Airservices case that the salaries ranged up to $329,000 for the Chief Executive. Parliamentary salaries have been in the news recently, but they do not go anywhere near the salary that Mr Pollard receives. The General Manager, Corporate and Employee Relations for Airservices is paid $256,214. I see in the ACCC document that no officer receives a salary of that level. I do think that whilst the ACCC document is, in my view, deficient in what it presents—and I am heartened by the statement of Senator Chapman—it is hard to understand why the minister cannot see that the Australian public have a direct interest in knowing what a statutory authority such as Airservices pays to individuals. If newspaper reports are correct, the salaries for those officers are greater than for those in the ACCC. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>10232</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to government documents were considered:</para><para>Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency—Quarterly report for the period 5 February to 31 March 1999 (First).

Tuesday, 19 October, marked the 25th anniversary of the election of the first fully elected parliament of the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory of 25 years ago was still pictured by the vast majority of Australians as the frontier of our great country, a vast region with extremes of climate that was populated by wild and dangerous animals and by even wilder characters.</para></talk.start><para>It was viewed as pioneer country, and people who made this their home worked hard, gave a lot to the community and had a lifestyle that many in southern states could only dream of, or in some cases imagine in their worst nightmares. The Northern Territory is still a place for pioneers, but they are pioneers of a different ilk to those of 25 years ago, who were building a modern community and its necessary infrastructure in the face of much adversity.</para><para>Over the past 25 years we have seen enormous and unparalleled growth in the Northern Territory. Let me outline some of the major achievements and issues as I have seen them over the course of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I was very privileged to have been an initial member of that assembly in 1974, so the 25th anniversary has a very personal and parochial significance for me.</para><para>There has been an incredible growth in the tourist industry, from a somewhat unsophisticated beginning into something that now caters for all types of visitors in the most professional and friendly manner. The Northern Territory had 1.28 million visitors in 1998-99, with 434,000 of them being from overseas. This compares to only 113,000 for 1971-72, with 12,000 of them being from overseas. The Northern Territory government has facilitated this growth by expanding the number of Territory parks to over 90 and putting in place the infrastructure that is so necessary—such as the Yulara resort—to service the national parks in the Territory. The gas pipeline from the Mareenie field to Darwin is another major achievement that should be noted. This opens up many possibilities. It is pleasing to see the current plans for a major LNG plant in Darwin and the benefits this project will bring.</para><para>In 25 years we have seen the mining industry expand from one worth just over $100 million a year to one worth $933 million in 1997-98. There have been several new major projects come on line and the expansion over the years of others such as the Nabalco operation at Nhulunbuy. Gold has proven over the years to be a major commodity in the Territory, with various mines expanding or operating. I think of places like Jabiru and the Macarthur River and recent developments relating to diamond mining.</para><para>Closely related to the issue of mining is the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act of 1996 which was introduced by the Fraser government. It is my belief that this federal act has been both a boon and a curse to the Northern Territory. It has certainly focused attention on the plight and needs of Aboriginal people, but at the same time, due 
 to the fact that it traverses traditional land administration, it has created an impediment to mining and land development. Complex land council administration has acted as a hindrance to the social development of many Aboriginal people, and the concentration on acquiring land at any cost has perversely left the vast majority of Aboriginal people living in remote communities still dependent on welfare support income mechanisms.</para><para>It is interesting to note the parallel between the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act of 1978 and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act of 1976. Both of them over this period that I am talking about have had an important impact on the Northern Territory. It is very significant to note the positive and the negative on both of those issues.</para><para>Another issue which is of particular recent importance is defence. Over the years we have seen a substantial build-up of defence forces in the Territory. The RAAF base Tindal and the defence personnel and infrastructure located in the Darwin region are proving their worth to Australians and the greater international region. The federal government has continued the build-up of defence forces in the Territory and earlier this year upgraded the readiness of the 1st Brigade in Darwin. This foresight has showed its dividends in the response to the recent East Timor crisis.</para><para>The Northern Territory government and the community have done much to welcome the defence personnel to the Territory. They have worked hard in conjunction with the forces to make any impact of defence personnel's presence a minimal and positive one for all involved. The Territory's response to the East Timor crisis, both at a government and business level, has shown the sophistication, planning and readiness of the Territory for tasks of this magnitude and the potential of the region as a service centre.</para><para>In the south of the Territory a major defence installation that is often not talked about is the Pine Gap joint defence facility. This facility has seen a large expansion recently and is vital to our national defence interests and the economy of Alice Springs. The staff 
 numbers in 1974 were 432: US, 226 and Australian, 206. In 1999 there are now 850 staff there, and half are Australians.</para><para>The creation of a Northern Territory Public Service that escaped the paternalistic management style previously seen from Canberra is another important step in the Territory's development. The Northern Territory Public Service was consolidated by Chief Minister Marshall Perron, who was also instrumental in ensuring that Territory businesses received appropriate government assistance to develop, to expand and to seek new opportunities. Marshall Perron was also instrumental in an important aspect of the Territory's social development prior to his retirement, the Northern Territory's progressive euthanasia legislation. This Northern Territory legislation, unfortunately, was thwarted in this parliament in a manner that constitutionally could not have applied to any state. This issue will be seen as a watershed in the Territory's history and an important factor in the social development of the community.</para><para>Since 1974 we have seen substantial change in the Northern Territory community. The population is ageing, with more people choosing to stay in the Territory to enjoy the lifestyle opportunities it offers in their retirement. We are seeing increasing numbers of second, third and even fourth generation families in the Territory, adding stability and character and giving much back to the community.</para><para>On a personal note, it has been a privilege and an  honour serving Territorians almost continuously in various political capacities since that fateful day in 1974 when I was first elected to public life. I have many fond memories of the time and some memories that, whilst they cannot be called fond, will always remain with me, in particular memories of Cyclone Tracy, which followed only a couple of months after the election of that first parliament. My first speech to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was made a week after Cyclone Tracy, and it is not hard to guess the topic of that speech—planning and relooking at the lives of many people.</para><para>A fledgling parliament faced an enormous task in the reconstruction of the social and 
 physical environment of Darwin. I am proud to have been a member of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission from 1975 to 1978 as a nominee of the Territory parliament and can only marvel at the Darwin I see now compared to then. The Territory is an exciting and vibrant place with many projects and developments coming on line or expanding. The people of the Territory have an air of optimism and expectation that is refreshing. This attitude is certainly a factor in the success of business and government in the Northern Territory, along with a willingness to have the foresight to recognise the potential in the region in so many diverse areas. This foresight has seen Territorians pioneering Australia's engagement with Asia, and Darwin becoming a highly sophisticated service centre that is pivotal in the area of regional focus.</para><para>The Territory pioneers of today are those pioneering our engagement with the Asian region and those who are looking to expand their opportunities nationally and internationally. In the next 25 years, the Legislative Assembly will have much to look forward to. In the near future we will have further infrastructure to facilitate our engagement with the region such as the railway and the continued development of the port and, of course, an advancement into statehood. I predict that the Darwin of the future will be cosmopolitan—a new Singapore—and the social reform of the next 25 years will impact on the lives of all Territorians, particularly with a major health, educational and social improvement for Aboriginal Territorians.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Internet</title><page.no>10236</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>10236</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to raise the concerns of the Internet Society of Australia specifically, and other industry groups generally, regarding the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act 1999. Since the passage of this legislation in June 1999, the Internet Society of Australia has continued to analyse the impact of the act. Part of this analysis has been an identification of the definitions employed by the act, which demonstrates that the legislation is likely to impact on more organisations than even 
 Senator Alston would have intended it to impact upon.</para></talk.start><para>According to legal opinion received from the Internet Society of Australia which was produced by lawyers Andrew Chalet and Lucas Testro of Phillips Fox, the act fails to provide a meaningful definition of `Internet content host', stating only that the term refers to a person who hosts or proposes to host Internet content in Australia. `Internet content' is defined to mean information available for access using an Internet carriage service but does not include email. The act does not state which activities are considered to constitute `hosting' of Internet content. The legal opinion goes on to say:</para><para>However, the use of the term throughout the code suggests that the code drafters intended the term to refer to entities which provide facilities on which the Internet content of other people can be stored and centrally administered by the host.</para><para>The reality of web site management these days is quite different from that anticipated by such a definition. These days, many hosts, which are usually ISPs, offer their customers a permanent `direct' connection to the Internet. Senator Alston's ambiguous definition of `Internet content host' in the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act means that these businesses, as well as those people who manage the content of their own web site, despite the wording of the proposed code, may be liable to be served with a take-down notice by the Australian Broadcasting Authority.</para><para>This also raises the issue of what action can be taken by an ISP or host which provides direct Internet access for its clients if it is served with a take-down notice. In such a situation, a host could only ensure that a small amount of prohibited material is taken down by taking the drastic action of blocking access to the entire web site, preventing any of the customers' material from being accessible via the Internet.</para><para>While Senator Alston's definition of Internet service provider, ISP, is more substantial than the definition of Internet content host, it is a definition which creates even more uncertainty, according to this advice gathered by the Internet Society of Australia. 
 Under the act, and according to this legal opinion, the term `ISP' includes any person who supplies an Internet carriage service that is used for the carriage of information between two end users outside the immediate circle of the supplier, as defined within the Telecommunications Act 1997, where one person uses an Internet carriage service to view the Internet content of a second person, for example, by visiting a web site. Both of those people are considered to be end users of that carriage service. That is about two end users being defined as being outside the immediate circle. ISP would also include a person who supplies a service for the carriage of information simultaneously to more than one end user, at least one of whom is outside the immediate circle of the supplier.</para><para>Close examination of this definition demonstrates that some highly surprising and inappropriate entities may, in fact, be considered ISPs under the Broadcasting Services (Online Services) Act definition. As a result, all persons who operate their own web servers, whether for business or personal purposes, appear to be included as ISPs under the act. This is because servers enable such people, through their web sites, to transmit communications simultaneously to thousands of end users. That is the nature of the Internet.</para><para>However, even if a business does not own its own server, it may still be considered to provide services enabling end users to access the Internet. An example of this, provided by Phillips Fox, would be a business that enters into an agreement with an ISP under which it is provided with access to the Internet and which in turn permits other people to access the services provided by that ISP, arguably providing those people with a service enabling them to access the Internet.</para><para>On that basis, even businesses which do not own their own servers may, in some circumstances, be considered ISPs under the definitions of this act. Consider, for example, a business which allows its employees to place information on its web site or even to use its computers to place information on Internet bulletin boards unrelated to the business. By doing so, the business is arguably providing employees with a service enabling them to 
 access the Internet and to communicate simultaneously with many people. As it is possible, and practically inevitable, for at least one of those people to be outside the immediate circle of the business, that business is an ISP under the act and could therefore be liable to be served with an access prevention notice by the ABA.</para><para>Companies providing independent contractors with access to the Internet also appear to be ISPs under the act, according to this legal advice provided to the Internet Society of Australia by Phillips Fox. There are numerous other entities which appear to fall within the act's definition of an ISP. These include specialists to whom businesses outsource management of their IT services, including Internet access arrangements; tertiary institutions which provide Internet access to visitors to the institution; in certain circumstances, trust companies created by partnerships to own the legal interest in the partnership's business infrastructure, such as Internet servers, or to enter Internet access arrangements with ISPs on behalf of the partnerships; and businesses which allow clients to access their intranets, provided a link exists from the businesses' intranet to the Internet, as is usually the case, and this link is available to clients accessing the intranet. In each of the examples mentioned, the entities would appear to fall within the act's definition of an ISP, even if their primary business does not involve the supply of Internet related services.</para><para>This is the key point. Rather than the mere 650 ISPs referred to in Senator Alston's second reading speech on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act 1999, the true impact of this somewhat ridiculous legislation has now become clear. In fact, figures produced by the Internet Society of Australia clearly demonstrate that in fact some 35,000 web servers could now be considered ISPs for all intents and purposes under the act, due to Senator Alston's failure to accurately and concisely define both Internet service provider and Internet content host. We all know that the explanatory memorandum which accompanied this particular bill, and indeed the minister's own second reading speech, clearly articulated that this 
 bill's definition would be constrained to those 650 Internet service providers, but this legal opinion articulates the concerns that many in industry, in business and indeed in the Internet sector, if you like, have at the depth of the ambiguity that has now been identified. It does require immediate attention by Senator Alston to find some resolution to it.</para><para>This is just another bad news story for the government in the ongoing saga of mismanagement in relation to their attempts to regulate the Internet. In fact, the government would be far better served by looking for some practical solution, which should include as its primary focus the education and the skilling up of end users of the Internet to resolve some of the community concerns that Minister Alston so often articulates in this place, as though that is justification for a piece of legislation that has had a very controversial history to date and continues down the path of hefty scrutiny by an industry that knows, as Senator Alston should, that its application cannot possibly achieve the outcome that the minister has claimed to the Australian community that it will.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Castan, Mr Ron, QC</title><page.no>10238</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>10238</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak of the loss of a great Australian, the death of Aaron Ronald Castan, commonly known as Ron Castan, a Queen's Counsel of the highest order. Ron was a man of outstanding integrity who recognised that the Australian legal system was there to represent all, not just a few. He recognised the need for tolerance, but I think beyond that he also understood, in furthering the principles of compassion and decency, that there was a need for understanding in Australia's legal system. His profound understanding of the law enabled him to lead the historic Mabo case and to play an instrumental role in the establishment of the Racial Discrimination Act. Ron was one of Australia's most eminent lawyers who dedicated a significant part of his life to furthering the rights of Aboriginal people. He truly was a great advocate and a person respected by all people of all political persuasions. Much of that respect and my personal admiration were motivated by his exceptional intelligence, 
 capacity and humility—traits that I think are rare from the point of view of being found in one person.</para></talk.start><para>Ron said that as a young man he was naive in his understanding of who Aborigines are and what had happened and continued to happen as he grew up. He often spoke of lectures given by Professor Bill Stanner, who spoke of the plight of the original Australians, describing that as the `cult of disremembering' and `the great Australian silence'. He said in late November last year, when reflecting upon what drove his life, that it was what he saw in the history of the Jewish nation, his people. But in wise words he also said:</para><para>Nevertheless it troubles my conscience now that it took me until 1971 to really commence to see that the determination not to stand by and see the Jewish people downtrodden and persecuted was meaningless if I was standing by and seeing another oppressed people downtrodden and persecuted within my own country.</para><para>Ron was a person who had an innate goodness, and his ability to bring understanding to complex legal issues was truly amazing in the legal and political life of this nation. I have no doubt that Ron had all the necessary qualities, and more, that would have made him a truly exceptional judge of the High Court of Australia.</para><para>Looking at his life, I believe it covered everything that Australians stand for and are proud of. He worked with Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders but he worked also with the now famous Eddie Mabo and many land councils across the country. He was not bound by any one particular group or any one political party; he worked for all. Ron did work tirelessly on behalf of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for nearly 30 years, and he ought to be remembered for that. He displayed fearless tenacity, co-chairing the federal government's national inquiry into racist violence during 1990 and 1991. He was an active member of the Jewish community, senior counsel to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and also involved with the National Indigenous Working Group during the Wik debate. Ron was also the founding honorary secretary of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service. He was a great man who fought for people and 
 for the human rights of Australians. On this occasion I want to extend my deep condolences to Mrs Castan and their three children. This truly is a sorry time for all.</para><para>Also on behalf of the Australian Democrats and indigenous people in this country, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, I want to extend the deepest sympathy of all to the family of Ron Castan, Queen's Counsel, who died in Victoria this morning. Mr Castan had dedicated a significant part of his life to furthering not only the legal rights of Aboriginal people but also human rights as part of national society. He did play an instrumental role in building up all of the things that are valuable to us and, in my final words, I would say that he is a man that is a great white warrior who fought for all people and fought for the rights of all. For indigenous people and for other Australian citizens it is a sad loss and a sorry time for all.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Youth: Generation X</title><page.no>10239</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>10239</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A few months ago I was lucky enough to be invited back to speak to students at the university where I taught. I was, I admit, a little nervous as university campuses are not always full of a Liberal politician's most enthusiastic constituents. But I need not have worried: not only were they a polite lot—I must admit a lot more polite than I had been to Labor politicians back in the early days of the Hawke government—but they were also an earnest, attentive and responsive audience. This is not to say that most supported the coalition; I sincerely doubt that. But their reaction to my speech on that day points towards a changing set of values among young Australians.</para></talk.start><para>A particularly notable example of this change is in the area of most concern to them—tertiary education. I remember all too well the great turmoil in the mid-eighties when tertiary fees were first mooted. All of my lecturers were against them. Most, but not all, students opposed them. Tertiary education, it was argued, would be destroyed. The Whitlam view of an accessible tertiary system would be surrendered to the bean counters of the Treasury. University would become the 
 preserve of the rich. Of course, this proved to be totally false.</para><para>Tertiary fees assisted in allowing governments to expand the number of places available. Accessibility to tertiary education has boomed in the years since the advent of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. Much more importantly, in terms of the change in generational values, today's students believe that they should pay something towards the cost of their education. They realise that they are the primary beneficiaries of a university education and that their education is being subsidised by those unable to attend.</para><para>But it goes much further than this. Generation X-ers are information technology wise, worldly, sophisticated and ambitious. They are triers who do not look for safety nets. They are lifters, not leaners. A good majority believe in the Howard government's work for the dole scheme. There is a strong belief in mutual obligation, a commitment to help those in need, reciprocated by an expectation that those in need will strive to help themselves.</para><para>Strangely, not so long ago this belief would have seemed radical, yet now it is accepted as commonsense and obvious by the young. And among the students there was not even one socialist; they did not even know what the term meant. Some thought it had something to do with party-going. I assured them that socialists had not had much fun in recent times. Sir Arvi Parbo wrote recently, in addressing young Australians about this new and evolving consensus:</para><para>No-one is entitled to handouts just because they happen to be an Australian.</para><para>He said we should think `in terms of contributions' and `responsibilities' instead of `entitlements' and `rights'. Sir Arvi continued:</para><para>I would tell young Australians that they face a future full of challenges which offers no soft options for them or for Australia. I would also tell them that that is not a reason for despondency but for eager acceptance, because it means that the future is in their own hands. History leaves no doubt that people who master and accept such challenges benefit greatly from them.</para><para>Fortunately, the young are not afraid of change and, having spent their formative 
 years during a period—let's face it—of great economic upheaval, they are not threatened by new policies. The essential ingredient lacking in the Australia in which they have grown up is the security that their parents took so much for granted.</para><para>Their baby boomer parents, born between 1945 and about 1960, are perhaps the luckiest generation known to man. They arrived to a world of unprecedented prosperity and security created by their own parents, whose modest aspirations—born out of childhoods marred by poverty and war—sometimes seemed quite crass and materialistic to their indulged offspring. The world of suburbia, the shopping mall, a family car and brand new appliances might have seemed an unfulfilling spiritual desert to some baby boomers who took it all for granted, but for their parents financial security could never simply be assumed. Many baby boomers grew up with, and helped to entrench, the expectation that the world would provide for them, that there would be free lunches for everyone. The laws of economics and commonsense would no longer apply in the brave new world of the baby boomer future.</para><para>Again, recalling that afternoon at a Brisbane university campus, I can still hear the fevered clamour of my former colleagues, the baby boomer academics. Weaned on great prosperity and security but beholden to transient, ephemeral and glib fashions, many baby boomers are now increasingly caught within a contradiction: some still seek to undermine and to ridicule the economic system that they will soon depend upon to provide for their needs as the first baby boomers now reach their retirement years.</para><para>With utopian illusions now largely confined to the baby boomers, responsible and sensible progress is now resumed by their own children, generation X. While in many ways unique, generation X resembles most closely their grandparents, and the challenges facing them today are similar to those their grandparents had to confront more than 50 years ago. Their grandparents, growing up amidst the Great Depression—quite possibly the single most traumatic economic event in Western history—were soon confronted with 
 the task of rebuilding the world after the calamity and destruction of the Second World War. In this monumental task they succeeded splendidly.</para><para>Their grandchildren, generation X, are growing up at a time that Francis Fukuyama calls the `Great Disruption', a time of social and economic change brought about by globalisation and an information revolution that in many ways can only be compared in its intensity to the early days of the Industrial Revolution. This new generation now faces the task of building the world after the Cold War, a conflict less bloody and destructive than the Second World War yet similarly momentous and significant in its consequences. Having taught many generation Xers, I know they will meet this challenge. With values born of responsibility and determination, and possessing a quiet confidence in their ability to hold their own against all comers, Australia's emerging generation fills me with great confidence that this country is in very good hands.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Banking: Services and Fees</title><page.no>10241</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>10241</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I would like to talk about how a bank's mismanagement of its processes has ruined the life of a Brisbane couple. Everybody knows about the greed that leads banks to raise their fees and charges, close branches and make jobs redundant. But receiving less publicity is when a bank mistreats customers in normal day-to-day transactions. When banks raise fees, the community hurts as a whole. There is usually an uproar, but somehow we allow ourselves to rationalise the move, accepting that perhaps there are legitimate commercial reasons for it. This is, however, usually short lived as we become dismayed when we hear of billion dollar profits.</para></talk.start><para>As I mentioned earlier, although receiving less publicity, there are many instances when banks simply stuff up their procedures or deal with customers with total disregard for the customers' feelings or situation. Banks have a lot of control over other people's money, so when things go wrong in the banks' processes of managing people's accounts, it usually leads to a lot of stress and anxiety for the 
 customer. What is worse is that customers usually have no recourse.</para><para>The banks, big as they are and insensitive as they are, often reject any blame on their part when something goes wrong. In addition, despite the Howard government's claims, there is a pathetic level of competition in the banking industry. Banks are able to mistreat their customers. Customers cannot so easily walk away either because banks have put high hurdles on leaving. There is little competition and the banks know it. That is why they are so cavalier, callous even, in their treatment of customers.</para><para>I would like to talk about the tragic story of Mr and Mrs Kurz. Mr Terry and Mrs Majella Kurz, customers of the National Australia Bank, experienced such heartless treatment. Their lives were turned into a nightmare because the bank was less than professional in its dealings with them. It all started simply enough: a straightforward loan with a couple of properties as security. But it would prove to be a Faustian deal—a deal with the devil—where your dreams can be brought to reality, but at a very high price. It was a potential cost that the Kurzes had no inkling of.</para><para>In July 1995 the Kurzes consolidated their loans from various institutions at one bank—the NAB. The consolidated loan was worth about $135,000. The Kurzes were doing well enough in meeting repayments for the first year until their dry-cleaning business began to struggle. They had hit a bad patch. To help ease their financial difficulties, the Kurzes let their house. While some payments were being made, they fell behind in their obligations. By the second half of 1997 the bank had issued a notice of default, a demand notice and a notice of exercise of power of sale for one of the properties. The Kurzes claim, however, that they did not receive any of these. We may doubt this claim, but this is the beginning of a whole series of anomalies in the bank's procedures, which left the Kurzes confused, frustrated and distressed.</para><para>The bank had come down hard on the Kurzes. The bank deemed the Kurzes as having failed to live up to the loan agreement. One of the securities to the loan, a block of land, was taken by the bank and sold off for 
 about $33,000 in November 1997. The Kurzes, perhaps naively, believed that this had now saved them from their arrears. Indeed, more than that, they thought that perhaps they might even now be ahead of the required payments. It was difficult for them to be certain. Why? The bank had not provided them with any statement or documentation informing them of the current state of the loan—that is, whether or not they were still in arrears or were now ahead in the repayment schedule. The bank had ceased sending the Kurzes any statement of accounts.</para><para>The Kurzes took the initiative to approach the bank. They also proposed a new payment arrangement which they believed they could afford and could bring them back on track. The Kurzes, represented by a financial services adviser, negotiated a new repayment schedule of $1,300 a month. The bank agreed. But it would seem that the bank and the Kurzes left the meeting with a different understanding of the arrangement. The Kurzes understood that a total of $1,300 per month would be paid, but the bank, it would seem, thought it would be $1,300 per month on top of the regular repayments.</para><para>A contract reflecting the latter interpretation reached the Kurzes on 28 January 1998, two days before they were scheduled to make the first repayment of the new arrangement. The Kurzes did not immediately commit to or sign the contract because it did not reflect their view of the negotiations with the bank. Nevertheless, in good faith, they made repayments as instructed by the bank. They made repayments of $1,300 on 3 February 1998, 16 February 1998 and 17 February 1998 despite the misleading claim by the bank in its 13 October 1999 letter that `the next repayment due on 27 February 1998 had not been received by 3 March 1998'.</para><para>It is on this bank's perception of events that they then pursued possession of the other security to the loan, the house being let by the Kurzes. The Kurzes at this time were still under the impression that the terms of the new arrangements were being sorted out or maybe even being corrected, as per their initial discussion with the bank. This was not the case, however. The bank sent an eviction 
 notice to the tenant on 9 March 1998, without informing the Kurzes beforehand. The tenant had to move out in 14 days. The Kurzes now did not have a source of income, which came from the rent. This put the Kurzes under further extreme financial pressure.</para><para>They were also now being denied access to make repayments into the relevant account, a situation which they apparently experienced before with the same bank and with the same account. The bank refused to take the deposits, with tellers citing some instructions about not having the authority to accept them. There was one occasion when the Kurzes did manage to deposit money into the account. The Kurzes, conscious of not being able to deposit for the last few months, made a repayment of a lump sum of $4,000 on 25 August 1998. This deposit repayment was accepted. Later attempts at repayments were not accepted.</para><para>The Kurzes have proof that they endeavoured to make repayments on the loan and that the bank did not accept them. What was going on? The Kurzes had no idea and the bank was not forthcoming with an explanation. The tenant moved out, and the house was left unoccupied. The house sat empty for at least six months—abandoned, uncared for and losing value by the day. In its insensitive fashion, the bank rushed the tenant out the door but did not expedite the sale of the house, nor did it take the effort to initiate further discussions with the Kurzes to address the problem.</para><para>I understand that the Kurzes did approach the bank, seeking means to rectify the problem. The bank was uncooperative. Indeed, attempts at some payments by the Kurzes were rejected. At this point, the strain and distress had their most significant impact on the Kurzes. Mr and Mrs Kurz separated. Their business closed down. Mrs Kurz was alone, with the exception of the company of her dogs.</para><para>With no place to go, Mrs Kurz and her dogs moved back into the house in August 1998, without the bank's permission. A month later the bank sold off the house for $70,000. Mrs Kurz was forced out of the house by an officer of the court. Mrs Kurz had no place to stay, had nowhere to go, was without a 
 husband and with little money. With little financial support, finding accommodation that would take two big dogs was extremely difficult. Without a choice, she had to send the dogs to the pound and the dogs were put to sleep.</para><para>It is difficult to explain how special these dogs were to Mrs Kurz. The dogs helped her through the tragic death of her first husband. They were her faithful company. Now they were dead due to the greed and incompetence of the bank. There is much to comprehend with this sad story.

Its mistakes seem to have been done with intent to end the relationship and obtain everything she's got.</para><para>I'll list what the bank did wrong.</para><para>It gave Mrs Kurz the wrong information about the new repayment arrangement.

How</para><para></para><para>could she continue to make payments. The bank had a strategy to confuse and frustrate.

Implementation of the Library's compliance plan is not due to commence until later this month and as consequence there has been minimal expenditure on preparing for the introduction of the GST. The cost to 15 September 1999 on external suppliers is $1,000. (b) To date there has been no expenditure on consultancies, however it is planned that the Library's Internal Auditors will be used to provide specialist advice and undertake reviews of Library systems and procedures in accordance with the Library's GST Compliance Plan. The value of this consultancy has not been quantified at this time. Training of staff by external providers has cost $375 in 99/00 and $270 in 98/99. The training of other Library staff is to be undertaken by the Library's Finance staff. There has been no expenditure on computer software as a consequence of the introduction of the GST. It is not envisaged that there will be expenditure of this nature other than ensure that interfaces between systems are GST compliant. The Library's major systems are GST compliant. There has not been any expenditure on additional staff as a result of the introduction of the GST, nor is any planned. There has been no expenditure on new stationery and expenditure on new stationery should be minimised as the Library's accounting system uses electronic stationery.

Building a framework for an acceptable solution remains the responsibility of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) which is charged with organising and conducting the referendum on the future of the disputed territory.</para><para>(2) In this type of case the UN may formally request member states to provide independent observers. To date the Government has not received any such request from the UN in respect of the planned referendum in Western Sahara. In keeping with its long interest in seeing a just and lasting resolution of the status of Western Sahara, as evidenced by Australia's participation in MINURSO, the Government would be prepared to consider a request from the UN to provide observers to help monitor the referendum. In considering any such request the Government would need to balance its interest in assisting the referendum process in Western Sahara with the demands of other foreign policy priorities.</para><para>(3) The Government has already provided substantial assistance to UN efforts to resolve the situation in Western Sahara and organise a referendum there. From 1991 to 1994 Australia provided a contingent of 45 signallers to MINURSO. Australia's withdrawal from MINURSO in 1994 in no way indicated any diminution of Australian support for the UN operation there, but rather the emergence of higher priority demands on Australia's limited resources in this field.</para><para>(4) On the matter of recognition of Polisario, Australia recognises states, not governments, and accordingly there is no basis for formal recognition of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) proclaimed in Algeria in February 1976. Australia considers the Polisario Front to be representative of an important body of West Saharan opinion, but does not regard it as the sole representative. Dealings occur with Polisario on an informal basis in New York, and Australian parliamentarians and officials meet with Polisario Front representatives informally. Since many Polisario representatives also hold SADR positions, Australian Ministers do not formally receive them, because to do so might be presented as Australian acceptance of the SADR as the government of Western Sahara. 
</para><para>(5) Amnesty International produced Reports on the Western Sahara dated June and August 1999. These reports, while registering the organisation's continuing concerns over the human rights situation, in particular on torture and ill-treatment in detention, freedom of expression, association and movement, acknowledge that there have been improvements in recent years, including in the release of hundreds of "disappeared" and also of prisoners of conscience.</para><para>(6) The Government continues to monitor the human rights situation in the Western Sahara as part of its commitment to the promotion and pro-</para><para></para><para>tection of human rights internationally. Over the last few years, individual cases of alleged human rights abuses in the Western Sahara have been brought to the Government's attention through a longstanding arrangement whereby Amnesty International "Urgent Action" cases are considered and, where appropriate, pursued by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on behalf of the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group. The Australian Embassy in Paris, which has responsibility for Morocco, has made representations to the Moroccan authorities and will continue to do where appropriate.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
