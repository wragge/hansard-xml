I refer the minister to the fifth conference of the parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change recently held in Bonn. Can the minister confirm that some 60 countries at COP-5 committed to a timetable of ratification to allow the protocol to come into effect by 2002, and that these countries cover some 80 per cent of the emissions needed for the protocol to come into force? Can the minister further confirm that the Kyoto Protocol could come into force without ratification by the United States?

When you go for 150 days without asking a question of your opponents in this place and that then becomes public knowledge, obviously you have got to take some remedial action. Anyway, I welcome environment questions from Senator Bolkus—even if I get so few—and I am happy to talk about the issue that Senator Bolkus raised of ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.</para></talk.start><para>The facts of life are that the Kyoto Protocol will not be ratified by major players until a number of matters have been settled, including the flexibility mechanisms—which, in turn, include matters such as the CDM and emissions trading—issues of compliance and issues of sinks. It is hoped that the detail of these matters will be settled at the next conference of the parties, which in turn, it is believed, although it is not certain, will be held late next year. It should clear the way for 
 consideration of ratification by the major emitters.</para><para>But there is one matter that, beyond issues of filling in the detail of the Kyoto Protocol, is critical to the issue of ratification, and that is third-party participation by developing countries. It is well known that without the settlement of details, such as on emissions trading, and also real commitments by large developing country emitters, the United States will not ratify. It is true that it is technically possible for enough other states to ratify without the United States, but it is simply unrealistic to expect that to occur. I say that, knowing as I do that the European Union has made some public statement to the effect that it might do so. In my view, it will not do so ahead of the United States because, by doing so, it could be economically disadvantaged; and that is just not the real world.</para><para>It is in Australia's interests to get the detail of Kyoto finally settled at the next COP and to get the Kyoto Protocol brought into legal effect as soon as possible. That is because Australia, although accepting a demanding target at Kyoto, nevertheless got a fair target, and it is unlikely that any alternative international negotiation that could potentially subsume Kyoto in the future would give to Australia an opportunity that is as fair as we were able to negotiate in Kyoto.</para><para>We are one of the countries that are actively working towards settling outstanding issues in order that ratification might be made at the earliest possible date, in order that the Kyoto Protocol might come into effect and be legally enforceable. In concluding, I make the point that I have made before: Australia, in terms of its domestic response, is not actually waiting for the Kyoto Protocol to come into effect: we are implementing programs to achieve our target, notwithstanding. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10385</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have a supplementary question to the minister.

 people to COP-5 in Bonn, when the government had no intention at all of ratifying the protocol? How many of the sizeable delegation were from the non-government sector?

It was a sizeable delegation, as every delegation has been—including the one led by Senator Faulkner that was so unsuccessful, I might say, Senator Bolkus. What you failed to tell the Senate is that most of the countries that said that they would commit to a timetable of 2002 will not even be bound by the Kyoto Protocol. They are countries that will not take new legal obligation as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, and I am sorry that you misled the Senate a little in your question in that regard, Senator.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to ratification, Senator Bolkus failed to hear what I said, and that is that Australia is keen to be in a position to be able to ratify in due course and to see the Kyoto Protocol come into effect.

Does 
 the minister also recall stating on 16 November that part of the government's role as a sponsor of this event was `to sponsor the application for APEC badging' and that support for APEC badging was `part of being a sponsor'? Isn't the minister deliberately fudging the timing of the Commonwealth's involvement in the light of former Minister Moore's announcement of the APEC badging of the Technomart on 9 October 1998?

When I said that, I was quite deliberately including in that description the fact that the Commonwealth did assist in sponsoring this Technomart receiving APEC endorsement. It is quite clear that the word `sponsorship', which is the way I described the government's support for this Technomart, clearly encompasses our role in assisting this organisation to secure APEC badging. In August of 1998, the then Department of Industry, Science and Tourism sponsored the proposal to secure APEC badging and invited other APEC economies to cosponsor the event.</para></talk.start><para>Sponsoring the proposal for APEC endorsement maximised the potential benefits of the government's financial sponsorship of the event. Sponsoring the APEC endorsement process was the first stage of the department's financial sponsorship of the event.

They currently employ in excess of 200,000 people in Australia. As a percentage of GDP, our expenditure on information technology and telecommunications is the third highest in the OECD region. The marketplace is valued at around $45 billion, which is about three per cent of the global market, which means we are punching well above our weight, and it is a larger sector than all of the ASEAN countries combined. It clearly has enormous potential. The demand for skilled employees is growing at the rate of nine per cent a year, and there are currently some 360,000 specialists employed in the IT&amp;T sector.</para></talk.start><para>One of the concerns that has been expressed around the world is the global skills shortage. Quite clearly, Australia needs to ensure that we do everything to attract people into the sector and to have the education system produce people who not only are IT literate but also have the skills that are required in the marketplace and are able to take advantage of the significant premiums that attach to positions in this area.</para><para>When you contrast the approach that we have taken with that of our political opponents, it really is very stark and, from 
 Australia's point of view, it really is very one-sided. For example, if one tries to explain why people are attracted offshore, one might refer to Silicon Valley, where there are innumerable job opportunities and tremendous shortages. It might also be the size of the market on the US mainland. It might simply be the excitement of networking in that region. The Labor Party's explanation for why people tend to leave Australia is this—this is what Senator Lundy had to say recently:</para><para>Young people who have these skills, who have their whole lives ahead of them, who are committed to Australia, look at the frontbench of the government and it does not inspire them to stay. Is it any wonder people look elsewhere?</para><para>So Labor's explanation for the global skills shortage and the reason for people being persuaded to go offshore is apparently to have a look at our frontbench. It makes you wonder about the state of Labor's frontbench. We know that they have had to suspend all operations to try to cobble together this employment package. It looks like now being eight or nine months behind schedule, which is rather tragic. I would have thought they could have done a lot better than that.</para><para>You have only to look at the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Computers</inline> editorial earlier this month to see where Labor has really got to in terms of IT&amp;T. The heading is `Labor well behind on IT awareness', and it states:</para><para>The state and federal governments accept this reality, but Labor's politicians in Canberra struggle to grasp the enormity of this change.</para><para>I think it is fair to say that John Brumby is very interested in this area and will make a significant contribution in due course. I am delighted that he was able to persuade his short-sighted colleagues from the Premier down that somehow IT&amp;T did deserve a mention on the front bench, a very silly mistake but one that was actually corrected within a reasonably short period of time. But we do not get anything like that sort of fleetness of foot at federal level.

 decide whether to fill in a survey and that what you really need is someone from the union standing over your shoulder telling you how to behave, telling you how to organise your affairs, telling you how to run your lifestyle. It is quite incorrect for Senator Allison to say that this is a compulsory survey. You do not need to fill it in and submit it before obtaining a bonus. The arrangements are that the bonus payments depend upon two things: meeting the attendance requirement and a workplace score of at least 50 per cent of the total points that could be scored on lifestyle elements. So this could occur if all employees score at least 50 per cent or if half of the employees score 100 per cent or some other combination. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>APEC Technomart III</title><page.no>10391</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10391</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Minchin, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources.

This is a further major example of the problems with the application of a GST—the important principle of a tax on a tax. This was an issue which the Liberal-National coalition assured the Australian people would not occur in respect of a GST. They assured the Australian people there would not be a tax on a tax.</para><para>It is a grossly unfair situation where, for example, a GST is added to the cost of the purchase of small businesses, residential homes, insurance policies, property leases and those sorts of financial transactions and then, on top of that, there are various state charges, taxes, levies or whatever they may be called. This in effect is a tax on a tax. To magnify the difficulty that this causes, it is a percentage tax on top of a percentage tax. And what was Senator Kemp's response to this further example of a major problem that has emerged with the GST? Senator Kemp's response was that they would be consulting with state governments to try and establish some guidelines for the application of the GST in these circumstances.</para><para>This is not good enough. This problem has arisen in other countries. The government was forewarned of the difficulties that this would present. Indeed, I can recall the Liberal Party assuring the people of Australia in the lead-up to the last election that these sorts of state taxes and charges would be abolished and would be replaced by the GST. Not only have 
 they not been abolished, their impact has been added to with a double whammy—and, in some cases, the triple whammy of a tax on a tax on a tax. Senator Kemp referred to the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Richard Court. The Premier of Western Australia said that stamp duty had always been applied after Commonwealth taxes had been levied. I quote the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>:</para><para>`The principle is uniform,' he said. `In some cases [particularly on car purchases] stamp duty will decrease, in other cases it will increase.'</para><para>The point at issue here is that we have never had a GST in this country before. We have not had a federal tax apply to a whole range of transactions, such as residential home purchase, insurance policies, purchase of a small business, a mortgage and property leases. We have never had a federal tax apply in this area before. The wholesale sales tax, which the Liberal Party is so fond of criticising, did not apply in those areas. So we have a new tax, and then state taxes applying on top of the GST. This is grossly unfair. It is ludicrous for the Liberal Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, to say that this has always happened. It has not always happened, because we have not had a GST.</para><para>The Liberal Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, would have known this well. He has been a strong advocate of a GST.

My colleagues are right, in that we heard the government say that it would seek to get the states and territories to abolish those stamp duties, and we can see that that is not happening.</para><para>An example of those levies, fees and charges that are expected to have GST added on them are fire levies contained in insurance policies, environmental levies, bushland acquisition levies, camping fees, national park entry fees, swimming pool entry fees—even sporting fields that are hired from local councils you will pay a GST on—community hire halls from local councils and library fees. In these cases the GST will be a tax on a tax.</para><para>In some states—such as Victoria—the fire service levy will be hit by the GST and both of these will be hit by stamp duty. So in these states consumers will be hit by a triple tax—a tax on a tax on a tax. We know the property and insurance industries recently have reacted very angrily to the revelation that states propose to charge stamp duty on and after a GST basis—effectively a tax on a tax. I have with me an article from the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> of 26 October, which talks about the complexities for higher insurance premiums being paid by people.

It is about three things. Firstly, it is about a tax on a tax that is applying now. If you had listened to the question that came from my colleague Senator Mackay, you would have realised that she asked about a tax on a tax that is applying now, and she quoted Mr Rod Hill who said that the insurance industry is issuing notices daily and that people are paying those notices—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Right now.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—Right now. So we are talking about a tax on a tax that is applying now, particularly to insurance, and that in the near future will apply to property, even prior to 1 July next year. Secondly, there is no compensation for this tax whatsoever. And, thirdly, it was avoidable had this government foreseen the effect of the GST on state taxes. Those are the three points: it is a tax on a tax that is operating now; there is no compensation; and it was avoidable.</para></talk.start></continue><para>My colleagues who spoke before me, Senator Sherry and Senator Crossin, have clearly pointed out that this tax on a tax is applying throughout a number of states of Australia. It has a significant effect when it comes to notices that are being issued for taxation in the area of stamp duty. I will point out how that applies in a moment. It will apply to property progressively as time goes on. As contracts are entered into in the period prior to 1 July, the operators will be obliged to include in those contracts an element of GST which will attract stamp duty in those property dealings. Clearly the government has failed to deliver on its promise that there would be no tax on a tax. It has nothing to do with Labor Party policy; it is to do with the government's promise that there would be no tax on a tax.</para><para>There is no compensation either now or in the future for the tax on the tax—the tax on the tax that is happening this very day. There is no compensation whatsoever, neither now nor in the future. Any compensation packages were worked out prior to this becoming a problem for the government. So those people renewing their insurance policies now and paying the stamp duty on the GST will not be compensated for that in any way. Those people who enter into property deals prior to 1 July or post 1 July which attract stamp duty on their transactions will not have any compensation whatsoever. So we have a dilemma for people—from battlers to business people—that has not been addressed and was not even foreseen by this government.</para><para>A couple of examples bring clearly to mind what this is about. If you look at a home in Western Australia costing $141,000, the stamp duty on that will increase by $233 as 
 a result of the tax on the tax. If you look at an apartment in Sydney costing $350,000, that cost will increase by $787.50 as a result of the tax on the tax. Those amounts will not be compensated for by this government. Then if you look at the business end, the cost of an investment in a plant or factory worth $1.5 million in Newcastle will increase by $8,250. That is certainly not insignificant.</para><para>But it was avoidable, because the government had the opportunity to not have this mess occur in the first place. If there had not been the grubby deal between the Democrats and the government in the first instance, we would not have seen this happen. We would have seen a proper scrutiny of the legislation before this chamber, and issues such as this would have been picked up.</para><para>But the federal government will not accept responsibility. They want to put the blame now on the state governments. Of course, if there were no GST, this problem would not be in existence in the first place. It is because of the legislation of this government that the problem exists, and so they have got to face up to it and do something about it. They can take actions with the state government which can overcome the problem. But the problem exists today; and how to redress the problem is something that faces this government. There is a tax on a tax, and there is no compensation. The fact that it was avoidable and that the government failed to address it is totally their fault, and the blame lies with the government on this issue. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>10403</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Hogg finished by saying that this government should face up to its tax policies.

For ease of reference, in the following paragraphs the Committee's questions are presented in bold type, with detailed answers appearing immediately below.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">THE AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG AGENCY REGULATIONS 1999 (THE REGULATIONS)</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Drug Control Officials and Chaperones</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Regulations 8 and 9 allow for the appointment of, respectively, `drug control officials' and `chaperones'. Since, by virtue of subregulation 9(2), a drug control official is also a chaperone, and since neither need have any special qualifications or attributes, as they need only be a `person', it is difficult to see the reason for the two types of officials.</inline></para><para>The reason for two roles is separation of functions. A chaperone will accompany an athlete from the time of notification of a request to provide a sample to the point of provision of the sample, and will accompany the athlete throughout the collection process. This is to ensure security of the sample.</para><para>The drug control official (DCO) manages the overall sample collection process. The DCO is not in the company of the athlete at all times. It is, however, appropriate for the DCO to be able to perform the functions of the subordinate chaperone if called upon to do so.</para><para>This might occur if the chaperone is not the same sex as the athlete requested to provide the sample.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Personal interest</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Subregulations 12(1) and 13(2) seek to ensure that a person taking a sample from a competitor will report to the Australian Sports Drug Agency any personal interest in the collection of the 
 sample. Subregulations 12(2) and 13(3) nevertheless permit the Agency to allow the person taking the sample to continue with that task.</inline></para><para>A personal interest must be declared, but does not necessarily disqualify the person from being an Agency representative or an appointee of a sporting administration body. There is nothing unusual in this. The Agency or the body concerned must then decide whether the interest warrants withdrawing the person. Ultimately it is for the courts to decide if a wrong decision has been made (In this context and throughout this reply, `court' includes `tribunal'.)</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Conditions of service—persons appointed by a sporting administrative body</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Subregulation 13(2) requires the Agency to make sure that the conditions of service of persons appointed by a sporting administrative body contain particular terms. However, it is suggested that this provision may not fulfil its apparent purpose. There is no requirement, for instance, that the conditions of service must be immutable, and it is difficult to see how the Agency could monitor the conditions of service, at any particular time, of those appointed by other, outside, bodies.</inline></para><para>In this circumstance the Agency enters into a contract arrangement with the sporting administration body so the sporting administration body may collect samples from competitors on behalf of the Agency.</para><para>The contract will stipulate the obligations and responsibilities of the sporting administration body. This includes monitoring conflicts of interest relating to any person appointed by the sporting administration body to conduct and monitor the sample collection process.</para><para>If the Agency becomes aware that the sporting administration body is not fulfilling or has not fulfilled its obligations under the contract, the Agency will renegotiate or revoke the contract as may be appropriate in the circumstances. A clause of this type is included in contracts entered into by the Agency.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Discretion to use an interpreter</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Subregulations 18(2) and (3) give the Agency a discretion as to whether to communicate with a competitor through an interpreter. It might be thought that if a competitor is `unable to receive or understand [a] request' (see subregulation 18(2)), or is `unable to understand English' (see subregulation 18(3)), the Agency should be  required </inline> to make all reasonable efforts to ensure, by whatever means, that its request is understood.</para><para>This is an empowering provision, so that the request communicated by the interpreter is taken to be a request by the Agency. It is a matter of the 
 Agency's judgment whether the competitor understands the request. The review provisions apply if a competitor claims not to have understood, but the Agency thinks he or she did understand. However, the provision will be expanded to ensure that the Agency is required to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that its request is understood.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">By virtue of paragraph 65(2)(b) read with subregulation 65(3), the Chairman of the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee must convene a meeting of the Committee if he or she receives, among other things, an oral request therefor from the Agency. The Committee suggests that it would be conducive to better administration if such requests were required to be in writing.</inline></para><para>It is agreed that it is preferable for such requests to be in writing, but it is conceivable that circumstances may arise where time will not allow this. There is nothing in the legislation to prevent a written request being made.</para><para>A situation of urgency could arise, for example, where the determination of the validity of an analytical positive test result requires a scientific investigation protocol to be set by the ASDMAC. Such a circumstance is conceivable in an event testing context when positive test results need to be reported within 24-48 hours.</para><para>A written record of the request for the meeting from the Chief Executive Officer of ASDA would, of course, form part of the minutes of the meeting of ASDMAC.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Delegation of powers</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Regulation 80 permits the Agency to delegate `all or any of its powers' . . . except [this] power to delegate to, among others, a drug control official or a chaperone, and regulation 82 gives a drug control official a similar power to delegate to a chaperone. However, it is apparent that by virtue of the definitions of a drug control official and chaperone in regulation 3, there is no limit by reason of office or attribute on the persons who may be appointed to the position of drug control official or chaperone. The Committee suggests that these powers of delegation are too wide, and that delegations should, for instance, be limited to employees of the Agency.</inline></para><para>DCO's and chaperones are appointed by the Agency and are employees of the Agency. It is not possible to limit the class further because of the wide range of persons who may be employed to fill thee appointments.</para><para>A DCO needs to be able to delegate his or her powers to a chaperone if necessary for effective delivery of the Agency's services. For example, in some circumstances arising during the sample 
 collection process (say, if the DCO becomes unwell during the testing process) it may be necessary for the DCO to delegate some of his or her functions to a chaperone.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG AGENCY DRUG TESTING ORDERS</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Compliance</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Section 8 of the Orders provides that substantial, rather than strict, compliance with the provisions of these Orders will generally be sufficient. However, the Orders do not indicate who is to decide what constitutes substantial compliance.</inline></para><para>Subsection 17A(3) of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 </inline> (the Act) sets down the circumstances under which the Agency must strictly comply with procedures.</para><para>Apart from the matters mentioned in that subsection, the Act permits the regulations to provide for substantial compliance with procedures set out in the Scheme (subsection 17H(2)). What constitutes substantial compliance is to be decided by the courts which generally permit inconsequential deviations from procedures where the deviations will not affect the end result. `Substantial compliance' provisions can not be used to change the structure or policy of the law.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Collection of samples</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Subsection 10(2) of the Orders obliges a competitor to comply with `any instructions given by a chaperone during the sample collection process'. However, the subsection does not limit those instructions to such as may be reasonably required in the circumstances.</inline></para><para>If a competitor believes an instruction is unreasonable, he or she can apply for a review of any action taken by the Agency as a result of either compliance or failure to comply with the instruction. If the requirement is only to comply with `reasonable instructions', the competitor could arbitrarily decide that an instruction is unreasonable, and the Agency would then have to establish that it was reasonable. In the time available between request and provision of a sample, arbitration of this point may be impractical or even impossible. However, the orders will be altered to provide that the instruction must be relevant to the process.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Section 11 of the Orders gives to the drug control officer in charge of the collection of a urine sample a discretion as to the information which he or she may record on the drug testing form. It is difficult to see why this discretion should be available, and why the officer is not required to record certain information, and no other.</inline></para><para>This is an empowering provision. The requirement to complete the form is set out in section 30. While a drug control officer is empowered under section 
 11 to annotate the form relevantly, the competitor is given the opportunity to agree or disagree with the contents of the form under section 30.</para><para>The sort of annotation that is envisaged here includes descriptions of problems encountered during the sample collection process, annotations requested by a competitor concerned about, for example, medications he or she might have taken or the procedures adopted during the collection process.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Subsection 28(2) to (6) of the Orders list a number of matters which a competitor and a drug control officer must carry out, but then, in subsection 28(7), the drug control officer is given the discretion as to the instructions which may be given to the competitor. It is difficult to see why this subsection does not lay down a further mandatory requirement.</inline></para><para>Subsections 28(2) to (6) set down the procedures which must be followed if a sample proves to be sufficient. The discretionary nature of subsection 28(7) is important to leave open to the competitor the option of requesting assistance to seal the bottle (see subsection 28(8)).</para><para>Subsections 28(7) and 28(8) provide options for both the competitor and the DCO in dealing with a situation where a bottle continues to leak despite efforts to seal it properly. Using the discretionary power contained in subsection 28(7), the DCO may instruct the competitor to give an additional sample, or select another test kit, or the competitor, under subsection 28(8), may ask the DCO, or another person, to help seal the sample bottle. The provision will be amended to make it clearer that the outcome must be a valid sample in a secure bottle.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Both subsection 29(4) and 43(4) of the Orders appear anomalous. Subsections 29(3) and 43(3) provide that the respective subsections (4) apply if, for example, the pH of a sample is lower than 5 or higher than 7. But the relevant subsections (4) then require the drug control officer to deny the evidence that he or she has received, and treat the sample as if the pH were not lower than 5 or higher than 7.</inline></para><para>If the relative acidity (pH) of a sample is lower than 5 or higher than 7, or the sample's specific gravity is equal to or lower than 1.010, the sample is not necessarily unsuitable for analysis. A sample's pH and specific gravity are only preliminary indicators of its suitability for analysis.</para><para>A sample outside the prescribed limits of pH and specific gravity will still be sent to the laboratory for testing. The DCO, however, is given the discretion to instruct the competitor to give the Agency an additional sample. The additional sample is also tested for pH and specific gravity and is sent to the laboratory for analysis as well.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Subsection 49(2) of the orders deems `a courier in the normal course of business' to be a secure 
 means of transporting a sample to an accredited laboratory. However, neither the Act, the Regulations, nor the Orders provide a definition of such a courier. Also, if a drug control officer decides not to use such a courier, he or she is required to see to the transport of samples `by means which will ensure [their] safe arrival'. The section, however, does not provide for the means by which the officer is to fulfil this requirement.</inline></para><para>This is meant to link up with the prescribed courier services referred to in regulation 86. Section 49 of the orders should clearly state this. I undertake to amend the provision accordingly.</para><para>`Safe arrival' is a question of fact. The official could use a prescribed courier service, or other means that will achieve the required result. It would be otiose to spell out all the steps that would ensure safe arrival and it would not be possible to provide a conclusive list of appropriate circumstances in any event. A court could determine if the provisions of the Orders had not been followed in the particular circumstances of each case.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Subsection 51(2) of the Orders obliges a drug control officer to store samples overnight in `a secure place', but neither the Act, the Regulations nor the Orders apparently defines such a place.</inline></para><para>Whether a place is secure is a question of fact that will be determined by the courts if necessary.</para><para>If a competitor is concerned that a sample may have been tampered with, this may be raised in a review and the security of the place where the sample is kept ultimately becomes an issue for the court. (It should be noted that the containers in which samples are kept are required to be tamper-evident.)</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Testing of samples</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Section 57 of the Orders deals with the testing of part B of a sample, if the result of testing part A of the sample is positive. The section does not, however, indicate what an accredited laboratory is to do with part B of a sample if, either the test of part A is negative, or the Agency does not instruct the laboratory to test part B.</inline></para><para>If part A of a sample is negative or if the Agency does not give instruction to the laboratory to test part B, the testing process stops.</para><para>The accredited laboratory procedures state that if a test is completed on Part A of a sample and the result is negative, the laboratory is required to hold on to Part B of the sample for 30 days. In the case where a Part A of a sample tests positive, irrespective of whether the Agency instructs the laboratory to test Part B, the laboratory is required to hold Part B of the sample for 12 months. Appropriate provision can be made in the Regulations to outline 
 these practices.

Although such contracts are said to stipulate the obligations and responsibilities of such bodies, it is not apparent how the Agency would become aware that they are not fulfilling such contracts. Has the Agency developed practical mechanisms to handle a breach of such contracts?  You also advise that a clause is included concerning the renegotiation or revocation of such contracts in such circumstances.

This assessment is used to determine the suitability of the sporting administration body to conduct drug testing on the Agency's behalf. Another practical mechanism to monitor compliance exists in the form of the doping control session report. The Doping Control Official (DCO) in charge of the sample collection session prepares reports that describe issues arising during the session.

These decisions flow directly from Australia's involvement in East Timor. I also report to the House on the impressive progress made to date by the INTERFET multinational force in East Timor, so ably and effectively led by Australia. Furthermore, I will explain the details of a temporary revenue measure, for the next financial year only, to cover the unexpected costs of the military deployment by our nation in East Timor.</para><para>On 21 September, I advised parliament of the deployment of Australian troops as part of INTERFET, the multinational force mandated by the United Nations, to restore order in East Timor. I am pleased to report that, in the intervening two months, INTERFET has largely achieved the tasks the United Nations set it: to restore peace and security to East Timor, to protect the United Nations mission in East Timor and to facilitate humanitarian relief.</para><para>In this period also, East Timor's political status was settled. On 19 October, the People's Consultative Assembly in Indonesia agreed to the separation of East Timor from the republic of Indonesia, thus respecting the vote East Timor's people freely exercised in the United Nations ballot on 30 August. East Timor is now under the transitional authority of the United Nations until its full independence is achieved in two or three years time. The day after its decision on East Timor, the assembly elected Abdurrahman Wahid as President and Megawati Sukarnoputri as Vice-President. These steps underline the enormous distance Indonesia has travelled towards democracy over the past 12 months.</para><para>INTERFET's achievement of its mandate has been an outstanding success. It reflects very well indeed 
 on Australia's leadership, the international support the force has received, the good cooperation among contributing countries and, above all, the professionalism of the service men and women in the force. Soldiers, sailors and aircrew from 17 nations are working together effectively. The force now numbers over 9,900, including 4,400 from Australia's coalition partners.</para><para>Countries in Australia's region have made a strong contribution to INTERFET. The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea are participating. Thailand has provided the deputy commander, Major General Songkitti, and the second largest contingent of forces. The government is particularly grateful to the Prime Minister and the people of Thailand for their support. We thank Japan, which, unable to commit troops for constitutional reasons, is providing $US100 million to pay the cost of developing country contributors to INTERFET. China has been supportive throughout the UN process. New Zealand's contribution represents its largest deployment of forces abroad since World War II, and I would like to express my particular thanks to Mrs Shipley for the leadership she displayed.</para><para>Countries beyond the immediate region have also made a substantial contribution to INTERFET. The United States has provided capabilities which are essential to the mission's operations and would otherwise have been difficult to secure. Its ready support for Australia's leadership of INTERFET has underlined the effectiveness of the ANZUS alliance. We were grateful for the United Kingdom's prompt response in sending a company of combat troops and naval assets at the very beginning of the operation. Canada, Brazil, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway and Portugal have all made valuable contributions. Denmark, Egypt, Fiji, Jordan and Kenya have committed to send forces.</para><para>To date, INTERFET forces have sustained only two casualties. We were pleased and relieved that both these Australians are making a full recovery. There have also been six militia deaths and a number of militia casualties. This loss of life is regretted, but in each case the incidents did result from attacks on INTERFET. Since these events the security environment in East Timor has greatly improved. INTERFET has consolidated its control throughout the mandated area, including the Oecussi enclave. Dili is returning to normal life. More than half its displaced residents have returned, and work on rebuilding the city's shattered infrastructure has begun. The last Indonesian troops and officials left East Timor on 31 October.</para><para>INTERFET's success in providing security has provided the basis for achieving its second and third goals: protecting the UN mission and facilitating the provision of humanitarian assistance. 
 Humanitarian assistance is reaching all corners of East Timor, with greatly improved access for international relief agencies. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Red Cross, World Vision, CARE, Catholic Relief, UNICEF, UNHCR and others now have operations on the ground. This financial year, the government has provided an initial $14 million in humanitarian assistance to East and West Timor. And yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced a further $23 million in humanitarian assistance. INTERFET has created the conditions for hundreds of thousands of East Timorese to return home and to start to rebuild their lives. The United Nations estimates that more than 88,000 displaced East Timorese have now returned.</para><para>The government is still very concerned, however, about the plight of over 150,000 displaced East Timorese who remain in West Timor and are subject to intimidation by militia. The onset of the wet season makes their return home urgent. The government welcomes statements from the Indonesian government that militia groups are to be disarmed and removed from border areas, and that displaced East Timorese who wish to return are to be allowed to do so. Unfortunately, as yet this has only happened in some areas. The government will pursue this issue vigorously with the Indonesian government, the UN Secretary-General, other governments and the appropriate relief agencies.</para><para>With security largely restored, the immediate priorities remain humanitarian: the return of internally displaced people and the rebuilding of their lives in East Timor. East Timor and the United Nations must also now begin work on reconstruction, reconciliation and nation building. On 25 October, the UN Security Council passed resolution 1272, which establishes a United Nations Transitional Authority, UNTAET, to prepare East Timor for independence and provides for a UN peacekeeping operation to take over from INTERFET as soon as possible. It is essential that UNTAET moves quickly to set up effective political, economic and social structures and that UNTAET involves East Timorese as much as it can in its work. The government warmly welcomes the appointment of Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello as head of UNTAET and looks forward to working closely with him. We are now discussing with the United Nations an early transfer from INTERFET to the new UN peacekeeping force, to be managed in a way that fully maintains East Timor's security. We expect this will occur early next year. INTERFET's role will end once it hands over responsibility for security in East Timor to the United Nations.</para><para>I am sure both sides of the House, and indeed all Australians, will join me in warmly commending the force commander, Major General Cosgrove, and the Australian men and women serving with him in East Timor for the outstanding job they have 
 done on our behalf and on behalf of the United Nations.</para><para>All Australians were deeply distressed by the scenes of violence, death and destruction in East Timor that they witnessed daily after the results of the ballot were announced in early September. As I said in my address to the nation at the time, we sensed that a small, vulnerable community was about to be denied the freedom it had sought so long and that it had voted so overwhelmingly to achieve. Despite the pleas of the international community, the Indonesian government was unable to restore order and the United Nations authorised a multinational force to do so with the agreement of Indonesia.</para><para>Australia acted because it was the right thing that we help protect East Timorese from appalling violence and destruction and also because it was in Australia's national interest to restore stability in East Timor. The mission was dangerous and the risks to our men and women were high, but the Australian people gave it their strong support. It represents our largest military involvement for more than 30 years. The Australian troops in East Timor are doing a splendid job and all of us are rightly proud of every one of them. Australia's military involvement in East Timor will not end with INTERFET. We will make a substantial contribution to the follow-on UN peacekeeping operation—in the order of 1,500 troops.</para><para>Inevitably, such a commitment to East Timor has put added pressures on our Defence Force and the budget. In order to be sure that we can sustain our commitment to East Timor, the government has accepted a recommendation from the Minister for Defence, based on advice from the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary of Defence, to increase the number of fully operational infantry battalions in the Army from four to six for a period of two years. The Army's size will grow from 23,000 to 26,000. This increase is required to sustain Australia's involvement in the peacekeeping operation and to maintain acceptable levels of overall defence readiness.</para><para>Although the extra battalions have been raised to meet the immediate East Timor requirement, they could be needed on an ongoing basis. A decision will be taken on this in the context of the government's defence white paper next year. Air Force numbers will also be increased by about 500, to just over 13,500, to allow for additional combat support personnel and the raising of an extra airfield defence squadron.</para><para>The government estimates that the extra defence costs from the deployment of forces to East Timor, the raising of two new battalions and additional Air Force numbers will amount to $907 million in 1999-2000, the current financial year; $1.089 billion in the year 2000-01; and $901 million in 
 2001-02. After the transition from INTERFET to the UN peacekeeping operation, the United Nations will make some reimbursements. But these reimbursements will cover only a small portion of the costs of the deployment of Australian forces in East Timor and not the wider defence costs associated with that deployment.</para><para>Australia's support for East Timor goes wider than our involvement in peacekeeping and peace enforcement. The government will make available $60 million during the current financial year to cover additional aid needs for East Timor. Australia's aid commitment for 2000-01 will be considered in the coming year's budget process. Other additional costs in 1999-2000, the current financial year, relating to East Timor include assistance to evacuees from East Timor to Australia, $35 million, and deployment of Australian Federal Police and police from other jurisdictions as part of the United Nations civilian presence, $26 million. Attached to this statement is a table setting out these additional costs.</para><para>The government will present to parliament before the end of the year a special appropriation bill to cover the extra defence and aid expenses for the current financial year. The government's <inline font-style="italic">Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook</inline>  has now been compiled and will be released in full by the Treasurer shortly. We know, however, from the details to hand what the impact of the additional cost of the East Timor operation will be on the budget balance both for this and subsequent years.</para><para>The House will recall that I undertook some weeks ago to outline funding arrangements for the Timor operation when details of the mid-year economic outlook were available. This I am now doing. It is clear from these details that the cost of the East Timor deployment presents a particular difficulty in the next financial year commencing on 1 July 2000. At the time of the May budget the underlying cash budget surplus for 2000-01 was projected to be $3.1 billion. That figure has been significantly reduced by a number of developments.</para><para>The major additional item was the further costs to the budget of $1.8 billion in the coming financial year—that is, 2000-01—for revisions to the tax package that were negotiated with the Australian Democrats to secure its passage through the parliament. Other necessary policy decisions and adverse variations to estimates have imposed further costs to the budget. These additional costs, combined with the delay in receipts from the sale of the second tranche of Telstra, have also led to slower debt retirement and higher interest repayments on outstanding debt, costing about $500 million in 2000-01. In the absence of East Timor, all of these extra costs could properly have been absorbed within the projected budget surplus for 2000-01.  
</para><para>The defence expenditure relating to East Timor of about $1.1 billion in 2000-01, however, falls into a different category altogether. Such an extraordinary item of additional expenditure could not reasonably have been expected at budget time. Therefore a special provision must be made for its impact in the year 2000-01. The additional expenditure on the East Timor defence effort has a particularly severe impact in the next financial year. By contrast, in the current year and the year subsequent to 2000-01, even after East Timor costs have been allowed for, the budget is expected to remain in healthy surplus.</para><para>As a result of the extra costs since last May, and in particular the unexpected defence costs relating to East Timor of around $1.1 billion in the 2000-01 financial year, it is calculated that, without additional measures, the budget in that year—that is, the year commencing 1 July 2000—will record an underlying cash deficit of approximately $500 million. The government is not willing for this to occur. The days of budget deficits should remain firmly behind us. The economic consequences of high deficits, particularly the pressure they place on interest rates, should be unacceptable to all honourable members.</para><para>The government has decided therefore to introduce a temporary Defence-East Timor levy for 2000-01 only. This levy will be applied as an addition to the Medicare levy on the income of taxpayers earning above $50,000 a year.</para><para>The levy will be set at 0.5 per cent for taxpayers with an income of between $50,000 and $100,000, and at one per cent for taxpayers with incomes above $100,000 a year. There will be appropriate shade-ins to smooth the impact on taxpayers earning just above $50,000 and $100,000. The levy will apply only for a 12-month period from 1 July 2000, ending on 30 June 2001.</para><para>Applying the levy on incomes above $50,000 will protect low- and many middle-income earners. The levy will begin on the same date that tax cuts begin under the government's tax reform. It will reduce only slightly—and for only one year—the tax cuts that those taxpayers will receive. For example, a single taxpayer with an income of $60,000 a year will receive a tax cut of nearly $62 a week and the levy will reduce that for one year only by about $6 a week. With this approach, 80 per cent of all Australian taxpayers will receive their tax cuts in full from 1 July next year.</para><para>The levy will collect approximately $900 million in 2000-01. That sum will substantially cover the East Timor defence costs arising in that year. After 2000-01, the East Timor defence costs can be absorbed by the budget whilst maintaining strong surpluses. The community, I hope, will support this measure as a fair and reasonable one to help fund the bulk of our defence costs relating to East Timor 
 in 2000-01. The only alternative to this special and temporary levy would be further cuts in government spending.</para><para>Given the expenditure savings of earlier years, the necessary funds of approximately $1 billion could not have been obtained without paring back in essential areas of social expenditure, such as health, education and welfare for the needy. The government does not believe it would be fair to do this. The levy I have announced is the fair and decent way to deal with this unexpected budget difficulty in the next financial year. There will of course be other requirements for Defence that do not relate to our involvement in East Timor, such as completing the submarines and other procurement decisions. These will be considered in the normal budget process and in the context of next year's defence white paper.</para><para>Australians from all walks of life have responded sympathetically to the suffering of the East Timorese people, and I want to acknowledge the great willingness of so many individuals and organisations to help in different ways. In particular, Australian non-government organisations, including the churches, have played an important role. Australian business can also play a significant part. The government convened a meeting with business groups and aid agencies in response to the strong interest from the business community in helping with reconstruction. I warmly welcome the contributions already made or foreshadowed by the timber, construction, power and pharmaceutical industries. The Northern Territory government has also provided valuable help. Darwin will continue to serve as the principal logistics base for UNTAET in the period ahead.</para><para>East Timor's resources are limited. Now that it is entering the phase of reconstruction and nation building, it will need a great deal of international support. Australia will act generously, but we cannot carry the full burden alone. The government is encouraging others to make substantial</para><para>commitments. Even with international help, however, East Timor's future prosperity can ultimately be assured only by the East Timorese themselves. Only they can put in place the democratic, transparent and accountable political and economic institutions on which a viable state can be created.</para><para>I was therefore pleased with the approaches Mr Xanana Gusmao laid out in my meeting with him in October. He is realistic about the challenges that face East Timor. His commitment to pursuing reconciliation is encouraging, and we hope he will work closely with UNTAET. He understands the importance for East Timor's future of a good relationship with Indonesia. President Wahid's readiness to meet Mr Gusmao in order to lay sound foundations for the future is also to be particularly welcomed. Australia's own relationship with 
 Indonesia has been under some strain because of East Timor. Now that East Timor's status has been resolved, both sides can move on. Australia and Indonesia are neighbours, and it makes sense for us to cooperate closely. Australia has long been a good friend to Indonesia, and we gave it strong support during its recent economic crisis.</para><para>Indonesia has a new democratic government and an elected president who has a record of commitment to human rights and tolerance and to economic and political reform. Both countries have important interests in common. I am confident that on the basis of mutual respect both of us can build a mutually advantageous and pragmatic relationship.</para><para></para><para>Mr Speaker, let me conclude by again expressing on behalf of all Australians the immense pride we feel in the contribution of the serving men and women of our nation now in East Timor.

The caucus process has not been possible in this circumstance. But subject to that caveat, I would like to convey the opposition's support for the proposals in the statement.</para><para>We believe that the Prime Minister's statement is consistent with Labor's strong support for INTERFET, for the ADF and for the people of East Timor. The aspect of this particular statement which will attract the most attention is the Defence-East Timor levy. So I would like to deal with that matter 
 first. Again, subject to the processes of the caucus, I would like to indicate our in principle support for the levy. This is consistent with out view that our troops must have everything they need in this deployment and that there are real questions for our defence structure down the track. I might add that we could not have a better reminder of the need to ensure revenue neutrality in the business tax reforms and for ongoing attention to the offsetting arrangements for the GST package.</para><para>We think it appropriate that those most likely to benefit from this government's past and proposed tax reforms are those who it is intended will pay this levy. I note in passing that this levy would not be necessary had the government not spent $17 billion on its GST package—$6 billion of that in the year this levy will be introduced alone. But those are matters for just passing mention. The fact is that the opposition supports the levy in principle and we do so because we support our troops absolutely.</para><para>As we have made clear on very many occasions, we thoroughly support the INTERFET deployment in East Timor. We believe that the professionalism of the ADF has been amply demonstrated throughout this deployment. Some have questioned the capabilities of the ADF, but the truth is we are without question among the most professional and effective fighting forces in the world. We have always been at this level and we have proved it again in East Timor, and our forces deserve all the support that we can give them.</para><para>On reserves, we understand there is more detail to be provided, and we look forward to looking closely at it when it is forthcoming, but we would add a couple of points. Firstly, whatever is done on reserves, we would have been far better placed had this government not abolished the Ready Reserve upon coming to power. Secondly, whatever is done must take account of the issues we in the opposition have raised on numerous occasions, including two private members' bills that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has been associated with—that is, the protection of leave entitlements for reservists to undertake their reserve duties as an allowable matter in awards and the protection of civil 
 employment for those reservists who are called up for service.</para><para>We are pleased to see the government commit $60 million for aid to East Timor. We note that the $60 million might be a good start, but it cannot be the end of the story. There is no money committed above the existing very small aid program beyond 1999-2000, yet an enormous amount of work needs to be done in rebuilding infrastructure, in replacing the infrastructure funding previously provided to East Timor as a province and, of course, in humanitarian work for the people of East Timor.</para><para>Part of Australia's support should also be in the area of lending our expertise to the establishment of political and administrative institutions in East Timor—for example, legal experts, public service experts, economists, finance experts and the like. East Timor needs that sort of expertise. Australia has it, and we should stand ready to provide it wherever possible. There are always many people of decency and of goodwill who emerge in difficult times like these, but there are often some unscrupulous operators ready to take advantage. To the extent that we can help them avoid the latter, we should be there to do so as well.</para><para>There are, of course, diplomatic issues which extend beyond the scope of the Prime Minister's statement but which are no less important both to our deployment and to the future of East Timor, and I would just like to touch on those for a short time. The first point is that Australia should be very grateful for the support of the United States. We welcome the strong support of the United States in securing the diplomatic conditions for INTERFET's deployment in the first place and then in backing up that support with visits by the Secretary of Defence and, most recently, by Ambassador Holbrook. We could not want for a better contribution from our greatest ally since this deployment. The United States's strong diplomatic presence has been indispensable in securing a dangerous environment, and of course that goes for the people of East Timor and also for our own troops on the ground in East Timor.</para><para>But the further crucial question is the role of Indonesia in East Timor's future. We would echo the words of Richard Holbrook in saying that Indonesia's reputation in the international community will depend to a significant extent on its role in East Timor's security. The new Wahid government has, in our view, a magnificent opportunity to establish its international credentials. The immediate task is the disarming of the militias, currently in West Timor, to remove the external threat to the new state of East Timor. There must also be a role for Indonesia in the rebuilding of East Timor through material and political support.</para><para>There are many issues raised in this statement, and these are obviously going to be the subject of debate in days to come. Let me say clearly that we support, in principle, the proposals outlined by the Prime Minister as a useful contribution to our current troop deployment, to our future defence posture and, of course, to the future of East Timor.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>10421</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak briefly on the Prime Minister's statement relating to East Timor. I would like to say at the outset that we are very pleased to note that there will be no cuts to services in order to fund our commitments in East Timor. We note that an additional two battalions will be raised for our Army and also other Defence personnel will be recruited, and these costs will be met through revenue raising.</para></talk.start><para>I wish to put on the record the support of the Australian Democrats for those fundraising proposals and for both parts of this initiative—the government in their actions and the comments made by the Prime Minister. I would just like to look at some other parts of the statement. In particular, I note how pleased we are to see that we are part of a 17-nation force that is working in East Timor to secure peace in that country and to start assisting the citizens of East Timor get their lives back together again.</para><para>On behalf of the Democrats, I want to say how pleased we are with all that our force in INTERFET has achieved. We congratulate the men and women who are over there working so hard in the interests of the people of East 
 Timor. We note with pleasure that life in Dili is slowly returning to normal and that the markets are resuming. In some of the outlying villages, things are still a little slow to get back to anything like a normal way of life, but more and more of the displaced residents are returning and starting to get their shattered lives back together.</para><para>The biggest problem is that so many East Timorese still find themselves in West Timor. Despite the assurances of the Indonesian government and the variety of different promises, very little seems to be happening on a large scale. People on a regular basis are finding their way back into East Timor, and that is an issue we encourage the government to pursue vigorously to ensure that all those people who wish to return to East Timor can do so as a matter of urgency before the worst of the wet season is upon them. These people should be given the opportunity to get back to their homes and be in some reasonable level of restoration before the full wet season is on them.</para><para>There are a number of comments in the Prime Minister's statement relating to the substantial and tremendous effort of our troops, but he also said that this is a long-term commitment. Once the peace has been restored, we will be part of the long-term peacekeeping operation. It may be that that is required year after year after year in order to ensure that the people of East Timor can get their country back together again and resume their lives.</para><para>I note on page 8 of the Prime Minister's statement a reference to the arrangements that we made on the ANTS tax package and the cost to the budget of that. I point out that at that time we said to the government that the tax cuts for those on high incomes should be pared back even more. Effectively, we are now seeing that happen—not back to where we had recommended they go, but we are taxing those earning over $50,000 and taxing those earning over $100,000 at double that rate in order to fund these immediate commitments to East Timor. We wish to support the government in that and to say that this is certainly the fairest way we could have secured this amount of money.</para><para>However, I do wish to point out that the table at the back which looks at expenditure through 1999-2000 out to 2002-03 does not include an amount for aid beyond this year. That hole is going to have to be filled. In an earlier part of the statement, the Prime Minister noted that and said that we will be told what that amount is, but we can only wonder where that amount of money is going to be found. Nowhere is there any mention of our direct support for the rebuilding and for the actual infrastructure that needs to be put back in place in East Timor.</para><para>Also, there is no ongoing funding for the civilian police force, for the role of the United Nations and for our support of the administrative part of the UN's role in East Timor. I do point out that, while we have raised this amount of money through the Medicare levy being increased for only 12 months, there may be a need to look in the future at an ongoing stream of finance for our long-term commitment to East Timor.</para><para>We have been arguing throughout the debate on business tax that there would be pressures on the budget bottom line as a result of our commitment to East Timor and that we have to be doubly certain we are not going to leave the budget under further stress because of the decisions we make on business tax. There has been a specific amount identified in the small section on the personal aspect of capital gains tax within the business package, and that in itself is at least another $400 million a year.</para><para>So while we have welcomed this statement and it has taken some pressure off the debate of where business tax is going, it certainly has not reduced our commitment to making sure that the business tax package is revenue neutral. There simply is no fat left to trim off any of our social programs—not off our schools, our hospitals, our universities or any of our environment programs. There is nothing spare left. After the first two Costello budgets, we have argued all along that there was far too much cut from government expenditure.</para><para>We will be continuing to push for substantial aid for East Timor so as to fill those gaps in the chart that has been provided to us 
 today. If we look at the fact that the government is using an unusual device of asking the Reserve Bank to defer some $600 million of its dividends payments until next year, we believe the budget is still under incredible pressure and could still be heading for a deficit.</para><para>I will close there and simply state again that the Democrats fully support the government's decision not to touch services but to raise the money through an additional Medicare levy. I congratulate all of those who are working so well in East Timor to give that country a future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>10422</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also support the Australian contingent and all the people involved in establishing the East Timorese nation to our immediate north. I am happy to pay the Timor tax. As a parliamentarian I am receiving an income of more than $80,000 a year. I am very supportive of the fact that this is aimed at high income earners, who can afford to be contributing towards the Australian presence in East Timor as it moves towards being our newest fully independent national neighbour.</para></talk.start><para>That said, I am also very aware that the $900 million that is involved here is the same figure that the Treasurer said before the 1996 elections would be coming from high wealth individuals who do not pay their tax, who avoid tax one way or another. The government has not been able to recoup that $900 million. Were it able to, we would be able to support this East Timorese presence through people defaulting on taxes in this country—people who still need to be pursued and who ought to be paying their taxes. I am also very aware that half the multinational corporations in this country pay no tax at all. That is a matter that needs rectification. </para><para>However, the thrust of the Prime Minister's statement is towards the East Timorese, to give them assurance that Australia is with them. I note that it is also towards mending relationships with Indonesia. This is going to be a difficult matter. It is going to require maturity in Jakarta as well as in Canberra. It is not, in my books, a case for turning our back on the people seeking self-determination in Aceh and in West Papua in particular. 
 These issues will not be resolved and the aspirations of those people will not be resolved by us saying that East Timor is the end of it. Putting to right, after such a horrible history over the last 25 years, the East Timorese situation does not enable us to turn our back on the rest.</para><para>I hope that the government will be learning from Australia's sorry history in regard to East Timor when it comes to the other inherent nations such as Aceh and West Papua and their right to have their day in the sun. That said, I again give my support to this way of raising the necessary money to ensure Australia's commitment to East Timor stays strong, firm and friendly to all concerned.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>LEAVE OF ABSENCE</title><type>Leave of Absence</type><page.no>10423</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><para>That leave of absence be granted to Senator Forshaw for the period 22 to 25 November 1999 inclusive, on account of parliamentary business overseas, and to Senator Murphy for the period 22 November to 30 November 1999 inclusive.</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>10423</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Postponements</title><page.no>10423</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>General business notice of motion No. 372 standing in the name of Senator Brown for today, relating to the World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle, postponed till 24 November 1999.</para><para>General business notice of motion No. 370 standing in the name of Senator Stott Despoja for today, relating to the establishment of a Select Committee on the Regulation and Promotion of biotechnology, postponed till 30 November 1999.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>10423</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stott Despoja</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the Senate—</para><para>(a)	 notes that:</para><para>	 (i)	 21 October 1999 is a staff and student national day of action, and</para><para>	 (ii)	 the national day of action is a response to proposals by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) to turn the higher education sector into a demand-driven system with the possible abolition of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, the introduction of a real

</para><para>This is an extremely important matter. If there is one part of the Indonesian empire that is closer to Australia than East Timor it is West Papua. In West Papua there are nearly two million people who aspire to their freedom. The latest news reports point to 1 December, which is, in effect, independence day for West Papuans, being marked by the raising of the Morning Star flag of the West Papuans.</para><para>The chamber might remember me asking for assurances from the Australian government last year as we approached that anniversary that this nation would be doing everything it could to help protect West Papuans against Indonesian military brutality following the Biak massacre last year where anything between 20 and 120 people were machine-gunned effectively after they had raised the Morning Star flag in Biak. That monumental day for the West Papuans is coming again. Let me read from an AAP overseas news report of Monday. It says:</para><para>The Morning Star flag was raised last week in the grounds of the Three Kings Catholic Church in Timika, on the central south coast of Indonesia's easternmost province—</para><para>that is West Papua—</para><para>It was still flying after several days, a situation unheard of in the past, even under the more liberal tenure of the third Indonesian president BJ Habibie.</para><para>When the Morning Star was hoisted in Biak, in 1998, less than two months after Habibie took over from long-serving president Suharto, troops opened fired in an incident that has been reported as a massacre by church investigators.</para><para>Among other new independence groups is the National Council of West Papua . . . , set up by traditional leaders whose head, Theys Eluai, is called the Father of West Papua.</para><para>The group's primary aim is getting the independence message out to Europe, the Pacific and Asia.</para><para>This council acted as a sort of alternative parliament to prepare for independence, Theys said.</para><para>But he admitted that the OPM—</para><para>the Free West Papua movement—</para><para>was not involved.</para><para>"Our struggle is a diplomatic one, not a military one," Theys told AAP.</para><para>"We haven't talked with the OPM, but we have similar objectives for independence." 
</para><para>Theys said some students also supported the council.</para><para>I also want to refer to the article by Anthony Balmain in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>  and the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>  on 26 August this year which pointed out:</para><para>As East Timor prepares to vote in a United Nations ballot on its future, previously secret documents show Australia played a leading behind-the-scenes role to ensure Irian Jaya—</para><para>that is, West Papua—</para><para>became a part of Indonesia in another UN-supervised vote—the so-called Act of Free Choice in 1969.</para><para>The article goes on to show what a sham that act was, with only 1,025 people voting out of 800,000. No women were involved in that vote. Those who did vote were very clearly under coercion. Yet the rest of the world turned its back on West Papua, and Australia did so knowingly.

 1996 ON  AUSTRALIA'S VISA SYSTEM FOR VISITORS </inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Introduction</inline></para><para>The Joint Standing Committee on Migration (JSCM) Report on  Australia's Visa System for Visitors  contains thirty-five recommendations about the visa system then in operation and covers the streamlining initiatives (such as the Electronic Travel Authority [ETA]) being foreshadowed at the time this report was released, many of which have since been implemented.</para><para>The major debate during the inquiry was whether streamlining visitor entry processes had gone far enough, balanced against concerns about whether the processes for screening visitors were able to provide sufficient protection. There was little objective evidence available about the likely impact of introducing visa free arrangements. The Committee concluded that the changes being introduced including agency arrangements and the ETA were steps in the right direction which should be assessed before any further decisions about visa free travel. The Government agrees that these steps have proven to be beneficial but it is still too early to make a full assessment of them. The recent JSCM <inline font-style="italic">Inquiry into the Immigration Entry Arrangements for the Olympic and Paralympic Games </inline> has provided more recent information about Australia's visa arrangements.</para><para>The Committee recommended the collection of additional data on visitors to Australia and comparable data from overseas countries. The Government accepts the need for useful data on visitors but notes the complexity of collecting some of this data and the need to take account of privacy issues. DIMA will continue to collect data, taking into consideration useability, cost and privacy.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Summary of DIMA progress against the recommendations</inline></para><para>Considerable progress has been made against a number of the recommendations of the Report:</para><para>a)	 The implementation of a number of streamlined visa issuance processes is well advanced. As at 1 November 1999:</para><para>.	 The ETA is available to passport holders from 31 countries and locations. 70 airlines are participating in the ETA system [ETAS] and access to the system is also provided to thousands of travel agents world wide through their subscription to participating computer reservation systems;</para><para>	 -	 over 5 million ETAs have been issued since the system was introduced in Singapore in September 1996;</para><para>	 -	 the Australian National Audit Office has conducted a Performance Audit of the Electronic Travel Authority. The report 
 dated 22 July 1999 was favourable in its assessment of the ETA system.</para><para>.	 The Governments of the USA, Canada, France, Spain, Japan and the Republic of Korea have recognised the ETA as equivalent to visa-free travel and, in return, no longer require Australian visitors to hold visas for short-term travel to those destinations.</para><para>.	 Prior to the implementation of the ETA accessibility to the visa process for short-term travellers was increased through the establishment of agency arrangements. At the peak of agency arrangement expansion in 1995/96, arrangements were operating in thirty-two countries with over 300 agents participating;</para><para>	 -	 generally these arrangements have been phased out in countries where the ETA has been launched but they continue to operate in a number of places where the ETA is not implemented.</para><para>.	 The Nominated Temporary Business Entry (NTBE) scheme commenced in July 1995. It is a niche program which supports business visits by persons well known and important to Australian business interests, particularly in terms of trade and investment. The scheme operates on the principle of partnership (with Government and other key agencies) in facilitating, at the Australia end, the entry of genuine business people who have been nominated by approved organisations. The approved organisations include SOCOG.</para><para>.	 After a successful evaluation of its trial phase, the APEC Business Travel Card scheme has been operating on a permanent basis since 1 March 1999. Australia, Chile, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea and the Philippines currently participate in the scheme. New Zealand and Malaysia joined the scheme this year and will soon become operational. Seven out of the 21 APEC economies are now participating in the scheme.</para><para>.	 Advance Passenger Information (API) has been identified as a significant strategy for the smooth handling of Australia's entry and border procedures up to and beyond the 2000 Olympic Games and for strengthening border control. API incorporates passenger pre-clearance, accelerated immigration and customs passenger processing and enhanced border control for all border agencies.</para><para>.	 The Advance Passenger Clearance (APC) system was implemented with Qantas in February 1994 and with Ansett in October 1996.</para><para>.	 DIMA's new platform for API is the Advance Passenger Processing system (APP) which 
 interfaces with the Electronic Travel Authority system;</para><para>	 -	 APP is a fast passenger processing system that provides border agencies with advance notice of the arrival of a passenger on a particular flight;</para><para>	 -	 the APP system was implemented for incoming passengers from Singapore by Singapore Airlines on 8 July 1998 and introduced by Air New Zealand on 27 April 1999;</para><para>	 -	 DIMA and the Australian Customs Service are actively encouraging other airlines to introduce APP.</para><para>b)	 The Movement Alert List (MAL) system is constantly being improved to optimise the Commonwealth's ability to achieve broad national security and law enforcement objectives. Recent emphasis has been given to the improvement of the functionality of MAL to effectively improve the quality of data on MAL.</para><para>c)	 In line with the Report's recommendations, amendments to the <inline font-style="italic">Migration Regulations</inline>  have modified public interest criterion 4011 to allow the risk factor profile data to be regularly updated and broadened, if necessary, without the requirement of having to make a regulatory amendment on each occasion. The mechanism for introducing updated risk profile data is now by <inline font-style="italic">Gazette </inline> Notice. The most recent <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>  Notice no. 21, dated 26 May 1999, which was issued following a review of recent visitor risk profile data, presented an expanded list of countries now considered to be high risk. In addition, character and removal provisions are being strengthened.</para><para>d)	 Four Regional Training Units (Bangkok, Hong Kong, London and Washington) operate to identify training needs in their respective Region, plan training activities accordingly, liaise with other posts/Central Office/States and Territories on training issues as they arise, co-ordinate and provide general and program specific training to Australian based and locally engaged staff.</para><para>e)	 All posts have been provided with Guidelines on Ensuring Integrity in Decision-Making which cover the issue of delegations for locally engaged staff. Posts also perform four-monthly audit and security checks, which include checks of decision-making protocols. Prior to being posted overseas, and at annual migration officers' conferences, departmental officers are briefed on integrity issues. 
</para><para>f)	 A Client Reference Group has been established which brings together relevant government agencies, key travel industry representatives and tourism umbrella groups for an exchange of ideas on current issues and provides an opportunity for ongoing review of initiatives and strategies relating to visitor entry. The group meets on a quarterly basis.</para><para>g)	 New incoming and outgoing passenger cards were introduced on 1 July 1998. The new incoming document replaced the previous Incoming Passenger Card and the Travellers Statement. The introduction of the new cards has contributed to significant improvement in passenger processing times at airports by simplifying processing.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Accounts and Audit Committee</title><page.no>10427</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>10427</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>10427</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also present the government's response to report No. 369 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit on its inquiry into Australian government procurement.

Wearing my hat as the Democrats' spokesperson on Attorney-General's matters, I am pleased to present on behalf of the Australian Democrats a speech on the second reading of the Federal Magistrates Bill 1999.</para></talk.start><para>This parliament has created comparatively fewer courts than those created by the states. One reason for this is that, even today, the largest amount of legal work for Australian citizens is presided over by state and territory courts exercising their own jurisdiction and not that of the Commonwealth. For the Australian Democrats, the establishment of a new court must be seen in the context of why we even have courts in the first place. On this point, some of the learned scholars of the past are instructive for how the Australian Democrats see this latest initiative by the government.</para><para>As far back as 1748, well before the arrival of white people's law in this country, Montisesquieu had the following to say on the separation of powers:</para><para>There is no liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and the executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and oppression. There would be an end to everything were the same man or the same body, whether of the nobles or of the people, to exercise those three powers, that of 
 enacting laws, that of executing the public resolutions, and of trying the causes of individuals.</para><para>More recently, in 1981, former High Court Justice and former Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, said the following:</para><para>But within its own modest limits judicial independence conduces to the free society and it is within those limits that I confine myself tonight. If judicial independence is in itself far from a complete protection against absolutism in government it is nevertheless a sure touchstone of freedom under the law; where it exists absolutism  has not yet established itself, and where it is absent absolutism is likely to have free reign.</para><para>It is therefore with some concern that the Democrats have viewed the agenda of the minister for immigration in curtailing judicial review within his portfolio. One wonders if even the jurisdiction of the High Court would be safe from the minister for immigration should he deem it necessary to curtail the civil liberties of people within our shorelines.</para><para>However, to the extent that this bill furthers access to justice, it is a welcome development. Unfortunately, with the present cuts to legal aid, access to justice has become a term of endearment rather than a benchmark of Australian democracy. All the courts in the world cannot create justice if those people who need it the most cannot cross the threshold because of the costs associated with access to that justice.</para><para>In analysing the debates and issues related to this to date, the Australian Democrats will be supporting this bill but, additionally, will be supporting the bulk of the amendments proposed by the Australian Labor Party, in particular those relating to industrial relations. We Democrats have no particular concern with the creation of a new Federal Court structure and are perfectly accommodating of the notion and happy to facilitate support for greater access and equity within such a structure, particularly to the extent to which it might facilitate or take some of the stress off our existing Family Court. That concludes my remarks on this point. Thank you.</para><para>(Quorum formed)</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>10431</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I would like to thank all honourable senators for contributing to the 
 debate on this important legislation. There are just a few points that need to be made. One relates to how the Federal Magistrates Service will help ease delays in the family law system. It will do that by easing the workload of the court, since it will be able to deal with many matters which judges currently deal with as well as those matters which can currently be dealt with by registrars. Because the federal magistrates will be able to make final orders and hear matters more quickly, there should be less need for interim applications and hence less need for parties to appear so frequently before the court.</para></talk.start><para>The service is an efficient use of Commonwealth funds. It will have very close links with the existing federal courts and will share many of those courts' facilities. In that way, duplication can be avoided and the best use will be made of all available resources. That strategy will minimise both the set-up and ongoing costs of the service. Both courts have been cooperating with the Attorney-General's Department in planning how that will actually work in practice.</para><para>The question has been raised: why not appoint magistrates to the existing Federal and Family Courts? In respect of that matter, the government is of the view that it is essential that federal magistrates be appointed to a separate court. The service will develop a new culture with an emphasis on user-friendly streamlined procedures. They will facilitate access by unrepresented litigants and minimise technicalities and delays. The new culture cannot be achieved by appointing magistrates to the existing federal courts and incorporating them in their cultures. That view is supported by the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, who considers that the establishment of a new and separate court is essential to enable a different culture and new practices to be developed which are appropriate for dealing with smaller and less complex matters.</para><para>Senator McKiernan raised the issue of whether it is appropriate to have part-time federal magistrates, querying whether part-time appointments would be unconstitutional or cause problems with conflicts of interest. The provision has been drafted to minimise 
 any risk of appointments being held to be unconstitutional and has been the subject of careful consideration and advice. I note the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee obtained the opinion of Professor George Williams on the issue. He advised the committee in September that it seems unlikely that chapter III of the Constitution would prevent those appointments. Individual federal magistrates would not be appointed where conflicts of interest were likely to arise. The magistrates will not be permitted to practise as lawyers, which will assist in minimising any conflict of interest they may have.</para><para>The bill also makes it clear that the doctrine of constitutional incompatibility developed by the High Court will still apply to such activities, as it currently does to High Court, Federal Court and Family Court judges. The Law Council of Australia initially had reservations about part-time magistrates. However, I note that the Law Council now supports the provisions of the bill which deal with those matters and considers that the issue of potential conflicts of interest is adequately addressed in the bill.</para><para>As to workplace relations and the jurisdiction, Senators Bolkus, Ludwig, Cooney, Collins and McKiernan made comments about the court's jurisdiction under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. There will be more to say about that when we reach the opposition's proposed amendments, but at this point I should say that this jurisdiction will be concurrent with that of the Federal Court so that more complex matters will continue to be dealt with in a superior court.</para><para>Finally, the establishment of the new Federal Magistrates Service is an important step towards ensuring suitable access to the justice system for all Australians. I thank honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on these matters.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>10432</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicated during my second reading speech that I would be moving a second reading amendment.

Nevertheless, there is a possibility that the High Court could find that the effect of section 73 of the Constitution is that appeals must be directly available to the High Court from a decision of any Federal Court without first being channelled through a superior court. In this event, amendment (2) would ensure that appeals could only be brought directly from the Federal Magistrates Court to the High Court if the High Court granted special leave to do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>10434</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister will know that the opposition, particularly in respect of appeals between courts, will be moving amendments (1) and (3) to (8).

The effect of opposition amendment (1) would be to allow appeals from decisions of the Federal Magistrates Service as to whether a proceeding should be heard in one court or another. The government does not consider that time and resources should be spent on appeals about decisions of this nature. Each court will have similar powers to make appropriate orders as necessary for the proper disposition of the proceedings before it. A right to appeal in these circumstances would simply increase costs and delay for litigants. The government is opposed to this because that is exactly what we are trying to fix in relation to introducing a Federal Magistrates Service.</para></talk.start><para>The government also opposes opposition amendments (3) to (8). These amendments would allow the Family Court and Federal Court to order that a proceeding be transferred from the Federal Magistrates Service to the superior court. That would lead to the danger of litigants attempting to manipulate, to their own advantage, the venue in which the proceedings are conducted. It could be used as a tactic by litigants to force their underresourced opponents into a more expensive superior court. The government considers that it should be up to each court to decide for itself whether to transfer proceedings to another court.

If you get into the courts and see how they work, you may find that they work very differently from the sorts of scenarios that are painted within the various offices around the place. The Magistrates Court deals with issues of fact.

In relation to amendment No. 10, clause 45 provides that interrogatories and discovery are not allowed unless the Federal Magistrates Service declares it is appropriate in the interests of the administration of justice. The court must consider they would be likely to contribute to the fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings. It is clear that this clause does not prevent discovery and interrogatories being used; it merely provides that leave of the Federal Magistrates Service is needed before they can be used. The ALRC has found that interlocutory proceedings such 
 as discovery and interrogatories are sometimes used by lawyers as a delaying tactic or to run up legal costs. This clause will assist in reducing costs for litigants and will prevent litigants imposing unnecessary costs on other parties. It will be up to the court itself to determine how this clause operates in practice through its rules.</para></talk.start><para>We also oppose amendment No. 11. Clause 46 provides that subpoenas cannot be issued without the leave of the Federal Magistrates Service. The court has to be satisfied there that it is in the same interests of the administration of justice. The rationale for this provision is just the same as that for limiting discovery and interrogatories: the ALRC has found that subpoenas can be misused. This clause will assist in reducing unnecessary costs incurred by both parties and, more often, non-parties in complying with the onerous subpoenas. That is often a real problem in the federal and family courts at the moment. Clause 46 will allow the Federal Magistrates Service to better control the use of subpoenas, and for that reason we oppose the opposition amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>10438</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We concur with the arguments presented by the opposition on amendments Nos 10 and 11 and thus support them.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the negative.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>10438</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government has circulated a set of amendments, and we have gone through a couple of them so far.

It is particularly important that part-time magistrates exist in Australian society within this jurisdiction, because I believe that it does greatly benefit particularly women, and is reflective of the changing nature of the work force in Australia and of the way that Australian society is changing. I do not see that having part-time magistrates undervalues, as Senator Bolkus suggests, or detracts from the integrity of the proposed magistracies.

 ty in dispute exceeds $300,000 or such other amount as is set by regulation. These amendments provide an exception to this rule where both  parties consent to the matter remaining before the Federal Magistrates Service.</para><para> As the consequential amendments bill is currently drafted, the determination as to whether the proceedings should be transferred is only made at the commencement of proceedings. Frequently, the value of property will not be known or may not be disclosed until midway through the case. Accordingly, in such circumstances, neither the Federal Magistrates Court nor the parties are going to be in a position to make an informed decision at the commencement of proceedings as to whether the matter should in fact remain with the Federal Magistrates Court. The amendments that we are proposing allow the court and the parties to make that decision at the time it becomes known that the value of the property may exceed $300,000.</para><para> Amendment No. 2 amends the proposed section 45A to make it clear that an initial determination of the value of the property should  be made at the time proceedings are commenced. Amendment No. 3 provides the mechanism for the matter to be reconsidered if at any time during the proceedings the value exceeds $300,000. Amendments Nos. 4 to 7 are consequential to the above two substantive changes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>10441</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government opposes these amendments. The service will be obliged to transfer family law property proceedings to the Family Court where, when the proceeding is filed, the property in dispute is worth more than $300,000. These amendments would mandate the transfer of family law property matters during the conduct of proceedings if it became apparent during the proceeding that the value of property in dispute was worth more than $300,000. The government considers that the most appropriate time to look at the value of the property is when the proceeding is filed; otherwise, parties could make transfer applications halfway through the proceeding, and this could be yet again another delaying 
 tactic used by the strong to disadvantage the weak and, of course, would be disruptive.</para></talk.start><para>Under the arrangements currently in the bill, if there is a possibility that the value of the property is more than $300,000 at the start of proceedings, the Federal Magistrates Service can simply  transfer them to the Family Court. That would avoid too much time being spent hearing argument about the value of the property. Additionally, in any event, if a property did increase significantly in value during the proceedings, the Federal Magistrates Service could use its general transfer power to transfer the proceedings to the Family Court if it considered it appropriate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>10442</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats are of the same view as the opposition in this case for the reasons articulated by Senator Bolkus and thus support amendments Nos 2 to 7.</para></talk.start><para>Amendments agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Sherry)</name></talker><para>—The question now is that schedule 25 stand as printed.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>10442</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think No. 11 is now probably the last amendment before us on this legislation. This amendment will delete schedule 25 of the <inline ref="r853">Federal Magistrates (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999</inline> . Schedule 25 provides for the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. It is very strongly our view that the government is inappropriately seeking to give jurisdiction to hear matters under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to the Magistrates Court. The jurisdiction includes: (1) injunctive powers to stop or prevent industrial action under section 127, items 1 to 6 of schedule 25 of the bill; and (2) the power to cancel the registration of an organisation for breach of the freedom of association provisions which, if passed, would include the additional anti-union provisions and the workplace relations amendment bill, cynically called the <inline ref="r894">Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>These are, it has to be said, notoriously complex areas of law, which we believe are 
 totally inappropriate for determination at a magistrate's level. For example, the provisions allowing the court to issue injunctions under section 127 would have permitted the Federal Magistrates Court to hear much of the waterfront dispute—a dispute which was of national, if not international, significance. You do not get matters much bigger than that. To be in the situation now where the government are trying to flick that jurisdiction off to, in their own words, an `inferior court' is something which we find totally unacceptable. In a sense, it would probably be an abdication of responsibility by this parliament were we to allow such matters to be referred to the inferior court's jurisdiction.</para><para>Of course, it has to be recognised that the government's proposals are consistent with its desire to prevent the Federal Court from examining such important issues. Increasingly, what the government has found is that the Federal Court, by construing domestic law according to international standards, has become a major problem for the implementation of the government's radical industrial relations reforms but, more importantly, it is acting in defence of the rights of people working in the Australian community.</para><para>Item 33 of schedule 2 of the consequential amendments bill provides for the referral of matters, including questions of law, to the full court of the Federal Court for determination. Item 14 provides for representation before the Federal Magistrates Court in industrial matters. Items 15 to 21 relate to the power of parties and the minister to intervene in proceedings before the Federal Magistrates Court. While some of these provisions may have an unobjectionable element to them, they are consequential on the granting of the jurisdiction that I previously referred to; the granting of jurisdiction which, as I said, we are very strongly against.</para><para>Finally, it has to be noted that the government is coming to this particular provision with a degree of bad faith in the granting of jurisdiction, because one thing it does fail to do is to give the court jurisdiction for unfair dismissal cases arising under division 3 of the Workplace Relations Act. These cases are generally of a small claims nature, suitable 
 indeed for determination by a magistrate. However, the government's proposals leave in place the arrangements that see these matters determined principally by judicial registrars of the Federal Court, leaving those cases subject to a second tier of merits review by a judge.</para><para>Basically, for the reasons I have already expressed, we do not think the government comes to this in good faith. We also think the government comes to this particular debate with a degree of cynicism and with a very pernicious hidden agenda to try to refer these matters away from a court which the government does not like because it is acting, probably in the eyes of the government, in a way that defends the rights of workers too strenuously. It is an agenda that we do not want to endorse and, as a consequence, we move this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>10443</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government opposes this amendment.

Federal magistrates may transfer proceedings on their initiative or, after reaching an independent decision on this issue, upon the application of a party. This will ensure that proceedings are dealt with in the most appropriate forum.

Generally we have our prepared positions and there is no point in pretending that we make up our mind at the last minute.

So why then would you need to support this amendment? If you leave it as it is, you will allow litigants to choose to go to the federal magistracy if they want to. A party to that can make a application to the magistrate to say, `Look, this is a mistake; this should go to the Federal Court.' So no party is denied a hearing on that issue. The Federal Court itself can say, `We want to bring this matter up,' because of support that you have given to opposition amendments.</para></talk.start><para>What I am trying to say is that the situation has changed from when we first came in here, by virtue of your supporting Senator Bolkus's amendments.

</para><para>This amendment places a member of the Australian Conservation Foundation on the council that is being established. I think this is acceptable to the Labor Party. It follows part (c) in the `Constitution of Council', which would have `two persons nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions', and it is more specific than the standing part (d), which says:</para><para>. . . a person representing persons having an interest in the protection of forest environments and ecosystems—</para><para>I am sure Senator Bolkus would agree with me that that would leave the way open for the government to appoint anybody at all under the elastic definition of the environment and ecosystems which the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, has and which includes anything and everything.</para><para>It is important that we be specific and that we not have somebody from the woodchip corporations—who I think will dominate this council anyway—representing forest environments and ecosystems. As I have said so many times before in this debate, the woodchip corporations which run the forest industry in Australia—and there are only a handful of them—are in the business of wreaking havoc in Australia's unprotected, grand wild forests. They are in the process of logging those forests. In Tasmania and also on parts of the mainland where those forests are logged, 90 per cent of them do not go to sawmills, do not go to downstream processing and do not go to creating more jobs in Australia; they go to the woodchip mills to line the pockets of companies like Bunnings, North and the other corporations involved in woodchipping.</para><para>It is very important, if this council is going to have any validity at all and not simply be a taxpayer funded cipher to the logging industry, that it at least have a voice for the environment that is recognised as such. That is why I have put forward this amendment in specific terms.</para><para>The Australian conservation movement represents 80 per cent of public feeling in this matter. I am being conservative when it comes to Western Australia, but that is what the opinion polls show as the proportion of 
 Australians who do not want the continued destruction of our grand wild forests and their wildlife by the woodchip industry. So if they are going to be represented adequately, they need to have faith in that representation, even though it will be but a voice on this council. It will not be able to affect outcomes. My amendment, which says that `a person nominated by the Australian Conservation Foundation' be on the council, would fulfil that democratic role.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>10449</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition does support Senator Brown's amendment, which would in essence put on the council a person nominated by the Australian Conservation Foundation.

Let me speak briefly to both of those appointments.</para><para>Firstly, in Tasmania, from where two-thirds of the woodchips exported out of this country emanate, the cry has always been that the forests are there for jobs. We have seen that as the rate of woodchipping increases the number of jobs has fallen—in fact it has fallen by more than 5,000 since the woodchip industry began in Tasmania. This has been matched by an increase in jobs in the tourism and service industries by people wanting to come and see the forests. This is a very real use of the forest resource. It is particularly vital in Tasmania where, as senators will know, the unemployment problem is worse than in other parts of Australia.</para><para>The tourism industry in Tasmania supports more than 18,000 jobs; the logging industry in native forests supports 2,000 jobs. When you look at that component of the tourism industry that depends on wild forests, you find that it is 3,000 jobs. So already in Tasmania there are more jobs in the tourist and service industries dependent on natural forest being protected than there are dependent on the woodchip and associated industries which are involved in destroying that same resource.</para><para>You cannot have it both ways. You cannot log a resource and expect tourists to go there. Other people who live in Tasmania will corroborate my experience that, while visitors proclaim the beauty of Tasmania, they are universal in their condemnation of the ugliness of the woodchip industry and the destruction which it occasions all over the state, not just in state forests, publicly owned forests, but increasingly in private forests where the destruction of the rural landscape and even the urban visual amenity has become unprecedented in Australian history since Prime Minister Howard and then Liberal Premier Mr Rundle signed the Regional Forest Agreement.</para><para>Far from the forest agreement leading to the security of jobs that the industry and the Labor and Liberal parties in Tasmania always said would follow, 500 jobs have been shed from the industry since the Regional Forest Agreement was signed. That agreement opened the way to the greatest onslaught on Tasmania's forests in history. That surely is saying something. Nevertheless, the tourism and service industries in Tasmania continue to bolster the employment figures.</para><para>It is very important that senators, including Senator Troeth, understand this: you cannot have it both ways. You cannot destroy the resource upon which the tourism and service industries depend for thousands of jobs and say that you are creating jobs. It would be totally remiss for a council which is looking at the health of the wood and wood products industries in Tasmania to not include looking at the biggest employer of the lot—that is, the tourist related industry—which depends on wild forests and wild landscapes. It would be absurd to do so. It would reflect thinking of a couple of decades ago.</para><para>The forest industry these days has changed. Industrial forestry has no place destroying the job creating service industries in Tasmania, Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. This is a very important matter. I was very disappointed that the emergent new tourism industry based on Tasmania's wild and scenic attributes and its wilderness did not take a much more aggressive role in the regional forest agreement 
 business. But the power base in Tasmania which has been established by the logging industry over these last few decades is awesome indeed. There is a small business community which is very much interconnected, and the people who are involved know when to keep their heads down. It is truly a great pity that the tourism industry did not bore in there in defence of business, jobs and, I might add, the service industries which, very much distinct from the big woodchip industries based outside Tasmania, put their money back into the Tasmanian economy. You will note that this is a Green not talking about the environmental amenity per se but talking about jobs and the economy. I would be very happy for the government or anybody else to provide a different set of figures to that which I have put before the Senate just now.</para><para>Once again, placing a person representing the interests of the forest related tourism sector on this council is not going to enable them to have sway. They ought to, but they are not going to have it; the woodchippers will get that. Nevertheless, it is excruciatingly important that their voice be there and that it be heard and that it be a genuine person representing the forest related tourism sector.</para><para>Further, this amendment would ensure that a person representing the interests of the forest related water sector be there, and that also is hugely important. Forests and water go together. What is left of our forests is very often high in the catchments of rivers and streams flowing to the sea via townships and through agricultural areas which are very dependent on the water. Members will know that, these days, high-tech forestry also involves such things as pesticides and herbicides on a large scale and that there is great alarm about water pollution from the mud which gets into these stream systems and is currently threatening marvellous species like the world's largest crayfish, <inline font-style="italic">Astracopsis gouldii</inline>, in Tasmania's north-west streams and also the wellbeing of the human population further down. It threatens that much-touted clean green image. It threatens organic farming. It threatens other economic and job important components of the future. Again, we cannot have it both ways. It is extraordi 
 narily important that somebody who is involved in that forest related water sector be on this council.</para><para>I might add here, Chair, because you might not be aware of this, that studies in Victoria have shown that the value of forests in Melbourne's water catchment to supplying a clean and natural water system to the metropolis of Melbourne is far greater than the value of cutting those trees down and transporting them off to the woodchip mill and the rubbish dumps of Japan—far greater. That is an economic fact. This is not me coming up with an assumption. This is a result of independent studies and is there for all to see, and everybody of course knows about it.</para><para>It is putting our heads in the sand if, when it comes to the future of forests, we do not have somebody involved in the water related industries, which are themselves dependent on what happens in forests, not only in headwaters but throughout catchments in this wonderful country of ours on a wood and wood products council. Again, they are going to be underrepresented. But it would be very remiss were their voice to be shut out altogether. We are still at a very primitive stage in the way in which governments deal with the forest resource in this country, but it is time that we started to catch up. It is essential that the voice of the tourism sector and the water sector be heard on this council and that it have a say in formulating an informed policy and putting that to the body politic as well as to the public in the most rounded out way possible.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>—Before I call Senator Bolkus, I clarify that the matter before the chair is Senator Brown's amendments Nos 1 and 2 on sheet 1621, which is an amendment to opposition sheet 1617, as amended.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>10451</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to briefly come into the debate at this stage.

On Sunday nights, I—and I am sure many of us—have been watching on television the spectacular BBC program on dinosaurs. It intrigued me that the background footage—the landscape—used in that program was chosen from very 
 specific places on the globe, one of which was the Tasmanian highlands. It was chosen for its ancient and existing beauty.

When I last spoke on this in the Senate I explained that I had recently spent some time in and around the region of Deloraine and Meander—this was my first time in Tasmania—and I had spent some time in the logged and being-logged region of Mother Cummings Peak and its surrounds. I hesitate to refer to it as logging; it is more like mining. The utter devastation has to be seen to be believed. Yet as you stand on that peak in the midst of this utter devastation, you cannot but be struck by the immense beauty of the place and wonder why the tourism industry, most particularly in Tasmania but also in my home state of Western Australia, is continuing to be denied the greater patronage that it is crying out for. I understand there is a tourism exhibition about to take place in Tasmania as I speak.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I was also struck by the fact that, in my home state of Western Australia in the Karri forests around Pemberton, there is a magnificent tree of some—unless I am mistaken—70 metres in height known as the Gloucester Tree. It is very famous in Western Australia. It is a tree which almost every Western Australian, who is able to, is keen to climb and enjoy. It is marketed very much as one of the highlights of that region. People can no longer climb that tree. The reason offered is that it is now dangerous. I am led to believe that that is nonsense and that the real reason the Gloucester Tree was closed is that, when people climb to the top of it, they can see the logging that is going on in nearby districts and are horrified by it.</para><para>In my home state, I was struck recently by some imagery of the state Minister for the Environment, Mrs Edwardes, handing out awards to members of the tourism industry within Western Australia and basking in the 
 glow of how wonderful our south-west forests were and that we should be doing more to promote tourism within them. This was occurring at the very time when in excess of 80 per cent of people in my home state were screaming out in outrage over the continued logging of native forests in that very region. For that reason it comes as no difficulty for us whatsoever to support the notion that should any such council exist, as is being advocated by the Labor Party, then it is imperative that it involve at least one person from the forest related tourism sector.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Brown to insert paragraph (ja) be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question now is that Senator Brown's amendment to insert paragraph (jb) be agreed to.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>10453</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I draw the committee's attention again to the amendment which proposes that a person representing the interests of the forest-related water sector should be on this council. I will not go over the argument again, but I want to repeat that we are not talking here about some minor or side issue to the proper management of forests. We are talking about a multimillion dollar component, if not multibillion dollar component, annually of the forest industry impact on Australia's wellbeing. I reiterate that studies in Victoria for one have shown that the value of forests in important catchments being unlogged—that is, staying as they are—is greater than the value of cutting them down and carting them off to the woodchip mill.</para></talk.start><para>It needs to be said that the value accrues differently, though. When you are talking about the value of keeping catchments pristine, and being able to slowly release the water into the river systems and then into the water systems of cities like Melbourne, you are talking about the interests of millions. But when you are talking about the woodchip industry, which would cut down those catchments and cart them off to a woodchip mill, you are talking about very few indeed who want to exploit—for the short term and for a 
 premium on their woodchip shares—the forests against the interests of the majority.</para><para>There are much wider ramifications in this amendment than I will go into here. But water, as everybody knows, is a prime commodity in these days when six billion people are on the planet. The majority of people in this largely dry continent of ours live in areas which hug our coastline. Our forests and the water that we all depend on are also along our coastline. Increasingly, it is an economic premium that that water be unsullied, and increasingly one of the biggest factors degrading the water catchments near the populated areas of the eastern and far south-west seaboard of Australia is the logging industry.</para><para>Where logging occurs, you get a disturbance to the flow of water. When you do not have a forest there is a more rapid run-off and a loss of water. Of course, this means that there is less insurance against drought. You also get pollution through the direct erosion of the soils—and it is massive in places. Consequent upon that is the pollution from industrial forestry where so much depends on chemicals these days. These are all injurious to the wider economy of the populace as a whole.</para><para>I can gather the way this vote might go. I would expect the support of the Democrats, and Senator Greig has assented that that is the way they will be going. But I cannot understand the older parties not wanting to support something which is economically sound as well as environmentally sound and in the interests of the wider populace. Having somebody representing the forest related water sector on this council is not going to change the vote of the council, but it is going to make sure that those who persist in what is going to be the most rapid onslaught on the unprotected forests of Australia in history under the Howard government's regional forest agreements do so with their eyes wide open, knowing what damage they are causing economically as well as environmentally to the interests of the Australian populace as a whole. There should be somebody from the forest related water sector on this council.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>10453</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As Senator Brown stated, the Demo

I think the amendments that Senator Greig has brought forward on behalf of the Australian Democrats are eminently sensible and very appropriate to the aspirations of Australians 
 at the end of this century. But, again, we are going to see the Democrats and the Greens outvoted by Labor and the government on this matter. Senator Greig has proposed that there be a council looking after the management of the regional forest agreements—which we are dealing with here—and, in particular, that it have an eye to ensuring ecologically sustainable forest management. That should be a major aim sought by any council—whatever its set-up—but we are not going to get that. We are going to see a council which is there primarily to promote the interests of the logging industry.</para></talk.start><para>I know that some of the Tasmanian Labor senators, including Senator Murphy, have been very concerned that this council be established. I am not going to speak for Senator Murphy, but one of the things that I have gleaned from him over the years is that he is concerned that the industry is top heavy and dominated by the woodchip industry and the out-of-state corporations and that it is time the smaller players had a real say. A council like this is going to enable the smaller players and the interests of workers to be represented. In those circumstances, it is entirely appropriate that the council be looking at the way forward. If you leave out ecological sustainability, you are not looking at the way forward; you are looking at a way to an end—you are looking at the way to the ultimate end of the native forests that are unprotected. They are being cut down rapidly and the forest product is being shot out of this country. This is of course increasing, by huge amounts, other problems like greenhouse gas release, which is quite unnecessary because the standing forests are the best carbon banks this nation has.</para><para>All sorts of things need to be looked at here. I see the pivotal words in Senator Greig's amendments as being `ecologically sustainable forest management'. Surely that should be central to the whole matter. That is what the national forest policy of Labor and the government is aimed at: ecologically sustainable forest management. But, although Senator Greig and the Democrats have brought forward a proposal for the council to have that as its first aim, we can see that we 
 are going to get voted down. There is a disjunction here between the rhetoric and the reality. The reality is that the big logging corporations are calling the shots. They essentially wrote the legislation and they have essentially written the regional forest agreements, against the wishes of the vast majority of the Australian public, who own those forests. They also—and I am going to keep saying this because it is so important to understanding the process we are dealing with here—put hundreds of thousands of dollars into the coffers of the big political parties, and they do not do that without expecting a dividend.</para><para>I find it quite remarkable that, just last week in the House of Assembly in the Tasmanian parliament, a move by both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party was successful in calling on all members of this parliament, particularly the Tasmanian members, to support this legislation without any of these amendments—that is, with no amendments at all. The Tasmanian Labor Party, which is in office at the moment, is the most gung-ho destroyer of forests of any of the governments in Australia—and that is saying something. They even wanted to log the very small area of national park which the Liberals, who are dependent on the Greens in the state parliament, set aside last year for the nation's future—for future generations. You can only ask when Tasmania is going to follow the example of the Hawke government in the eighties and bring in legislation or allow legislation to be brought in which brings transparency at least to the donations being handed across by the woodchip corporations and other logging entities to the Labor Party and the Liberal Party in Tasmania.</para><para>I know from my own times in the Tasmanian state parliament that such proposals got hammered down by the big parties. There is a very unhealthy relationship there that is against the public interest and certainly against the job-rich industries that I talked about earlier today—not least, the service and tourism industries. This is highlighted by what we are seeing here right now—that is, this Senate, this parliament, reflecting that atavistic sentiment in the Tasmanian parliament by 
 not wanting to support an amendment which says that this council should be looking at implementing ecologically sustainable forest management in all the regional forest agreement areas. It is time—is it not?—that the big parties who talk about user pays applied that to the big industries, and that includes the big industries `picking up the tab', in the rawest terms, for the environmental damage which they have put on the shoulders of industry as a whole.</para><para>At the moment in Tasmania we have the extraordinary example of a new concert hall being built next to the Grand Chancellor Hotel across from Constitution Dock in downtown Hobart; it is a mixture of private enterprise and public support. Recently, there was great speculation that the whole thing would fall through. Why? Because costs had soared by $5 million. Why? Because the log trucks roaring through Hobart, down Davey Street, laden with the grand forests of the southern regions of Tasmania on their way to the woodchip mills to be exported to Japan, created such difficulties that the sum of $5 million was needed to protect the concert hall from these thundering beasts of destruction that were roaring past outside.</para><para>It is not as though I am talking about one or two trucks. Under this legislation, under the regional forest agreements a la Labor and Liberal in Tasmania, 150,000 log trucks a year are taking the most magnificent forests in this country to the woodchip mills. It is very difficult not to be angry about that. It is very difficult not to feel outraged—by not just the environmental but also the economic and employment madness of this situation.</para><para>It is shown up for what it is when there is an amendment here which says that this council should have ecologically sustainable forest management as its purview and the big parties are about to vote it down. That is not just bad management; it is culpability in my books. Remember, the taxpayers will be funding this council. The Greens and the Democrats will be left to try to improve the membership so at least there will be a flow of information, which will be in the wider public interest, to and from the council.</para><para>We cannot do anything but mark the argument and the dereliction of duty of the government in particular in the direction in which this vote will go. I congratulate the Democrats for their proposal; it is the right one. But, as we know, in this place right is never necessarily going to lead to the right outcome. I support wholeheartedly the Democrat amendments, and I recommend that the big parties again have a look at their opposition to them.</para><para>Amendments not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>10457</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Democrat amendment No. 12:</para></talk.start><para>(12)	 After paragraph 15(1)(b), insert:</para><para>		 (ba)	 a person nominated by the conservation council of each of those States which have entered into RFAs;</para><para>This amendment allows for a person nominated by the conservation council of each of those states which have entered into RFAs to be a part of the council.

It is plain commonsense and, for the reasons I gave in my last contribution, it should be supported.

I will be conservative and say that 70 to 80 per cent of people right around this country have shown in opinion polls consistently for the last decade that they agree with that sentiment. But money speaks louder than democracy. That is why we are not succeeding with the amendments that Senator Greig is putting forward. However, it is sensible that conservation councils, which represent that majority viewpoint of the Australian people, be on this council. The council will also have a member from the Australian Conservation Foundation, which is seen by many as the umbrella organisation for conservation groups in Australia—and that is a move in the right direction.</para><para>But where we have, for example, the Tasmanian forests feeding two-thirds of the inexhaustible appetite for woodchips of the overseas pulp and paper industry, there is no Australian Conservation Foundation field officer in Tasmania. It is appropriate that there be a conservationist from Tasmania, a person representing that state's conservation interests, on this council—a person with on the ground knowledge and with an ability to work through and follow the arguments as they relate to the island state.</para><para>This is not a small matter. It has huge economic, employment and environmental ramifications. If this council is going to work successfully, it needs to be based on good, sound knowledge. You do not get that result by cutting out a pivotal part of the knowledge base because you do not like its point of view. That is what Labor and Liberal in Tasmania stand for: they are anti-conservationist; they are anti-green; they are anti protecting forests. They are exploitative parties in the business of permitting, at the bidding of the big woodchip corporations, the 
 record destruction which this process allows of one of the most important economic and employment resources the state has. We need to have someone speak up for the alternative at a regional level, someone that can really argue on behalf of the industries which provide more jobs from keeping forests intact than the industries that want to destroy the forests, such as woodchipping, and that continue to shed jobs.</para><para>I am afraid we are going to see the committee vote this amendment down, but I am glad it is on the record.

Threatened species are, regrettably, an integral part of our forests. I say `regrettably' because of the extent to which they are threatened and not because they exist. I am very conscious, for example—and I spoke of this previously—of the chuditch, one threatened species amongst others in the south-west of Western Australia, which has so endeared itself to the populace of Western Australia that it has been adopted as the icon and emblem of the Small Business Association of Western Australia—an association which is, incidentally, strongly opposed to the logging of native forests. Again, I think 
 this is a sensible amendment, and I seek Senate support for it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>10459</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Greig has my support for it. Around the world, the greatest cause of the loss of species is destruction of forests. We have the cute argument by the industry in Australia that nobody can specifically identify a tree that has fallen that has led to the extinction of a species; but this process of gradualism is extraordinarily important. In Australia 50 per cent of the species are in our forests.</para></talk.start><para>Under this legislation, millions of hectares of forests are going to be destroyed. We do not have the minister for the environment in here. He has avoided this whole debate because he is not up to protecting the environment of this country. He repeatedly sells out on it. We cannot allow this to go by with a shrug of the shoulders, because inherent in this legislation is the deliberate destruction of habitat and the deliberate movement towards extinction of a whole range of species in our forests.</para><para>There is a glib look of satisfaction on the face of the greenwash experts who assure us that the regional forest agreement legislation is going to actually enhance species in our forests. But you could not get away with that in a kindergarten. You cannot go ahead and destroy half of what is left of the forests of Australia and cogently argue that the species base—the thousands of species of plants, animals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and insects—in those forests is going to be, at the end of that process, as well off as it is now with the wild forests intact. This is a process of extinction.</para><para>So we have a council set up to look at the way this industry is going, and we have a Democrat amendment here which says, `Let's put somebody on that council representing the interests of threatened species.' Is the Liberal Party, with its absent minister for the environment, going to say yes to that? No. Will the Labor Party say yes to that? I doubt it. And the reason for that is the woodchip industries and their financial clout, which not only goes against current Australians and future generations of Australians having all that is left in this much depleted country of theirs as part of 
 their variety of life, interest and natural realm; it sells out our fellow species themselves.</para><para>It is noteworthy that the particular amendment that Senator Greig is putting forward says `a person representing the interests of threatened species'. That would run a shudder down the spine of most of the woodchip industry, certainly economic commentators and I think the majority of people in this parliament, when they think about it, because other species have no rights in our society. We have enough arguing of the anthropocentric point of view, which is that we gain through having other species as part of our realm of existence. But when it comes to moving for leaving living room and the right to survival of other species, you would not get a debate on it except a jocular put-down from those opposed to it. It is part of this materialist, marauding world which needs rectifying.</para><para>That is why I am here as a Green—because not only future generations but other species do need a voice. Whereas many members of this place might think that this is almost an irrelevant amendment brought forward by the Democrats, I think it is a pivotal amendment. I think it is crucial. I think it is as important as the debate on taxes, which I recognise as being important. We are dealing here with the planet that we hand across to future generations. We are dealing here with the right to survive, with what is left of their natural habitat, of the panoply of species in this country and on this Earth.</para><para>I have no doubt that there are many members in the big parties who could get up here and give at least a little talk on why the Amazon forest should not be knocked down and why they are concerned about that. Senator McGauran, National Party Senator for Victoria, for one, agrees. But would you hear senators from the big parties getting up here to say that we should not knock our own forests down for exactly the same reasons, that is, because they are species rich, they are full of life, they are ancient, intact ecosystems, and we have lost too many of them already? And we do not need to because this  country has a plantation base which is totally 
 adequate to provide all our wood needs, including woodchipping for export.</para><para>It is profit that cuts across the field of vision of people who think it should stop in the Amazon and in Siberia, in West Papua and in Cameroon. But, oh no, not here in Australia. I remember trying to argue this with the former minister for the environment, Ros Kelly, who went to the Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro representing Australia. The argument made to Minister Kelly was: `If you are cutting down the tallest trees in the Southern Hemisphere and the tallest hardwood forests on the face of the planet in Tasmania because the woodchippers want to turn them into profits, you are not going to be  able to argue for saving the rainforests or the temperate forests in the rest of the world.' And that is exactly what happened.</para><para>At Rio, where an agreement was expected to come out of that conference trying to protect the forests and the majority of the world's living species which live within them, Australia was silent. It could not raise a voice to Vietnam, Brazil, the Congo or a great range of other countries. Why? Because those countries would immediately say, `Minister Kelly, look what you are doing in your own backyard. Look what is happening in Tasmania, in south-western Australia, in Victoria, in New South Wales and in Queensland. Of course, included in this is the current outrageous destruction of woodlands, rating at half a million hectares per annum in Queensland. This has Amazonian proportions of its own.</para><para>So here we have a council which is being set up in the wake of the regional forest agreements to ensure good management of this resource. Here we have the opportunity for those persons who say, `Don't cut down the Amazon' and `Stop the destruction in Thailand and Vietnam' and `Protect the forests of Tibet' to be honest and say, `Let's be consistent about this; let's protect the forests of this great nation of ours and, if we cannot do that, let's ensure that we have the maturity to have somebody on this council who speaks and can inform the council about threatened species.'</para><para>Do you know what the results will be? The big parties will outvote us on this matter. That is what is going to happen. It is an extraordinary bind that this nation is in on the environment, which has been put on the backburner, where former Prime Minister Keating said it should be. He was wrong, and the Howard government now is wrong. If there is any commitment I make in my time in this place, it is to keep resolute about giving a voice to the environment in the Parliament of Australia because that is what I believe the people of Australia want to have heard, along with the other arguments.</para><para>We are going to have representatives galore of the industry on this council. Surely there is room for somebody to represent, if not the threatened species themselves, then the public interest in the threatened species. You know what it is like. If you go to a kindergarten these days and ask the children what worries them, they will talk about the environment.</para><para>The pictures on the wall are of trees, animals and birds. If you ask the children, `If you're going to have a council that looks at the future management of Australia's forests, do you think anybody should be there to speak up for the birds and animals?' they will all say yes. So what is it in a mature group of adults elected into this place that squashes that wisdom of the infants in this country? What is it? It is ultimately greed and profit that, like a magnet across a computer, somehow erases long-term sensitivity and concern for this beautiful little planet of ours from the dinkum consideration of members here.</para><para>Once again, we cannot do anything but appeal to the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party and even One Nation, which is not supporting these amendments, to think again. These are critical matters. They are every bit as critical as the other matters we will be dealing with between now and Christmas. They deserve to be supported.</para><para>I go back again to that vote in the Tasmanian parliament last week where every member of the government, with one exception, called on this parliament to have no amendments at all—a lay down misere for the woodchip industry. The one exception, of course, was the Green MHA for Denison, Peg Putt—one 
 voice of sanity in a sea of insensitivity. Fortunately there are a few more of us in this place, but the majority here are not reflecting the public interest in this matter. There is a serious flaw in the democratic system that allows that to happen, and that serious flaw is called money—money being power. Again, I ask the big parties to think once more about whether it is too much to ask that, in a wood industry council, there ought not be somebody there representing the interests of the threatened species of this nation. Of course there should be.</para><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BORDER PROTECTION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>10461</page.no><id.no>r925</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>10461</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Troeth</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>10461</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>10461</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:</para></talk.start><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>This bill that is part of the package of measures announced by the Prime Minister on 27 June 1999 in response to a massive increase in the numbers of attempts at illegal entry to Australia.</para><para>The bill is part of the Government's ongoing commitment to combat the flow of unauthorised arrivals and other breaches of our laws at our borders.</para><para>The changes the bill proposes will strengthen legislative provisions relating to the prevention of the smuggling of people into Australia. 
</para><para>These changes will maintain the integrity of Australia's borders against attempted intrusions of the criminal elements behind most people smuggling activities.</para><para>The bill also implements a number of recommendations made by the Commonwealth Ombudsman in relation to the detention of non-citizens fishing illegally in Australian waters.</para><para>The recent events in East Timor provide a graphic and immediate illustration of circumstances that can drive people to leave their normal places of residence and seek safe haven elsewhere.</para><para>There is however another side to the mass movement of people. This is the cynical world-wide trade in smuggling people from one country to another.</para><para>It is a trade which preys on the misery and hopes of people. It is a criminal industry that the United Nations estimates has a turnover of seven billion dollars a year and involving up to four million people.</para><para>It is a trade which is increasing in scale and sophistication, and one which is now targeting Australia.</para><para>It is a trade which taxes the ability of law enforcement agencies to respond effectively.</para><para>It is a trade which requires a strong, determined response from Governments.</para><para>The trade is often closely related to extortion, prostitution, drug trafficking and other criminal activities.</para><para>The true concern of the criminals behind this trade is profit.</para><para>These criminals have no concern for the safety of the people they move—as was shown only recently with the tragic sinking of an unseaworthy vessel off Christmas Island which took the lives of fifteen people. These people were all on their way to Australia.</para><para>These criminals can also deal in large numbers of people. Earlier this year a ship was organised which was to leave Kenya with around 2,000 people of Somali descent on board. These people were all on their way to Australia.</para><para>It is a trade that needs to be dealt with before more lives are put at risk.</para><para>The activities of these criminals violate the sovereign rights of states to determine who can enter their territory.</para><para>The people being smuggled are, in most cases, not refugees seeking haven in the first safe country available. They are instead young migrants from less developed countries who are seeking to work in developed countries. 
</para><para>Australia is increasingly a preferred destination and unwilling recipient of the attention of these people.</para><para>In 1997-98 for example, there were 13 unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia with 157 people.</para><para>In 1998-99, this had increased to 42 boats with 926 unauthorised arrivals on-board. In this financial year to date ( 1 July-18 November 1999), there have been 35 boats carrying 1671 people.</para><para>These figures do not include the much larger number of persons detected and deterred by our overseas posts.</para><para>Clearly this is a significant problem for this country and one that demands our immediate attention.</para><para>The Government is responding quickly to the increase in this criminal trade.</para><para>The first of the influx of Chinese boats arrived in December last year, travelling at the conclusion of the monsoon season in the Northern Hemisphere.</para><para>A total of 471 Chinese nationals arrived, most targeting our Eastern coastline.</para><para>This could happen again this year.</para><para>This legislation is needed to be able to respond should it re-occur.</para><para>In order to ensure that Australia is no longer seen as a soft target, the changes made by this bill have to be in place before the end of this year.</para><para>Australia is not alone in adopting a more active approach to people smuggling.</para><para>The United States of America for example has announced its intention to broaden the scope of its border enforcement powers beyond its territorial waters. Canada is also reviewing its laws to combat this criminal activity.</para><para>It is expected that other countries will soon follow.</para><para>It may be helpful to outline an example of where Australia's existing laws to combat people smuggling are inadequate.</para><para>Earlier this year "Snakeheads", or people smugglers, from Fujian in China, conspired to bring a boatload of would-be illegal entrants to Australia.</para><para>The Fujian group were attempting a totally clandestine entry, attempting to avoid detection and to disappear into the Australian community.</para><para>The vessels involved in the Fujian operation were steel-hulled and equipped with modern navigational and communications equipment.</para><para>These ships travelled, by a circuitous route, through international waters, across the top of Papua New Guinea, before targeting Australia's eastern coast.</para><para>They avoided contact with those neighbouring countries whose officials might alert Australia of their imminent arrival.</para><para>The Snakeheads coordinated the route taken by the vessel and arranged for accomplices onshore in 
 Australia to receive and conceal the ships' human cargo.</para><para>Their plans were to exploit the limitations of our current laws.</para><para>The "mothership" was to wait in international waters. Accomplices in Australia were to travel out to the vessel in high-powered ocean going speed boats that had been specifically purchased for this purpose.</para><para>Those accomplices were to ferry the passengers to Australia under cover of darkness.</para><para>The mothership, relieved of its human cargo, would then sail back to China without being detected or arrested.</para><para>As it stands, the Captain, crew and the Snakeheads in command were immune to Australian law, which does not extend to people smugglers sitting so far off Australia.</para><para>They were beyond the reach of the law.</para><para>This legislation is designed to ensure that these smugglers, operating on mother ships sitting off Australia's coast, will not be immune.</para><para>They will not continue to be beyond the reach of Australian law.</para><para>The bill will create new powers that will allow officers to undertake enforcement action beyond the territorial waters, and to arrest and prosecute those involved in attempts to breach Australia's sovereignty in this way.</para><para>The bill ensures that the investigatory and enforcement powers held by officers of front line border agencies are complementary so they may function more efficiently on behalf of Australia.</para><para>The powers proposed will enhance the ability of officers to deal with other forms of illegal activity they encounter at sea such as drug smuggling and illegal fishing.</para><para>The bill achieves these aims by making amendments to the Migration Act 1958, the Customs Act 1901 and the Fisheries Management Act 1991.</para><para>This bill revises and enhances existing powers of investigation and enforcement at sea in the context of this country's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and customary international law.</para><para>Amendments to the Migration Act and the Customs Act will allow the detention, forfeiture, seizure and (as necessary) disposal, of ships and aircraft used in people smuggling operations.</para><para>In addition, vessels found to be unseaworthy, a risk to safety or navigation or a threat to the environment, will be able to be moved or destroyed.</para><para>The main target of the bill is smuggling of human cargoes by sea. 
</para><para>However, future attempts could also be made by air. Accordingly the bill gives Australia's main border agencies similar powers over aircraft being used in this criminal trade.</para><para>To ensure the safety of officers, in the increasingly violent world of people smuggling, amendments to the Customs Act will allow Customs officers to carry approved firearms.</para><para>They will also be able to carry other approved items of personal defence equipment in the performance of their duty.</para><para>Customs officers will also be officers for the purposes of the Fisheries Management Act and carry approved firearms in matters relating to surveillance and enforcement against illegal foreign fishers.</para><para>The measures contained in this bill are a major part of the Government's strategy for dealing appropriately with unauthorised arrivals. Another element of this strategy is contained in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 1998.</para><para>That bill is presently before this Chamber, and its passage through the Parliament is crucial in this Government's view.</para><para>The bill will limit the grounds for judicial review of migration matters, particularly for unauthorised arrivals, and provide a clear message that people will not be able to use the judicial review system simply to prolong their stay in Australia.</para><para>Passage of that bill will help ensure that the Snakeheads and other people smugglers cannot hold out false hopes that an extended stay in Australia can easily be arranged.</para><para>Senators are encouraged to take a broader view of that legislation and this current bill in the context of the issue of people smuggling into this country.</para><para>The Chamber is reminded that there is a qualitative difference between organised people smuggling and the irregular movement of people in need of safe haven.</para><para>Australia recognises that genuine refugees are sometimes caught up in the criminally organised people smuggling operations. However this country's refugee determination system works to identify genuine refugees and accord to them protection irrespective of how they gain entry.</para><para>It is the very generosity of Australia's refugee determination system that some see as an incentive to make their way to Australia illegally.</para><para>For example, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people from Iraq who are arriving illegally by boat. Of the 1675 unauthorised arrivals this financial year, Iraqi nationals have numbered 954, a sevenfold increase over 1998-99 numbers. 
</para><para>Afghanis make up the next biggest national group of arrivals, with a 620 per cent increase in their numbers from the last financial year.</para><para>One of the factors behind this dramatic increase may be the perception that past illegal arrivals from those countries had been successful in engaging Australia's protection obligations.</para><para>These perceptions have also led to expectations.</para><para>It was disturbing to hear reports of some of these arrivals asking for "Pert" shampoo immediately upon their arrival.</para><para>Some of them have arrived with details of medical treatment that they wanted to receive whilst in detention—including dental work.</para><para>There has been more than one case of demands being made for very expensive medical treatment—with the full expectation that the Australian taxpayer would foot the bill.</para><para>Others have been critical of the conditions in which they are being detained.</para><para>Whatever the reasons for the increase, the fact remains that travelling to Australia by boat is a hazardous undertaking.</para><para>It places people in leaking, rusty boats which are prone to breakdown.</para><para>It places them at the mercy of the weather.</para><para>Most of all, it makes these people vulnerable to the criminals behind the smuggling trade.</para><para>It is these factors that require this Parliament to deal with this bill quickly and for it to gain passage and come into force before the end of the year.</para><para>It was heartening to read that the Shadow Minister for Employment, Training and Population had placed a motion in the other place indicating the "utmost concern" about the activities of people smugglers.</para><para>The Government trust's that this concern will result in unequivocal support for this bill and other legislation for which the Government will be seeking the support of the Parliament.</para><para>This bill also proposes a number of amendments to the Fisheries Management Act to allow for the detention of foreign fishermen who are suspected of fisheries violations.</para><para>These amendments flow from a recent report on this issue by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.</para><para>Consequential amendments to the Migration Act will provide a scheme by which these fishermen are taken to hold a visa immediately upon enforcement action by Fisheries officers. This new visa will come into effect automatically for the duration of the period of detention of persons suspected of fisheries violations.</para><para>Once Fisheries detention is concluded any continued detention will be under existing provisions 
 of the Migration Act. Amongst other things these provisions enable any custodial sentences to be served.</para><para>The bill also makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Migration Act. Some of these changes are consequential to the main thrust of the bill and act to streamline operational aspects of enforcement practice.</para><para>Others revise existing provisions relating to bringing unauthorised arrivals into Australia where these persons need to travel to Australia for various reasons.</para><para>The bill provides for such circumstances and also ensures that the officers implementing these returns are not acting contrary to the law and therefore vulnerable to prosecution. It also ensures that those returned will be detained on arrival and will not reactivate entitlements that they had already used.</para><para>In summary , this bill is part of a package announced by the Prime Minister on 27 June 1999 to combat the international trade in people.</para><para>This bill will allow Australia to increase its capacity to detect and to deter people smuggling.</para><para>It will ensure that the organisers of this criminal activity are not beyond the reach of our laws.</para><para>The Government has responded promptly and unequivocally to this growing and real criminal activity.

 following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) The papaya fruit fly (PFF) eradication campaign was completed when formal recognition of eradication was declared in May 1999. Area freedom status was achieved in August 1998. All that remains to be finalised under the eradication program is the documentation of the campaign and the preparation and publication of scientific papers.</para><para>(2) A scientific Technical Advisory panel, which comprised fruit fly scientists with international and national recognition, was established to oversight the scientific activities of the eradication program. Acting on the advice of this panel, the criteria for establishing the eradication of the pest were developed and implemented. This included maintaining the intensive monitoring for the presence of the pest for over twelve months following the last detection of a wild fly. Given that this criterion was met and papaya fruit fly has not been detected in the wild since July 1997, the government is confident that the pest has been eradicated.</para><para>(3) The total cost to the Commonwealth and State/Territory governments under the national cost sharing agreement for the eradication campaign was $33.54 million. In addition, the Queensland Government provided an additional $3.8 million for the purchase and refurbishment of a building for fruit fly disinfestation research in Cairns, and a further $4.5 million to support affected horticultural growers in north Queensland, through waiving of government service charges.</para><para>(4) Labour and non-labour costs for the cost shared component of the eradication program were approximately $23.5 million [70%] (labour), $7.75 million [23%] (consumables, including chemicals, supplementary traps and other equipment for fruit fly control), $2.25 million [7%] (capital).</para><para>(5) There have been a total of five claims for compensation made in relation to the PFF program. Two claims related to damages arising out of the actual eradication program. One was a minor claim relating the alleged death of goldfish in a garden pond which was settled. The other involves alleged damage to a number of coffee crops near Mareeba.</para><para>There have also been three other claims lodged for compensation for damages arising out of the application of post harvest quarantine treatments required for the movement of produce out of the PFF quarantine area. Two claims have been settled and the other is the subject of current civil action.</para><para>(6) The cost to the north Queensland horticultural industry resulting from the PFF outbreak has been estimated by industry at approximately $100 million. This primarily consists of initial lost markets and the costs of the implementation of PFF quarantine protocols. 
</para><para>The government has no direct figures on the amount of any losses that may have been suffered by farmers as a result of the PFF outbreak. In the initial stages of the outbreak the estimate of the potential economic loss to the Australian horticultural industry had the pest not been eradicated was calculated by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) to be $73.51 million annually.</para><para>(7) The impact of the eradication program on the organic fruit industry was considered during the program. Every effort was made to accommodate the organic industry in meeting their strict protocols, minimising market disruption for organic produce and still maintaining the eradication program. Extensive consultation was maintained with organic growers throughout the eradication program.</para><para>No formal economic assessment was undertaken.</para><para>(8) There were a number of complaints lodged by the plant industries and the general public relating to the chemicals being used in the eradication program. The complaints lodged by plant industries related to workplace health and safety issues arising from the requirement for post harvest chemical disinfestation of produce leaving the quarantine area. These complaints were dealt with on an individual basis, working closely with the local Health and Workplace Health and Safety agencies.</para><para>Complaints from the public included concerns relating to the use of chemical insecticides in the eradication treatments. These were addressed through the formation of a PFF Health and Environmental Liaison Group. In addition, close collaboration with the National Registration Authority (NRA) on the use of the eradication chemicals was maintained throughout the program. The NRA also conducted an independent audit into the use of chemicals in the eradication program. This audit established that the eradication program was being conducted in an effective and safe manner. In conjunction with the local Queensland Health office, the NRA also established an adverse chemical consequences register relating to the eradication program. However, the NRA received no reports of adverse chemical consequences.</para><para>(9) Apart from the Workplace Health and Safety issues mentioned in the answer to question 8 (above), there have not been any formal complaints about the use of chemicals on fruits and vegetables associated with the PFF quarantine requirements.</para><para>(10) The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has two operating groups with responsibilities with regard to exotic pests and diseases. One group has responsibility for the exclusion of exotic pests and diseases and in the event that there is a breach in the quarantine barrier, the other 
 group is responsible for the management of incursions of exotic pests and diseases.</para><para>The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has prime responsibility for the exclusion of exotic pests and diseases from Australia. Measures in place to ensure that no further incursions of papaya fruit fly occur include the airports program, aimed at preventing people entering Australia carrying items of quarantine concern, such as fruit and vegetables that may harbour papaya fruit fly. The import clearance program facilitates the entry of among other things agricultural products from overseas and ensures that such products are free of pests and diseases.</para><para>The National Office of Animal and Plant Health (NOAPH) administers a national fruit fly surveillance program designed to identify and define incursions of targeted exotic fruit fly pests, including papaya fruit fly, entering through international pathways at ports and associated urban areas. It is the aim of this program to ensure that, where incursions of papaya fruit fly and other exotic fruit fly species occur, they are detected quickly enabling a response strategy to be rapidly implemented.</para><para>The Queensland Department of Primary Industries administers the operational aspect of the national program, under contract to NOAPH, as well as administering a supplementary fruit fly surveillance program which operates in other centres at high risk of fruit fly incursion, such as the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast.</para><para>The Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy (NAQS) within AQIS performs crop and field surveys throughout northern Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia to provide data on the pest status of these regions for the formulation of quarantine programs to combat such pests. Papaya fruit fly is a known pest of the South East Asian region.</para><para>(11) (a) The cost of the national surveillance program in the financial year 1999/2000 will be $464,165. There is also a limited outlay of funds for consumable items associated with surveillance such as traps and other trapping equipment. The national surveillance program has been in operation for each of the financial years 1996/97, 1997/98 and 1998/99 at a cost similar to that of the current financial year. Before the 1996/97 financial year, there was no national surveillance program in operation.</para><para>No figures associated with financing the Northern Monitoring [see (11) (b) below] are available for the years sought.</para><para>(b) Surveillance for exotic fruit flies in northern Australia has been carried out since the mid-1970s, initially under the Northern Monitoring Program. This program was largely carried out by state and territory departments in the region, funded by the 
 Commonwealth quarantine authority. Initially, the program maintained surveillance sites along Australia's northern coastline between Derby in Western Australia and the Torres Strait. Following the release of the 1991 review commissioned by NAQS, a decision was made not to undertake surveillance in Cairns under the NAQS program. This decision was made on the basis that surveillance in settled areas was not a NAQS responsibility but should be considered in the broader context of surveillance at ports of entry.</para><para>The first surveillance program with national coverage was initiated in 1996. The program, as it has operated since 1996, provides a minimum 5 km density of trap sites in all major and minor trafficked `first port of call' ports. The network includes over 1,600 traps directly administered by the National Office of Animal and Plant Health and serviced by the state departments of agriculture/ primary industry in Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Tasmania and South Australia carry out more extensive surveillance in port cities and towns to support those states' pest free area programs. The NAQS carries out surveillance in the more remote areas and port city areas in northern Australia. Traps are maintained in the urban areas of: Sydney, Newcastle, Wollongong, Yamba, Coffs Harbour, Darwin, Gove, Groote, Brisbane, Cairns, Townsville, Gladstone, Mackay, Bundaberg, Weipa, Thursday Island, Mourilyan Harbour, Karumba, Adelaide, Port Lincoln, Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Whyalla, Ceduna, Hobart, Launceston, Devonport/ Burnie, Melbourne/Westonport, Geelong, Portland, Albany, Bunbury, Esperance, Perth/Freemantle, Geraldton, Dampier, Karratha, Carnavon, Broome, Wydham, Derby and Port Hedland.</para><para>Three trap types are located at each surveillance site. Each trap type contains a lure type specific to one fruit fly group. Methyl eugenol lures are used for papaya fruit fly and related species, capi-lure for Mediterranean fruit fly and related species and cue-lure is used to detect Queensland fruit fly and related species. The trap types used in fruit fly surveillance differ in architecture and have specific applications depending on the environment and climate they are used in. Within the national surveillance system the so-called `Steiner', `Lynfield' and `Jackson' traps are utilised.</para><para>(c) It was recognised by the Consultative Committee that was formed to manage the eradication campaign for PFF, that the likely pathway that led to the establishment of the PFF was the illegal entry of fruit carried by a private individual through the quarantine barrier.</para><para>It is possible that PFF may have been present in the Cairns region for two or more years before the species was identified. There was no structured 
 fruit fly surveillance system, utilising traps with lures, operating in the region.</para><para>(12) (a) There was no pre-established national or international certification or approval mechanism in place to ensure confidence in the claim that PFF has been eradicated from north Queensland. In the case of PFF, a specific criterion was agreed upon, nationally, to ensure confidence in eradication claims. The Papaya Fruit Fly Technical Advisory Panel considered PFF to be eradicated if a minimum period of nine months of nil detections was reached, in the absence of eradication measures, including one peak activity season for fruit flies (summer). A period of 20 months of nil detections had elapsed at the time of declaration of eradication.</para><para>The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), under the Food and Agriculture Organisation, has associated standards for phytosanitary measures, including a standard for pest surveillance. These standards are recognised by the World Trade Organisation. The particular standard relating to pest surveillance encompasses general requirements for achieving and maintaining pest free areas. The standard provides a scientific framework for national governments to assess claims of pest freedom as the need arises. Australia has met this general standard in regard to eradicating PFF and maintaining a pest free area in the eradication zone. To remain assured of the PFF-free status of fruit exported from Australia, AQIS inspects such fruit for freedom from quarantine pests and documents this through phytosanitary certification issued in accordance with IPPC requirements.</para><para>(b) Endorsement of the eradication criterion for PFF within north Queensland was made by the National Papaya Fruit Fly Consultative Committee. All states and territories of Australia endorsed the declaration of eradication through the committee processes working under the auspices of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management.</para><para>The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service sought and received the endorsement of international trading partners of the criterion and outcome of the eradication campaign.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Schedule 25A Companies</title><page.no>10500</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1634)</subtitle><id.no>1634</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10500</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator Harris</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 29 September 1999:</para></talk.start><para>(a) How much net tax was paid by Schedule 25A companies in the 1995-96 and 1996-97 financial years; and (b) what were their aggregate taxable incomes for each of those years.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>10500</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(a) In 1995-96 and 1996-97, net tax for schedule 25A companies was $7.7b and $8.3b respectively.</para><para>(b) In 1995-96 and 1996-97 aggregate taxable incomes for schedule 25A companies were $41.7b and $46.4b respectively.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Falun Gong</title><page.no>10500</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1638)</subtitle><id.no>1638</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10500</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator Bourne</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 30 September 1999:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Did the Minister or the Prime Minister raise the issue of the Falun Gong with the President of China Jiang Zemin, during his recent visit to Australia.</para><para>(2) Can the Minister outline any action the Australian Government has taken to date, regarding the arrests and allegations of torture of practitioners of Falun Gong in China.</para><para>(3) With reference to reports from the Falun Gong which indicate that hundreds of thousands of practitioners are currently being held, does the Minister have any confirmation of these figures.</para><para>(4) Is the Minister aware of when the trials for the imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners are being conducted.</para><para>(5) Given that if the Falun Gong practitioners are found guilty of subversion the penalty could be death, has any representation to the Chinese Government been made to ensure that the trials are fair and open and can be monitored by international and human rights bodies.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>10500</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) No</para><para>(2) The Australian Government has raised its concerns about the treatment of Falungong with the Chinese government: first, to the Chinese Charg d'Affaires in Canberra on 23 July 1999; secondly, to a senior official of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing on 29 July; and thirdly, in a number of senior-level meetings during the third round of the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in China from 16-20 August.

It should be noted that, for this election, a new system of placing polling places into three wheelchair access categories (full access, access with minimal assistance, no access) was introduced. The categories are 
 identified on all polling place advertising. The change followed meetings and discussions with the Commonwealth Disability Commissioner and also a desire by the AEC to accurately reflect Australian standard (AS 1428) access requirements. While many buildings do not fully comply with AS 1428, they may still allow for reasonable wheelchair access.</para><para>(2) In 1993, 4,967 polling places had no wheelchair access. In 1996, 3,771 polling places had no wheelchair access. The significant improvement between 1993 and 1996 was as a result of both efforts to locate and utilise polling places with higher levels of wheelchair access and a full review of polling places to more accurately classify them. As wheelchair access levels constantly change due to building improvements and/or replacement and new buildings, the review of polling place locations is an ongoing process between major electoral events.</para><para>(3) Yes. A copy of the Commission's Disability Discrimination Plan, which has recently been subject to broad consultation within the disability community, can be provided. The plan sets out the Commission's strategy for increasing the number of polling places with wheelchair access. The plan is also available on the Commission's web site aec.gov.au</para><para>(4) There are three options for voters in situations where wheelchair access is not available. With the first option, a voter can apply for and then cast a postal vote from their own place of residence. With the second option, pre-poll voting, the Commission ensures that pre-poll voting centres have wheelchair access and are normally open for a period of two weeks prior to election day. In regard to the third option, an amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 just prior to the 1998 Federal election enabled Presiding Officers to take voting material and a ballot box outside a polling place to a voter with a disability so that they could still vote without having to enter the polling place.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Basslink</title><page.no>10503</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1677)</subtitle><id.no>1677</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10503</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 13 October 1999:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Has Telstra been advised whether Basslink will operate in a mono-pole or bi-pole configuration.</para><para>(2) If Basslink operates on a mono-pole configuration, what effects will this have on Telstra's fibre-optic cables and other installations.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>10503</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Telstra has not been advised by Basslink of the proposed configuration.</para><para>(2) Regardless of the configuration chosen for the Basslink cable, Telstra will work with Basslink and the successful tenderer to ensure that the integrity of Telstra's transmission systems is not compromised.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Film Production: Backdated Taxation Liability</title><page.no>10504</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1689)</subtitle><id.no>1689</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10504</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 October 1999:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Is the Treasurer aware that a number of small investors in the film production Michael have had claims in relation to their investments under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 refused by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), resulting in taxation liabilities dating back to 1995.</para><para>(2) Is the Treasurer aware of any advance opinions or private binding rulings made by the ATO in relation to this production; if so, can the Treasurer advise: (a) when these opinions or rulings were made; and (b) what they said about investments in this project under the Act.</para><para>(3) Has the ATO made any investigations into the companies involved in this film, Kamisha Productions Limited and Shooting Star Holdings Pty Ltd; if not, will the ATO investigate whether these companies misled investors about the allowableness under the Act for investment in this production.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>10504</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The following answer is provided to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) The ATO has been conducting a review of claims made by investors for film production costs.
