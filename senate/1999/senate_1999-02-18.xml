Amongst the major parties, the National Party has recognised that the current regional forest process is not going to resolve the conflict, and it has made an earnest effort to look at how the conflict may be resolved. It is unusual for me as a Green to be moving to support that earnest effort from the Nationals. But let us give credit where it is due, and here it is due to the Nationals. I quote from the Nationals' press release of Thursday, 11 January, in which the state director, Jamie Kronborg says:</para><para>We believe that at least three major steps must be taken as a matter of urgency to help resolve the conflict over logging. These include the rapid phasing out of clear felling in old-growth forests.</para><para>The press release goes on to look at the way in which old-growth forest logging is no longer the major source of wood products in Western Australia, and how there is an alternative to the continuing destruction of the karri, jarrah and marri forests in Western Australia, which is better from an economic, employment and environmental point of view.</para><para> The reason we must change the direction of the major parties, as the Nationals have done in Western Australia, is because the public demands it. There is so little of the grand forests of this nation left. There is an enormous groundswell of feeling that that little should be protected. The reason is that the public at large recognises that it is unnecessary to keep the destruction going, that the plantation and regrowth alternatives are there and are available now—not only for this industry to maintain its diversity of wood products for the Australian market but also for export and with downstream processing to increase the jobs provided in the logging industry. </para><para> Moreover, the real jobs in ancient forests these days are from the presentation of those forests to visitors in the recreation and tourism industries. Western Australia is no different from Tasmania where, these days, more jobs are actually created by keeping the trees intact with their wildlife than by felling the trees to the ground. I see some Labor members laughing about that, but they are the ones who always espouse jobs, jobs, jobs, while the big woodchip corporations mechanise, conglomerate and shed jobs—the jobs of their union members. It is not they who often sit outside the woodchip offices complaining about this, it is very often the Greens. But when the Nationals do their homework and come to the same conclusion, they should be congratulated and they should be supported.</para><para> There is some prospect that Western Australia will be the state which, through public impulse, through the sheer pressure of public outrage about the destruction of forests, may turn around this head-in-the-sand attitude of the Howard government and several other state governments who say, `Whatever the woodchip corporations say, that is the line we will take.' This is an urgent matter. There is a positive resolution. When the Nationals in Western Australia come up with the road to that positive resolution, they deserve the support of this place.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>2174</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have heard a debate on the motion but we have not heard a debate on why standing orders should be suspended, why this motion is urgent and why it could not be dealt with in the ordinary course of events. The fact is that this matter—notice of which was given yesterday—was dealt with last night at the whips meeting. At that time we indicated that we were unhappy with the matter proceeding and that we would deny formality.</para></talk.start><para>However, we were prepared to entertain any approaches as to a rewording of the motion. No such approaches have been forthcoming. This motion is simplistic. It deals with an issue which has not just Western Australian but also national ramifications. If the matter is to be dealt with, it should be dealt with in a fulsome debate. It should be dealt with so 
 that all parties have an opportunity to move amendments that they consider appropriate, rather than simply deal with the motion by granting formality and voting for or against it. That would not necessarily reflect the views of the Labor Party, for example, on the range of issues which underlie this motion.</para><para>So we believe, firstly, that the matter is not urgent. Secondly, it is important that if this motion is to be debated it should be debated when there is an opportunity to give the matter the attention that it deserves and to deal with the full range of issues that lies behind it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>2174</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government will be opposing the motion for the suspension of standing orders. Senator Brown has not made out a case as to why the very limited time available to the Senate to debate matters should be used in this way. We had a debate on the RFA only yesterday afternoon. We will have a debate on RFA legislation in the next couple of sitting days, unless Senator Brown's tactics can delay that as well.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown wants us to suspend standing orders so that the motion relating to the support for the WA National Party's stance on clear-felling in old-growth forests can be debated. I know that the Leader of the National Party and Western Australian Deputy Premier Hendy Cowan would be very pleased to have the support of Senator Bob Brown from Tasmania for the policy, but I am sure that the most successful deputy premier in many years of Western Australia's history can probably wait a few more days to have that support reaffirmed.</para><para>Senator Brown in his discussions talked about the overwhelming upsurge of support for stopping logging in old-growth forests that is occurring, mostly from extremely wealthy, well-heeled people living in the leafy western suburbs of Perth, who I guess would love to have the support of Senator Bob Brown in this and, I guess, many of his other economic policies. Most of them live in houses that have had their floors and their roofs chopped 
 out of old-growth forests. They are really saying to the rest of the home buyers in Western Australia: `We have our houses in Peppermint Grove and Dalkeith, but you can't have yours in the northern suburbs.'</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>2175</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In relation to this motion and the question before the chamber of its urgency and the need to suspend standing orders to be able to debate it and vote on it, from the Democrats' point of view it is clearly a motion that deserves the support of the chamber. Senator O'Brien said that it is a simplistic motion. It is not simplistic; it is simple. It is very simple, it is very straightforward, it is very clear and it is very positive. For that reason it is probably unfortunate that formality was denied on the issue.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats believe that the issue of forests is an important one, as was indicated in the debate yesterday, that needs to be brought to the attention of the Australian public. It is good to see WA leading the way in highlighting public awareness about the threat to our native forests. We are always keen to encourage and express support for state governments when they are doing the right thing, when they are highlighting threats to our environment in particular, and especially when it comes from parties such as the National Party. It is a bit of a surprise that National Party colleagues are not in here at the moment to assist in congratulating their colleague. I am sure they all do that privately but it would be a great opportunity for them to express it publicly.</para><para>So the Democrats, without wanting to take up an excessive amount of time in the chamber—because we do recognise that there are a lot of other important matters, which is why it is unfortunate that formality was denied—believe that it is an important matter on a number of levels. The overall issue of the protection of our forests in Western Australia and elsewhere is one that the Senate and the parliament should express support for as often as possible in the Democrats' view. For that reason we support the motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>2175</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is urgent, as anyone in Western Australia would know. The issue is 
 urgent because at the moment the proposed RFA in Western Australia is still not presented and at the same time the Department of Conservation and Land Management are cutting down as much contentious old-growth forest as they can. There are very few people who know the situation in Western Australia who would not fully agree that the situation is urgent.</para></talk.start><para>There are very few issues I have seen take up the entire coalition conference in Western Australia, the issue having generated such huge controversy. The coalition in Western Australia considered it so urgent that almost nothing else got a guernsey at their state conference. They certainly believe it is urgent. Perhaps Senator O'Brien was not aware of the fact that the Western Australian coalition considered this their most urgent topic. The media reported it as the most urgent topic that was considered at the recent coalition conference in Western Australia.</para><para>A very large percentage of people in Western Australia, again and again, when asked, have said that this is a very important issue. A growing number of people on all sides of politics in Western Australia believe that it is time for people to put aside politics and the old prejudices and do something for the future of Western Australian forests and for the future of conservation and the sustainability of jobs.</para><para>I believe the Western Australian Labor Party are thinking of putting together a committee to look at the issue. They are saying that industry and all stakeholders should be involved in assessing the situation. Unfortunately, they didn't qualify what industry they meant. Perhaps we need to remind the Labor Party that there are other industries apart from the timber industry, but let us not judge them too harshly before that comes around.</para><para>What we don't know yet in Western Australia is what the actions of the Labor Party will be. We do know what the National Party have said. We know what the Greens and the Democrats have said in Western Australia. We are not quite sure of the ALP, but we do know that enabling legislation has gone 
 through already in the House of Representatives and was voted on by the Labor Party.</para><para>You can understand why the ALP are not wanting to consider this urgent. They are squirming because they have a huge number of constituents in Western Australia who want them to take a responsible position. Yet their federal party cannot see fit to support their Western Australian party. I can understand why the urgency of this is concerning the ALP in Canberra. I can see why people from other parts of Australia, including Tasmania, might be concerned about the pressure that has been put on their own party, as we speak, in Western Australia; the pressure has been put on all parties to put down their prejudices and come to the table and work out what is the way of the future for this industry. If we continue to put it off, the destruction will continue. If we continue to put it off, it will be in the state election the biggest issue we have seen for some time.</para><para>From the Greens' point of view, that might be to our benefit. However, that is not the way we want things to go. We want a sensible approach, a sensible outcome, and it is urgent. It is urgent because as we speak a number of areas which have been considered as high conservation value are being cut down by a department which has an in-built conflict of interest. I have to congratulate the National Party on taking a stance in Western Australia on old growth forest, but there is also another area of congratulation in Western Australia. The Labor Party have asked that the Department of Conservation and Land Management be separated; that the conservation and forestry functions be separated. That is commonsense.</para><para>At the moment, we have the National Party in Western Australia calling for a separation. We also have the Greens and I think the Democrats in Western Australia calling for a separation. The one big gap in Western Australia on that issue is the Liberal Party. But we are getting daily more and more people coming from the Liberal Party, longstanding members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, who are asking their own party to get real. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>09:59:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

Senators may recall that Landcare is not a government program, but is more accurately described as a community based voluntary program supported, encouraged and influenced by a number of Commonwealth and State Government programs.</para><para>While Landcare enjoyed a high level of initial success, the committee identified the emergence of some problems and the existence of a degree of frustration among landholders and Landcare groups, principally as a result of:</para><para>.	 The inability of landholders to obtain funding for on-ground works under the then guidelines;</para><para>.	 The possible low value of further demonstration projects;</para><para>.	 Economic constraints attributable to the rural recession;</para><para>.	 Issues were beyond the capacity of individual groups; and</para><para>.	 Commonwealth State funding arrangements.</para><para>In the 37th parliament, the Committee made a detailed and thorough investigation of a wide range of issues relevant to the delivery of Landcare programs in Australia. In 1996, the Committee tabled an interim report, which highlighted anticipated changes to the delivery of Landcare programs. In 1997, the Committee held a detailed inquiry into that changed system of delivery.</para><para>However, for a number of reasons it is no longer appropriate for the Committee to produce a final report—intervening elections, the committee's intensive involvement in other inquiries referred to it by the Senate, which assumed a greater degree of urgency, and recent changes to the funding arrangements for Landcare programs, including the introduction of the National Heritage Trust, have all meant that the inquiry has lost some of its relevance and topicality.</para><para>The new arrangements put in place by the Government are a significant reason for not pursuing the inquiry at this time. The establishment of the National Heritage Trust, a capital funding base for a number of programs, including Landcare, may 
 address some of the problems initially identified in the committee's interim report.</para><para>An assessment of the operation of the National Heritage Trust and its funding of a range of programs, including Coastcare, Landcare and Waterwatch may be appropriate once the arrangements have been in place for a significant period of time. However, at this point, the Committee feels that an assessment would be premature and would prefer to give the Trust time to demonstrate its efficacy.</para><para>Given the committee's current inquiry schedule and particularly its major inquiry into access to services by rural and regional communities, the committee feels there is little to be gained by any further work on the Landcare inquiry at this time.</para><para>I believe that the most effective use of scarce committee resources requires the committee to discontinue the inquiry into Landcare and concentrate its efforts elsewhere. I would however like to place on record my thanks to the previous Chairman of the Committee, Senator David Brownhill and to previous committee members and staff, all of whom have put such a lot of time and effort into gathering evidence for the inquiry and to those people and organisations who gave evidence or made submissions to the inquiry.</para><para>16 February, 1999</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That the report be adopted.</para><para>I wanted to remind the Senate that the Landcare program was originally the brainchild, if you like, of the NFF's Rick Farley and the ACF's Phillip Toyne. I think the program has been a very significant social movement and has made an environmental contribution to this country. The program is certainly far from over. But one of the issues that the committee has to deal with is the significant change in policy that has occurred under this government. We will continue to monitor that program, but it is not possible to monitor it under the current terms of reference.

If not addressed in a comprehensive and timely fashion, it has the potential to cause significant disruption across the entire economy. Inadequate remediation could cause services to fail. Insufficient information concerning the extent of any risk could cause the community to undertake unnecessary and costly contingency measures (such as the hoarding of cash and foodstuffs) with detrimental economic and social effects.</para><para>This bill addresses this concern by providing a framework to encourage the voluntary disclosure and exchange of information about Year 2000 computer problems, remediation efforts and compliance.</para><para>At present, statements made in good faith for the purpose of sharing information on Year 2000 readiness issues can, under certain circumstances, 
 expose a person to legal liability. Legal risk could relate to:</para><para>.	 negligent misstatement—where statements that are relied upon cause loss or injury;</para><para>.	 defamation—where statements have the effect of injuring a business or personal reputation; or</para><para>.	 breach of contract—where consumers choose either to purchase a product, or elect to terminate a contract with a supplier, as a result of a Year 2000 statement.</para><para>The most likely circumstances in which liability for a Year 2000 statement may arise are under section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (dealing with conduct that is misleading and deceptive) and section 53 of that act (relating to false representation of the standard of goods).</para><para>The threat of legal liability is often cited by organisations (including governments) as a significant reason for their reluctance to reveal information about their Year 2000 preparedness to other bodies, or assist other organisations to achieve early compliance.</para><para>The Year 2000 computer date issue is much more than an Information Technology problem. It is a whole of business management problem. Preparing for the Year 2000 problem requires organisations to address not only their internal systems, but also the Year 2000 preparedness of their suppliers, service providers and customers upon whom they rely.</para><para>The lack of accurate and relevant information is hindering the ability of organisations to check thoroughly these supply chains. It is also impacting on, and adding significantly to the costs of, developing appropriate contingency plans.</para><para>Large organisations need to be encouraged to provide remediation advice to small businesses, thereby helping to minimise the risk of small business failure. Availability of reliable information to the public will lessen the potential for unnecessary concern and uninformed reaction which itself could have adverse social and economic consequences.</para><para>Australia is acknowledged internationally as a world leader in addressing the Year 2000 problem. The Government has been active since 1997 remediating its own systems with the aim of maintaining service continuity, and promoting awareness of the Year 2000 problem to business and the wider community. In the 1998-1999 Budget, as an incentive to business to address the problem, the Government announced that most Year 2000 related software expenditures would be immediately deductible for taxation purposes.</para><para>However, a considerable cooperative effort is still required if Australia is to be fully prepared for the potential impacts of the date change. If incentives 
 are not provided to encourage disclosure and information sharing on Year 2000 processing, it is unlikely that there will be any major increase in current levels of activity.</para><para>This bill demonstrates the Government's leadership and ongoing commitment to respond to the challenges presented by the Year 2000 problem by providing an environment in which organisations are encouraged to act responsibly.</para><para>The bill will provide greater certainty to those organisations that wish to make statements to clients and the public concerning their levels of Year 2000 preparedness. It will encourage organisations to be more open about their level of Year 2000 readiness. This will assist organisations to check their supply chains and target their contingency planning more effectively at areas of real risk. It will also assist large companies to assist the remediation efforts of smaller firms—the so called `Good Samaritan' effect.</para><para>The bill will not impose direct costs on business or impose administrative burdens. The strictly voluntary nature of any Year 2000 disclosure statement will allow business to control any costs associated with the making of such a statement.</para><para>In addition, the removal of some risks for governments and business in providing publicly available information on Year 2000 preparedness will assist in addressing community concerns about the possible risks or otherwise of service failures.</para><para>The bill has many parallels with the Year 2000 Information Readiness Disclosure Act introduced in the United States of America in October 1998.</para><para>The bill will, under certain circumstances, protect a person from civil liability arising out of the making of a Year 2000 disclosure statement. The scope of the protection will be narrow and will apply for a limited period.</para><para>Protection from civil liability for a Year 2000 statement will be limited to clearly identified and authorised written disclosure statements that relate to Year 2000 processing. Apart from dealing with Year 2000 processing problems, these statements will be able to deal with planned activities to mitigate the consequences of potential problems relating to Year 2000 processing. Protection will also extend to a person republishing an original Year 2000 disclosure statement.</para><para>The bill will not provide protection from civil action in relation to:</para><para>.	 Year 2000 disclosure statements which were made recklessly, or known to be materially false or misleading;</para><para>.	 actions instituted by consumers in relation to goods or services which they had purchased following inducements provided by a Year 2000 disclosure statement, such as where a product or 
 service fails as a result of a Year 2000 service failure;</para><para>.	 Year 2000 disclosure statements made in the context of entering into a contract;</para><para>.	 Year 2000 disclosure statements made in the context of obligations imposed by a contract or a Commonwealth, State or Territory law; or.</para><para>.	 proceedings, or the exercise of regulatory or enforcement power, by a regulator or enforcement body.</para><para>A Year 2000 disclosure statement will not be taken to amend a contract unless the parties agree otherwise. Provisions of the bill will not alter any intellectual property rights. The bill ensures that arrangements for the disclosure and exchange of Year 2000 information between competitors in an industry are exempt from section 45 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. That section prohibits certain arrangements which have the effect of substantially lessening competition.</para><para>The range of exceptions in the bill maintains the capacity of regulators to carry out their statutory roles to act in the public interest, and ensures that the rights of consumers, as set out in the Trade Practices Act 1974, will be unaffected. By maintaining the rights of consumers, and the rights of individuals to take action in the event of Year 2000 product or service failure, the bill will not weaken incentives for government and business to continue remediation work.</para><para>The Government intends to monitor the operation of the bill following its enactment to ensure that its aims are not being frustrated. Should any abuses come to light, the Government will act swiftly to move appropriate amendments.</para><para>The bill will have implications for State and Territory law, including in the areas of tort and defamation law. However, the Government considers that the unique circumstances of the Year 2000 problem warrant such action, which should not be treated as a precedent. The provisions of the bill are time limited, with all effects ceasing on 1 July 2001.</para><para>The States and Territories will be free to enact their own Year 2000 information disclosure legislation. Any such legislation will be able to operate to the extent to which it is consistent with the bill.</para><para>Where a self-Governing Territory, such as the ACT, Northern Territory or Norfolk Island, enacts its own Year 2000 Information Disclosure legislation, regulations will be able to be made to limit the application of the bill to that Territory.</para><para>Conclusion</para><para>This bill, by significantly reducing barriers to disclosure and information sharing by industry and governments, will help accelerate the rate of Year 2000 remediation progress. 
</para><para>The bill provides the opportunity for Australia to enhance its position as a world leader in tackling the Year 2000 computer date problem. Any increase in the level of Australia's Year 2000 readiness will have positive effects on Australia's international competitiveness.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carr</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the resumption of the debate on the second reading of this bill be made an order of the day for a later hour this day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>2182</page.no><id.no>r653</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>2182</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 17 February.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2182</page.no><name role="metadata">The CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The committee is considering the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 as amended and amendments moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner.

 (10.26 a.m.)—Yesterday I was addressing the three amendments that I had moved. I will not go over the points that I made earlier in this debate. Suffice to say, let me remind the committee that yesterday I indicated that the opposition moved these amendments because of our belief that it is essential that we tighten the definition of associated entity. These amendments will close the loophole in the event of a loan being forgiven and ultimately becoming a gift. They also prevent loans from being received from anyone other than a registered financial institution unless certain information such as terms and conditions of the loan are disclosed. The amendments now before the chair specifically go to the issue of the actual receipt of loans.</para><para>The primary problem that we have with the $4,650,000 Greenfields loan is that we have no evidence to suggest or prove that it is a loan given on commercial terms. In fact, to the contrary, we do know, from their annual return, that the Liberal Party made annual payments of $100,000 to the Greenfields Foundation. As a $100,000 per annum repayment on a $4.65 million loan, we can say that it is certainly at the very lucrative rate of 2½ per cent. There does not appear to be any indication that there would be any commercial rate of interest or that the loan was made on a commercial basis. The evidence just mounts for such a loan being forgiven. The loan would then constitute a gift.</para><para>During questioning at the Senate estimates, the AEC conceded that a 2½ per cent interest rate on a loan would give reasonable grounds to assume that the loan was not on a commercial basis and possibly even constituted a gift. Of course it is. It is $4.65 million that the Liberal Party will never have to repay in full. It has no intention of repaying it in full, and that is just the $4.65 million that has been disclosed so far up until the end of the last financial year. We do not know what money changed hands after that. That, of course, was in the lead-up to the federal election last year.</para><para>Our amendments would prohibit a loan from being received from anyone other than a registered financial institution unless certain information was disclosed. Basic information such as the terms and conditions of the loan 
 and details about the individual or organisation from whom the loan was received is the sort of information that we are talking about. I believe that this information would greatly assist the Australian Electoral Commission in their investigation and pursuit of possible or suspected associated entities. The amendments do not prohibit loans from being received; they just say that if you get a loan from an organisation other than a registered financial institution then you have to disclose enough about that loan to inform the AEC as to whether it is on a commercial basis or not—in other words, if it would actually constitute a gift.</para><para>During yesterday's debate, the minister and, I think, his office flagged some concerns with these amendments. Initially, these concerns were about certain credit cards such as Diners Club and American Express being caught up by not fitting our definition, as I understand it, of `registered financial institution'. The concern that was expressed was that credit card debts may need disclosure. That is not the intent of the amendments, so we offered to work with the government to find a suitable form of words to ensure that that was not a problem. The government was either unable or, I suspect, unwilling to help us, so we have revised our amendments to insert after `loan' the words `of $1,500 or more', which would eliminate minor credit card transactions. I commend that revision in the amendment to the committee.</para><para>We were also advised by the AEC that significant payments to credit card companies such as Diners Club and American Express are not featuring in the annual returns. So I have to say that either the government is looking for problems here where there are none or perhaps it is just that the Liberal Party is not disclosing its payments to American Express or Diners Club—I do not know. But I think the revision to the amendment very effectively deals with this issue.</para><para>The minister also indicated that the government had concerns about there being no definition of a loan in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which might present problems for our amendments regarding loans. We heard what the minister said. I do not know 
 whether there was any basis for it, but you have to accept these things on face value. So we have also inserted in our revised amendments on sheet 1244 a definition of a loan which we have, frankly, pinched from the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 109D(3), that being, a loan is:</para><para>(a) an advance of money; and</para><para>(b) a provision of credit or any other form of financial accommodation; and</para><para>(c) a payment of an amount for, on account of, on behalf of or at the request of, an entity, if there is an express or implied obligation to repay the amount; and</para><para>(d) a transaction (whatever its terms or form) which in substance effects a loan of money.</para><para>As I say, that definition of a loan, which was the second area where the government and government staff were suggesting there might have been a weakness, has been effectively addressed by using that definition from the Income tax Assessment Act.</para><para>The minister and the Prime Minister and others in the government have been peddling what have been pretty pathetic lines from the National Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Crosby, who has really, I think, been making a bit of a fool of himself in the national press by trying to set his own definitions of a loan versus a debt. I think the Department of Finance and Administration understands what a loan is. Hopefully, this definition, as set out in the Income Tax Assessment Act, will help Mr Crosby and Mr Ron Walker understand—along with the minister at the table and the Prime Minister. I think it is really the role of the opposition to help them out when they are struggling in this regard, so that definition is included in our revised amendment.</para><para>As for the government and the Greenfields Foundation, if they are really fair dinkum and they want to prove that they are not rorting the electoral system by using forgivable loans as gifts then I think they should not have any fear of these amendments. If these amendments were to be adopted, I think it would be a very significant improvement in the Electoral Act, and I commend them to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>2183</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At 
 the outset, I will correct things for the record. Senator Faulkner said that the government has been unwilling to help. I think the officers from the Electoral Commission did meet with someone from Senator Faulkner's office yesterday. I dispute that we have been unwilling to try to resolve this matter. The government's genuine approach to this matter is evidenced by supporting the first three amendments proposed by the opposition.</para></talk.start><para>The situation in relation to the remaining three amendments is, for a number of reasons, problematical. I appreciate that the opposition has revised its previous wording. But, at the outset, I would say that the government still has a problem with the wording as proposed by the opposition. The opposition amendment proposes to add a new section to division 4 of part 20 of the Electoral Act. This division of the act deals with disclosure of donations.</para><para>The government notes that the opposition has modelled this provision on the wording contained in present section 306, which deals with certain gifts not to be received by political parties and candidates. The government also notes that the terms of proposed section 306A are not exactly the same as those in current section 306. In particular, the government notes that the proposed provision does not limit the receipt of a loan to those circumstances listed in section 306 for the receipt of a gift. So what you have is not a complete replication, if you like, of a provision dealing with loans such as the one we currently have dealing with gifts.</para><para>Proposed section 306A would cover all loans received by a political party, state branch of a political party, a person acting on behalf of a political party, a candidate, a member of a group or person acting on behalf of a candidate or group and not just loans received for the benefit of the party, branch, candidate or group. The coverage is wide indeed.</para><para>Given that a difference in wording is employed, it would be reasonable to assume that the proposed provision was intended to be interpreted in a manner that was different from the general interpretation given to section 306. This is a reasonable conclusion because there is a departure between 306A 
 and the current 306. It would be open, for example, to interpret the provision to mean any loan of more than $1,500 received by a candidate at any time during the relevant disclosure period.</para><para>That raises the question of a situation where you have an unsuccessful candidate in a previous election. Where you have someone who has run unsuccessfully in an election and who then renominates at a subsequent election, the relevant disclosure period covers all the preceding time running from the second election to a period starting 30 days after the previous election. That could cover a period nearly as long as three years.</para><para>What is problematical here is that this coverage could include all personal loans made to the individual possibly for the benefit of some other person or entity. This could include loans taken out by a candidate for the benefit of a spouse, a sibling or an organisation for which the candidate was a guarantor—in other words, personal matters relating to that candidate. It could cover all manner of things—hire-purchase agreements, home loans, personal loans. Also, the proposed definition of `loan' in the opposition's provision is the first time that an attempt has been made to have the term `loan' defined in the Electoral Act.</para><para>The proposed definition is broad in that it covers any form of financial accommodation and any transaction, whatever its terms or form, which in substance affect a loan of money. The government has not had the opportunity to have this definition considered in detail by parliamentary counsel and is, therefore, unable to inform the Senate as to the possible implications of the provision. I note that the opposition say they have taken the term `loan' from taxation legislation. I understand that definition to have been in place for only a year, so it has not yet been fully tested.</para><para>It would be premature to include that definition in the Electoral Act, in that you are looking at a term which is being used for taxation purposes. What I am saying here is that, really, this definition is something which has been transposed by the opposition from one piece of legislation to another. That is not 
 normally a wise course of action, because the respective pieces of legislation could well require different definitions.</para><para>What is clear is that the proposed provision will treat credit card debts incurred by way of Mastercard or Visa cards quite differently from debts incurred by way of credit providers who are, in effect, financial associations, such as Diners Club or American Express. They are different in their make-up to Visa card and Mastercard. The position of credit providers like AGC, who have an association with a financial institution but are not necessarily themselves a financial institution, is unclear.</para><para>The opposition, I assume, would argue that this would not be a problem because the proposed provision only involves debts in excess of $1,500. It is, however, not clear in the proposed provision whether the $1,500 limit is a cumulative or aggregate figure. It is quite possible that the provision could be interpreted to mean a loan by way of credit advance by a credit company over the full disclosure period and not just each individual transaction. In these circumstances, it could be necessary for every candidate to detail every credit card transaction where that credit card was not held with a financial institution and the total credit provided exceeded $1,500. This, I would submit, is not an intended result.</para><para>In summary, the government does not object to the principle incorporated in the opposition's provision. What the government believes should happen is that this matter should be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for thorough investigation. The government believes that there is merit in what the opposition is proposing. But what it does say is that this has not stood the test of sufficient scrutiny and investigation. The government has supported the first three proposals put forward by the opposition. The remaining three, it says, require investigation, and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is the place where that should be done.</para><para>I reiterate that the government is not unwilling to look at this matter. It is not a question of the government disagreeing in principle 
 with what the opposition is proposing. It is not a question of the government being obstructive. It is a question of the government saying, `This is a very involved area where the technical detail has to be right.' We have a mechanism in place to give this sufficient scrutiny, and that is the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which already has, as its terms of reference, a review of the last election. This matter could be easily incorporated in that review. On that basis, the government cannot see its way clear to supporting these proposals by the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>2185</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Very briefly, I think that even the most generous person would have to describe that contribution by the minister on this important issue as particularly weaselly. Minister, one can come only to the conclusion that you do not want the definition of a loan placed by your own government in the Income Tax Assessment Act in this particular act because you simply have got something to hide.</para></talk.start><para>Minister, you have indicated to us that this was the definition of a loan that came about as an amendment to legislation brought about while your own government was in office. You are saying there might be some weaknesses in the definition. If there are weaknesses in the definition, you should not have seen your way clear to enshrine it in the Income Tax Assessment Act. I think that is an extremely long bow for you to draw here in the committee, and the committee is entitled to be very cynical and sceptical about the nature of the carefully worded response that you have given, describing, in our own words, some of this as problematical. I do not think it is problematical legislatively, and I think you know that. It is problematical politically and it is problematical politically only to the Liberal Party. That is the problem we have got here.</para><para>The opposition wants to ensure this loophole or apparent loophole in the Electoral Act is closed so it cannot be exploited in the way it has been exploited thus far through the use of the Greenfields Foundation vehicle. That is our intention. Not one substantive argument 
 comes forward from you. I am not convinced on this occasion about some suggestion that a reference to the joint standing committee is the way to go. If we have a situation which does not deal with a massive exploitation of an apparent loophole in the act to the tune of a $4.65 million loan, then perhaps the issue can go off to the JSCEM. The problem there, as you know full well, Minister, is that there is a government majority on that committee.</para><para>This matter has been one of considerable public debate and notoriety now for in excess of a year since the activities of the Greenfields Foundation were first exposed. This committee has looked at this issue before. At that time it determined not to move in the direction that the opposition strongly argued for in relation to closing the loophole, but since that time more evidence has come forward. The AEC has served notice under the act and, frankly, Minister, you have not been able to put up any argument at all in relation to these amendments. It is merely that they do not suit the political party which you are a member of. I think you have to be a little broader than that. We have to look at the integrity of our electoral system and the integrity of the act. If any political party decides it is going to take a course of action which deliberately contravenes the spirit of the act and attempts to exploit an apparent loophole in the act, then I think the committee and this parliament have a responsibility to act.</para><para>It was a miserable defence, Minister, with respect. I think these are very strong amendments. The substantive issues that were raised by you, Minister, have clearly been addressed in the revised amendments in relation to credit cards and the definition of a loan. I am very doubtful on the issue of credit cards, but they may well have had some substance in relation to the definition of a loan. If it is an issue, it has been resolved in the revised amendment. I commend these amendments to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>2186</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been listening to the contributions made by both Senator Faulkner and Senator Ellison. Clearly, if this is to be effective at all, there must be a definition of 
 a loan. If I did not know the minister as being one of the most honourable and efficient members of this government, I would have thought he was having a lend of us by the response that he gave to us. The minister says that there has not really been time for the OPC to have a look at this. I think it is a very important issue, and the OPC frequently drops everything at the request of a government to have a look at a very important question. The definition of a loan is important for the integrity of this measure. The minister himself says the government agrees with propositions one, two and three. If the general thrust of the policy that appears to be accepted right throughout the chamber is going to be truly effective, then we do need to have a definition of a loan.</para></talk.start><para>Failing anything else, I think the chamber ought to adopt the definition that is in the taxation legislation. Mind you, there are a number of things in the taxation legislation with which many of us disagree, including the rather cumbersome proposition in the taxation legislation which deals with the question of avoidance. It empowers the Taxation Commissioner to deem that an act that has been done in fact has not been done and that an act that has been done was done at another time than it was done. We came across it the other day. It is in the taxation legislation, but it is also in the legislation that is coming before us, the GST legislation. As I say, I think the OPC can at times use more felicitous words than it does to achieve the policy objectives.</para><para>Failing any other suggestions before the chamber, I feel inclined now to vote for the definition as contained in the taxation legislation. No doubt there will be time to amend the legislation if it proves to be insufficient for the purpose, unless there is some big rush on at the present moment to get everything in place for a double dissolution later this year. If that is not the case, why not put it in now and then we will have plenty of time to amend the legislation if the definition of `loan' in the taxation legislation is proven to be inadequate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>2186</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Having listened to the debate and to Senator Harradine's contribution, the Demo

If I am illiterate or innumerate, then I clearly would know which party I wanted to vote for but I may not be able to write the numbers one to nine or the numbers one to 15 sequentially. I know that for most people that is probably a fairly hard prospect to comprehend. But in places like outback Western Australia—I had a discussion with my colleague Senator West yesterday about this—and particularly the Northern Territory, you have very elderly and senior traditional Aboriginal people who do not know how to write the numbers. That is one problem I know we have ascertained during the last few elections.</para><para>They do not always vote Labor. In fact, statistics will show you that is not the case. So this is not a party political discussion here; this is about pressing an argument to maintain people's right to be able to have a confidential vote. It means that a disabled or an illiterate person, who clearly knows whom they want to vote for, ask their voter's friend—Senator Faulkner referred to them as a voter's friend; it might be a relative or it might be somebody else in the community—to come into the polling booth with them. They probably say to them, `I want to vote for this party. Can you mark my ballot paper for me?' That is what that person does. At the moment that is all that happens. That vote stays confidential between the voter and the person who is marking their ballot paper. Then the ballot paper is put in the box.</para><para> At the moment, if that person has no assistant, then the presiding officer marks the ballot paper and, of course, scrutineers can be present. The current situation is that we can 
 have two people in a ballot box, and sometimes three if the presiding officer is there. But what you are proposing is that the person can bring in their assistant to vote but the presiding officer must be the person who marks the ballot paper. So already the confidentiality is gone. But not only that, the suggestion is that the presiding officer must also be watched by scrutineers, if they are there, and the assistant's friend, if that person is there.</para><para> In the situation where a person clearly knows who they want to vote for but just cannot mark the ballot paper, we have gone from having two people or maybe three people currently to having possibly five people watching that vote. Under the current situation, though, if you feel that a person is being intimidated by their friend or the presiding officer to vote in a way they do not want to, then the scrutineers from either party can step in if they feel that somebody is being coerced into a vote.</para><para> What the changes are suggesting is that it automatically assumes that that vote must be supervised. I do not agree with the fact that people who are disabled, blind or illiterate need to have this overly prescriptive policing. We are talking about people who already have some inequity in society and who probably are not as strong in forcing their rights. I am wondering why there is a proposal to have scrutineers compelled to be present, if they are there, or to have the presiding officer being compelled to mark their ballot paper—when that is not necessarily the case. If you leave the wording in the act as it is now, it does not preclude the presiding officer from marking the ballot paper and it does not currently prevent scrutineers from intervening. But the changes require that those other people must be present. I think it severely restricts the right of people to vote as secretly as possible.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>2189</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I can understand the points that have been made by Senator Crossin, but I think you have to look at the question in this way: there needs to be some certainty, some guarantee, that how the person with a disability desires to vote has been recorded on that 
 ballot paper. You can have a situation where a friend, relative, et cetera, is being asked by the person with a disability to accompany them and to fill out the ballot paper, but there is no guarantee that that will be in the manner precisely that the person with the disability wants.</para></talk.start><para>I come to the general question. I disagree with the government. I am not supporting the proposal that the presiding officer and the scrutineers be present with the voter and the voter's friend. That is five in the box, which is getting a bit cosy.</para><para>Some of the people who are concerned have put to me that this could take place in a very small town where the scrutineers of the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the Democrats are known around the place—they might see the person in the pub on Friday or whatever—and they are going to know how that person with a disability voted. The question is: are they under the same penalty regime as an officer or as a worker of the Australian Electoral Commission?</para><para>So far as I understand, they are in respect of the disclosure but they are certainly not in respect of their continuing employment in the Electoral Commission, because they are not employed by the Electoral Commission. That is the added discouragement, if discouragement is needed, for the presiding officer, for example, to disclose how that person voted. That dissuasion is not there so far as the political party's scrutineers are concerned.</para><para>I can understand why the government has brought forward this measure—at present only the friend is required to be present. Unless Senator Brown can see his way clear to amending the legislation to require the presiding officer to be present, then we go back to the old act and the only person who is required by the voter to be present is the friend.</para><para>So all in all I suppose I have a halfway position. I haven't got an amendment to the amendment, but I am concerned about what the government is proposing here. Senator Brown has gone a very long way to remedy that, but I personally feel that the presiding officer needs to be present to guarantee the basic principle that what the voter wants recorded is recorded.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>2190</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Harradine made some very good points. It is a complex matter. One thing that needs to be noted is that the very big majority of people who would be affected by the change in provisions here are indigenous people, or people who do not speak the English language—ethnic people who speak other languages. In that situation the presiding officers are really not going to be able to intervene in the relationship between the friend and the voter because the voter is going to be giving instructions in that language and the presiding officer is therefore not going to be party to whether those instructions are being carried out anyway. That is the major group that is affected in this situation.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Harradine is quite right. With sight-impaired people the situation will be different. The presiding officer will give the assurance that the instructions are being carried out. However, the weight of the argument is very much in favour of just the friend being present. As Senator Crossin says, there is even some intimidation felt, rightly or wrongly, by people in small communities if a presiding officer is present and watching what they are doing. The law is there to make sure that that presiding officer does not say how you voted. Nevertheless, if you put yourself in the position of the voter, with the presiding officer present you would feel uncomfortable. That discomfort ought not be there in a system of secret voting, which is going to be valid as far as possible for all people. The best we can do is have the friend situation. In the absence of any strong argument brought forward, as Senator Faulkner said, the situation as it currently stands is far preferable to the one the government amendments would create.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>2190</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand what Senator Brown is saying.

The presiding officers' presence in the booth with two people who are not speaking English and who are deciding how to mark a vote is not going to help ensure anything, other than that a voting paper is delivered to the ballot box, which is going to happen anyway. But it is going to bring a presiding officer unnecessarily into the booth to watch the vote being cast by people who do not speak English. There is no advantage in that happening, but there is a very clear disadvantage.</para></talk.start><para>Many indigenous people, those that Senator Crossin was talking about, are unfairly going to have a presiding officer in the ballot box watching their vote being cast, without any advantage. I do not think that is too different from the presiding officer being in the ballot

We really ought to leave it to the judgment of the person who is making the vote for their friend. I think that is the best that can be done.

A more sensible thing to do is for the committee to omit these items, to have a look at it, having sought evidence from people who are directly involved. If we are going to go down the track, let us not do it in a half-hearted way. Let us take some evidence and be absolutely clear that any change we make to the act is a good one and a sensible one that will work in the interests of the AEC and the electoral process and those voters who may have a physical incapacity or impairment, voters who might be illiterate or voters who might not have English as a first language and so on.

I have refrained from speaking to date. I have listened to some of the various views that have been put forward. As has been said by one other contributor, drafting or amending on the run is a fairly risky process, particularly when you are dealing with a reasonably sizeable act like the Electoral Act. The issues that have been raised are very important ones. The Democrats have also had similar representations from community organisations.</para></talk.start><para>I think the concerns that have been put forward by Senator Crossin and others and the representations that the Democrats have received are sufficiently strong that we would 
 not be of a mind to support the section of the legislation, as it stands, that seeks to amend the act.</para><para>I do take on board Senator Harradine's concern about the need—and this is obviously the intention of the amendment—for the presiding officer, as an impartial officer of the Electoral Commission, to witness the vote to ensure that the person's vote is being cast in the way that they intend. Although I must say that if there are two people in a polling booth talking in a traditional Aboriginal language and the presiding officer does not know the language, then I am not sure how they are going to be able to be sure about whether the voter's desires are being fulfilled anyway. I suspect that is something that would be very difficult to absolutely guarantee without requiring access to translators and so on, which would obviously become impractical. But it is an important issue.</para><para>A lot of different competing issues come in, such as the privacy aspect that was raised—the problem of having, particularly in smaller areas, smaller towns, two or three scrutineers watching over your shoulder and seeing how you vote and being able to wander off down the road and tell the rest of the town, or the prospect of that anyway. That is certainly a serious concern, and certainly a fundamental component of our electoral system stretching back many years is the right to a secret ballot. I think it is important to emphasise—in fact, from memory, from reading through a few of the submissions that have already come in to the current inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—that that is an issue that has been raised by a member of the public in relation to the fact that visually impaired people actually do not have the right or the opportunity to be able to cast a secret ballot in many circumstances currently.</para><para>It is important to emphasise that because it is a fundamental principle of our act and of our electoral tradition. On the surface this may seem like a small matter but it actually deals with some fairly fundamental principles in respect of the operation of our Electoral Act—whether it is a secret ballot issue as against, obviously, another crucial issue of whether the person's vote is being cast in a 
 way that meets their wishes. It is also very important to maximise the opportunity to guarantee that.</para><para>Those are some of the competing issues that are involved in this part of the bill. Certainly, as it stands, to require only the presiding officer to be able to mark the ballot paper and also to enable any number of scrutineers to witness the whole operation is something that the Democrats believe is not an appropriate solution to what the government is trying to address, and we do not support this section of the bill as it stands.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>2193</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Temporary Chairman, can I ask the minister a question through you?

I say again to the committee: the smart thing here is to omit these particular items that somehow—not via the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters but through some other processes that remain unknown to me and unknown to the committee, and perhaps unknown to the government and its advisers—have turned up in this bill that we are debating in the committee stage in this Senate. The truth is the specific proposals contained in these items ought to be examined.

I certainly accept that Senator Crossin, for example, knows a great deal more about it than I do and has had a lot more personal experience with it than I have. Most senators are in exactly the same boat as I am.</para><para>What is the sensible thing to do in this circumstance? I do not want be conned that this has come out of the joint standing committee. It has not. The recommendation of the joint standing committee has very little to do with the items that are before us. Let's do this properly in the time available. This is the point of Senator Harradine made just a moment ago in debating another amendment before the committee. We have got enough time to do this properly. This significant change to the act that might affect many people in the community who want to participate in the democratic process should not be dealt with in this way.</para><para>I strongly believe that it would be inappropriate for us to report progress because, if we do, we are not going to have the advan 
 tage of the sort of examination that I think is required in relation to this issue—if we are going to change the act and the way these provisions work. That is basically an unarguable case, and I will not be supporting a proposition that we report progress. I will certainly support Senator Brown's approach of omitting these items from the bill, and I will also be supportive of any endeavours on the part of the government or other senators who would want to see these issues investigated further in a sensible way, drawing on experiences of people who might be able to provide valuable insights and guidance for the benefit of the committee, as we seriously look at any way we might substantively change the Electoral Act.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>2194</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Well, that is Senator's Faulkner's decision, Mr Temporary Chairman, and he might have to wear it.

One of the problems—which we always grapple with—is whether or not the voter's friend accurately records the intent of the voter. That is a problem, but now that I have listened to what the report recommends, I realise it goes much further than the current suggestion before us. If you picked up what the report suggested, which was to delete section 234(1), then you miss out entirely on the intent of what a definition of a voter's friend is and how they can be appointed. So that needs to stay there. But the current legislation, particularly section 234(2), says that where there is no voter's friend, only the presiding officer can mark the ballot paper. That is a problem too, because in a booth where you have a couple of hundred people who might need that assistance, the need for the presiding officer is clearly too restrictive and you might need other polling officials to mark the ballot paper.</para></talk.start><para>In one sense, the current legislation does need amending to make it more flexible, but the set of amendments that you have put before us goes way beyond that. Requiring scrutineers to be present is too restrictive and their presence could be quite intimidating. Senator Harradine does make a valid point, but how does anybody guarantee that the voter's intention is recorded accurately unless somebody else witnesses it? It is up to the voter, of course, to get a presiding officer or a polling official to supervise what their voter's friend does, if they feel uncomfortable about it.</para><para>In one respect, I support what Senator Faulkner was saying. The person's right to be able to record their ballot secretly is too important for us to amend this on the run. But your current proposal is far too restrictive and impinges too much on a person's right to maintain their ballot as secretly as possible.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>2194</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been thoroughly convinced on one matter—that is, that the committee should not report progress—by the very cogent 
 argument put forward by Senator Faulkner. If this is going to be altered, if there is some other middle ground going to be reached and we do not have a recommendation from the relevant committee, then it ought to go back to those people who are affected. There ought to be time for that and there ought to be thorough consultation with the community—the very people who are affected by this, including the people that Senator Crossin refers to.</para></talk.start><para>The second point is that I believe Senator Harradine has not heard the argument against a polling official being present when a voter and her or his friend is in the booth, whether they like it or not. That should be an option that is available to the voter. For us to dictate that a polling official should be there as a watch on the friend because the voter does not have English as their first language or they are sight impaired not only is a declaration that the voter's choice of friend cannot be trusted but also imposes the presence of a polling official where some people may absolutely not want that.</para><para>One does not have to have much of an imagination to know that in small communities polling officials and voters are going to be mixing and the voters put at a disadvantage. So Senator Harradine's argument does not hold up, except in the circumstance that we go out to the communities and say, `Is this what you want?' We should not be imposing on the voter polling officials—presiding officers or otherwise—who are very often the local official, the local school teacher or the publican appointed for this purpose. It is quite wrong for Senator Harradine, or for me or for anybody else to be dictating that that official be there, when the voter simply wants their friend. I disagree with Senator Harradine. We should not be dictating some form of middle ground, any more than we should be accepting the dictates of the government's amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>2195</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just briefly, I note that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters did recommend that section 234(1)(b) be repealed, and that is in our amendments today.

This matter was subject to scrutiny in the previous report, the 1996 federal election report by the JSCEM, so the government says that this has been addressed previously.

The proposal before the committee should be put and voted on and we will get on with the rest of the bill.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>2195</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One of the other points that has been made that is worth re-emphasising is that, unless there is something strange happening in the mind of the government in terms of its electoral strategy, we do have plenty of time to look at this. We are not likely, one would hope, to be faced with an election immediately. We do have another joint standing committee inquiry happening which is going to report before the end of this year. I have already indicated that the Democrats are not supportive of what is in the legislation as it stands.</para></talk.start><para>I do have a lot of interest in the proposal Senator Harradine was voicing, but we obviously do not have an amendment dealing with that before us at the moment. Nor, as Senator Brown pointed out, have we had the opportunity to more fully explore the community's and the affected people's desire about this, which is an important thing. So, given the fact that, one would hope, we have two or three years before the next election and a committee inquiry is going to report before the end of the year, then the Democrats believe it is something that we should not support in its current form. We have plenty of time to look at it and come up with an improved version in the next year or two.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Ferguson)</name></talker><para>—The question is that schedule 1, items 32 to 35 and 37 to 42 stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the negative.</para><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported with amendments; report adopted.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>2196</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>) read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>2196</page.no><id.no>r602</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>2196</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 30 November 1998, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Minchin</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><para>(Quorum formed)</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>2196</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r602">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998</inline>  is an omnibus bill of some 10 measures. It was introduced into the House of Representatives in early November last year and passed with the support of the opposition in late November last year. As is usual practice, this bill gives legislative backing to this government's standard practice of policy by press release. For instance, the changes to deductible expenditure for capital gains tax purposes was announced by the Treasurer in the May 1997 budget. It is February 1999 and only now has the Senate the opportunity to examine these changes. This is just another example of the government's general incompetence when it comes to administering its legislative program. A measure that was announced nearly two years ago has finally reached this chamber. This is simply not good enough.</para></talk.start><para>To the bill itself, the measures in the main seek to make void tax avoidance schemes and, in the case of the CGT provisions relating to capital losses, the cessation of the artificial manipulation of these provisions which result in greater tax loses being claimed relative to the actual economic loss that has been incurred. For those senators who are interested, there is a good working example of this abuse on page 12 of the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</para><para>The changes to the capital loss provisions are stated as protecting $100 million in revenue. I note for the record that my col 
 league in the other chamber Mr Kelvin Thomson made mention of the fact that the Australian Taxation Office had commented on these changes in a <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> article on 20 November last. He sought from the minister a response about the effectiveness of the provisions now before us to counter the kinds of schemes that were referred to in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>. I would also seek a similar response from the minister here today as I do not remember seeing what Minister Hockey's reply to those provisions was, if he replied to them at all.</para><para>Skipping through the bill slightly but still in the area of changes to capital gains tax, schedule 7 will seek to ensure that, where an entity claims deductions for income tax purposes for capital assets, those deductions will now have to be deducted from the cost base of that capital asset for capital gains tax purposes. Building depreciation is a classic example of expenditure which will now have to be deducted from the adjusted capital cost base for a subsequently sold asset. This change will eliminate an effective double deduction for such expenditures in that, until the Treasurer's announcement, they reduced both the taxable income flow from an asset as it is earned and the amount of the capital gain which is eventually taxable when the asset is disposed of.</para><para>As stated earlier, not only is this measure nearly two years old but the Treasurer also has had to subsequently amend his original decision under pressure from the building industry and the Labor Party to provide transitional relief to taxpayers who were hit unexpectedly by the government's original announcement. Now expenditure incurred until 30 June 1999 on land or buildings owned as at the 1997 budget will not be affected. We in the opposition support this welcome change.</para><para>Schedule 10 of the bill relates to the depreciation of assets. This measure clarifies the Australian Taxation Office's interpretation of existing provisions applying to formally tax exempt entities which became the subject of taxation between 1 July 1988 and 2 July 1995. This measure will ensure consistent treatment of assets for depreciation purposes 
 for entities that came into the tax system between 1988 and 1995. Such entities include specific types of superannuation funds, some Commonwealth government business enterprises that have come into the income tax net—for example, Telstra and Australia Post—and state government business enterprises which have been privatised wholly or partially. It also includes some private entities that have lost their tax exempt status such as sporting clubs due to a change in the nature of their operations.</para><para>It is interesting to note that state governments and particularly the Kennett government in Victoria used as a selling point when flogging every state asset that he could the tax benefit from doing so of the depreciation charges available. In essence, the Kennett government was using the Commonwealth Treasury and therefore all Australian taxpayers as subsidy providers in order to prop up the sale of Victorian public assets. This measure will now put an end to such a practice.</para><para>The next measure I will discuss is schedule 9 of the bill which relates to the average calculated liabilities of life insurance companies. As the law currently stands, it requires that life companies use calculated liabilities at the end of the financial year to determine the amount of exempt income to be allocated to the immediate annuity policies. As a result, this has caused distortions where the proportion of liabilities at the end of the year do not reflect the experience through the year. Due to these distortions, the possibility exists for manipulation by life companies of these liabilities which then flow through to the amount of income tax that would be payable. Changing to an averaged calculated liabilities method will address this problem. It will protect revenue to the tune of about $100 million per annum.</para><para>While on the issue of insurance companies, schedule 8 relates to the tax treatment of the passive income of insurance companies. At present, the formula used for determining the passive income of controlled foreign companies of insurance companies is flawed. As the law is, passive income of insurance companies does not fall foul of the existing 
 rules and thereby escapes Australian tax. This allows life and general insurance companies to obtain a significant advantage in respect of offshore investment income.</para><para>This bill proposes a new formula to countenance that problem. It is estimated that it will raise some $10 million in revenue per annum. I have to say that we support this measure. We support it because it overcomes an unintended technical consequence of the existing legislation which frees some foreign income from tax when it should be subject to Australian tax.</para><para>Schedule 6 of the bill deals with the question of dividend imputation and retirement savings accounts. Under the government's proposals, dividend imputation credits or debits will be prevented from arising from the payment or refund of tax where those amounts are attributable to the RSA business of a life assurance company. This is not intended to punish RSAs relative to other superannuation funds; it simply ensures that life assurance companies do not get a windfall under the dividend imputation system. Labor supports this amendment.</para><para>Next we have schedule 4, which concerns the effect of bankruptcies on carrying forward tax offsets. These are technical amendments which simply propose that the tax rebate available for landcare type expenditures for farmers will not be available to be carried forward into future years for a taxpayer who becomes a bankrupt. We do not oppose that amendment.</para><para>Schedule 11 pertains to company tax instalments. The timing of when a company has to pay company tax depends on whether it is classified as small, medium or large—with large companies paying earlier than medium companies and small companies paying later still. The grouping measures that are part of that cover superannuation funds. The inclusion of superannuation funds is inappropriate as it can unfairly penalise a genuine medium size firm by including, for instance, a company super fund in the grouping provisions. Thus, the medium size company is treated as a large company for company tax instalment purposes when, obviously, it is not. Labor, therefore, supports this amendment.</para><para>The final measures in this bill deal with changes to the fringe benefits tax regime. The government proposes five changes to fringe benefits tax. Included amongst these is the exemption of all taxi travel to and from work from a fringe benefits tax. This extends the exemption granted by Labor in 1995 to out-of-hours travel—that is, travel after 7 p.m. or before 7 a.m. On balance, Labor has made a decision to support this amendment, as we have other proposals which involve exempting certain carparking fringe benefits provided by small business. </para><para>The other measures alter the range of provisions which deal with situations where a third party provides a fringe benefit to an employee either on behalf of an employer or with their involvement. The new proposals purport to simplify what are very complex existing rules although they may make them worse in some circumstances. Nevertheless, we do need to have rules in this area to ensure that fringe benefits tax cannot simply be avoided by someone other than the employer providing the fringe benefits. The other changes go to the way in which employers will maintain fringe benefit tax records. These proposals came out of the Bell review of small business. They are not opposed by the Labor Party.</para><para>Finally, there are some changes in the payments of tax by small companies. These benefit small businesses only and on that basis we support them. The cost to revenue of this particular measure will be negligible.</para><para>I would now like to make some general comments. When this bill was debate in the House, my colleague Mr Kelvin Thomson moved a second reading amendment in respect of the bill. To save the time of the Senate, I do not propose to do that, but I will speak on the substance of the issue the amendment went to. That issue is the government's lack of commitment to stamping out the aggressive new tax avoidance culture that has developed under this government. It is my concern that this government is blinded by ministerial personal interest as opposed to what is in the public interest when it comes to the issue of tax avoidance. This is most notable in the area of trusts.</para><para>One cannot help but wonder, every time Treasury presents a proposal regarding the abuse of trusts, whether the government conducts a survey of its frontbench members to determine whether the proposal will offend any of the trust-owning members of the government. In the last parliament, the opposition identified, from memory, 19 trust-owning, tax avoiding members of the frontbench. Whether that number has increased or not, I do not know. What I do know is that this government has been loathe to move on the issue of the tax abuse of trusts.</para><para>I remember the paper that the government was going to release on the issue of trusts and tax avoidance. This paper was never released, on the basis that the issues it discussed were subsumed into the government's overall tax reform proposals. The real reason is that the government did not want the paper in itself to become the focus of attention to which individual ministers and their trust arrangements could then be held up to proper public scrutiny.</para><para>If the government has nothing to hide then it will release the paper. The reality, though, is that this government is a supporter of the tax avoidance industry. It has as its Prime Minister a man who presided over the worst abuses of our tax system ever seen—the bottom of the harbour period. What action did we then get from the then Treasurer, Mr Howard? He took no action over bottom of the harbour until the public outcry was so loud that he could no longer ignore it. The sad fact, though, is that he acted because he was forced to do so, not because he or the then Liberal government believed it was in the public interest to do so. It was a case of Johnny-come-lately by name and Johnny-come-lately by nature.</para><para>Sadly, we see a continuation of this ambivalence in the current government. A lot of rhetoric has been put out but not much substance has accompanied it. When we look at the previous antics of someone like Senator Parer and his myriad of tax schemes, is it any wonder that this government is soft on tax avoidance and tax avoiders when the Prime Minister himself condoned and justified the actions of the former minister for resources?</para><para>We now see the Prime Minister has had to lower his ministerial standards to meet the failures of his ministers, rather than ensuring that these failures never occurred in the first place. On a broader level, we have had the somewhat murky relationship between the Greenfields Foundation and the Liberal Party of Australia regarding the question of a $4.5 million loan, of which the full details have only now surfaced due to the persistent pressure of the Labor Party.</para><para>In conclusion, it is the Australian Labor Party that has had to enforce the Prime Minister's now defunct code of conduct. It is the Australian Labor Party that has had to drag this government, kicking and screaming, to the issue of tax avoidance. Sadly, this government puts ministerial or personal self-interest before the public interest. But this chamber can be assured that we in the opposition will continue to hold this government and its ministers accountable—as it is obvious that the Prime Minister will not do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>2199</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am glad to have been preceded by my colleague Senator Cook, who has done a very capable wrap-up of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998. In his normal adequate and comprehensive manner, he has covered the issues raised by the legislation.</para></talk.start><para>This bill covers the denial of certain capital losses, deductible expenditure and capital gains cost bases, depreciation, average calculated liabilities of life insurance companies, passive income of insurance companies, dividend imputation and retirement savings account changes, the effect of bankruptcy on carrying forward tax offsets, company tax instalments, payments of tax by small companies and, to the particular benefit of small business, fringe benefits tax changes. That is an awfully boring list when you read it out like that.</para><para>However, this kind of legislation is the bedrock of sound government administration. Most of these changes are very welcome and, in fact, improve both the integrity and the administration of the tax act and will contribute to the better management of tax affairs by businesses. So, overall, our compliments 
 go to the government on the bill. As you would have gathered from my remarks, we do support the bill. In particular, we are happy to see some of the onerous requirements of fringe benefits tax reporting being lifted from small business.</para><para>We also welcome the remarks of Senator Cook, although we probably would not express them in precisely the same manner. We certainly support his very strong urging of the government to pay attention to areas which are causing the tax office and the community at large—and, hopefully, the government itself—great concern. One of those areas is the erosion of our tax base and the integrity of our tax system through very aggressive tax planning which, to use a very commonly overworked term, is profoundly un-Australian, never mind anything else. I am sure that you are taking that to heart—at least I hope you are—and that both the tax office and the government will move to crack down on tax avoidance and unacceptable tax minimisation.</para><para>I would make the point that, contrary to recent comments of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Australian Democrats are delighted to support fair and sensible removal of regulation from small business where that policy change is fair to all concerned—and we consider this to be one of those cases. We are also pleased to see the closing of the loophole in respect of artificially created capital losses.</para><para>As you know, the non-government parties and the government itself receive a lot of submissions from interested parties where such legislation is of interest to them. We have received very little correspondence in this area, and that indicates the full support in the community at large for this bill, despite it being lengthy and, no doubt, having a few little glitches and twitches here and there. But I think it points to the difference between this kind of legislation—legislation which the Senate can accept and will deal with quickly—and that of the ANTS tax reform package, which also is before us.</para><para>The other day, one of my fellow senators made a remark about the stupidity of those who need to take time to properly consider 
 legislation in this place. Just briefly, in response to that, we all know that the Senate is traditionally the chamber that reviews government legislation and subjects it to far greater scrutiny than ever occurs in the House of Representatives. Indeed, it is as a result of this scrutiny, in my opinion—and in the opinion of Australians, who vote differently in the Senate from the way they vote in the House of Representatives—that better legislation is delivered.</para><para>As we all know, this chamber has an extensive committee system, which allows for substantial public input and in-depth scrutiny of legislation; it is an invaluable process. But it is a process which, quite simply, takes time. It consumes a substantial amount of senators' time and a lot of resources. We are all in this chamber, across all the range of issues we deal with, generalists. There are very few specialists in this chamber. Therefore, we need to acquaint ourselves with the meaning of legislation and with its consequences.</para><para>The senator who made the remark about the stupidity of those who need to take time to properly consider legislation, I believe, might have been reflecting his own frustration at the fact that he probably had a lot more impact on legislation when he was in opposition than he now has in government.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government senator interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—That may reflect an overheard remark and, therefore, I will not attribute it to the senator concerned. But it does indicate the difference between the frustrations of those in government, for whom every bill is urgent and unchangeable, and those of us who are non-government senators, whose job it is to do the difficult, and sometimes awkward, job of review.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The contrast between this bill and the 16 tax bills—which, I suspect, will increase to about 22—which govern the ANTS tax package is quite marked. Those bills represent over 600 pages of new legislation. Their effect will be to impose a new tax system. In contrast, we can, quite readily and easily, deal quite quickly with this bill. A new tax system strains the intelligence or the stupidity, depending upon your view of the rest of us in this chamber, much, much more.</para><para>As a party committed to review, we make no apologies for the process of review. But we make no apologies either for at times allowing a bill straight through with no amendments from us because, in our opinion, it is a good bill. This is one of those instances. We commend the government for bringing the bill before us. We indicate to you our support for it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>2200</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r602">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998</inline>  contains an array of provisions, including a crackdown on tax avoidance measures relating to the artificial creation of capital losses, changes to the calculation of capital gains tax, changes to an entity's tax status to cut down on depreciation advantages, reduction in compliance costs relating to fringe benefits tax and clarification of dividend imputation credits for life insurance companies. On the whole, the Greens (WA) are supportive of these measures. However, I would like to focus on two main issues raised by this bill. Firstly, I would like to discuss issues relating to tax avoidance and, secondly, I want to discuss the fringe benefits tax regime.</para></talk.start><para>This bill attempts to tackle some areas that have been exploited for tax breaks. The Greens are certainly supportive of moves in this direction. However, we have major concerns about the government's general apathy in tackling some of the biggest issues in tax avoidance in Australia. The problem of tax avoidance in Australia is becoming more and more of a talking point. As Jennie George, President of the ACTU, has recently pointed out in committee hearings on the tax package, PAYE taxpayers are feeling that they are the only ones paying their fair share of tax in this country. They feel as if they do not have the ability to work the tax system and minimise their income tax as many high income earners are able to do. The average taxpayer does not have the money to be paying financial consultants, accountants and lawyers to devise elaborate schemes to evade the Australian Taxation Office. The average taxpayer cannot take advantage of the many tax effective products which are blatantly and aggressively marketed. Splashed unashamedly 
 in our weekend newspapers are advertisements that are selling expertise in tax minimisation techniques.</para><para>It may be argued that this is mere populist thinking that does not accord with reality. It may be argued that this is merely some kind of corporate bashing or cutting down the tall poppies. However, it seems that our very own Tax Commissioner shares elements of this populist thinking. It was reported earlier this month, on 1 February, on the news wire that internal memos issued by the Tax Commissioner, Michael Carmody, have warned that the tax system has been taken over by large companies and that they could not be trusted to pay their fair share of tax. Yes, our Tax Commissioner, who is absolutely in the thick of things, sees tax avoidance by large companies as a huge issue for Australia's revenue base.</para><para>Of course, the government's answer to our declining revenue base is to hit us with a GST. Certainly a broadening of consumption tax is one option that will help add to the revenue base, but at what cost? The cost is that it is the PAYE taxpayers, especially those on low incomes, who will be affected the most by the implementation of a GST. Even on the government's own figures, it is the high income earners who will gain the most from the tax package.</para><para>There is no real commitment to tackle the problems our Tax Commissioner has identified. Michael Carmody has also warned the government that the tax package will create fresh tax avoidance opportunities. Our Tax Commissioner is concerned that high income earners and businesses will take the opportunity to delay their income until July 2000 to take advantage of the tax cuts on offer. This will reduce revenue collection when the tax is finally paid. Michael Carmody estimates that it could deprive the budget of hundreds of millions—or even billions—of dollars. In addition, international experience suggests that the GST will create a whole new black market of its own.</para><para>Along with the tax package that is currently before the Senate, we have the review of business tax, the Ralph review, taking place. This review is not attempting to tackle any 
 issues such as how to maintain an adequate revenue base to meet our needs. The boundaries of the review are that it must be revenue neutral. It is also not attempting to tackle any issues of corporate tax avoidance. It would hardly be in many of the participants' interests to do so. The Greens have strongly argued that business tax should not be siphoned off into a separate debate. In fact, I moved a motion in the Senate last year to ensure the results of the review of business tax were known before the Senate debated the rest of the tax package. Unfortunately, this sensible motion was defeated so now we cannot look at the tax system as a whole and decide how we would like to structure it as a community. No, the business tax area has been shoved to one side so it cannot be touched in the more general debate about tax reform. So suggestions such as the minimum corporate tax that has been raised by many non-corporate players in the community barely rate a mention in the review of business tax. Many of these community and church groups do not have the time to engage in the RBT as they are struggling to try to inject some equity and fairness into the rest of the tax package.</para><para>Tax reform in this country needs to be holistic, transparent and fair. It is totally hypocritical of the government to undermine the Senate committee process by threatening to pull the whole tax package if the Senate makes any substantive changes. Yet, what is happening with business tax? Is the government trying to tell all those business folk making lengthy submissions that it is all in vain and that it will not be giving any concessions, making any adjustments? If the government does make concessions and alterations in the business tax arena, how can it then turn around and argue that any other changes that may benefit low income people, charities, community organisations or the environment are not possible? Could it be that there is one rule for the government's big business mates and one rule for the rest of the community?</para><para>While aspects of this bill are commendable, these measures to address avoidance do not go far enough and fail to address some of the most fundamental drains on our national 
 revenue. While the Greens (WA) would not expect one piece of legislation to be able to fix all aspects of tax avoidance, the government is closing its ears and eyes to the really big issue of tax avoidance in this country and, indeed, around the world. Obviously, the tax package put forward by the government could have realistically looked to the future and had the vision to see the realities of taxation in a global economy.</para><para>Tax officials have said that the growth of the Internet has made the use of tax havens easier than ever before. It is estimated that billions of dollars are escaping the tax net in this way. Is there any attempt to address this kind of issue? Not a mention.</para><para>One of the biggest challenges that faces Australia and the world is the ability of transnational companies, their contractors and their skilled employees to massively avoid tax. This is done by exploiting differences between national tax regimes and by using tax havens such as the Cayman Islands to hide their true financial position from the tax office. Electronic funds transfer is facilitating this massive leak from national tax revenues everywhere. We in this chamber have actually been creating a necessity for electronic transfers more and more because that is what banks want, that is what the big institutions want, and, therefore, it is easier for those institutions to avoid scrutiny.</para><para>A government with vision would be talking about the tough decisions that need to be taken to curb this kind of revenue leakage. What is really required is joint international action by governments to pursue transnational companies for tax avoidance. Others in the national arena are making these kinds of noises. It is about transfer pricing. It is about people who charge a lot for the goods they produce in the countries that charge the most tax. They make losses or only scrape even in those countries that charge the most tax, and they save their profits for those countries, or parts of their networks, which charge the least tax.</para><para>John Ralston Saul has been drawing attention to the statement recently issued by the Group of Seven in which they basically said they are going to bail out the bankrupt devel 
 oping countries. He points out that the third paragraph contains many statements of interest:</para><para>We commit to develop and implement international principles and codes of best practice on fiscal policy, financial and monetary policy, corporate governance and accounting. And to work to ensure private sector institutions comply with new standards of disclosure.</para><para>This is a good example of the moves toward joint international regulations—the way of the future that the government is failing to recognise. The Greens have been championing the kind of tax reform that goes to the heart of some of the biggest problems created by globalisation. Positive reforms such as the Tobin tax would assist in regulating the explosion of international financial speculation that acts like a giant vacuum cleaner sucking wealth from everyone around the world and concentrating it in the major financial centres located in the USA, Japan and Europe.</para><para>The government are trumpeting the fact that Australia is leading the world in bringing down tariff and non-tariff barriers. They have unilaterally reduced these rates, often to the detriment of many Australian industries and communities, and yet they shy away from being international leaders in progressive policy areas such as the Tobin tax, other international regulations of capital flows or strong stances on human rights on the basis that Australia is just a `middle power'. The Greens would like to see the government starting to talk about and engage in finding solutions to some of these issues.</para><para>The second issue I would like to briefly address is the changes to the fringe benefits tax regime. This bill relaxes the FBT regime in relation to small business and taxi travel. The Greens acknowledge that there is a difficult balance to be reached between fairly taxing all relevant income and creating enormous amounts of red tape that become a burden for small business. It is also important that strange anomalies be avoided or minimised in the quest to tax all Australians in a fair and equitable manner.</para><para>The position of the Greens (WA) on FBT and cars and parking is well known. In 
 principle, the Greens are not in favour of relaxing FBT for company cars and parking spaces as it encourages people to drive to work and generally use their cars more frequently. It is also an issue in terms of attempting to use economic measures and pricing mechanisms to encourage internalisation of the costs of the use of non-renewable resources.</para><para>The use of cars is perhaps one of the most wasteful uses of non-renewable energy in modern society. The environmental and associated health costs of using cars are well documented. There are huge health consequences from the rising levels of air pollution, but the community spends significant amounts of money rectifying or trying to rectify these health effects. Air pollution is a growing problem in our cities and the use of cars is a huge contributor to this increasing pollution. In addition, considering the growing problem of greenhouse gases, the overuse of motor vehicles is an issue that requires urgent attention. What would it mean in reality if we removed the fringe benefits tax on car parking spaces, especially where this is a substantial amount? My feeling is that it may in fact benefit those more wealthy employees for whom this is part of a tax avoidance package.</para><para>The Greens have acknowledged that compliance costs for small business is a significant issue. In our taxation platform for the previous election, one of the aims of the Greens (WA) was to reduce compliance costs where they are high, particularly where small and medium size businesses are affected. The issue of compliance costs will certainly be a big issue in the upcoming tax debate when every charity, community organisation and small business will become a mini tax agent for the government.</para><para>Indeed, Ray Reagan of the National Tax and Accountants Association has warned today that businesses face a $15 billion start-up cost to meet the introduction of the GST. In addition, he said University of New South Wales research showed the continuing annual cost to small business would run to thousands of dollars, not the $130 which the Howard government claimed. Are we really specifically aiming towards compliance costs for small 
 business? These figures show that it is unlikely that that is the aim of the government.</para><para>These issues of red tape versus using the taxation system for positive environmental outcomes are often difficult to reconcile. The Greens do acknowledge the comment of Professor Dixon that the FBT regime may not be the most effective vehicle to attempt to alter behaviour. In the absence of a user friendly transport system, many employees may drive to work any way. If this is so, the reality is that a car park is worth around $2,500 per year—more if it is in Sydney or Melbourne—and is likely to go to the more senior staff, who are likely to be high income earners. These are difficult issues to reconcile. I will be opposing changes to the fringe benefits tax on car parking, and I will discuss this issue in more detail in the committee stage of the bill.</para><para>Those companies who have located close to major transport routes, or those who have decentralised and located in areas where it is accessible and where there are not high levels of parking, may well be disadvantaged if we give a specific advantage to those companies who may be using a tax package to bolster the salaries and, therefore, competing unfairly with those companies who are trying hard to do the right thing. As I said, I will talk more about this issue in the committee stage of the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>2203</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have had a range of issues raised in the second reading debate on the <inline ref="r602">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998</inline> .

Some of them, particularly the end run of Senator Cook's speech when he was talking about the attitude of this government to tax avoidance, I totally rejected.</para></talk.start><para>Having said that, the bill contains a number of measures—some are designed to protect revenue, some make technical changes, while others demonstrate the government's commitment to assist small business. For example, small business will benefit from changes to the fringe benefits tax and from the arrangements to allow small companies to pay their 
 tax later. The revenue will be protected by denying corporate groups the ability to multiply capital losses and by preventing taxpayers from claiming double deductions in certain circumstances.</para><para>This bill also ensures that tax exempt entities that become subject to tax have depreciation deductions and balancing adjustments based on notional written down values as if the entity had always been subject to tax. Also, this bill requires life companies to use average calculated liabilities rather than calculated liabilities at the end of the year of income. Finally, the bill corrects a deficiency in the formula used to calculate passive income of controlled foreign insurance companies.</para><para>I will give some brief comments on matters that were raised during the debate. First of all, Senator Cook brought to our attention a question that Mr Kelvin Thomson asked Mr Hockey during the debate in the House of Representatives on 26 November last year. That question was in fact responded to by Mr Hockey some days later on 1 December.

My observation on that is that I think there is a difficult balance that I am not sure the Senate has fully addressed. If the Senate wishes to have very long, prolonged debates on bills, that is a matter for the Senate. On the other hand, those debates squeeze out other bills on the government's program, which inevitably leads to delays. I am not sure it helps when senators make bold claims about the mismanagement of the government's program when some very real issues are being addressed. I do not know at this stage how we successfully balance the legislative program with the right of the Senate to debate bills extensively.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to Senator Cook's efforts on tax avoidance in the last part of his speech, Senator Cook and I have debated these issues on many occasions. The sorts of responses that I would bring to this debate are probably well known. This government moved very rapidly in the area of trust losses, which I do not think the Labor government did in all its years in office. We have moved to look at high wealth individuals. We have closed down a variety of schemes which came to be 
 exploited under the former government, such as R&amp;D syndicates and so forth. So I put it on the record that this government has moved very strongly in this area to deal with what I think is a problem in relation to the aggressive tax planning that we see in Australia. We have moved to make sure we have a fair and equitable tax system.</para><para>Senator Margetts raised a very wide range of issues in relation to the tax package, and they are going to be debated very extensively in the coming months. It may well start today, if Senator Cook's committee can bring down its report. I do not propose to address those matters in any detail now. I thought Senator Murray's speech—and I agreed with 90 per cent of his speech, except for his very kind remarks about Senator Cook—covered the field pretty well. We welcome the support that the Democrats are giving to this bill. With those comments, I close my remarks.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>2205</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>2205</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I can count, and I obviously counted during the second reading debate when senators were speaking on the fringe benefits tax, so I will give my arguments but I realise what the outcome will be.

The amendments oppose on three grounds the relaxation of the fringe benefits 
 tax regime in relation to car parking for small business. The first is for environmental reasons where we are talking about pollution impacting on environmental health and greenhouse problems which are exacerbated by encouraging more extensive use of cars. That is what it will do—it will not just remain in the current situation; it will encourage greater use of cars. I would think in the current situation we should not be moving in that direction. It will also lessen economies of scale for strong public transport systems which has environmental implications with inefficient energy use as well as equity implications, because it will further disadvantage those who do not have a car—for instance, the young, the disabled, the low income and the elderly.</para></talk.start></continue><para> We acknowledge that the red tape argument is a genuine concern. However, in this case it provides only marginal relief to a marginal number of small businesses. I believe it benefits only 0.4 per cent of small businesses. The type of small business that would receive the benefit would generally be located in the central business district. Consequently, employees are likely to be in proximity to public transport.</para><para>The loss of revenue is $35 million per annum. I would think the government, ostensibly trying to avoid reduction of the direct tax base, should not be looking at losing further revenue. I believe the calculation of fringe benefit tax liability is not overly time consuming or draconian, because that particular reporting is something that can be done on a regular basis. There would not be a small business that did not know how many car parking spaces they make available; there would not be a small business that did not know how many of their employees were offered those car parking spaces. In fact, they are often highly sought after.</para><para> Let us look at environmental health and pollution. Cars are a major problem. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Energy News</inline> of December 1998 noted:</para><para>Transport related emissions, exacerbated by chronic traffic congestion, are repeatedly identified by authorities around the world as the most difficult source of urban air pollution and greenhouse gas to control.  
</para><para>There were 790,000 new vehicles registered in Australia in 1997-98, and very few of these were low emission vehicles. This was an increase of nine per cent on the previous year's records. The source of this data was also the December 1998 edition of <inline font-style="italic">Australian Energy News</inline> , page 37. Note that new vehicles do not automatically equate with scrapping of old vehicles. It often just means more cars. This is the assumption used by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics in their modelling. Despite increases in energy efficiency in motor vehicles, the use of cars is still a relatively inefficient use of energy. It does not take a mathematician to see that public transport is a far more energy efficient means of transport than individual motor vehicles.</para><para>There are a number of environmental health issues exacerbated by the over-reliance on cars. These include: noise; congestion and stress; air pollution mainly from octane enhancing constituents in petroleum products; life expectancy; and respiratory problems. These respiratory problems include cough, throat dryness, wheeze, chest pain, lassitude, malaise and nausea. That is taken from an article by Woodward et al in the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health</inline>, 1995, volume 49, pages 401 to 407. It can also cause the impairment of children's intellectual development, according to Menkes and Paul Fawcett.</para><para> Decreasing the reliance on private automobiles for urban transport is the key issue in tackling these environmental health problems, according to David Menkes and Paul Fawcett of the Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. That article is contained in <inline font-style="italic">Environmental Health Perspectives</inline>, volume 105. In addition, a recent report by the Victorian EPA identified motor vehicles as the biggest contributor to emissions, including particles, carbon monoxide and the primary pollutants that generate photochemical smog, which is a big problem in states such as Western Australia. The community spends significant amounts of money rectifying these health problems. It spends $7 billion per annum in 
 health costs, according to Dr Hamilton from the Australia Institute.</para><para>The increase in greenhouse gas emissions is another problem that the overuse of cars contributes to. We all know the ongoing problem and the ongoing cost that climate change has created in Australia. I refer to the CSIRO report on the implications of climate change for towns and biodiversity. So the facts are there if we look beyond just the dollars in tax.</para><para> This goes against international trends. The relaxation of fringe benefits tax on car parking is at odds with the struggles of legislators around the world who are increasingly considering radical approaches to minimising car use in the CBD and encouraging public transport. Can you imagine if Senator Hill at the Kyoto summit said, `And, by the way, we're going to change our tax regime to make diesel cheaper in relation to gas and we are going to reduce the fringe benefit tax on car parking in central business districts?' Can you imagine how impressed those countries would be, especially the low-lying Pacific countries, about these policy decisions that the Australian government is taking after saying that it was absolutely impossible for Australia to do anything about the greenhouse issue.</para><para>We believe the red tape argument has been overstated. Time and money depend on the efficiency of the business. Other measures in the bill go a long way towards reducing compliance costs. The government estimates that the revenue forgone would be around $35 million ongoing per year, as it will affect around 4,000 small businesses. So on average a small business will pay $8,750 less per annum. How many will be affected? I have mentioned that 0.4 per cent of small business will have reduced compliance costs. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that there were just over one million small private sector businesses in Australia in 1996-97. The government has estimated that this measure will affect approximately 4,000.</para><para>What type of small business? The small businesses that get the benefits are those that were previously in a one-kilometre radius of a commercial car park. Essentially, we are talking inner city small businesses. The 
 explanatory memorandum explicitly notes that the fringe benefits tax generally applies to small businesses in the central business district. Employees at these kinds of small businesses are more likely to be in proximity to public transport. The employees who receive the benefits are most likely to be those in senior management, lessening economies of scale for the viable expansion of public transport and increasing the disadvantage of those who do not have cars—that includes the young, the elderly, the low income and the disabled.</para><para> I would like to speak further on the social security contrast; that is, the effort, time and money that the government takes to chase after relatively small differences in social security payments. Given the lack of time we have today, I would like to be able to continue that when next we continue the committee stage debate.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>2207</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Selection of Bills Committee</title><page.no>2207</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>2207</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2207</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Calvert, a very fine senator, I present the second report of 1999 of the Selection of Bills Committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be adopted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to have the report incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The report read as follows—</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">SELECTION OF BILLS COMMITTEE</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">REPORT NO. 2 OF 1999</inline></para><para>1.

The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in schedule 1 of the act may be granted to Aboriginal land trusts to hold on behalf of Aboriginal people. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 provides for two additional such places under schedule 1 of the act. The first of these pieces of land is the Innesvale Land Claim based on Innesvale Pastoral Lease, an area of some 2,820 square kilometres approximately 150 
 kilometres south-west of Katherine. The Northern Land Council has handled this claim on behalf of the Wardaman people.</para></talk.start><para>Older Wardaman claimants have had first-hand experience of the harsh conditions on cattle stations in the region and they have retained their strong oral tradition in relation to often violent conflict between traditional owners and frontier settlers. Many Aboriginal people from the area were killed in this early frontier period, including close relations and immediate forebears of present claimants.</para><para>The claimants have maintained strong traditional attachment to the land, with detailed knowledge of sites on the Innesvale station, of the dreamings and mythology associated with them and of the rights and responsibilities to the different areas of Innesvale for which each descendant group has responsibility. Senior claimants have actively ensured that this knowledge will be passed on by younger claimants to succeeding generations.</para><para>The claim itself is viewed as the basis for passing on this knowledge of and affiliation with at least this portion of the Wardaman traditional lands. Elders will, once this legislation is passed, be in a much stronger position to pass on knowledge of country that is traditionally theirs than currently is possible while they live in Katherine. They have expressed the desire to develop and live on outstations in parts of Innesvale such as the Flora River.</para><para>The claim will benefit some 200 claimants and some 200 to 300 non-claimants. It does offer a focal point for the Wardaman people of the Katherine region. Being granted title to their traditional lands will be of fundamental benefit to the claimants and their people in the maintenance of their culture, particularly their traditional relationship to their lands.</para><para>The second parcel of land to be returned to its traditional owners is the Urrpantyenye (Repeat) land claim. This claim was handled by the Central Land Council on behalf of the East Arrente people. I would like to thank both the Northern Land Council and the CLC for providing the opposition with details of their respective claims in their areas. This claim is a relatively small block of land 
 between the Allambi and Horseshoe Bend stations, east of Maryvale.</para><para>The area that we are talking about here was originally included in the Simpson Desert land claim No. 126. This claim was not recommended for grant. One reason for this was the isolation of the area and the difficulty of access which prevented proper investigation of the claim. In October 1991 the Northern Territory government purported to grant a crown lease perpetual over the area to the Northern Territory Land Corporation. The current land claim was lodged in December of that year. In September 1995 the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Justice Gray, found that the grant of crown lease perpetual was invalid under section 67A of the Northern Territory land rights legislation because the earlier Simpson Desert land claim No. 126 had not been fully disposed of as provided for under that act.</para><para>Following Justice Gray's decision, negotiations between the claimants, the CLC, the Northern Territory government and the Todd River Pastoral Co., the lessee of Allambi, resulted in the settlement of the claim and subsequently its inclusion in this amendment to schedule 1 of the act. While it is isolated, the area is rich in cultural significance and rich in culturally significant sites for the East Arrente people. The significance of this area to its traditional owners is amply illustrated by their persistence in pursuing the claim despite the original knock-back of the Simpson Desert land claim No. 126. The people look forward to maintaining their traditional knowledge and links with the land, and this would be enhanced by the return of the claim area.</para><para>I would like to point out that both the land claims that we are discussing this afternoon are examples of the land rights act working through consensus. The traditional owners, the land councils, the Northern Territory government and private interests were able to come to a mutual understanding through negotiation rather than conflict. This is a way the opposition applauds and a way in which we would encourage the Northern Territory government to approach this process. I acknowledge there is a new leader there, and there is the oppor 
 tunity to start afresh with relations with the Aboriginal people in the Territory.</para><para>The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 is one of the most successful pieces of legislation affecting indigenous people in Australia. These two parcels of land will now bring to 61 the number of such areas listed under schedule 1 of the act. The act, it should be remembered, was initiated by the Whitlam Labor government and, after some modification, implemented by the Fraser coalition. It does represent a bipartisan approach to indigenous affairs. It represents an approach which has been clearly lacking since the election of this present government. That bipartisan approach of the 1970s, along with the goodwill of the people involved in the claims, has ensured that the act has worked in its objectives.</para><para>I should mention, in closing, that this bill does remove a small anomaly. It raises the retiring age for the occupant of the position of Aboriginal Land Commissioner from 65 years to 70 years. The commissioner is required to be a judge of the Federal Court or the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, and that bill brings the retiring age of the commissioner in line with the judges of these courts. The opposition is happy to support this legislation and is happy to facilitate the quick passage of the bills.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>2210</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r648">Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998</inline>  is one that the Democrats welcome. The effect of this bill will be, one, to hand back two parcels of land to indigenous groups in the Northern Territory and, two, to raise the age at which the Aboriginal Land Commissioner must retire from 65 to 70 years of age to bring it into line with that of all Supreme Court and Federal Court judges.</para></talk.start><para>That we are considering this bill today clearly illustrates just how well the land rights legislation in the Northern Territory is working. In fact, it is working very well indeed. It is one of the legacies, as Senator Bolkus said, of both the Whitlam and the Fraser governments. It was under the Fraser government and the Tonkin Liberal government in South Australia that probably the two best pieces of 
 land rights legislation were passed. In saying that I am not ignoring the 1993 native title legislation, but I see that in a different context. So we must underline that it was both Liberal governments that moved those two pieces of legislation. I would hope that the Liberal Party eventually may return to the more enlightened view that they had of Aboriginal land rights in those days.</para><para>That this legislation is working so well makes it very difficult to understand why the Reeves report, which was released last year, recommends major changes to the existing legislation. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 passed by the Fraser government in 1976 is widely acknowledged as the most progressive land rights legislation in Australia. Enacted long before Eddie Mabo's case brought native title into common law, the Northern Territory act established an administrative system where applications could be made to return parcels of land to the traditional owners. The act also established the facilitators of such transfers, the first land councils.</para><para>Those land councils have been successful in returning Aboriginal land to its traditional owners without a negative impact on local industry, which seems to be the rhetoric which is used so often these days to deny native title. While the recent review of the 23-year-old act was arguably due, there has been mixed reaction to the recommendations made by Justice John Reeves QC. In fact, indigenous people have expressed alarm at the call to replace the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council—both elected bodies—with new regional councils overseen by a new government-appointed Northern Territory Land Council. Aboriginal leaders, including ATSIC chair, Gatjil Djerrkura, a Territorian, say this would undermine self-determination by removing indigenous people's right to elect their native title representatives.</para><para>The recommendations that the permit system, which gives Aboriginal people the right to permit or not permit access to their country, be scrapped is also a matter of deep concern to the Democrats. We are pleased that the House of Representatives Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
 Affairs is going to inquire into the Reeves report, as at least this will give the indigenous people of the Northern Territory the chance to give their views on the changes which have been recommended. We will be closely monitoring the views expressed at those committee hearings, and I can give the undertaking that the Democrats will not be supporting legislative change that weakens the rights of Australia's traditional owners to own or control what occurs on their land. Thankfully, the bill we are considering today does not fit into that category, and the Democrats are very pleased to be able to support it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>2211</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This bill is very welcome for a number of reasons. Primarily, of course, it is welcome by the Aboriginal communities whose land rights the bill recognises. In the case of the Wardaman people's claim to Innesvale station, the member for Banks, Darryl Melham, explained the background to the claim to parliament in a speech based on material provided by the Northern Land Council. I do not want to repeat all of that material, but there are some key points I believe the Senate should take an interest in.</para></talk.start><para>Innesvale station is approximately 150 kilometres south-west of Katherine. The station is located on Wardaman country, of which seven Wardaman estates are located on Innesvale. Wardaman people are acutely aware of their history since white people first came to the region. Older claimants had first-hand experience of the frequently harsh and punitive conditions on cattle stations in the area. There is a strong oral tradition relating to the often violent early frontier period which saw many Aboriginal people from this area killed, including close relations and immediate forebears.</para><para>Despite this recent harsh history, the claimants have maintained strong traditional attachments to the area they are claiming. Senior claimants see the claim as providing the basis by which younger generations will be able to maintain knowledge of and affiliations with at least this portion of Wardaman traditional lands. They emphasise, too, that they will be in a much stronger position to transmit knowledge on country that is traditionally theirs 
 than currently is possible while they live in Katherine.</para><para>The Wardaman people have been actively pursuing claims to regain control of their traditional country since at least the early days of the Northern Territory Land Rights Act. While they have had some success in the past, the current claim represents the most substantial parcel of Wardaman land to be claimed. That it has taken so long—when the area involved has such a high degree of traditional significance and there is such cultural coherence—is cause for concern.</para><para>It is pleasing to note that these two claims come before the Senate today as a result of agreements reached between the claimants and their representatives and the Northern Territory government. But even so, nothing happens quickly when it comes to recognising Aboriginal rights. The original agreements were reached in 1996 and yet they are only coming to us now. How long will it be before the claimants actually get the title? They should not have to wait another 12 months. The minister can and should make the handover of title an urgent priority.</para><para>While it is pleasing to note that these two claims have been settled by agreement, one has to ask, `Where are all the other agreements?' The Reeves review of the Land Rights Act spoke of 112 land claims outstanding, yet the Northern Land Council have been unable to get agreement from the Northern Territory government on any claims since the Innesvale claim in 1996—not one. The Northern Territory government is clearly adopting a combative approach.</para><para>In his submission to the Reeves review, former Liberal Party minister, Ian Viner, described it like this:</para><para>The political attitudes of Northern Territory governments over the last 20 years have been a disgrace, in their constant and unremitting opposition to land rights claims; their repetitive resort to anti-land rights propaganda and playing the `race card' at election after election; failure to honour the letter and spirit of the intention of the 1976 Act, or complementary sacred site and Aboriginal heritage laws and, now, the Northern Territory Government's desire to obtain compulsory acquisition powers over traditional lands, the weakening of the central position of the land councils, the further 
 diminishment of Aboriginal consent to mining, objection to native title and the denial of recognition within future constitutional arrangements of Aboriginal customary law and traditional rights.</para><para>I would add myself that the federal government is doing nothing to discourage such an approach. In fact, much of that catalogue of sins could be equally applied to them as well.</para><para>Ian Viner is not alone in his damning critique of the Northern Territory government. Even John Reeves QC had to acknowledge that Mr Viner's views accord with the perception of the Northern Territory government held by most Aboriginal people. Reeves goes on to quote people at Utopia, Darwin, Alice Springs, Jabiru, Daly River, Booroloola, Maningrida and Yirrkala—all over the Northern Territory, in fact—expressing their distrust of the Northern Territory government—distrust based on bitter experience.</para><para>I commend pages 67 to 70 of the Reeves review as essential reading for senators in their preparation for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill. If you have any doubt about what would happen to Aboriginal rights if responsibility for heritage passed to states and territories, read those quotes.</para><para>In commending those pages, please do not think I am in any way endorsing anything else in Reeves report. The report is the latest attack on Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory. If implemented, his report would destroy the very basis of land rights by taking away the rights of traditional Aboriginal owners to control their country. The Land Rights Act is a complex piece of legislation with some simple aims: to recognise and protect Aboriginal interests in land and to ensure that Aboriginal people control what happens on their land.</para><para>The Reeves report provides very few constructive suggestions as to furthering these aims, and makes many recommendations which would severely limit the achievement of these aims. Reeves titled his report <inline font-style="italic">Building on land rights for the next generation</inline>, but in fact what it is really about is a return to the days of assimilation and dependency. Under Reeves' land rights model, the current system 
 where traditional Aboriginal owners must be informed about and consent to any use of their land would be replaced by decision making by a regional council who may have no rights in Aboriginal law to make such decisions.</para><para>Reeves proposes breaking the Northern Territory up into 18 land council areas, with these 18 regional land councils then under the strategic supervision of a politically appointed Northern Territory Aboriginal council. The members of the Northern Territory Aboriginal council are to be chosen by the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in conjunction with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. Reconciliation? Self-determination? Ha!</para><para>The loss of recognition of traditional Aboriginal law and land owners, and the establishment of regional councils who can make decisions without reference to the land owners, is one of the major changes—I was going to say `reforms', but I am not going to use that word, because it means a change for the better—which Reeves proposes which significantly disempowers those Aboriginal people who speak for country.</para><para>Other unacceptable attacks on self-determination are the abolition of the permits system—itself based on Aboriginal law—the transfer of control of the compensatory Aboriginal benefits reserve and the compensation payments to the government appointed Northern Territory body, and this same government appointed body will assume overriding powers over all aspects of the regional councils.</para><para>The Reeves report seeks to blame the Land Rights Act for not acting as a mechanism to improve the socioeconomic status of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, and tries to address this by legislating that all compensatory monies are to be put to community purposes such as health, housing or education. It is an absurdity to blame the Land Rights Act for the failures of Australian and Northern Territory governments, and it is unacceptable to use compensatory monies to provide basic citizenship services.</para><para>Commonwealth money has been going to the Northern Territory to provide basic education services, including money that has been 
 used so far to provide dual language education in outstations, but just the other day we heard that the Northern Territory government has decided it is going to stop teaching indigenous languages. How can you trust the Northern Territory government to work for the welfare of indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory?</para><para>Reeves justifies these far-reaching changes through radical rewrite of accepted anthropology and legal theory. He tries to prove that Aboriginal people have never had any real ownership of the land, but simply gather `around geographically coherent resources' according to `seasonal fluctuations in available subsistence resources.' That is from page 147 of this report. This extraordinary anthropological revisionism is rejected by eminent anthropologists all over Australia, many of whom will shortly conveying their concerns to the House of Representatives committee inquiry into the Reeves report.</para><para>His legal reasoning is equally faulty. Despite the finding of the High Court in the Mabo decision, Reeves argues that Justice Blackburn was right in 1971 when he said that the people of East Arnhem did not own the land. That is page 146. Like his faulty reasoning, the Reeves report takes Australia back more than 30 years to the days when land rights were not recognised and people thought that Aboriginal people had no law, no culture, no society. We should not let the clock be turned back.</para><para>The present claim to Innesvale station is an example of what can be achieved when there is negotiation and agreement. The Wardaman people are now caring for their country, developing a cattle enterprise on Innesvale which is compatible with wider social, cultural and economic goals, including maintaining the integrity of the cultural landscape.</para><para>The Wardaman people emphasise with pride the mythological richness of their country, including an unsurpassed heritage of archaeologically significant rock art sites. The area was described as tribal country, a reference to the persisting strong relationship between law, land and people that is evident there.</para><para>When the claimants are granted title to Innesvale station, advantage will flow directly 
 to approximately 200 claimants. In addition, it will provide security to approximately another 200 to 300 people. Holding freehold title will allow them to protect and maintain the values of Innesvale as a highly significant cultural landscape for succeeding generations.</para><para>Similarly, the granting of the Urrpantyenye claim, which is for an area of the Simpson Desert in Central Australia will be of great cultural importance. This is an extremely isolated area and very difficult to get to. While it is probably unlikely that the people will return to live in the area, it is extremely important to them that the claim is recognised, because the area contains some sites of great cultural significance.</para><para>This is another example of the Land Rights Act working as it should, albeit too slowly. After some initial attempts by the Northern Territory government to frustrate the impending claim back in 1991 by the granting of a perpetual lease over the area and then a finding by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Justice Gray, that the lease was invalid, an agreement was finally reached between the Urrpantyenye, the Central Land Council and the Northern Territory government in 1996.</para><para>All parties are to be commended for coming to agreement in this and in the Wardaman case. I only wish more such agreements could be reached, and reached with greater goodwill on behalf of the Northern Territory government, and progressed through the system in a much more timely manner.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>2214</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank all honourable senators for their contributions to the debate.

 the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Bill 1999 is to encourage the voluntary disclosure and exchange of information about the year 2000 computer problems and remediation efforts by providing limited protection from civil liability for the year 2000 disclosure statements.</para></talk.start><para>Its so-called Good Samaritan activity allows large organisations to provide smaller organisations with advice relating to Y2K, and this issue has been the source of some interest in the federal parliament over the last couple of years.</para><para>I would like to foreshadow an amendment that I will be moving in the Committee of the Whole that will require a process for parliamentary departments, Commonwealth departments and agencies to report back to the parliament for the purposes of improving public knowledge about progress to date with Y2K compliance.</para><para>The whole issue of the year 2000 bug relates to a programming flaw that was done many, many years ago that required the shortening up of dates contained in both embedded chips and computer applications. The manifestation of this problem extends now to when the date clicks over on the first  of the first in the year 2000. There is grave concern, both throughout the community and business, that business operations, community services—indeed, very serious and essential services—could be affected adversely by this change. Hence the program for testing, remediation and preparing contingency plans is of very serious public interest and is on the minds of government, business and community organisations everywhere.</para><para>This legislation goes some way to addressing the ability of the community generally to talk about the issue and share information. The amendment that we are foreshadowing provides for the reporting of the progress to date of those testing, remediation and contingency plans to the Commonwealth parliament for the purposes of keeping the public informed about progress to date with Y2K compliance.</para><para>This amendment has been agreed to by the government after extensive negotiations and comes on the back of a high level of frustra 
 tion about the quality of reporting to date by the Commonwealth government to the public. Indeed, the extent of public disclosure about progress on remediation and contingency planning to date comes in the form of just a three-page report that was released by cabinet about mid last year.</para><para>There is a need for extensive public awareness in relation to this problem. We heard just last night at an estimates committee that the government has finally, albeit belatedly, commissioned research in preparation for a public awareness campaign.</para><para>In order to help me keep my comments brief, I seek leave to table some documents provided to the opposition by the government in relation to their intentions with respect to Y2K reporting of Commonwealth agencies.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name></talker><para>—The other issue that needs to be traversed in the context of this debate is how the government can go about gaining the confidence as to their handling of Y2K of both the community and the corporate sector, at which this Good Samaritan style legislation is specifically aimed.

The critical challenge that Y2K presents to the world over is something that must be addressed forthrightly and with leadership by governments.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are several other reports that have significant impact on the way the Y2K problem is being addressed. One, in particular, in relation to Commonwealth progress to date was prepared by the Australia National Audit Office entitled `Getting over the line'. That report identified a series of recommendations aimed at assisting Commonwealth agencies to progress their reporting, testing and compliance in accordance with the guidelines provided for by the department.</para><para>The government has indicated that they will also be moving an amendment to extend the limited exemptions from civil liabilities to oral statements.

As the previous speaker in this debate outlined, the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Bill is intended to provide a system of voluntary disclosure in exchange for information about year 2000 problems, remediation effects and compliance.</para></talk.start><para>This bill provides for limited liability for certain statements made between royal assent and 30 June 2001. The bill provides significant limitations on liability for statements made detailing the risks and compliance history of organisations. The rights of parties receiving year 2000 statements and the rights of third parties referred to in those statements are limited, except where statements are made fraudulently and recklessly.</para><para>The Democrats support strongly an open and fair approach to the resolution of the year 2000 issues. We will be supporting this bill and the various amendments being moved today. But we make it very clear that we reserve the right, as does any one in this chamber, to make any further amendments that are required or any amendments that are appropriate if, at a later stage, we find the government's processes or this particular regime wanting.</para><para>It is widely acknowledged that the year 2000 or millennium bug is one of the most significant challenges yet to face the information technology industry. The origins and the history of the bug provide a fascinating parallel to the information technology industry itself. Although many have blamed the cost, the limited capacity and the lack of availability of memory storage devices, it is more likely that this is just one of the many short cuts which programmers have taken over the years. Sadly, this short cut was entrenched in a number of different ways and with little foresight as to the consequences.</para><para>We should be aware that one of the impediments to addressing the millennium bug has been the opaque nature of so many of the 
 technologies which play a role in our lives. Significant developments are occurring in technology and in technology culture as a result of the recent dramatic spread of computer networking and the convergence among media communications and computing. The movement known as Open Source Software has become a major force in computer development. It promises a level of cooperation and peer review, which is likely to have a dramatic impact on business culture in the long term.</para><para>This may be the appropriate time to suggest that we rethink the role of ethics and professional responsibility. For the last 50 years technology has raced ahead of our society's understanding of the consequences. Many of us are focused on the consequences of the year 2000 right now, but it is probably worth a reminder that the issues exposed by the millennium bug are also part of a broader range of problems created by the elevation of business and technology interests over those of consumers and of society generally.</para><para>I am aware of at least three other significant dates and a number of triggers that could occur in other parts of the economy. The dates are 9 September 1999—it would be my birthday!—29 February 2000 and another `end of time' for many existing business computer systems around the year 2038. So there are at least three significant or `end of time' dates that may affect society.</para><para>Recently there has been concern that the passing of the 10,000 mark on the Dow Jones industrial average might cause a US stock market meltdown, with systems failing to move from four- to five-digit numbers. We are still waiting for the US stock market to hit that magic level. These and other dates and thresholds point to an ongoing concern that we should all have with the extent to which we oversee, understand and control the technology in our lives.</para><para>The problems relating to the millennium bug should not simply be seen as a single issue that needs to be cleanly and swiftly disposed of—while of course it must be—but also be an incentive to think about and discuss the ongoing role of government in regulating technology. This legislation is an 
 important attempt to urgently encourage a spirit of cooperation and openness regarding the risks and preparations for the new millennium. We are all still quite uncertain as to the actual impact of the arrival of the year 2000. The range of systems, in both the computer and organisational sense, which may be vulnerable is wide. But we are still distressingly uninformed about the complex relationship between different systems and the real effects of failure of individual components.</para><para>We certainly have many reasons to be cautious about the possible impact and that is why contingency plans and information are so important. There are risks that have been suggested in a number of areas ranging from health care to aircraft safety. On that note, I point out the encouraging words from the minister. I do not know if other members of the chamber are aware of this, but the information technology minister, Mr Alston, is so confident that the millennium bug will be zapped—this is according to AAP on 9 February—by the end of this year that he plans to take Prime Minister John Howard on a New Year's Eve plane trip. He is apparently going to be spending New Year's Eve in a cockpit of an aircraft. I am glad that the minister is so confident. It has actually been suggested in some countries that confidence in the resolution of safety issues should be demonstrated through such displays as airline executives and, of course, government officials taking flights that cross the threshold. Each to their own!</para><para>We should be proud of the way in the which the Australian community has responded to many of the challenges and uncertainties of the year 2000 but we should not become complacent. On the other hand we should not, at the other extreme, use simplistic scare tactics to bring about action. We should all take the opportunities provided by this particular bill to further prepare.</para><para>I do note with concern, on behalf of the Democrats, the government's lack of openness in the past about preparedness and the process of resolution. It seems that the threat of amendments requiring an obligation on the government to disclose has been instrumental, 
 so that threat seems to be one reason that the government has responded, and has resulted in what I believe is a more open attitude from the government on this issue. We continue to call on the government to be fair, open and accountable on this issue, especially in the way that it communicates with the Australian population about the impact of this issue and about preparations. I do not believe that has been the case so far, certainly not satisfactorily. The general `your government knows best, so don't worry' approach is not an appropriate way to address the legitimate concerns of our community.</para><para>There is no doubt that preparedness and contingency planning in Australia are proceeding well, but we must maintain our leading role in the international community and also play a part in world preparations. The Democrats, while currently supporting the framework before us and the framework of disclosure generally, still have some concerns in relation to the weakening of the Trade Practices Act, for example, and its particular protections. We believe that always sets a dangerous precedent, and we will be vigilant about the use and abuse of the disclosure rules contained in this bill. As I have mentioned, we reserve the right to amend this bill in the future if any abuse should be detected.</para><para>This bill is a good faith, good Samaritan offering to the Australian community, and any abuse of its provisions cannot be tolerated. The bill does provide an important defence in the case where parties feel they have been defamed through the making of a year 2000 statement that is the truth. We are all aware that the truth is fragile; the truth defence is provided in an atmosphere of trust to the Australian community.</para><para>In relation to the proposed amendments, we are mindful of the somewhat secretive nature of the government's year 2000 preparations. We are pleased that the government has added the commitments contained within these amendments. That is a good sign. We would also like to see extensive use of the provisions of this bill by government, departments and agencies, even where that has not been compelled. A system of voluntary disclosure could undoubtedly benefit from a strong lead 
 from all government departments and agencies.</para><para>As I have indicated, this bill is a timely reminder of the concerns we should all have with the failure of successive governments to tackle the difficult ethical questions arising from advances in technology. Internationally, we have often been in a leading position, but we must ensure that moves towards deregulation and self-regulation in critical areas of technology do not undo that success. Too often we are informed that regulation of or even public discussion about some of the matters relating to advances in technology is not appropriate. This, understandably, is part of the ongoing questioning of the role of government at a time when it seems to many that innovation is occurring faster than we can understand or appropriately regulate.</para><para>In a number of other areas, our ability to regulate is being limited by lack of discussion. Among these I include the regulation of encryption technologies and a range of other areas, like privacy. We must be continually vigilant where business interests, technology, community interests and human rights collide. I look forward to the ongoing debate on these matters and look forward also to a satisfactory outcome.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>2217</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Lundy and Senator Stott Despoja for their contributions to the debate here in the chamber and outside the chamber—to the very important debate on year 2K preparations in the community and the negotiations that we have held around this bill.

However, contrary to what has been said in relation to the disclosure regime, Australia is recognised internationally by leading organisations as having one of the best government disclosure regimes on the globe.</para><para>The changes that took place to that regime as a result of a federal-state ministers meeting with industry on 17 December, to bring all of the states together to report on a common format, really did take Australia ahead of even the United States in terms of the quality of government reporting. Every state and the Commonwealth, as well as some utilities, I might say, will be reporting on a similar format as from the first couple of weeks of March—this coming disclosure period. That is something that has not been able to be achieved in any other nation. We are committed to continuing to increase the level of transparency and quality of information so that Australian citizens and businesses can make sensible decisions about Y2K preparedness.</para><para>There are two other things I wanted to mention. Senator Stott Despoja made a very important point about being flexible in our approach. I do not think that was the word she used, but she said we need to reserve the right to alter our approach to this problem and that, indeed, is why we want to keep an open mind about improving the government's own preparations and assisting industry. Also, we cannot be complacent, even though Australia is regarded as being amongst the best nations as far as our preparations go. There are many areas in which we have to improve our game and we cannot be complacent about it with 316 days to go.</para><para>Finally, I would like to say that Australia would not be in the position that she is in as a nation if it had not been for the efforts of a number of remarkable and quite outstanding individuals in the preparations—and there are probably hundreds of them. But I would like to take this opportunity to remark on the very good work of the Y2K unit in the Office for Government Online of the Department of 
 Communications, Information Technology and the Arts headed by Susan Page, who is here today; and also Maurice Newman, who has led the fight internationally. As chairman of the ASX and Deutsche Bank and head of our industry program, he has been one of the key people on the globe in terms of raising awareness and getting people to take action. Australians should be proud of Morris's work in this field and, of course, his chief executive officer, Graeme Inchley. There are many others who work with those people, but these individuals deserve mention here.</para><para>I genuinely thank the opposition and the Democrats and all other senators who have allowed this bill to be progressed so quickly. It shows what can be done with a truly non-partisan agenda in Australia. It is something we should be proud of. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>2218</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>2218</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Clause 4, page 3 (after line 8), after the definition of <inline font-style="italic"> data storage device</inline> , insert:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"> electronic communication of speech</inline>  means a communication of speech by means of guided and/or unguided electromagnetic energy (for example, a telephone call or a radio broadcast).</para><para>(2)	 Clause 9, page 6 (line 28), omit "or reproduction", substitute ", reproduction, recital or reading aloud".</para><para>(3)	 Clause 9, page 7 (lines 1 to 7), omit paragraph (c), substitute:</para><para>		 (c)	 is made:</para><para>			 (i)	 orally, or</para><para>			 (ii)	 in writing, or</para><para>			 (iii)	 in a data storage device; or</para><para>			 (iv)	 by way of an electronic communication of writing; or</para><para>			 (v)	 by way of an electronic communication of speech.

It effectively means that 
 if someone or an organisation makes a statement in good faith about the year 2000 preparations, and that statement is not misleading or deceptive, then they will receive some relief from existing statute. The problem that this bill seeks to address is where companies, which are asked by a supplier or a customer whether they are ready for year 2000, have been given legal advice to be very careful about what they say.</para></talk.start><para>The whole solution to year 2000 problems is for organisations to understand the readiness of their own internal systems.

We did, in the preparation of this bill, seek to get as much information as possible from the United States, but it is fair to say there was a paucity of it. We will be monitoring what is happening in the United States; we will monitor what happens here. We are talking, on an hourly basis, to people who are in that area and we have spoken to the insurance industry as well.</para></talk.start><para>Back in, I think, December, when the Insurance Council made that announcement about Y2K clauses in legislation, I took the opportunity to say to media who inquired of me that it should send a message to businesses and other organisations about the reality of the Y2K problem. I am sure there are millions of people out there in our community and certainly around the world who do not understand the enormity of this problem. The fact that insurance companies cannot cover that risk and strike a premium for that risk should actually send a very loud message that organisations must take responsibility for the problem. The best way of judging whether an 
 organisation understands and has responsibility for the problem is to talk to their chief executive. If the chief executive of any organisation—small, medium or large—does not understand the Y2K problem, the organisation will not be ready. It is a problem that these people must take responsibility for.

The required forensic test to prove the medicines actually contain the endangered species are just not available.

Not a single prosecution took place.</para><para>Traditional East Asian medicine practised for over 5,000 years uses more than 1,000 plant and animal species.

For these species, poaching for TEAM has been identified as the most immediate threat to the survival of the populations in the wild.</para><para>These amendments will allow for prosecution for illegally importing medicines claiming to contain endangered species without the requirement for forensic proof that the medicines actually do contain these species. This brings Australia in line with its obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species on Wildlife, Flora and Fauna, or the CITES convention.</para><para>It is, however, very important that the government continues to work with the traditional East Asian medicine community in Australia on this issue to raise awareness and 
 understandings of the laws and regulations and streamline these, where necessary, to help compliance.

First of all, anybody with poetry in the soul would want to preserve the wildlife of the world. I think later in the year we are going to have a full discussion about biodiversity and the need to preserve the world with the magic presently in it.</para></talk.start><para>The second point I want to make is about traditional medicine, to which a reference appears in the second reading speech. I would like to make it clear, of course, that Chinese medicine—some call it traditional Chinese medicine—is an ancient art and a very honourable one. I would like to make clear that the exploitation of rare animals and beautiful animals is not at the heart of Chinese medi 
 cine. It can and does do a great service to humankind, without relying on those products.</para><para>Indeed, in Melbourne there is a move to regulate Chinese medicine—I think it might already be under regulation—by the Victorian government, and the government deserves credit for that. I put in this context the work done by Professor Chiang Lin (I know the minister, Senator Kemp, would have heard of him out Footscray way) working through the RMIT to see that regulation of medicine is properly instituted so that the good parts that come from Chinese medicine—as, indeed, with the good parts that come from any particular profession or any particular practice—are the parts that are preserved. That needs regulation. He fought hard for the regulation and, in spite of all, has got it through. May I say, just to balance up the matter, Senator Kemp, that Senator Crowley, when she was the minister, did a lot of good work in this area.</para><para>They are the two points I want to make. Firstly, this bill goes to protect, as I say, the poetry of the world and, secondly, Chinese medicine should not be seen as dependent upon illegitimate products or on the killing of beautiful animals, but does have a legitimacy which, I might say, is equal to the legitimacy of Western medicine; and by marrying the two, as Professor Lin wants to do, we get a much better outcome for all people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>2223</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will be very brief, to enable the legislation to get passed in the four minutes we have remaining. Firstly, the Democrats support this legislation, the aim of which, of course, is to enable more successful prosecution of those who seek to use endangered species in various products. I note that the act creates a specific definition of convention listed species and, in a sense, only addresses convention listed species rather than other animals that are currently listed under the wildlife protection act. I understand the rationale for that, in terms of what this is aimed at, but I am not sure if it was necessary in the sense that it may have been helpful to actually have this sort of mechanism applied more widely to other wildlife.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is important to emphasise, given that the bill itself is only four pages long, that the quite comprehensive explanatory memorandum lists various options that were considered and the costs and benefits of each and even lists the option of doing nothing, or taking no specific action. As it quite pithily says, there are no foreseeable benefits in maintaining a stance of no action. I think that is the important part of this legislation, that it does seek to take concrete and positive action to address what is a real problem. And the Democrats support that.</para><para>Briefly, we would also like to note, as is also mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, the government's commitment to undertake a broad review of the wildlife protection act. That is certainly something the Democrats will be paying close attention to. It refers to recommendations in a recent Senate committee report. The Democrats do have a strong concern about the potential for an expansion of trade in wildlife without very clear and strong protections to ensure that environmental benefits are protected for the long term.

Is that the position—you have no policies until 2001?

That is the sort of $2 billion program that Martin Ferguson and Simon Crean think makes a lot of sense. But we know those policies have failed. Mark Latham knows they have failed. Lindsay Tanner knows they have failed. Two-thirds of those on your labour market programs ended up back on the unemployment scrap heap. You have rejected our reforms for unfair dismissals, you were opposed to Work for the Dole, you were opposed to stimulating the economy through tax cuts—in other words, every sensible policy proposal is something you are not allowed to contemplate because your union bosses say, `It might jeopardise our power bases. We are not interested in the unemployed; we are interested in hanging on to those that we have got.' That is a tragic abdication of responsibility.

It is very well known. I guess what is most appreciated about the tax reform package is in fact the $13 billion of personal income tax benefits that would flow therefrom. But, beyond that, there are of course 
 many other benefits, particularly for small business. Small business, I have to say, recognises the good policies of the Howard government—in particular, the lower interest rates, lower inflation and a more flexible labour market. In fact, that recognition has been shown up again in the latest survey by the National Australia Bank, which indicates that business confidence has returned to the high levels prevailing before the onset of the Asian economic crisis. That is very pleasing, Madam President.</para></talk.start><para>But small business also knows that it suffers from an outdated taxation system and it has demanded reform in that area for a long time. Unfortunately, it got no reform from 13 years of Labor. By contrast, under our government it will. This tax reform package, and the return of all the GST to the states, will allow a number of state based taxes to end—nine, in particular—including the financial institutions duty, the debits taxes, a range of stamp duties, conveyancing duties on business properties and the bed taxes—all taxes, as Senator Boswell knows, that small business wishes to see the end of. That will occur under our tax reform package. It has the advantage, of course, of reducing the compliance costs for small business, which means that small business has greater opportunity to invest in creating wealth and providing job opportunities, which is what it should be all about, rather than incurring the cost and time of unnecessary compliance.</para><para>If we went down the Australian Democrats path of taking food out of the GST, it would be so much more complicated, and that would add a new burden of compliance cost to small business. That is why small business does not wish to have the Democrats' answer to the GST—that is, to remove food. Small business is clear and loud in its condemnation of the Democrats' attempted changes to the GST package. We have been told, in fact, by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants that to go down that path would add an extra $100 million a year in compliance costs—that is, compliance costs largely paid for by small business. No wonder small business does not want it. The National Association of Retail Grocers, representing 
 some 10,000 independent retailers, has said no to the Democrats' position. All council members of COSBOA, the peak body representing small business, have said no. The National Farmers Federation has said no. Small business knows that to go down the path of removing food adds to compliance costs and therefore reduces the benefits that would flow from the government's tax reform package. It is not the way to go.</para><para>The Labor Party, on the other hand, has no policies at all. It has no tax reform policy. It has no alternative to put to the Australian people. It has no interest in the compliance costs that small business pays on all of those state based taxes. It has no interest in allowing small business to grow and to employ and to create wealth.

In the recently released <inline font-style="italic">Report on Government Services</inline> , a number of interesting and pertinent statistics are presented that clearly show that property crimes, such as armed and unarmed robbery, are increasing in certain states over the period 1993 to 1997 and are stable or decreasing in other states.</para></talk.start><para>If I might, I will choose my own state of South Australia, since the question comes from Senator Ferguson, and Australia's `Premier' state, New South Wales, for comparison of rates of armed and unarmed robbery, two crimes that are very closely related to the use of illegal drugs. In 1993, the rate of unarmed robbery in South Australia was 82.9 per 100,000 of population, but by 1997 this had dropped to 57.4 per 100,000, a decrease of 31 per cent in five years in South Australia. No doubt this was due to fine police work and a good Liberal government. By stark contrast, the rate of unarmed robbery in New South Wales over the same period increased from 61.5 per 100,000 to 121 per 100,000, an increase of 97 per cent over the same time. So unarmed robbery goes down by 31 per cent in South Australia and soars by 97 per cent in New South Wales.</para><para>If we turn to armed robbery, the picture is even more disturbing.

It has been 10 years since the Burdekin report was brought down, 
 and now is really a valuable time to stand back and look at what has been achieved. Our government, when it came into office three years ago, put youth homelessness at the top of its priorities for social policy programs and policy development. We well understand the problems that are faced in our communities by the break-up of families and the homelessness that sometimes is produced as a result. The Burdekin report made very clear the social problems the nation faces as a result of youth homelessness.</para></talk.start><para>You can contrast the approach of this government with that of the Hawke and Keating governments, both of which were very much focused on the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff rather than the fence at the top of the cliff. We have introduced a concerted attempt to make prevention rather than bandaids the priority of this government in terms of young people who are at risk of homelessness.</para><para>When we first came into government, the Prime Minister called together the major welfare organisations and set up a task force to work in cooperation with three of the major federal departments to try to establish a pilot program to prevent youth homelessness and help those who were homeless. Following the evaluation late last year of that pilot program, which has been a great success—and I think those senators who have had anything to do with it would recognise that—the Prime Minister launched a new $60 million program to combat youth homelessness with a focus on early intervention. At the heart of that, we are recognising the need to try to keep families together wherever possible, because the research does show that early intervention is a really important way of preventing young people becoming trapped in the cycle of homelessness and long-term welfare dependency.</para><para>An independent evaluation of the pilot program showed that reconciliation was achieved between the parents and young person in 72 per cent of the cases, and improvements to relationships and greater stability also resulted from these reconciliations. The program is designed to encourage the young to reconcile with their families and 
 re-engage with education, training and employment in the community, which are the linchpins as we all know to a whole and meaningful life.</para><para>This new program, now with the extra funding, will assist thousands of Australian families each year, including about 7,000 young people and 5,000 parents. When it is fully operational, there will be 100 services funded across Australia targeting areas of highest need at a cost of $20 million a year. That is, of course, only part of what this government is doing to attack the problems that were identified in the Burdekin report. For example, $230 million this financial year is going into the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, which is helpful for those who are already homeless. The government has also allocated $13.8 million this year for the Job Placement, Employment and Training program. But the Burdekin report also very significantly identified the lack of literacy skills as an important thing that needs to be overcome in these young people who are showing up as unemployed and homeless. Few of them have the qualifications necessary to gain employment. That is why we have put such a priority on helping young job seekers who have been unemployed for six months to focus on and access the money that is available for literacy and numeracy programs. We have to get their skills up so they are able to get a job.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">HILL</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> .</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>2237</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Child Disability Allowance: Eligibility </title><page.no>2237</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2237</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have some information for Senator Gibbs, who asked a question yesterday about the child disability assessment tool and its affect on customers.

You have to ask yourself why Minister Reith took this course of action. It was not, of course, to protect the national interest. It was not, of course, to protect the integrity of any government papers or documents. It was simply to try to dilute the effect of those documents on the media and the public. You also have to ask yourself whether that is now going to be the way the government reacts in relation to a whole number of things at Senate estimates committees and at question time. Will the government say, `That is a matter of cabinet-in-confidence and is certainly something the Senate should not be pursuing'?</para><para>What these documents do conclusively is show the untruths and the deliberate misleading of the Australian electorate in the 1996 and 1998 federal election campaigns by the Prime Minister and Mr Reith. These documents graphically highlight that the Prime Minister never intended to give the sorts of promises we talked about at question time today—on the no disadvantage test, the award safety net and the protections offered to workers in this country.</para><para>There are many other things that these documents show. What about the fact that the Minister for Family and Community Services put out a very rushed press statement this morning saying that she `deplores the 
 misrepresentation of Mr Reith's paper by the opposition,' and that `Mr Reith did not seek to impose limits on the duration of income support for the unemployed.' That is a deliberate attempt to mislead the Australian public, because if you go to page 11 of this cabinet-in-confidence document, Mr Reith says:</para><para>There would be merit in considering whether this Mutual Obligations approach could be applied to all adults once their receipt of allowance extends beyond, say, six months. I have in mind that beyond this duration, continued receipt of allowance could be conditional on the recipient being engaged in useful education activity, community service or other productive workplace activity.</para><para>Either Mr Reith or Senator Newman is not telling the truth. It is an open-and-shut case in this regard. The real situation is that, again, Senator Newman has been treated like a mushroom by the Prime Minister and Mr Reith. Her department has not been in the loop on this. They have had no involvement. This extraordinarily rushed press statement was put out this morning in the press gallery to try to ensure that the damage is minimised.</para><para>If you look closely at this cabinet-in-confidence document, you see what Mr Reith is all about, because this document says a lot about the relations between the minister for employment and the Prime Minister. You have to ask a very important question: has anyone ever heard from a minister of state a more grovelling, cringing, toadying and obsequious comment than the sort of thing we see in this document?

They cannot look forward to the fact that, if we actually get together and try to discuss some of these issues, there can be some real advantage to the unemployed in Australia.</para><para>The Labor Party has become such a vacant lot, such a policy free zone, and all you can do is write books. You cannot write down a policy; you are incapable of writing down a policy. You scrub policy and all you can do is to write books. What is it about the opposition that has made you shut down any ideas? Why are you so frightened of having a policy? What is wrong with having a policy on the unemployed? Why are you so hostile to ideas? It is far too important a subject to be simply quibbled about in question time. It is not much wonder that the public out there are disillusioned with the way in which both sides of politics are behaving when it comes to debate in this House on matters that affect so many people.</para><para>Having put absolutely nothing forward yourselves, not only can you not actually articulate a policy on unemployment but also you cannot even cooperate to look, in a proper review mode, at job creating policies that the coalition is bringing forward. There is no doubt that the ABS labour force figures that came out last week are encouraging, but there is a lot more that can be done. I don't think there would be anyone who would suggest that there is not.</para><para>No-one suggests that there should not be further labour market reform to get jobs for all Australians. Certainly, that is what Mr Latham seems to be suggesting. And, like it or not, Mark Latham is right when he said—I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> last year—`Those in the Labor Party know that Australia has a unique opportunity to improve the flexibility of its labour market.'</para><para>But those opposite do not seem to be taking much advantage of the fact that there might be a little chip there, a little encouragement, and that you have an opportunity to accept some responsibility to cast a vote for or 
 against lower unemployment in Australia. So far, you have fallen at the first fence because you have not only refused to pass the unfair dismissal law but also repealed the regulation. And, in the words of small business, the legislation is worth more than 50,000 jobs. I do not know how you can live with that outcome.</para><para>Not only that, but you are now refusing—you could support it if you wished—to preserve the youth wage structure legislation. We all know that this will protect the jobs of some 225,000 young Australians. If you were sincere, if you were fair dinkum, if you had any concern about the future of young unemployed people in Australia, you would stop worrying about cabinet documents and you would start trying to come up with a policy—if you don't agree with ours—which might at least not be beneath contempt. You have had three chances. You have knocked off one of them. You could do something for the young unemployed. The other thing you could do is pass the GST package and create a better economic environment for jobs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>2240</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I start my contribution by expressing my disappointment that Senator Coonan didn't comment on policy, but rather said that she believes Labor lacks it. The only policy point Senator Coonan made was that she thought the GST should be introduced. Mr Reith's statement highlights the cynicism the Australian public feels with respect to the GST. That cynicism is highlighted by Mr Reith's references to New Zealand. He talks about the 500,000 jobs we would have had, had we gone down the same path as New Zealand. We know what happened in New Zealand—the GST was introduced there and welfare was cut. So why do you think we are cynical when we see a document such as this that refers to every other possible avenue Minister Reith can think of to cut, cut, cut? That is not policy.</para></talk.start><para>Let me highlight one area which reinforces that point. Minister Reith refers to the OECD 10 points and tries to redefine himself to fit in with them. That redefinition is very interesting when you look at OECD point 7, which says that countries `should emphasise 
 an active labour market policy or policies'. How does Mr Reith describe that? Mr Reith describes that as `reform of labour market programs' because reform to Mr Reith is nothing but cut, cut, cut—cut rights to unfair dismissal, cut junior rates, et cetera.</para><para>I go back to Senator Hill's comments, since he has remained with us today, in response to Senator Harradine's question. Senator Harradine was concerned about the report in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> which said that the Prime Minister had redefined his election commitment as only relating to existing employees. Senator Harradine sought clarification on that point. He got no clarification from Senator Hill. All Senator Harradine got was a re-reading of the election policy platform. Senator Hill, can you reassure us that the Prime Minister has not come out and said that it will only apply to existing employees? That was Senator Harradine's concern. That was the issue Senator Hill did not answer. We got no guarantee from Senator Hill that the Prime Minister was not referring only to existing employees. Senator Hill did not reassure us on that point at all.</para><para>Senator Newman was the only other minister here today who actually made some comment on the policy issues. She tried valiantly to demonstrate that she had actually been consulted. Unfortunately, she failed dismally. The one ounce of reassurance we had were her comments in question time today that unemployment figures will not be redefined to rule out people on Work for the Dole. What a bodgie, rorting system this government is looking at if they are looking at forcing all unemployed onto Work for the Dole and then redefining them as employed.</para><para>I want to conclude on a point that highlights exactly what Minister Reith is talking about. On page 12 of his statement he says that what he envisages as the employer-employee relationship would be established and employers would have the right to expect work of an acceptable standard. `The scheme would thereby be easier to administer with non-compliance resulting in termination of payment.' So we will now have employers determining whether workers on Work for the Dole payments have their payments terminat 
 ed if they are not working hard enough. That is sheer slavery. Mr Reith is talking about sheer slavery. That is what he is describing in this program—nothing more, nothing less. It is dismal that members of the government here today can make no contribution to this policy debate except for Senator Newman's reassurance that they will not be cut off the unemployment figures. That is the only reassurance we have had on policy issues in this debate today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>2241</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to start today by quoting a couple of lines I have here that go back to 1990.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—Oh, you have come in today, have you?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name></talker><para>—I have been in every day, I think, Senator Faulkner.

Any form of work reduces unemployment. But that is a lot better way to enter the 21st century than the Labor Party could ever do. The Labor Party is expert in the employment of labour.

Once people become unemployed, in your view, they cease to be important because you do not get union dues out of them. I know that because of the unions that I have belonged to. You do not get union dues out of them when they are unemployed. They cease to become important. That is why unions are dropping below 30 per cent in work forces. That is why you are losing them.</para><para>Let me go on. Under your administration unemployment reached the highest—Senator Collins quoted the OECD—level in the OECD. Unemployment in Australia under your administration reached the highest level in the OECD. It is now down to 7.5 per 
 cent—not the lowest in the OECD but one of the lowest in the OECD. Certainly a long way from the 11½ per cent it was under you people. You had the temerity to criticise this administration for bringing unemployment down. I do not know what you are going to do. You are not doing too well now, but when Senator Robert Ray leaves you shortly, sometime through this term, certainly at the end of this term, the IQ will drop by about 50 per cent on the other side. What is going to happen then?</para><para>The problem is that there is a focus on the other side on the wrong areas. The focus has to be on the unemployed. This government is committed to bringing unemployment down. It has brought it down. It is performing. It is an abysmal lack of action on your part. You left us with high unemployment. You left us with high interests rates. The government is doing everything in its power, and it is doing it properly and methodically. I do not know how the documents were leaked. You are concentrating on the documents. Why do you not concentrate on some policy that helps your fellow Australians that are unemployed? Why do you not do that? Why do you not join with us? You do not have policies in this area, and this is one area where you should have some expertise. But you do not even have any expertise in the unemployment area. You do not offer anything. You criticise, but you do not offer anything.</para><para>It is not complete blind panic, as Senator Faulkner said. It is a studied way from the Prime Minister through his ministers through his cabinet to bring down unemployment, to sustain it at a level that is acceptable. There is no question that we will always have some unemployment, but there must be some acceptable level. This government is doing precisely that with a combination of low interest rates and low rates for business. If you people had voted through the acceptance of the small business package, where we would have employed 40,000 to 50,000 more people, we would have brought unemployment down to a lower figure than what it is now.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>2241</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Coonan said the Labor Party

The one thing this government hates is for its actions, its administration and the decisions it makes of an administrative nature to be scrutinised. The government hates it. It has this obsession with saying, `All we ever want to do in this chamber is discuss ideas and policy.' That is a role for this chamber, but our duty and an equal role for this chamber is to scrutinise the actions of this government, to make sure probity is there, to make sure there is an ethical approach to government.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the opinion polling for the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, it is a sleazy, stinking rort and nothing more than that.

Why? Not only is he the Liberal Party pollster; the more work he gets, the nearer a critical mass to a credible polling organisation he becomes. He is not credible out there in the commercial world. They do not give him work. So he relies on his work from the Liberal Party and government departments. That is where he gets his work from. Senator Alston said this is just spite from us because Mark Textor got the last election right. No pollster got the election more wrong than Mark Textor.

If you go back to this document, this now tabled leaked cabinet-in-confidence document, you will never see more pathetic qualitative polling than the results shown there. The methodology is trash. The results in interpretation are incompetent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>All you are doing is propping this person up, with his snout in the trough, strongarming contracts across to the Textor organisation when they should be going to competent polling firms. Let us have a look at his record. The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> got rid of him after six weeks because he was so wrong. If you look at his track record in the Northern Territory, he leaked all the government paid research over to the Country Liberal Party. All of it went to them, illegally, in breach of copyright and in breach of contract. Let us look at whom he has allied himself with now. This is the great freedom loving Liberal Party with principles. Their pollster is part of Wirthlin, and Wirthlin is connected to every right-wing ratbag group in the United States that exists. They align themselves with the anti-Semites, with the white supremacists, with the flat-earthers and the gun-toting rednecks. That is their record in the United States. Sure, they do some work for the Republican Party but only to destroy other Republican moderates. Not even the Democrats are their enemy in the US; moderate Republicans are their enemy.</para><para>Questions need to be answered. How indeed did Textor get this contract? Given the fact that he did his research in July and given his track record in the Northern Territory how much of this research went to the Liberal Party before the election? The fact is that it took him four months to report to the department with this research. You can bet it got up to Robert Menzies' house a lot quicker. This ethical position that we have of Textor being strongarmed in and basically doing the Liberal Party's research is a national disgrace. We will not be bluffed out of scrutiny in this place. No matter how many dirges you go on with, we will be there scrutinising the actions of this government and exposing it when it is involved in corruption.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>2243</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The first thing to say about Peter Reith's views on progressing reforms in the paper that we have all now well and truly seen and read is that this is a minister who has always pushed the envelope of industrial reform. He has always been at the forefront, and he has previous form on the board—so much so that he has, in fact, impressed Cheryl Kernot and the Democrats enough to get his first tranche of industrial reform through the parliament. His form on the board is now coming through, the success is coming through, in the statistics.</para></talk.start><para>First of all, he was the minister and we are the government that introduced a more flexible enterprise bargaining regime of three streams, three choices and options, for wage agreements. The attractiveness of that reform is shown in the figures. More than 45,000 AWAs have been approved, and 90 per cent of those have been in the last year. It has taken more than a year for those reforms to filter through, but they are coming through now. The attractiveness of AWAs is now showing through in the figures. Some 7,500 certified agreements have been made, including some 805 non-union agreements, covering around 100,000 workers. And there is still the award system, and there is still, underpinning that, the no-disadvantage test. From that, we have the low paid workers still receiving wage increases of more than five per cent through the Industrial Relations Commission, so there is a real wage increase.</para><para>Peter Reith was at the forefront of that very successful change. He is the minister who has overseen the unfair dismissal legislation, which has come through here. There was no reform held up more by the previous government than unfair dismissal. It was held up for ridicule. They know it themselves. They wanted to change it themselves prior to the 1996 election, yet when it came into this parliament they were against that particular reform—an area that of course, particularly for small business, deterred employment.</para><para>Another change introduced in the first tranche of our industrial relations reform was the secondary boycott. It had a positive effect. We reintroduced legislation—45D and 45E— 
about secondary boycotts. It had a positive effect on economic activity, that flowed on to employment. And where would we be if we did not have those clauses reintroduced into this parliament? Where would we be in relation to the waterfront dispute that we had last year? We would be right back to the bad old days. That one single change, introduced by Peter Reith, had the greatest effect down on the wharves to bring about change. We would be still living under the extortions, the strikes, the expenses and the rorts that were going on down on the waterfront. Now we have a revolution; we have world's best practice occurring down on the Melbourne waterfront. The union told us that they could not meet the container lifts rate. They were the worst in the world at 18 an hour; we were only asking for 25 an hour in our reforms. They are now reaching, at times, 32-plus down on the Melbourne waterfront.

The select committee was instructed to undertake its inquiries in two stages.</para><para>In this initial stage, the inquiry has focused on a preliminary analysis of the economic modelling and projections underpinning the Howard government's tax package—known by the acronym, ANTS. The second stage of the inquiry will examine the broader economic effects of the government's taxation reform package, with regard to the fairness of the tax system, the living standards of Australian households—especially those on low incomes—the efficiency of the economy and future public revenues. The second stage of the inquiry will draw on the findings of the three related inquiries conducted by the references committees. The references committee inquiries are due to be completed by 31 March this year and the final select committee report is expected to be presented by 19 April this year.</para><para>The terms of reference of the committee's inquiry were advertised in the national press in December last year and submissions called by the end of January this year. The committee is continuing to accept submissions and, to date, has received over 1,300 submissions. To date, the select committee has conducted nine public hearings in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. The intention is to conduct a further 12 hearings over the next month. In addition, a substantial number of public hearings are being conducted by the three references committees, as part of the separate inquiries.</para><para>The select committee reporting today heard 36 witnesses, some of them more than once, and sat for 61½ hours, including for five hours on Monday. The timetable, Madam Deputy President, is, indeed, very tight and getting our report out on time imposed, I believe, incredible strains and left insufficient time to seek a consensus among the committee. In the report, there may be some editorial mistakes which reflect this fact.</para><para>Having said that, I will turn to the findings of myself and my Labor colleagues. This committee has served for Australia a quite important purpose. Up until now, funded by a $20 million taxpayer-supported publicity campaign, Australians have heard the government's view about a GST. We have been force-fed on glossy documents, televi 
 sion and newspaper advertising, the cheer squad that supports the government, and ministerial statements telling us all that the GST is good for us. Those statements have been wrapped around pseudo-truths with some political and economic assertions in them.</para><para>What this inquiry has done is expose many of those statements by the government as having no particular basis in fact or no particular basis in modelling or research. This report, for the first time, enables independent voices in Australia to model and test the assumptions that the government has put into the public domain and make findings which are now public, through this report. This report has enabled industry groups, community organisations and unions to express their views in an inquiry setting about the tax and about the impacts of the tax on their organisations and on Australians generally. The propositions that the government has put in public debate and which featured in its advertising during the last election have at last come under independent scrutiny and test.</para><para>The conclusion is that, if you looked at what the government has said, most Australians have not been told the truth. As I said earlier, there is no basis for much of what the government has said in modelling; no basis for much of what the government has said in research; and no basis for much of what the government has said in advice to the government from Treasury. The worst feature of all that is that Australian taxpayers' money has been used to broadcast that situation—despite the lack of evidentiary proof of the assertions the government was making.</para><para>Let me turn to the major findings made by Labor senators from the evidence in this inquiry. The primary claim that the government based its assertions on was that the tax system is broken and in need of repair. The significant test as to whether that is true or not is the ability of the tax system to generate revenues to meet the needs of the Commonwealth. The truth is that the Commonwealth budget is in surplus. The aggregate of all state budgets is in surplus. The tax system, thereby, is doing its job at this point. As well, the modelling that was produced by the Monash Centre established that the current system, in 
 fact, will produce more revenue for future needs than the system proposed in the GST package called ANTS by the government. That is a significant finding. It is significant because some in the welfare sector have assumed support for a GST based on the belief that the government was right when it said that the current tax system will not produce that outcome. Independent modelling shows that view—the foundation for the whole reason for reform—not to be true.</para><para>The second important finding concerns the inflation rate. We were told that the inflation rate that would be produced by the ANTS package—the GST package—is 1.9 per cent. In fact, the real truth is that it will be more like four to five per cent when the GST is introduced. Let me take you through why that is the case. The Treasury figure of 1.9 per cent is the second year effect. That is what we were told. The first year effect, produced by Treasury, is 2.4 per cent. When you take housing and cigarettes and tobacco into consideration, it is 3.1 per cent. Based on the fact that, in New Zealand, only 70 per cent of the savings under their GST flowed through to consumers as benefits, the real impact in Australia would be between four and five per cent—not 1.9 per cent, but four and five per cent.</para><para>We were also told by the government that their package would increase economic growth. Those assertions were made by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Treasury admits that this is an assumption. No Treasury modelling was done to establish that this is true. It was an assumption based on Econtech modelling—it was not done of the ANTS package but was done of an assumption that Econtech had made. Based on that, Treasury appropriated an assumption in this case. No advice has been given by Treasury to the government on quantitative assessments on economic growth. The government got no numbers advice on employment, unemployment and economic growth figures. That, too, is a finding that comes through in the evidence.</para><para>The other assertion is that the GST will produce jobs. I have to say, on the evidence, that there is not a job in it. Any jobs that are 
 created by this package are not created by a GST. The expert economists who gave evidence were unanimous on the fact that jobs, if they occur, will be created by the fiscal stimulus provided by raiding the surplus. That is old-fashioned Keynesian stimulus of an economy, by making a fiscal injection. But the evidence also found that there will be job losses. If wages track the increases in the consumer price index, 100,000 jobs will be lost in the early years of the GST. If there is a delay in passing on savings—that is, savings by cuts to indirect taxes such as wholesale sales tax—15,000 jobs will be lost. Where will they be lost? They will be lost in states like Queensland and Tasmania. In what industries will they be lost? They will be lost in industries like tourism and education exports—industries that are growth industries in this nation, providing the area in which job expectations rise. It will be in those areas that jobs will be lost.</para><para>The accountants association gave evidence that the assertion that a GST is a simple tax is doubtful—that in fact the GST is a complex tax. They could not tell us how complex because they were not able to complete their own survey of the complexities in time to give that evidence to the inquiry. Will the GST promote exports? This is the advice given to Australia by the Minister for Trade. On Treasury's own evidence the exchange rate will rise. That will in fact limit the ability of this nation to export and, again, the industries of tourism and education exports—two of the fastest areas of growth in the economy—will be hardest hit.</para><para>We were not able to take a lot of evidence on the black economy, but what is also true is that in other countries where a GST applies the black economy is often rampant and bigger, in some cases, than is the case in Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>2246</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I commence my remarks by thanking the secretariat, under Rob Diamond's secretary-ship, for the enormous work that they have put into this report and to the inquiry to date.

So what they have to say about the tax reform system is irrelevant. It does not matter what this inquiry hears from witnesses because the Labor Party's position was determined prior to their listening to the very first witness we heard. Their position on the matters that we have been hearing evidence on is quite irrelevant. Although I have only had half an hour to see the Labor Party findings—and I have just been looking briefly 
 through them—in the executive summary of the findings there is no basis for the assumptions that they draw in relation to government assertions and committee evidence.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Secondly, I have looked at the conclusions in the Democrat report and I have seen the evidence that the Democrats have supplied in that report in relation to those conclusions. The Democrats agree with the majority of the government's conclusions that are drawn from the ANTS package. The Democrats in their conclusions found that there was agreement by analysts on the revenue forecasts underpinning the government's tax reform. The Democrats accept that tax reform is necessary and required to repair the revenue base—that is, they accept the government's view that the current tax system is broken. We acknowledge that in our report.</para><para>They accept that the government's tax package will provide a more sustainable and secure revenue base for the states and territories—from a quick appraisal of their report, this is something not even mentioned by the Labor Party. Nowhere do they mention anything about the more sustainable and secure revenue base for the states and territories. Above all else, the Democrats in Senator Murray's report accept that the macro-economic effects of the tax package are positive. They accept that, from the evidence we have heard from all of the supposed experts who have come before our inquiry, the macro-economic effects of the tax package are positive. So in all of those areas we agree with the Democrats.</para><para>Senator Murray, as the Democrat senator on this inquiry, has come to the inquiry and the public hearings to listen to try to expand his knowledge so that some determination can be made. He did not come with the predetermined position that the Labor Party had that they will oppose the tax package in its entirety. The Democrats have come to the conclusion that they want to look at the evidence and draw their conclusions from that.</para><para>Unfortunately, from the government's point of view, the Democrats were not convinced by the bulk of witnesses who argued that food should remain in the tax base. In all of the modelling that was done by those eminent 
 modellers—Professor Dixon, Professor Neil Warren, Professor Ann Harding, David Johnson from the University of Melbourne, Chris Murphy and anybody who came before our committee—every one of them said that food should remain in the package. Not one said that it should be exempt. The reason they said that and the key reason for the government's position in wanting to maintain food in the GST system is that, if you want to provide equity for low and middle income earners and welfare recipients, the most effective way of delivering equity is through the existing social security system where the compensation can be targeted to those people who really need it. That is where we differ from the Democrats.</para><para>While the evidence was overwhelming from all of the modellers that food should remain in the tax package, the position the Democrats have taken on food in their report is that they have chosen to exempt it because they say that is more equitable. Those experts who came before us said, `No, that is not the case. If you want to deliver effective compensation to low income earners, to low wage earners and to welfare recipients, do it through the system that has been designed to do it—that is, through the social security system.' We totally support that point of view, although unfortunately it is not a view that the Democrats have accepted.</para><para>In relation to all of those other matters that I spoke about, the Democrats agree with the government's position that the tax system is broken, not the report that Senator Cook has made. This is one of the remedies that we are going to use to make sure that we fix the tax system for good. It is also evident that, because of the Labor Party's pre-determined position in relation to outright opposition to this tax package—and I have had a brief look at their report—they choose only those assumptions and the results of modelling using the most unrealistic assumptions, particularly in relation to jobs and wage demands. International experience has shown and evidence was given to us that, when a value added tax or a goods and services tax has been introduced in other countries, it has not been followed by wage demands.</para><para>The income tax cuts that are delivered in this package more than compensate for any increase in the CPI. So wage and salary earners will have more take-home pay than they currently have. How can you possibly factor in wage demands when wage and salary earners are going to have a bigger take-home pay under this package than they currently have today? It is unrealistic for the Labor Party to suggest that wage demands will follow, regardless of what the ACTU and one of the other unions which gave evidence to us said. International evidence does not support it and neither does the evidence that was brought before the committee.</para><para>One of the reasons that has been used by the Democrats in particular in trying to justify the exemption of food rather than using the social security system to compensate low income earners is that at some stage in the future governments can take that away. They cite New Zealand as an example. The Labor Party in some of their questioning also cited New Zealand where the compensation package was reduced some time after the introduction of the GST.</para><para>Let me say that most people tend to forget that, if they use New Zealand as a case, New Zealand has a unicameral system of parliament. The government of the day can do what they like without any review by an upper house. If the day ever comes when a move is made to reduce compensation levels—I can only presume that the Democrats and the Labor Party will still be sitting in the Senate and I cannot presume that any of us will ever have a majority in the foreseeable future—can you imagine any scenario under which this Senate would allow compensation to be reduced from the current compensation that is being offered by the government in this package?</para><para>In our supplementary report we have tried our best to provide you with evidence that was not in the main body of the report which supports our conclusions. We have also used a wide variety of quotes from people who appeared before us in the inquiry. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>2248</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to commence by thanking 
 the President of the Senate for the additional finance and assistance she gave to the committee for the very complex modelling task we had before us. I do wish to concur with the earlier speakers in thanking the secretariat for operating under considerable pressure and for the printers in producing this on time. In doing so I must colour my thanks slightly by indicating that the page numbers of our report have been put out of sequence. Anyone reading this report had better follow the page numbers, not the pages. I would be grateful if further copies could be corrected accordingly. It will merely make the people think that the Democrats are more confused than some think otherwise.</para></talk.start><para>The other person that I particularly want to thank is my adviser. As you know, the Democrats have limited resources and particular note needs to be made of John Cherry. I want to turn to the chair of the committee. The conduct of the chair was very good in sometimes trying circumstances and he has been of great assistance to the proper conduct of the inquiry to date. I thank him accordingly. I thank the deputy chair for his input. I thank Senators Conroy and Ferguson for their occasional repartee which has enlightened and enlivened the committee.</para><para>I drew attention in an interjection to the fairness of Senator Ferguson's remarks about the chair paying more attention to the Labor Party report than to the report of the committee. I thought that was appropriate since the chair had already just about completed the secretariat's analysis and review. It was quite proper that he should then turn his attention elsewhere, but I am sure he will defend himself in due course.</para><para>I also want to thank the modellers—numbering around nine—whose professional input has been extremely helpful to the committee. Regardless of their particular political persuasions and inputs, they seem to me a class of people whose professionalism does credit to both their industry and themselves.</para><para>I draw attention to some of the conclusions delivered in my colleague Senator Ferguson's address. We have had conversations with Professor Harding, as you would expect, and 
 our understanding of her views on food is that the jury is still out for her and that the issues of adequacy and permanency are very much at hand.</para><para>Turning to the report itself, it was necessary, because of the failure of the government to release any substantive modelling of their tax plan before the election, to have this committee do modelling. I think it has been a very unusual experience for the Senate to have to commission quite such extensive work. The findings have been more than interesting to all of us. As Senator Ferguson outlined, the coalition and Democrats have both concluded, based on the evidence put before us, that the tax reform plan is likely to have a small but positive impact on the economy—somewhere up to about a 0.2 per cent increase in consumer welfare, fairly cautiously defined. So tax reform on the economic margin appears to be worth doing.</para><para>The coalition and Democrat senators have concluded that the indirect tax base is declining and is in trouble and the matter is serious—a point backed up, I note, by Access Economics today. If we fail to fix that indirect tax base, by the year 2002 we will need a nearly $3 billion increase in sales tax rates to restore them to the 1995-96 level. On the basis of the evidence, the coalition and Democrat senators concluded that the fiscal stimulus from the package will boost employment in the short term by around 30,000 jobs. But we should note that the long-term result on the employment side seems to be negligible.</para><para>As I read their report, interestingly, the coalition—and I noticed that Senator Ferguson did not draw much attention to it—have now finally conceded in their conclusions the Democrat assertion that exempting food will not reduce the economic boost from tax reform. That is a fundamental finding for us because now all the attention is on equity and simplicity with regard to the food issue. So that is the common ground—the things that the coalition and the Democrats have agreed on—but I think the Labor Party has similar views on many of those areas.</para><para>The Democrats have reached a number of other conclusions based on the evidence. First, the government's stated impacts of a 
 GST on households deliberately underestimates the impact on low income households and overestimates the impact on high income households. That conclusion was backed up by six university professors and the Australian Bureau of Statistics in evidence to the committee. All recommended that the government should have used the data from the Households Expenditure Survey to calculate the impact on different household cameos with different levels of spending and saving. The committee has unanimously agreed that the tax plan needs to be remodelled at the distributional end of things using the HES data, and that report is due on 1 April.</para><para>The other key evidence—key from our point of view—has been on the exemption of food on economic efficiency grounds. Both modelling reports to the committee from Peter Dixon and Chris Murphy concluded that a GST without food would deliver the same economic benefits as a GST with food, but on equity grounds all witnesses conceded that taxing food is regressive. Why? Because low income earners spend twice as much as high income earners on food as a percentage of income, so taxing food will hurt them more.</para><para>Even witnesses who support a tax on food—such as Neil Warren and Geoff Carmody—acknowledged not only that the government's compensation was inadequate but also that the government's compensation is fragile. We have seen today, with Minister Reith's expose of his plans for the future, the exposure of what may be seen to be a secret agenda by the coalition for the next term, which is welfare reform, as they conceive it, and glowing praise for the way in which New Zealand has gone.</para><para>We all know—and Senator Ferguson drew attention to it—that they introduced a GST in New Zealand in 1987. They introduced compensation and withdrew it three or four years later in 1991—a withdrawal which, I must say, was much promoted by the Business Round Table there. If this government is working to the same game plan, we have a real problem on our hands, and the problem relates to trust. The surveys of the Australian people indicate that they do not trust governments. It does not matter which government; 
 they do not trust governments. It is very difficult to gainsay that because survey after survey says that. I do not trust this government or any other government to keep their compensation in place if they develop other priorities.</para><para>On those grounds, the marginal economic benefits of the tax plan are more than offset by the unfairness it will generate, and it will then fail the equity test, in our view, if food is kept in. As we have said consistently all along, the package gets a tick on economic efficiency—well, we have not said that all along, but we have worked it out from the evidence—but it gets a cross on equity and fairness; and that is a big cross. The evidence before the committee has confirmed our view on these issues.</para><para>Finally, the committee heard strong evidence about the impact of the GST on housing and inbound tourism. In my report, I have a few comments to make about the need for action in this area. I will draw your attention, if I may, to some of the conclusions we came to. We listed them as 1 to 10. We also provided a summary of the findings of the two key final modellers that the committee used—Peter Dixon's and Chris Murphy's various measures of how the GST looks with food in and food out.</para><para>The modelling before the committee concluded that the long-term macro-economic effects of the tax package are likely to be positive, albeit small, with increases in capital investment and traditional exports, a small but positive rise in economic welfare, a negligible effect on employment and negative effects on industries such as tourism, housing and personal services.</para><para>The job of Labor will be to persuade the Australian people that alternative plans would produce as good, or better, results on the tax revenue front, on tax reform, on GDP and on the equity areas which the government is addressing. Our job, we believe, is to accept that the government's intent is right but its package is wrong in substantial detail. Unless we can persuade you to change your mind on that, we will find it very difficult to take a position in support of your package—and food, of course, is a fundamental issue within 
 that. So I look forward very much to working with my colleagues further in this matter, and I compliment both the chair and the deputy chair on what they have done to date. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>2250</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Accounts Committee</title><page.no>2250</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>2250</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>2250</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the government's response to report No. 355 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled <inline font-style="italic">Aboriginal councils and Torres Strait Island councils: Review of financial accountability requirements</inline> , and I seek leave to incorporate the document in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows</inline>—</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response to the Report by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (JCPA)</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">REPORT 355</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND TORRES STRAIT ISLAND COUNCILS: REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS</inline></para><para>June 1998</para><para>FOREWORD</para><para>The Joint Committee of Public Accounts (JCPA) <inline font-style="italic"> "</inline> Report 355:  <inline font-style="italic"> Aboriginal Councils and Torres Strait Island Councils: Review of financial accountability requirements"</inline>  was tabled in Parliament on 27 November 1997.</para><para>In its report JCPA made 19 Recommendations of which Recommendations 2, 3, 4, 12, 14, 15, and 16 had policy implications.

My contribution to this debate will touch upon the following five issues: firstly, the history and role of ABC Online; secondly, the future of media delivery in Australia; thirdly, why ABC Online is critical to the future of the ABC itself; fourthly, the position of government and the minister, as discussed in various public forums; and, finally, the position of the ABC expressed through its board and managing director, Mr Johns.</para><para>Turning firstly to the history and role of ABC Online, like everything, ABC Online had a relatively modest beginning. It commenced planning at the beginning of 1995, and operational work was delegated by the board in mid-1995. That decision resulted in the multimedia unit being instructed to build the ABC web site. Two staff were given that job and, on 14 August 1995, the ABC web site was launched.</para><para>Mr Johns has recently advised that the original grant to establish the ABC web site was in the order of only $750,000. Within 12 months the site had become one of the most popular in Australia. It had 2,500 pages of content, and 140,000 pages accesses per week. Some three years later, a successful service results: 24 full-time staff; extensive internal ABC ancillary support; and exceptional consumer demand, with 2,000 weekly page accesses as at August 1998.</para><para>ABC Online is not only successful in terms of growth in satisfying consumer demand but is also a critical success. ABC Online is one of the most visited web sites in Australia.	 ABC Online is consistently rated as one of the top five web sites in Australia. It has won, as we are all aware, numerous awards. In both 1996 and 1997 it was given the award for the best media web site in Australia. In 1997 it received four Australian teacher of media awards. In both 1997 and 1998 again it received specific awards for the production of CD-ROMs in a whole range of diverse areas—to mention a few: ingenious animated scientific adventure; Bananas in Pyjamas, winner of seven awards; and the Lab, the ABC science gateway. In January 1998, the Lab ABC science outline was listed as one of the top 40 web sites in the world by <inline font-style="italic">Australian Personal Computer</inline> magazine.</para><para>In summary, therefore, it is fair to conclude that ABC Online is a growing and productive area of the ABC. There is considerable consumer demand for its services. It has great critical recognition for delivery of those services around Australia. Also it is a critically important link in generating revenue for the ABC shops through the sale of products and services, and it has enormous capacity to increase that revenue in future years.</para><para>The future of media delivery in Australia is relatively easy to forecast. The Internet has developed, and is developing, as the third form of media delivery right around the world. First there was radio, second there was TV and now we have come into the age of the Internet. In five years time, the use of the Internet will be as simple as turning on a TV. So to restrict development of ABC Online, to sell it off, to sell it off in part or to privatise 
 ABC Online is to say the ABC has no viable future.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—What?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">TIERNEY</name><name role="display">Senator Tierney</name></talker><para>—Nonsense.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>—Why don't you listen to the debate and you will find out why.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">TIERNEY</name><name role="display">Senator Tierney</name></talker><para>—We are.

We all know that you can keep a body alive through the provision of advanced medical services. People survive in comas and on machines for many years. They do not function as rational normal human beings in the way we have come to understand. Getting rid of the ABC Online service is akin to turning off that survival machine.</para></talk.start></continue><para>TV, radio, Internet, computers and telephones are all in the process of convergence. The delivery system is in the process of being perfected. Look at the alliances developing all around the world—Microsoft, IBM, broadcasters, Telstra and big overseas telcos. The hardware, the software, the delivery methods and data reception are all in a process of convergence. The ABC Online Internet service is the first service with a true ability to provide text, data, sound, image and interactivity. From 2001 that capability will be available via TV. With the introduction of digital broadcasting, these traditional media services will all meld into one form. It is called convergence, and within two or three years it will be a fact of life in this country. The ABC board, if nothing else, was diligent in its planning for this new media world. The future of ABC Online is a future of convergence, traditional media services coming into one medium.</para><para>So the future of media delivery in Australia is fairly clear, but begs this question: why is the ABC Online service critical to the future of the ABC? That question was asked in the Senate estimates last week. ABC's Managing Director, Mr Brian Johns, addressed it in some detail. He described the ABC Online service as being at the heart and core of ABC activities. A press release of Thursday, 11 February states:</para><para>"ABC Online is at the heart of the ABC. It is a core asset. It is indivisible from radio and television, drawing resources and content from ABC program makers across all networks and around the country," Mr Johns said. ABC Online depends on input from the ABC's 800 journalists, the producers, presenters and program makers of each of the five radio networks, the television network and staff in 57 broadcast centres across the nation.</para><para>"The ABC has had to work smart to get where we are today. As a result we have one of the most popular and highly regarded Internet services in Australia. Despite lean funding we have been able to create a public asset of great value, by applying the information gathering resources of the national public broadcaster to the new communication medium.</para><para>"ABC Online is not a commercial service. Its roots are in the ABC Charter which requires us to serve a diverse range of different audience interests without reference to the ability to attract commercial revenue. It is a publicly funded national resource.</para><para>"Of course decisions about the future of ABC Online and any other policy matters affecting the development of digital broadcasting are continuing matters for the Board.</para><para>"The ABC has never shirked from the task of searching for external sources of funding revenue, provided these meet the requirements of the Charter.</para><para>"The success of ABC Enterprises, for instance, is the envy of many public broadcasters. Over the past five years it has increased its contribution to the ABC program budget six fold.</para><para>"ABC Online is the gateway to the future of digital communication for Australian audiences and ABC staff.</para><para>. . .   . . .   . . .</para><para>"The ABC's Online venture is our first foray into this new media world. We have been diligent and successful in developing our online expertise. ABC Online is the entry point for the organisation into a new media environment, and the entry point for millions of Australians to content on the Internet . . . </para><para>The managing director put it succinctly in estimates at page 143 early last week, when he said about ABC Online services:</para><para>It is not a limb to be cut off. It is not a limb to be amputated. It is right at the heart of the ABC.</para><para>I turn now to the position of the minister and the government. The subject was canvassed extensively at recent estimates hearings, as I said. There is no sense in reading out slabs or 
 large extracts from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> . The government's position, as I understand it, is reasonably clear. It has four points: firstly, the government—or Minister Alston, as its representative—sees privatisation in whole or in part as whether you allow commercial involvement without compromising charter obligations and standards set for the ABC generally;	 secondly, the ABC should seriously consider all options that might benefit from synergies that derive from commercial operators; thirdly, convergence leads to commercial opportunity and new marketing opportunities—the ABC suffers from lack of expertise in this area; and, fourthly, future revenue streams or significant additional funding arrangements are linked inextricably with new commercial opportunities.</para><para>Minister Alston refuses to comment on the views of Mr Johns or the board. It appears to be fairly Alice in Wonderland stuff. For example, if we sell 33 per cent or 49 per cent of Telstra, we call it part privatisation. If we sell the ABC or 49 per cent of ABC Online for $250 million to retire debt, as is suggested, the minister says it is not privatisation, not a substantial sale of an asset, but the selling off of a portion or entering into a joint venture.</para><para>On the contrary, in respect of ABC Online services, Mr Johns said it is an integral part of the ABC's future. It goes to the core of the ABC. It is a core asset, he said. It is central to its very digital future. Minister Alston said of ABC Online services that it is simply another ABC delivery platform, that it is not integral to the ABC, that the charter obligations are integral to the ABC and that the fulfilment of charter obligations can be done through commercial means. So the minister is being quite straightforward here. The ABC, whether by design, planning or accident, for relatively low cost has created something of real value, something of real commercial appeal and something attracting and retaining significant markets. Mr Kroger understood that as a merchant banker.</para><para>The value derives from a number of aspects of ABC Online services—firstly, additional revenue from online services, presumably the huge cashflows that are generated, and, 
 secondly, access to other ABC markets because of digital conversion and delivery system convergence. For example, ABC radio has 25 per cent to 40 per cent of the market in every state and territory of Australia. It has strong brand names in Triple J, Radio Classic FM, various regional stations and news radio. The TV has a strong brand name in terms of the national network. The third area of value is the physical assets of the ABC, which are declining. Buildings are losing value and the technology is making a lot of equipment very cheap to replace. As a consequence, operational costs will become lower over time for a range of reasons.</para><para>So commercial access, commercial control and commercial ownership in whole or in part will be like owning a printing press at the Treasury. Mr Kroger knows that. Minister Alston knows that. Mr Johns, the Managing Director of the ABC, knows that. Hence this whole sorry episode. Of course, members of the public also know that. If we look at the letters to the editor section of, I think, today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, we will see a whole heap of letters under the heading, `Hands off! It's our ABC, Mr Kroger'. Mr Walter Bass, Founding President of the Friends of the ABC, Turramurra, New South Wales, says:</para><para>If Michael Kroger's extraordinary letter . . . reflects the views of the Government he represents in a de facto capacity, the ABC is indeed, as he says, condemned to a bleak future.</para><para>From its inception, it was intended that the national broadcaster should provide independent, government-funded radio—and later television—providing world-class entertainment and information. Mr Kroger ignores the fact that it was never the intention nor, as many polls have demonstrated over the years, is it the wish of the public, that the ABC "should seriously compete with the commercials," as Mr Kroger implies.</para><para>Seen in that light all Mr Kroger's talk of cyberspace, digitalisation and "financial resource bases" becomes irrelevant. It is clearly the duty of the Government to adequately finance the ABC and to preserve its independence. Perhaps when Mr Kroger has digested this fact, he might pass it on to his colleagues in Canberra.</para><para>Similarly, a Mr Peter Symons from Brunswick East in Victoria said:</para><para>Mr Kroger doesn't seem to understand the inherent danger to the ABC's editorial independence if any 
 part of it is privatised. To have a member of the ABC board ignorant of these basic tenets of our public broadcaster is deeply worrying.</para><para>There is a whole range of other letters that follow the same theme. In a nutshell, the government and the minister know and say the following: digital conversion and media convergence create huge value in ABC Online services. That value comes in the form of huge surplus cash flows generated from advertising revenue and from gatekeeper to other ABC services and markets. This is a commercial opportunity and should be exploited by partial sale. The stalking horse here is a merchant banker from Victoria, presumably acting on behalf of his own interests or a range of commercial interests.</para><para>The position of the ALP, the position of the opposition, is very simple in this matter. We will not be in it. We will not participate in the flogging off of any part of ABC Online. Whether it be 10 per cent, 25 per cent, 35 per cent or the lot, we will retain it in public hands. The value will remain in the hands of the government on behalf of taxpayers. An additional value through commercial services is a matter properly for resolution by the board, not merchant bankers in Victoria.</para><para>On a final note, we are satisfied that the ABC charter properly allows ABC Online services to remain in public hands and not be partly privatised or fully privatised in due course. In particular, we refer the Senate to section 6(1)(a)(i) and section 6(2)(a)(iii). Section 6(1)(a) says the functions of the corporation are:</para><para>. . . to provide within Australia innovative and comprehensive broadcasting services of a high standard as part of the Australian broadcasting system consisting of national, commercial and community sectors and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to provide—</para><para>(i) broadcasting programs that contribute to a sense of national identity and inform and entertain, and reflect the cultural diversity of, the Australian community . . . </para><para>The key phrases in that ABC charter are `innovative and comprehensive broadcasting services' and `the responsibility of the corporation as the provider of an independent national broadcasting service'. There is a 
 certain logical position that derives from the inclusion of those provisions in the charter.</para><para>If the ABC Online service is a gateway after digital conversion and media convergence, it is absolutely necessary that it remain in public hands. If ABC Online services are integral and critical to the entire future of the ABC, it should remain in public hands. It strikes me that, when one looks at those particular phrases in the ABC charter, it is absolutely counter to the intent of the charter, as decided by parliament, for the ABC Online services when it becomes a gatekeeper—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>2257</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are considering Senator Carr's general business notice of motion on the ABC's Online Internet service and I sat and listened with interest to some of the comments of Senator Bishop.

I remind the Senate that we contribute almost half a billion dollars of taxpayer funds into the ABC, and the ABC has developed, in response to that, a very comprehensive range of television and radio programs and now Internet services, which is the subject of this motion. So I think we have a lot to be proud of. Senator Bishop seems to be disturbed by the fact that, in our budget savings program 
 in 1996, we reduced the revenue of the ABC.

That is the commercial world, and particularly the commercial world in this area of media. The ABC have been cocooned for decades by a set budget that just keeps expanding and expanding and expanding. When we came into government, we put into place quite a number of efficiency operations right across the whole span of government. It was not just the ABC involved; it was the whole span of government. In that way, we closed off the Beazley black hole of $10 billion and got the economy back on the right track, and that is why we enjoy the prosperity we do today. We were not taking services away from the ABC; we were actually making them more efficient and they had to respond in that sort of way.

They seem to have reversed their policy last year because Senator Carr's motion now criticises the government, saying that it is up to the ABC and its board of management. What a confused party! With the ALP being in such a policy free zone, I suppose we just get these flip-flops from one side to the other. Perhaps we should read Mark Latham's or Lindsay Tanner's books; we might get some guidance on where the ALP is going in this area.</para><para>Let us get back to the nub of what Senator Carr's motion is suggesting. Here we are occupying the time of the Senate—for about 
 an hour and a half, I assume—on a matter that is subject to the view of one board member of the ABC. One board member has made a suggestion—shock, horror!—and that suggestion is to bring some privatisation, up to a certain percentage, into the Online service. That is a suggestion of a member of the board. Why on earth is it occupying the time of this parliament? This is quite a silly motion. Of all the issues facing Australia, why are we debating this?</para><para>I went to a drug crisis summit in Newcastle last night, and we had 400 people turn up. A lot of them were parents of children who died and children who were on drugs. If you want an issue, boy, is that an issue. Then look by contrast at what we are considering: the comment of one board member from the ABC.</para><para>Senator Carr, if you look at international practice you will realise that what is being suggested by Mr Kroger—indeed, what was attempted by your last government with four ill-fated attempts which were badly managed by the former managing director—is moving in the direction of the ABC raising funds in legitimate ways within its own charter and that it actually fixes the problem that Senator Bourne has raised. She has been grumbling and complaining all through my contribution here today. Her basic point is that the ABC does not get enough funding. Well, if that is your view, Senator Bourne, you should support these sorts of arrangements, because the ABC will get more funding under them.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Bourne interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—Yet you seem to object to that.

Senator Bourne, most of the increase goes into the health and welfare areas which are not very good at self-funding. What about activities that can raise funding; what about 
 a high quality broadcaster like the ABC which has the capacity—through the selling of programs through commercial alliances such as the Online service—to actually raise additional funds and fund the organisation in the way that they want. This motion by Senator Carr is a total nonsense. It is a waste of the Senate's time. Senator Carr, I would invite you to get real and to get on with some real issues.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>2260</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I don't know where to start. Yes, I do know where to start. I am going to start with a motion for the suspension of standing orders that was moved by Senator Alston. We all know Senator Alston. Senator Alston is currently the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. On 30 June 1994 he moved a motion for the suspension of standing orders because there was a matter he thought was so important that it should take up the time of the Senate. And it was a very important motion. I supported him on this. The motion was:</para></talk.start><para>. . . that the Senate deplores the blatant politicisation of the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in flagrant disregard of its statutory obligations.</para><para>That was an extremely important motion. I supported him. The fact was that the ALP was putting ALP people on the board. The fact was that they had not adequately explained why they were doing that. The Liberal Party at the time, through Senator Alston and through other senators, was totally outraged that this was happening. They, of course, would never do such a thing—they would have put people on the board who could demonstrate that they had no close connections with the Liberal Party and that they were being put on the board purely because they were worth having on that board.</para><para>Let me tell you how Senator Alston finished that speech. It was a very good, strong finish. It is probably right as we speak today. He said:</para><para>I say in conclusion—</para><para>this is from the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  of 30 June 1994—</para><para>that what we have here is a classic stacked deck of which a Mississippi gambler would be very proud. 
 It is yet another example of Mr Keating's `all spoils to the victor' approach to politics. It has, I think, a serious capacity to undermine the integrity and reputation of an esteemed Australian institution.</para><para>That was what he was saying on 30 June 1994. On 27 June, just before that, he made a few other very pertinent points. They were that the appointment of people who had a very obvious connection with one side of politics to a board such as the ABC board was dangerous because it raised the more serious concern about the imminent appointments to the board of the ABC. Senator Alston stated:</para><para>The board of the ABC, when it started out under another name, was one that prided itself on its independence. Indeed, as Professor Armstrong, the chairman of the ABC—</para><para>on 27 June 1994—</para><para>says in his commentary on communications law and policy in Australia:</para><para>On the ABC's inaugural broadcast, the Prime Minister, Mr Joe Lyons, declared that the government's purpose was to appoint able and impartial trustees for an important national service.</para><para>Senator Alston goes on to say:</para><para>. . . it is absolutely critical that the ABC is not compromised in its work and that it does have a genuine and impartial board . . . Otherwise we end up with a stacked deck . . . to have people there who will not act in the best interests of the taxpayer but simply in the best interests of the ALP . . .</para><para>In this case it was the ALP. Let me suggest that in the current case it seems to be the Liberal Party. I don't think anybody can deny that Mr Kroger has very, very strong links with the Liberal Party, but his friendships go further, into commercial broadcasting.</para><para>Mr Kroger has been suggesting several things. One of the things Mr Kroger has been suggesting is that the ABC look at privatising just under half of ABC Online. We heard from Mr Kroger. He was writing to the newspapers saying that the ABC has to stop being reliant on government handouts. I don't think Mr Kroger quite understands what the ABC is based on. I don't think he quite understands that it is supposed to be completely impartial, that it cannot have advertising on it because, once it has advertising on it, it can't be completely impartial. The 
 quality and the type of broadcasting we have in Australia in all its forms depends on its source of funding. So it is really important that we have a national broadcaster.</para><para>I agree with Senator Tierney when he says that we have a terrific public broadcasting service in this country—but we won't for long unless we fund it properly. We fund it from the public purse. At the moment each of us is paying, I think, less than 6c a day. It is not 8c a day. I am happy to pay 8c a day, I am happy to pay 10c a day, I am happy to pay a $1 a day—but then, I am a high income earner. If you look at the latest survey about what people think of the ABC you will find that 86 per cent of the respondents to that Newspoll survey said that they thought ABC television can be rated as good, compared to commercial television, which 44 per cent rated as good.</para><para>So twice as many Australians—86 per cent—think that ABC television can be rated as good compared with the number who rate commercial television as good. That is almost exactly the same result we keep getting in these surveys. It is going to have to go down sooner or later once the funding downfall, the dreadful slashing in funding, that has happened under this government really starts kicking in. At the moment 86 per cent of Australians still believe that ABC TV is really good, whereas only 44 per cent of Australians think the same about commercial TV.</para><para>So Australians do believe that the ABC is something they want to maintain. In a survey two years ago they said that it was the greatest force for good in this community. It beat the police, the judiciary, politicians and journalists into the ground. It beat everybody. The ABC was seen by more than 85 per cent—I think it was 85 per cent—of respondents as being the greatest force for good in this country. `Oh, well let's get rid of it. Let's stop it being what it is and what it is seen to be.' Is that what this government wants to do? Is that why it is slashing all these funds? Is that what is happening here? I wish somebody would tell me it isn't, because I cannot believe that is not the case.</para><para>ABC Online is an integral part of the ABC's broadcast role. To sell it off would be 
 like selling off the TV part, or the radio part. It is one way that the ABC achieves its charter obligations—unless you want to change the charter, nothing much is happening—to reach as many Australians with as much information as possible. Just as the ABC had a responsibility to make use of TV to reach Australians when that medium reached Australia, so it must use digital formats like the Online service. This is a really popular and valuable service. That is obviously why Mr Kroger thinks it should be got rid of. He thinks there will be a one-off injection and then the government will not have to pay that money.</para><para>The government seems to think that income from tax revenue belongs to it, that it is its money, that it belongs to every member of the cabinet, that it belongs to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to do what they like with. It doesn't. It belongs to all Australians. It belongs to me, it belongs to you—it belongs to you, Madam Acting Deputy President. It belongs to everybody in this chamber. Most importantly, it belongs to every Australian outside this chamber, outside this Parliament House. That is who the ABC belongs to.</para><para>The ABC is not the plaything of this government. It is not the plaything of Mr Kroger. It is not the plaything of this minister. The ABC belongs to every Australian, and the ABC ought to be able to be used by every Australian. It ought to be able to be used in an impartial fashion. It ought to not have advertising on it, no matter what. It ought to be something that is funded so that it cannot be influenced by outside influences, such as corporations which might advertise on the ABC, ABC Online or anywhere on the ABC.</para><para>ABC Online is the digital precursor of more things to come in the ABC in Australia. The expertise that has been developed now in ABC Online will be used in digital television. It will be used in digital radio. It will be used in the convergence of other technologies that are coming. We all know they are coming. The minister keeps telling us that these things are about to hit us. That is where the technology is going to train people. The use of that technology will train people within the ABC to be able to switch over to digital TV, to be 
 able to switch over to digital radio. ABC Online is an integral part of the ABC as it stands at the moment.</para><para>Mr Kroger tells us that the sale of ABC Online will give the ABC funds to do its job and meet its charter obligations. It is the government's responsibility to fund the ABC adequately to do its job under the charter. It is not the ABC's job to sell off bits, to cobble together some inadequate service for all Australians. Just as the government of the day—the Menzies government—enthusiastically funded the ABC to go into television and to go into Radio Australia—and I will say a bit about that later—it should fund the ABC adequately to meet the digital age.</para><para>Broadcasting in Australia has depended on the ABC for innovative programming, training and development of services. The reason the ABC has done these things is that its funding base is different from the commercial sector. Its different funding source and charter have driven the ABC to provide programming which is different from the commercial channels. That is very important. We all remember Mr Bob Mansfield and we remember Mr Mansfield's report on the ABC. I am reasonably certain that the minister expected it to come out differently from what it did.</para><para>Mr Mansfield believed, and I am sure still believes, that you would need $500 million to run a national broadcasting service. Keep in mind that is a national television and a national radio broadcasting service, with several radio networks—$500 million. That is not what this government is giving the ABC to run its service. What this government is giving the ABC according to the figure in the last budget was $486 million and that included the orchestras. I think it was $467 million without the orchestras. That is spectacularly down from what it needs. Obviously the strain is beginning to show.</para><para>Despite that, ABC Online is one of the best online services in Australia. It is one of the most popular online services in Australia. It is not just that: the funding for the ABC has to include in the future the change to the digital era of television and the digital era of radio, and we do not even know where that is going yet. Goodness knows where the funding 
 for that is coming from, because as far as the funding for digital television is concerned the government has promised $20.7 million. They will get that. They need at least $184 million. So they will get $20.7 million.</para><para>The estimates given by the Arthur Andersen report into the digitisation strategy of the ABC are that it will take about $184 million for the ABC to be able to fully digitise. That is quite small when you consider that they will have to digitise an entire national rural and urban network of television. It compares extremely favourably when you compare it with what the commercial television networks believe they would need, which was somewhere in the vicinity of between $500 and $700 million—that is off the top of my head, so I am not sure—between the three of them to do the same thing only with their urban networks.</para><para>The Arthur Andersen report was completely independent—utterly independent. I do not see the government getting independent reports into what everybody else thinks they are going to need for digitisation, but that bill went through anyway. Still, they got an independent report into what the ABC would need, and the independent report agreed with what the ABC had estimated in the first place, which I believe was $184 million. Where is the ABC going to get the $184 million? They will not get it from selling ABC Online, and they are not going to get it from the government at this rate either. The government have promised $20.7 million. They have promised to underwrite another $24 million, and the minister says, `Don't worry, of course we will fund the ABC to go to digital television.'</para><para>Then I see a quote from the minister after Mr Kroger's suggestion was made public which says that this may be a very good way for the ABC to fund going to digital. Excuse me, I believe the minister said that the government would fund the ABC going to digital. I think that is the only reasonable way to fund going to digital. The government has, after all, given the commercial free-to-air networks free spectrum in the digital spectrum for a number of years because they believe it will cost them a lot of money to go to digital, and it will not cost them as much as it costs 
 the ABC. If the government is willing to give the commercial networks a foot-up in relation to exclusive digital spectrum for a number of years because of the costs, they really ought to be looking after their own duties—and it is a duty on their part—to fund the ABC properly to go into digital television.</para><para>I would like to make one last point about ABC funding. It is one of my favourite points: the funding of Radio Australia, which is of course part of the ABC. If you look at the ABC Online service, you will find that they have Radio Australia as part of that service. You can find what has been on Radio Australia recently. You can find transcripts of some of the articles, and you can find a lot of other information.</para><para>The problem with Radio Australia is that if you live, work or are in most of Asia, and particularly most of South-East Asia, you will not be able to hear it on short-wave radio. The reason for that is that the state-of-the-art transmitter, which is located in Darwin at Cox Peninsula, has been turned off by the ABC. It has been turned off by the ABC because the government told them to do that. The government is very proud of the fact they told them to do that because they have saved $1.4 million year. For that saving of $1.4 million a year what they have achieved is that they have got off side a huge number of ordinary citizens in South-East Asia.</para><para>And what about the heads of state that wrote and said, `Would you please not turn off the Radio Australia short-wave service'? They cannot be particularly pleased that it was, in fact, turned off. I had a prominent Cambodian in my office only a couple of weeks ago and, after discussing matters that were going on in Cambodia, he said, `I have to ask you one more thing: is it at all possible for you to influence the government to turn back on the Radio Australia short-wave service? We need it so much in Cambodia.' They do need it in Cambodia. They need it in Vietnam. They need it in Indonesia. They need it in all those countries of Asia, and particularly South-East Asia, that are currently 
 having problems. They are sorting out their problems, but they are currently having problems.</para><para>That Radio Australia short-wave transmission is desperately needed by the people of South-East Asia. It is desperately needed by Australians travelling in South-East Asia. It is one of the most unbiased and respected services in the world. At the moment you can get it if you have a satellite dish and satellite receiver. It is going out on satellite into Asia, but it is not going out in the form of broadcast which is affordable to pretty well all South-East Asians, in the form of broadcast which is really difficult to block and in the form of broadcast which is widely listened to around South-East Asia not only by the ordinary South-East Asians on the ground but also by Australian tourists, by Australian business people, by Australians travelling in South-East Asia. It is an absolute disgrace that this government has turned that off and has left that off. It is a disgrace that they are not listening to the people or even to the governments of South-East Asia who would like that service turned back on.</para><para>In conclusion, it would be a huge backward step for the ABC to sell any part of its basic service to all Australians. Let us just remember: all Australians own the ABC—not this government, not this minister and not even the board. It would be a dreadful backward step for any part of the ABC, including ABC Online, to be sold off, to be commercialised, to be beholden on advertising from someone who can then take away that advertising if they do not like what is going on at the ABC.</para><para>It would be a dreadful shame if any Australian government believed that they did not have to fund a public broadcasting service. It is called a public broadcasting service because it is a public broadcasting service, because it does not depend on any one commercial interest in order to be on the air. That means it can be innovative. That means it can be ahead of its time. That means it can take risks. And those risks have led to so many things that Australians value. Its unbiased nature has led to so many things that Australians value. Any diminution of that is a dimin 
 ution of the Australian lifestyle, and I would fight it to the end.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>2264</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to make a brief contribution to this afternoon's debate on general business notice of motion No. 119 standing in the name of Senator Carr. In doing so I would like to note that the observations that are made in the motion noting the unique and valuable contribution that the award winning Internet service ABC Online has made to the multimedia services of the ABC and that the online gateway structure is closely integrated with most ABC broadcasting services and fully integrated with ABC news services are, in fact, statements with which I am happy to agree.</para></talk.start><para>ABC Online, established in 1995 to initiate the ABC's involvement with multimedia, is an excellent valuable resource for all Australians and, obviously, for those much further afield. It is the network within the ABC that coordinates all ABC online activities and web sites as well as multimedia projects. It is an award winning Internet service. But, as such, it and any other aspect of the ABC should not for some bizarre reason be absolutely immune from any discussion of progress or change within that community of communications and information technology.</para><para>It seems to me curious that the opposition is not even prepared to look at, to consider, issues around the idea floated because that would somehow be breaking new ground. It would somehow be an idea which they would totally reject. I find it ironic in the extreme that they would attack Michael Kroger—or anyone else, for that matter—for floating ideas about the operations of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It is ironic that people who were always so protective of the capacity of the ABC to float ideas from outside the mainstream would be critical of someone for doing exactly that, critical of somebody for being independent and free-thinking. Apparently the only way you get to make a statement in this country anymore is if you agree with the ALP.</para><para>I was fortunate enough to be in estimates last week when this issue was discussed, and I think the Minister for Communications, 
 Information Technology and the Arts said some very useful things that regard, which I would like to refer to today. It is important to the ABC and it is important to public broadcasting in this nation that there is not just a knee-jerk response to the issues that we are discussing today and that the ABC itself, I guess, does not get caught up in what the minister described as `political crossfire' about whether this amounts to privatisation or whether it amounts to commercial encroachment.</para><para>Senator Bourne referred simply to advertising in her speech in relation to matters of commercialisation, but it is important to note that we are talking about more than one source of possible revenue in that regard. It could be advertising but, more than that, it could be subscription or the sale of products. You can have one, any or none of those. But it is not the case that you should exclude consideration of the options, and that is what the opposition is suggesting today.</para><para>I am highly diverted by the fact that the mover of the motion proposes that we give support to the ABC chair, Mr Donald McDonald. He is a person who does an excellent job in that capacity but—at any turn, at any moment, no matter what he says or what he does—he is usually attacked and criticised by those opposite for somehow being tainted in that environment. But today, apparently, it is okay to support Mr McDonald. I, for one, am a very strong supporter of Mr McDonald and am happy to see him in that responsible position.</para><para>It seems to me that what we should be talking about today is how ABC Online can look to its future and look at opportunities for innovation and change. A good online service, a good web site and any of its services do not need to be 100 per cent government owned to make it effective. What it needs to be is informative, expeditious and easily accessible. Look at how many other web sites—commercial and otherwise—have been pioneers of the information age. Dare I make reference to the classic case of the Drudge report in the United States, which breaks news reports of enormous international proportions and is operated by only one man? 
 Not that I would ever make a comparison between that and ABC Online, I hasten to add.</para><para>Nobody disagrees with the importance of a vibrant online community. In fact, as far as this government is concerned, this is an absolutely integral part of our move into the next century. An Online Australia Day is going to provide a national focus for exactly that. In the launch of <inline font-style="italic">Online Australia 1999</inline>, we have a national focus on the information economy. I am sure that those interested will know that ABC Online will play a very important part in that area.</para><para>Australia is already a globally recognised leader in the use of new technologies, including the Internet, e-commerce, IT, the development of computer software and hardware and all sorts of other online applications. These are transforming the daily lives of Australians. But to try to say, as the opposition has this afternoon that, as a knee-jerk reaction or automatic response to an unusually heightened level of paranoia, we should not even consider or discuss some of the suggestions which are around on this issue is extraordinarily narrow-minded and extraordinarily focused on their own interests.</para><para>The minister put the point particularly well in estimates last week, when he said that it was important `to look at whether there are ways in which they'—meaning the ABC—`can benefit from the synergies that derive from involvement with commercial operators'. Unless looking at synergies is now a crime under the laws created by the opposition is this regard, I think that is a very valuable suggestion to make. People who often regard each other as competitors are constantly, I believe, being involved in things like joint ventures—sometimes quite outside their traditional areas of activity—because, as the minister has said, there is `mutual benefit in understanding and getting new perspectives on the way in which business is done'. If members of the ABC board, or anyone else for that matter, see fit to make suggestions in that regard, Mr Acting Deputy President, I and the government, I think, see no reason why those issues cannot be explored in a 
 mature, sensible debate. But it would seem that those opposite would disagree.</para><para>The contribution of ABC Online to the health of the ABC's digital services is also well recorded in some of the statements of Mr Brian Johns at estimates last week. ABC Online uses `specialist program makers' providing material online from over `800 journalists'. That is a very important part of access, particularly for rural and regional Australia, right through Australia's radio networks. The ABC uses the full weight of the corporation to back that up, to maximise results and to capitalise on them, as Mr Johns as said. Nobody disagrees with the contribution that ABC Online can make to the provision of news and information. The issue is, apparently, whether it needs to be government owned. Ultimately, of course, that is a matter for the board and a matter which the board will consider, I am sure, in the due course of events.</para><para>The whole debate should not be about one side or the other of politics. It should be about the provision of quality services. In terms of discussion of ideas for the future, there has only been the suggestion of a small element of commercialisation in this regard. The issue is about the future; it is about considering the best operation of ABC Online within the whole ABC corporation and the best contribution that it can make to the sorts of things that Senator Bourne was talking about. I think she used the phrase `cobbled together'. I do not know whether she meant that people in Australia find that the ABC is cobbled together, but I would absolutely reject that. The government supports a strong and independent ABC; it always has and it always will. In discussing the future of parts of the ABC, like ABC Online, the government, at least, is prepared to be open minded and to consider all the options available.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>2265</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The motion that I moved today calls on the government to support the position of the ABC chair, Mr Donald McDonald, and the ABC managing director, Mr Brian Johns, in their rejection of any sale of the Online services. Given that the Prime Minister's friend, Mr McDonald, has made his strong 
 position clear on this, I think it is only appropriate that this Senate agree with him on this matter which is at the heart of the future direction of the ABC.</para></talk.start><para>It is clear from the debate we have had today that it is left once again to the opposition to come to the defence of the ABC. It is the Labor Party that seeks to defend the organisation from a government which is intent upon undermining its pillars of independence and intent upon dismantling its key functions. The move to privatise the ABC's Internet vehicle, Online, is just one of a series of attacks on the viability of the organisation. This is an organisation that is doing very well despite the persistent financial and rhetorical attacks launched upon it by this government. It follows constant attacks upon the ABC and its integrity. It follows severe budget cutbacks, programming cutbacks, attacks upon Australian content and Radio Australia cutbacks—the list goes on—all of which stem directly from the government's policy of removing hundreds of millions of dollars from the budget of the ABC.</para><para>This motion is as much about the activities of a Liberal stalwart and the ABC board member Mr Michael Kroger as it is about protecting ABC Online itself. We should all remember just who this Michael Kroger is. He has a record of attacking the ABC for what he perceives to be its biased political coverage. By that he means that it does not agree with the Liberal Party's point of view in any election campaign. Senator Abetz's very good understanding of an even-handed approach to broadcasting is that both the National Party and the Liberal Party get a fair cut of the action to the exclusion of all others.</para><para>We saw, for instance, in regard to Mr Kroger's complaints about the ABC during the election campaign that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> reported on 20 September 1998 that the ABC received 22 written complaints over its election coverage. One-third of those 22 complaints came from the Liberal Party director, Mr Lynton Crosby. At least another three had been made by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, who is the failed manager of the Liberal Party's election campaign in Victoria.</para><para>It is the same Mr Kroger who promised and failed to deliver the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper to Mr Packer. He spearheaded the PBL's failed campaign to convince the government to change its cross-media laws to allow Mr Packer to take over the Fairfax Holdings. It is the same Mr Kroger who also failed in his work that he did for News Ltd. He was at least even-handed in that regard. Remember when he sought to reverse the decision to give free spectrum to the commercial networks for digital television? It is the same Mr Kroger who was unsuccessful in his lobbying on behalf of the National Bank for the government to relax its four pillars policy to enable the NBA to merge with the ANZ.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>—So far.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—That may well be the case, Senator, that it is so far. But up to this point it is a failed lobbying effort. It is the same Mr Kroger who has acted as the chief spin doctor for the Solomon Lew family in their unsuccessful takeover of Country Road. He was the chief lobbyist for Solomon Lew's attempt to keep his Reserve Bank board seat. Importantly, his merchant bank, J.T. Campbell and Co., despite its enormously weak financial record, makes most of its money out of these various predatory moves against various other entities directly tied with lobbying government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is well known that J.T. Campbell lacks the financial resources to pitch for the mega deals, so therefore he concentrates on these niche arrangements. Mr Kroger's only real big money-spinner seems to be from his role as the deputy chair of Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting. It is a role that many in Melbourne are only too happy to talk to the press about because it has upset them so much, particularly given Mr Kroger's role as a spokesperson in Rinehart's bitter legal battles with her father's ex-wife, Rose Porteous.</para><para>In short, Mr Kroger's business and lobbyist activities to date have been unsuccessful, and at best one could say they have been entirely dependent upon what is perceived by some as his links to government. In fact, what you see from this is a record of failure, of waning political influence within the halls of power within the Liberal Party. Mr Kroger strongly 
 advertises what he sees as his success fees. This is why he is doing so badly financially, because his business deals hinge so strongly on receipt of success fees, which he very rarely obtains. His well-known political affiliations and close personal contacts and friendships with Mr Costello and Senator Alston have been a real negative for him and, I suspect, for them. One has to admire Mr Kroger for his persistence and his determination to battle on.</para><para>Now his latest business venture is the sale of ABC Online. One has to speculate that perhaps in the future Mr Kroger might resign from the ABC board and set himself up as a go-between for the Packer organisation and the government, given the Packer organisation is so intent on establishing itself in this Internet arena of business activity. However, we have to acknowledge the issue of Mr Kroger's influence on the Liberal Party itself. It raises real questions as to the extent to which he is able to influence anything at all.</para><para>We saw the great adventure he had with the Liberal Party preselections in Victoria just last year with Senator Synon and with the way in which Jeff Kennett comprehensively did him over. Even Jeff Kennett, who has made so many comments about other senators here, has made it very clear what he thinks about Senator Synon and her chief patron—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>—Has he ever said anything about Eric?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—He probably would not know him at all. Jeff Kennett understands Mr Kroger's waning influence in the Liberal Party and his attempt to promote Mr Costello, naturally enough, against the interests of so many. I suspect it is understood, in fact it is well known in Melbourne these days, that Mr Costello has been strongly advised by all the key players in the Liberal Party in Victoria that he should distance himself from Mr Kroger and seek his advice elsewhere. This is a well-known fact. It is a shame that Mr Costello seems so reluctant to accept this political advice.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Mr Kroger's declining influence on the Liberal Party and the broadening of his attempts to gain some sort of predatory advantage, in terms of commercially provid 
 ing advice to government about the privatisation of the ABC's Online service, has shown that he has acted entirely separately—and we acknowledge this—from his responsibilities as a member of the board of the ABC. He has not consulted with the managing director. He has not consulted with the chairman of the board. He has not sought to raise these issues with the board. He has sought to obtain some cheap publicity for himself which one might suggest was fully supported by Mr Costello—in fact pre-organised with Mr Costello, because it reflects the Liberal Party's deep and abiding hatred of the ABC. It also suggests to me his clear intention to punish the Liberal Party by his continued attempts to present himself as the great powerbroker within that organisation.</para><para>Mr Costello ought to make a clean break with this man. He should do the country a favour, do the Liberal Party a favour, and get out of his relationship with Mr Kroger. Mr Packer ought to do much the same himself, because the links there are quite clearly unproductive. Mr Kroger has not delivered what he claimed he would be able to deliver. He has not been able to deliver on so many occasions now. One trusts he will not be able to deliver on this. One simply has to acknowledge that this proposal does not make any sense at all. I hope that, like many of his other financial adventures, it too will fail. The attempt to privatise the ABC's Internet service is ill judged and, given Mr Kroger's membership of the ABC board, I would have thought he would have at least understood the vital part that the ABC's Internet service now plays in the whole organisation.</para><para>Mr Kroger estimates that Online's value is about $500 million. What a preposterous concept that is. The whole point about the value of the ABC is that you cannot put a price on it. That is what makes the ABC such a valuable institution to the rest of the country. You cannot put a price on its integrity, on its impartiality, on its objectivity. What he is proposing is essentially to separate out that fundamental premise that the ABC is above price. It is above purchase. It is not like the rest of the media in this country. It has an independent role free from those sorts of 
 commercial pressures. He is proposing to somehow or other place a dollar value on the integrity of the ABC. What we all accept and respect about the ABC is its integrity. Frankly, we do not see that with regard to the Liberal Party view of what the ABC should be—that is, a commercial outfit just like the others and subject to the same sorts of pressures and open to the same sorts of influences.</para><para>The great value of Online is that it is directly linked both to the corporation's future convergence plans and, as I say, the basic integrity of the organisation. You cannot possibly separate those two issues. You cannot possibly separate the integral part of Online from the rest of the ABC. The estimates of its value based on a privatised Online assumes that advertising could be introduced to the service as a whole. This is a concept that I find quite preposterous. Given any understanding of the charter of the ABC—and one would have thought that, as a member of the board of the ABC, Mr Kroger would have at least grasped that proposition—the charter of the ABC precludes the use of advertising for very good reasons.</para><para>What we have noticed throughout all of this is that the ABC is increasingly relying upon Online's services. The brochures that I have seen outlining the services that are provided by Online provide another alternative news source to many Australians in regional parts of this country. Those issues are directly put at risk by Mr Kroger's proposal. Frankly, in an era of convergence when the boundaries between radio, TV and the web are blurring, it is simply impossible to extract one aspect of the service delivery from the other. To do so would severely weaken the ABC as a whole and frankly weaken all of those services that are being provided.</para><para>I say to you that the idea of advertising in this context is quite reprehensible. What Mr Kroger and the Howard government fail to recognise is that the ABC's primary function is to deliver a high quality service to the Australian people which has the respect and the support of the Australian people. It cannot do so when it is seen as a mere commercial operation. Despite the limited resources that 
 the ABC has at its disposal, it is now quite clearly competing, particularly in the Internet field, very strongly with the rest of the private sector.</para><para>This is what is really at risk here. This is what the real question is—that is, the great threat the Liberal Party sees. All the enterprises that have been closed down by this government have been those enterprises that the ABC has embarked upon to expand upon its activities which are perceived to be in direct competition with the private sector. Its news gathering role and its capacity to move out into Australian society has been restricted by this government, a government which quite clearly hates and despises the ABC and all that it stands for.</para><para>What we are seeing is a government that frankly is not interested in protecting the viability and the long-term interests of this organisation. That is why we have moved this motion today to try to draw attention to the failure of this government in this regard and to acknowledge that it is very important that the ABC be provided with the opportunity to play a key role in developing and promoting Australian content, Australian media and Australian culture both in this country and abroad.</para><para>Mr Kroger as an ABC board member should understand that. He should get his mind above these narrow commercial pursuits and he should concentrate on his responsibilities and ensure that the ABC is protected as a viable organisation. His attempts to link the future of ABC funding to the privatisation of key services clearly spells out what the Liberal Party's plan is. It is totally unacceptable in that policy. What we are seeking in this motion, and I trust that the Senate will be able to support it as a whole, is to reaffirm the great values that have made the ABC a tremendous organisation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>—A real force for civilisation.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—Yes, it is a very important institution to the culture and to the people of this country.

The Democrats also sought to make a contribution in this debate, through Senator Bourne. Most of it was by way of interjection on my friend Senator Tierney but, when it was actually Senator Bourne's turn to make a contribution, there was nothing of substance. Indeed, she seemed to come into this debate like she came into the world—eyes closed and mouth wide open. I would suggest to Senator Bourne and the Democrats that they open their eyes and have a look at what is actually going on in the real world, what the benefits would be to the ABC if certain courses of action were even just 
 considered. Then, after she has taken it in, she might consider opening her mouth and making a more substantive contribution to this debate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>She sought to link Mr Kroger as a political appointment in the same fashion as the Labor Party used to stack the ABC board. Failed Labor Premier John Bannon—from your home state of South Australia, Senator Quirke—bankrupted the state of South Australia, had no financial capacity whatsoever and his only record in public life was to bankrupt his home state. So what do his federal mates do? They appoint him to the ABC board. In contradistinction, Mr Kroger has a reputation throughout the business community—well in excess of anything Mr Bannon ever had—and his appointment was on the basis of expertise and capacity. We on this side say that a party membership of itself should not disqualify you in relation to an appointment, but if the only characteristic is your party membership—as with John Bannon—then that is something to be condemned, and we in opposition quite appropriately did that. We condemned some of Labor's appointments because they were only appointments of mates. There was no objective standard by which you could say, with that abysmal track record of John Bannon, that he should have been presiding on the ABC board.</para><para>Senator Carr, as I indicated earlier, has this unique capacity to lead with his chin. He told us in the debate—and, indeed, in his motion—that the Senate is called upon to `condemn the anti-ABC ideology'. It is interesting to do an analysis of the news reporting during the last federal election campaign. A very respected body—the Institute of Public Affairs—did an analysis. It showed that, during the whole election campaign, National Nine News was the most balanced; Ten News was, in fact, the least: pro-ALP and anti-coalition comments outnumbered pro-coalition and anti-ALP comments on Nine by a 20 per cent margin, on ABC by 23 per cent, on Seven by 40 per cent and on Ten by 60 per cent.</para><para>You could say that is a pretty good record for the ABC, but then you have a look at the detailed figures. I want to read from the 
 Institute of Public Affairs analysis because it is very interesting. Three academics, having done a very detailed and considered study, found with respect to the ABC that:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">ABC News</inline>  made a spectacular U-turn during the campaign. In the first two weeks, it was the least balanced of the networks, favouring ALP policies by 56%. However, during the last three weeks of the campaign, <inline font-style="italic">ABC News</inline>  was the most balanced of the four networks, favouring ALP policies by just 8%.</para><para>The shift in the ABC coincided with a number of high-profile events—ABC Radio came under fire for promoting a rock concert called `Howard's End'; an interview with Verity James in which she questioned the Prime Minister about the impact of the GST on the price of heroin;—</para><para>I do not think even Senator Bolkus would stoop that low—</para><para>and the IPA's first press release critical of ABC-TV coverage. The most dramatic shift on <inline font-style="italic">ABC News</inline>  occurred after week two, when the coverage shifted from being highly favourable towards the ALP (by 120%) to favourable towards the Coalition (by 60%).</para><para>If you can see that sort of change within the ABC's national news reporting, assessed and undertaken by independent people studying the issues of the federal election campaign very carefully, you do have to ask the question: how unbiased and how balanced is the ABC? I have to ask Senator Bourne: with all the lovely words about ABC independence and how it is such a great institution in Australian society, how could the ABC, from being so biased at the beginning of an election campaign, have the ability to make this dramatic U-turn halfway through; and why did it make the U-turn?

These are approved voluntary work involving at least 32 hours of voluntary work per fortnight and, for young people subject to Mutual Obligation, voluntary work of 12 hours a fortnight for 7 out of 13 fortnights.</para><para>A total of 17,213 customers as at 13 November 1998 are participating in Mutual Obligation, of those, 10,659 customers are participating in an activity to meet their obligation with 1,687 participating in part time voluntary work, 363 participat 
 ing in a combination of voluntary work and part time work, 944 participating in a combination of voluntary work and/or part time work and/or education and training and 19 are participating in full time voluntary work.</para><para>In addition to the above 17,213 Mutual Obligation customers, a total of 2,094 customers aged over 25 years are participating in approved voluntary work. Of these, 61 are participating in Voluntary Work and Paid Work, 369 are participating in Voluntary Work with Agreement, and 1,664 were participating in Voluntary Work with no agreement.</para><para>(1) (b) Mutual Obligation customers are aged 18 to 24 years inclusive. There is no age group breakdown available to date for the other 2,094 customers from the over 25 years age group.</para><para>(2) Procedures for entering into a period of approved voluntary work vary according to the unemployed person's age, their duration on Newstart Allowance and the length of the period of voluntary work they propose to undertake. No Activity Agreement is required to participate in approved voluntary work for unemployed people aged over 50, or unemployed people who have been in receipt of Newstart Allowance for less than 12 months and who wish to participate in voluntary work for a period of 12 weeks or less. A Newstart Activity Agreement is required for unemployed people aged under 50 who wish to participate in approved voluntary work and who have been in receipt of Newstart Allowance for more than 12 months, people who have been unemployed for between 3 and 12 months and who wish to do more than 12 weeks voluntary work and those subject to Mutual Obligation who choose to do voluntary work to satisfy their requirement. The terms of these Activity Agreements must be negotiated with Centrelink.</para><para>(3) Customers in approved voluntary work are deemed to satisfy activity test requirements and are not required to report their job search efforts to Centrelink. However they must continue to lodge their "Application for Payment" form with Centrelink. The approved voluntary work activity is recorded on this form which is lodged on a regular basis by the customer (this can be between two and twelve weekly depending on the customer's particular circumstances). If a customer ceases approved voluntary work, then they are required to notify Centrelink and meet the job search requirements of the activity test.</para><para>Young Unemployed people subject to Mutual Obligation who choose to satisfy their requirement through voluntary work, are required to record their participation in voluntary work fortnightly in a Mutual Obligation Jobseeker Diary. This diary is assessed by Centrelink every 12 weeks. These customers must maintain their normal level of job search, which will be verified through the diary and 
 through the lodgement of their "Application for Payment" form with Centrelink every 4 weeks.</para><para>(4) (a) All approved voluntary work must be undertaken with a Centrelink approved, not-for-profit, community based organisation with volunteer insurance. Under Mutual Obligation requirements, voluntary work must be undertaken with a community based not-for-profit organisation. Certain types of voluntary work would not be approved by Centrelink.</para><para>This includes work:</para><para>-	 that replaces a paid worker;</para><para>-	 undertaken in one's own home, with one's family or for one's own organisation;</para><para>-	 that involves violence towards people or property;</para><para>-	 that does not have a community focus; or</para><para>-	 primarily focused on promoting particular religious or political views.</para><para>(4) (b) Unemployed people aged over 50 may participate in approved voluntary work of an unlimited duration.</para><para>Unemployed people aged under 50 who have been in receipt of Newstart Allowance for between 3 and 12 months can participate in approved voluntary work for a period of up to 12 weeks without the need to negotiate a Newstart Activity Agreement with Centrelink.</para><para>Approval to participate in longer periods of approved voluntary work must be negotiated as part of a Newstart Activity Agreement.</para><para>Approval for unemployed people aged less than 50 will not normally be given for a period exceeding 12 months in duration. After 12 months participation in approved voluntary work, Centrelink reviews each case to determine whether it would be appropriate to approve a further period of voluntary work.</para><para>Unemployed people subject to Mutual Obligation who choose to participate in voluntary work to satisfy their requirement undertake voluntary work for 7 of the 13 fortnights of their Mutual Obligation compliance period.</para><para>(4) (c) Participants in approved voluntary work must undertake at least 32 hours per fortnight of voluntary work with a Centrelink approved organisation. There is no upper limit for participation.</para><para>Unemployed people subject to Mutual Obligation who choose to participate in voluntary work to satisfy their requirement undertake 12 hours per fortnight voluntary work for 7 of the 13 fortnights of their Mutual Obligation compliance period.</para><para>(5) Centrelink monitors customers on approved voluntary work through the lodgement of their "Application for Payment" form. Under the Social 
 Security Act customers must advise of changes to their circumstances (eg cessation of voluntary work) within 7 days.</para><para>Unemployed people subject to Mutual Obligation who choose voluntary work to satisfy their requirement will record their participation in voluntary work fortnightly in a Mutual Obligation Jobseeker Diary which is assessed by Centrelink every 12 weeks. Job search efforts will be verified through the diary and the lodgement of their "Application for Payment" form with Centrelink every 4 weeks.</para><para>(6) Centrelink does take into consideration whether a period of voluntary work is the best option for an unemployed person when deciding whether to approve a voluntary work placement. However, there is no requirement to demonstrate that a particular voluntary work placement will lead to paid employment for that placement to be approved.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Maritime Industry Finance Company Limited: Deed of Grants</title><page.no>2276</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 164)</subtitle><id.no>164</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2276</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 12 November 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Can a copy be provided of the deed of grant between the Maritime Industry Finance Company Limited (MIFCo) and the Commonwealth on 30 June 1998.</para><para>(2) What are the conditions governing the $155 million syndicate cash advance facility for MIFCo.</para><para>(3) (a) What guarantees has the Commonwealth given in relation to the $155 million syndicate cash advance facility for MIFCo; and (b) to whom have these guarantees been given.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>2276</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator Sandy Macdonald</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) A copy of the grant agreement is available from the Table Office.</para><para>(2) The following conditions govern the syndicated $155 million cash advance facility</para><para>MIFCo can only use the funds from the cash advance facility for:</para><para>(a) paying redundancy related payments;</para><para>(b) payment of interest and fees under the loan agreement;</para><para>(c) the payment of bona fide establishment and operating expenses of MIFCo, including any directors' and members' fees and expenses, reasonable fees and expenses of advisors or any person

The Workbook is published by the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO) and is available at their Website at http://www.greenhouse.gov.au. Supplemental information can also be found in the supporting information to the 1996 Inventory which introduces some updated data and methods to the inventory procedures. The 1996 Inventory also provides the working tables behind the current emissions estimates for 1990 and 1996. The answers to points 
 (1) to (3) of your question can be found in the Workbook and 1996 Inventory with references to source materials provided.</para><para>(4) Undisturbed mature forests are generally considered to be in balance between carbon sequestered and emitted. An event, such as fire or harvest which removes carbon from the system generally promotes plant regrowth and leads to net sequestration until a new equilibrium is achieved. The type of disturbance, site growth potential and a variety of other factors will determine the rate at which carbon is sequestered, while the level of carbon storage at the new equilibrium will also be a factor of site growth potential, which is unlikely to change during disturbance.</para><para>(6) Forest carbon data (storage) takes account of emissions from clearing and sequestration during regrowth, and therefore, is not considered to be a potential source of estimation error.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Banned Pesticide Importation</title><page.no>2286</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 349)</subtitle><id.no>349</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2286</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 7 December 1998:</para></talk.start><para>Was 12,000 kg of the banned chemical pesticide Aldrin imported into Australia between April 1997 and January 1998 from the Indian port of Mumbai; if so: (a) why was it imported; (b) by whom; and (c) what was it used for.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>2286</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>I have made enquiries on this matter.</para><para>Aldrin is prohibited for import into Australia under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations, specifically Schedule 9.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests of India and Greenpeace (India) were contacted by Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry officials seeking verification of this information but there has been no response to Greenpeace's claim.

I would suggest that any further enquires on this matter be directed to the Minister for Justice and Customs and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry who have portfolio responsibility for the control of imports of organochlorine pesticides.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Exportation of Crocodile Products</title><page.no>2287</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 356)</subtitle><id.no>356</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2287</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 8 December 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Is the Minister aware of recent reports regarding possible export of saltwater crocodile penises to Japan.</para><para>(2) Have any requests been received for the approval for the exportation of such crocodile products; if so, will the Government agree to such requests.</para><para>(3) Is the Minister aware of the recent reports regarding crocodile products, taken as a result of trophy hunting, being exported.</para><para>(4) Have any requests been received for approval for the exportation of such crocodile products.</para><para>(5) What is the current situation in relation to the export of crocodile parts as hunting trophies.</para><para>(6) Will the Government agree to any requests for export of crocodile hunting trophies.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>2287</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) I am aware of reports on the possible exports of crocodile penises to Asia, in particular South-East Asia.

In the interests of such certainty, RFAs set out the processes by which any compensation liability will be assessed, agreed and paid. Further, Clause 7(1) of the Regional Forest Agreement Bill 1998 would ensure that the Commonwealth is liable for any compensation it is required to pay to a State under compensation provisions contained in an RFA in force at the time the Act commences or at the time the RFA commences, whichever is later. The Bill would also ensure that any Commonwealth liability under this subsection, which may be incurred when an RFA is in force, remains even though the RFA may subsequently be terminated or expire, and that compensation payments liable to be paid by the Commonwealth to a State under Clause 7(1) may be recovered as a debt and are payable from funds appropriated by Parliament.</para><para>Any such Commonwealth compensation liability could only arise from a Commonwealth breach of an undertaking in an RFA. The Commonwealth has no intention of breaching any such undertakings.

(b) The EIS and assessment process has provided a means of exposing all aspects of the project to public review and consultation. (c) Consultations were held with local Aboriginal people during the assessment process by the proponent and State agencies.</para><para>(2) (a) Acid leaching as a mining technique is not banned in the USA. 
</para><para>Most uranium mines use the in-situ leach mining technique in conjunction with an alkali leach, because the generally high levels of carbonates make acid leachates inefficient in the groundwater associated with the mines; (b) The environment protection for the Beverley mine is of the highest standard. The geology of US uranium deposits is not suitable for acid leaching and an alkali solution is used instead. Nevertheless ISL mines are required to be carefully monitored and controlled whatever type of leachate is used.</para><para>(3) (a) Approximately 32 tonnes of uranium oxide stored in 200 litre steel drums; (b) In a secure enclosure within the processing area at Beverley; (c) Uranium produced is owned by the South Australian government.</para><para>(4) I understand that the trials at Beverley have been very successful in their stated purpose of determining optimum operating conditions including environmental matters. There have not been any significant difficulties and irregularities in relation to pressure and containment. I understand that the only international personnel involved are engaged by Heathgate Resources which is US owned.</para><para>(5) The groundwater at the Beverley mineralised zone aquifer is highly saline and contains uranium and radon with no potential use for people or stock. In contrast, several US ISL mines operate in or immediately adjacent to aquifers from which nearby communities draw drinking water supplies. If approval is given for the proposed Beverley mine final conditions will be determined as part of the EIS process. Compared to pre-mining levels, radioactivity of the water in the mine zone will not change after mining. Heathgate Resources is proposing to use a technique known as `groundwater  
 sweep', where water from a mined out area is exchanged with groundwater from the next area to be mined. This results in a reduction of acidity in the mined out area. However, there will still be an elevation in the amount of some metals in the aquifer which could take up to 20 years to return to pre-mining levels.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Industry Cost Reductions</title><page.no>2300</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2300</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 November 1998:</para></talk.start><para>A question (<inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  page 421) regarding:</para><para>.
