On 7 May 1999, at the hearing of the Senate committee inquiry into voluntary student unionism, I put certain allegations to a witness, Jason Wood. Those allegations were put to him in good faith on the basis of information received. In the past, this source of information has been impeccable and therefore I had no reason to doubt its veracity. Given Mr Wood's denials, I asked my source for further proof. It has not been forthcoming. It is appropriate for me to advise the Senate of this fact. When allegations are raised, we have a duty to pursue them.

It is very easy to claim that something is satirical; it is another matter to establish that that is the case. If the material is regarded by the classification board as much more in the category of promoting illegal activity, then one would expect that they would refuse to classify it. If it was lineball then, in the scheme of things, the last thing we would want to do is err on the side of closing down sites unnecessarily, and that applies across the board.</para></talk.start><para>This is a regime that is only designed to restrict access to material that has very little going for it. Genuine satire is obviously part and parcel of a democracy and, to the extent that we are all victims of it, I suppose, at various times, we are a bit more sensitive. If it is genuinely in the category of satire, then I do not think anyone would be objecting.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>5246</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to follow up my final line of questioning last night because I have not got clear in my mind just where the government draws the line on its censorship proposals. I understand that Senator Alston is saying that the strict censorship rules that apply to film and video will apply to the Internet, and will be applied by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. There are different rules in regard to television. For example, material that can be shown on television late at night cannot be shown during the afternoon.</para></talk.start><para>In yesterday's Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> we had the story of a government senator, Senator Synon, approaching the ABA with a complaint that a perfectly ordinary, healthy, lesbian relationship is being shown as part of a television program during the middle of the afternoon. Clearly she is wanting that withdrawn.</para><para>What I want to know from the government is this: will the ABA be in a position to interfere with Internet transmissions in the same way? Bearing in mind that the 
 government's driving principle here is to protect minors, will the ABA be acceding to a time-of-the-day structured differential in censorship? And what is the government's attitude to a lesbian relationship being portrayed on television in the mid-afternoon hours?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>5246</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I have already said twice, there are separate rules that regulate free-to-air broadcasting. There is a classification regime that is enforced by the ABA. There are time specific restrictions on material. It is not our intention that that approach be slavishly adopted for the Internet because, quite clearly, material can be downloaded and generated at any hour of the day or night. In many ways, time becomes irrelevant if the subject matter of the material is of concern. You essentially want a discussion about the rules that ought to apply to free-to-air. I do not have them before me, but I have no doubt that there are particular limitations on children's programming. I believe that the subject matter of this complaint was something that was shown during prime time children's viewing.</para></talk.start><para>I also think it is fair to say that a majority of the community would not allow to go uncontested the proposition that a lesbian relationship was normal. It might be normal within the context of a lesbian relationship but, by definition of the fact that those relationships constitute a very small proportion of total relationships, it seems to me to be misusing the word `normal' to describe a minority situation. Having said that, it is not really a debate that we need to enter into today. It is an issue that arises in the context of free-to-air and that is not the subject of this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>5246</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is the subject that we are entering into. What the minister has just said is totally unacceptable. He is wrong in believing that he speaks for the majority of Australians.

But we do have the government saying that it is in the business of censoring and restricting the community's access to a perfectly normal, natural part of the spectrum of relationships. From Senator Alston, I get a government imprimatur on the complaint made by Senator Synon. This is an unacceptable set of circumstances. I think the government needs to review the position it is taking, because it is repugnant to the majority of Australians who do accept homosexual relationships not just as an add-on but as an integral part of our society.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In this statement from Senator Alston following the complaint from Senator Synon, I hear a legacy of a repression and a discrimination which we have a right to hope is a thing of the past. We are here talking about censorship. We are trying to define where the government is at in its new push for censorship. I am hearing here that there are no defined limits. We are back in a period of censorship of decades past. The government is going back on a community that has long been left behind by the wider Australian populace. This is going to alarm many Australians who see this country as having a fresh, open and freedom seeking attitude towards all citizens.</para><para>The minister says that he is not going to bring in a time structured censorship because you can download material from the Internet. You can also tape material from the television. That has not been a means of restricting material available on the television. There are cogent arguments, in particular to do with violence, about having restrictions on what children are faced with when they are watching television. I am trying to get from the government whether or not it intends to impose just those sorts of restrictions as part of the oncoming program—because we are not seeing the end of it here today—on the Internet. I am trying to find out from the government what its real end point is in its push to put restrictions on the Internet.</para><para>Let me say that it alarms me greatly—and I am not going to be the only Australian here whom it alarms—that we are getting from the minister a clear indication that this push for censorship goes way beyond explicit sexual portrayal and violence. It is moving towards a government view of censoring the diversity of relationships and the variety of interests that Australians have.</para><para>It is incumbent on the government to say where it is headed at this stage. I recognise from what has been said by Senator Harradine that the government has the numbers on this legislation. I also recognise from Senator Harradine that he wants to take it further. I now hear from Senator Alston that he is going to take it further. If not, he can get up and say, `No, this is it; the government has no further intentions.' But when the government says, `We are really doing no more or less than we do for television,' it is flagging further censorship rules down the line. I say to the minister, through the chair: you cannot have it both ways. You cannot say on the one hand that we are simply extending the rules of censorship across to the Internet and then say, on the other hand, that at this stage we are only going halfway as far as television is concerned.</para><para>That is a another debate that needs to be entered into. I will come to gambling in a minute, but I would like to hear a very clear statement of intent from the government as to what its future proposals are after this legislation, with Senator Harradine's support, goes through.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>5247</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If I could clarify matters, I did not express my opinion, or the government's opinion, and I am sure that Senator Brown knows that.

It has got nothing to do with any of that. I simply want to point out that this regime is analogous to narrowcasting rather than free-to-air. There are rules applying to free-to-air. The issue that you have raised falls squarely within the ambit of the ABA and the rules that apply to free-to-air. We have made it clear that we are applying the definitions of `refuse classification', X and R, but meaning restricted to adults only, to the Internet.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Those definitions are tried and true. You ought to know precisely what they mean, because this seems to be a matter of great interest to you. Those definitions do not change. We are not halfway towards some other regime; we are simply applying the existing classification system to the Internet. But rather than, for example, completely prohibiting R, as you would do on free-to-air, we are allowing restricted access only, wherever possible, and that is more appropriate to narrowcast pay television.</para><para>In those circumstances, there is no argument about what we have in mind. We are not halfway towards anything. We are not wanting to go any further.

To take a sporting analogy, a lot of people kick with a left foot. But, if only 10 per cent of the population kick with a left foot, that does not make it the norm. Normal kicks are right footed.

One issue that might arise from this legislation is that you will get a whole series of complaints about programs which then puts the people who have their service on the Internet to a lot of expense. In section 27, you are almost encouraging that by taking away rights that people normally would have. Section 27 states:</para></talk.start><para>Civil proceedings do not lie against a person in respect of loss, damage or injury of any kind suffered by another person because of any of the following acts done in good faith:</para><para>(a) the making of a complaint . . . </para><para>You could have a complaint made quite negligently or recklessly and yet that is to be brought, after it has gone through the ABA, against the person against whom the complaint is made. Section 27(b) goes on to say that `the making of a statement to, or the giving of a document or information to, the ABA in connection with an investigation under this division' is not to be punished except in circumstances where it is not done in good faith. When I say `punished', I mean civil action proceedings. I do not think there is any provision for criminal proceedings to be taken against a person who makes complaints. </para><para>Under section 37 a regime is set up for action to be taken in relation to a complaint about prohibited content hosted outside Australia. This is a separate question, but it is related in terms of the expression used. In that section a person who provides material to the Internet or who puts material across the Internet does not have to do it in good faith to enable him or her to get out of the problem. He or she has to take reasonable steps to stop it.

A take down order has been issued against me. I have been deprived of a huge volume of business. It is all your fault and I am suing.'

No such approach is contemplated.</para><para>There is no sign at all that Ron Wyden has looked at the legislation.

Despite the apprehensions that are very easily raised in this area—in what has been, I think, a fairly febrile atmosphere to date—we are confident that the regime is sufficiently flexible to ensure that we do not have an outcome that, in any material sense, inhibits the growth of electronic commerce.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>5256</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is certainly a fair comment to say that the shape of your amendments have now lent themselves to considering qualifications such as technically feasible and commercially viable. They certainly were Labor's minority report recommendations. But it is also a fair comment to say that, in the original drafting of this bill, the government 
 had no such intention. It seemed, certainly to the industry and to many people who held a direct interest in the concept that you are putting forward in censoring the Net, that the government was not prepared in the first instance to take into account the technological constraints that existed, and were known to be in existence by the government, prior to the drafting of this bill.</para></talk.start><para>This goes to a very important point in relation to the online services bill in that, in the very first instance when the minister made the announcement that he intended to legislate in this area, it was done on the back of two years of ongoing negotiations with the stakeholders in the Internet service provider industry. The bill as it was presented was then referred forthwith to a specially reconstructed committee for the purposes of a very condensed inquiry. It was only at this point that evidence relating to what was considered technically feasible and what was not actually came forth. Indeed, it was the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Blocking content on the Internet: a technical perspective</inline>, which was prepared for the National Office of the Information Economy by Dr Phil McCrea from the CSIRO, that actually started to bring into the public domain the facts of the matter about technical feasibility.</para><para>So my concern is one of process on behalf of the government, Minister. I am giving you the benefit of the doubt that at least if you do not have the knowledge yourself you have people around you who can advise you of the facts as to what constitutes technical feasibility and, indeed, some of the broader industry and social impacts of what you are proposing. If that was the case, it does not excuse you for the shape of the bill as it was first presented in the parliament. The fact that you have now come back with a very comprehensive set of amendments to try to address some of the concerns brought forward through the inquiry demonstrates that, from the first port of call, this government was not prepared to put forward a constructive proposal in the first place. They have been prepared to rely on a very, I believe, flawed and overly condensed inquiry process to try to draw out the nuts and 
 bolts and flaws and to attempt to address them through an amendment process.</para><para>This is not good legislative practice and it certainly does not enhance your reputation or your credibility as managing this whole issue effectively. Now that you have come forward with a whole series of amendments which do begin to address not just concerns but matters of fact—that is, that censoring the Internet is not technically feasible, as you described in your original statement—I think we are at a point where the Australian public at least has the right to know that we are dealing with a bill and amendments that have not been prepared in accordance with what I would consider as being an acceptable process within this chamber.</para><para>The Internet is very important both in social and economic terms. I for one—and I know certainly that the Labor Party does too—believe very strongly that, when you are dealing with a medium on the brink of a converging environment, it deserves far more than barely a month for the legislative process, through both houses of parliament and a condensed inquiry. The point I referred to earlier in relation to electronic commerce highlights the inconsistencies presented by the government on this matter. Indeed, Minister, only very recently during the Senate additional supplementary estimates hearings you took the opportunity to once again remind us of your government's commitment to the development of the online environment in this country, yet the inconsistencies with respect to this bill still shine through.</para><para>I am interested in knowing exactly what level of dialogue you intend to pursue with international fora in relation to this bill, how you intend to restore Australia's reputation as a significant contributor to the growth of the online environment—less a social aspect as a result of three years of governance under the coalition—and, with respect to the electronic commerce environment, how you intend to ensure that Australia does not come out of this flawed process with a reduced reputation at the forefront of developments in the area of online activity.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>5257</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am indebted to Senator Lundy for her concern about my credibility and the government's international reputation, but the fact remains that Senator Lundy is trying to embark upon a furious historical rewrite. As I recall it, the very first press release I put out on the subject talked about `technologically feasible', and we have always used the term `reasonableness'. I think I had Phil McCrea's report as far back as June last year, so we have been very much across the technical difficulties. In fact, the whole reason that the McCrea report came into existence was that I insisted on it. I wanted to know what was possible and what was not.</para></talk.start><para>Having read that report very carefully several times, it became increasingly apparent to us that the very big trap to fall into would be to try to be technology specific—in other words, to try to identify a particular approach that would solve the problems. That was quite tempting in the very early stages when people would say, `All you need to do is have proxy filters. The bandwidth speed is such these days that you could have thousands of prohibited sites on a black list and it won't slow down the speed of the Internet,' and you were therefore expected to adopt a particular approach. We did not do that. From the outset, we have made it plain that there were balancing factors.</para><para>I think I can recall, when I first thought about this,  that we should draw on the experience of the way broadcasting licences were issued back in the 1980s when these sorts of competing factors were taken into account. In other words, before you simply decide whether a market can accommodate a new licensee, you should also look at the financial impact upon the incumbents, and it seemed to me that that was an appropriate basis for introducing similar considerations here.</para><para>So I do not think Australia's reputation is at risk at all. I do think that it might be helped if you and your colleagues were to send the right messages: that you are just as concerned to protect young children, and that you are committed to exploring ways of achieving that outcome consistent with not 
 wanting to inadvertently put the Internet out of business or anything else. But I do not ever hear much from you domestically, and I presume you do not get a run internationally on these things. Most of your comments point to what you see as technological difficulties, whereas I think we should all be trying to strike the right balance. If you can get those signals across, then I think you get a much greater degree of community support as a result. The Internet community itself has acknowledged that, and I have said it repeatedly.</para><para>The Internet Association has been conscientiously grappling with these issues now for some years. It is the pace of change that concerns us. If you simply leave it to industry, then competing forces are such that you may never make progress. We interpret coregulation as meaning that the government should define the framework, that industry should develop the codes of practice and we should all march together. I think that can be achieved, and I hope that it will have cross-party support by the end of the day because otherwise you will be sending a very unfortunate signal.</para><para>Do not pride yourselves that somehow the US is the last frontier for absolute technological freedom—it is quite the opposite. What is trying to be achieved there is to strike the right balance. Because of the first amendment, it is a lot more difficult in the US, but the Supreme Court itself has said on a number of occasions that, whilst it might strike down particular approaches, it is not in any way wanting to pour cold water on honest attempts by governments to achieve socially desirable outcomes. I simply say that we have from the outset adopted the approach that is now contained in it. There are a few amendments at the margin that have been tabled, but I can assure you that the form of the bill and the statements that we have made right from the beginning have been entirely consistent with an approach that is flexible rather than technology specific.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>5258</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to ask the minister about the economic consequences

I think it is quite clear among all in the chamber—and certainly as far as the Democrats are concerned—that we do not support and we certainly do not advocate unsuitable Internet material being made available to minors. That is a statement we have made repeatedly, not only in this place but in various Senate select committee reports into online services. We also oppose the restriction of adult access to material that would generally be acceptable to reasonable adults. We oppose the restriction of adult access to Internet content where that same information or that same content is available in different media.</para><para>I have put on record a number of times not the Democrats' unwillingness to be involved in the construction of some kind of regulatory framework or regime but an analysis from the Democrats' perspective of the two primary concerns we have with the legislation before us. Yes, one of those relates to the workability—the operational and technical feasibility—of this legislation, and we have substantiated or explained why we have concerns with that aspect of the legislation before the chamber and in our committee report.</para><para>Beyond that, we have outlined some of our civil liberties concerns in relation to this legislation. I think all the concerns that we have put forward, and the concerns of various advocacy groups, representative organisations and Internet associations, are quite legitimate. I think it is very important that the minister acknowledges that there is cross-party support for that kind of regulatory regime. It is just that we have some concerns about the legislation before us. In particular, we ask the minister to outline, for the benefit of the chamber, any studies that are being conducted by government into the economic impact of the proposed regime.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>5258</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome Senator Stott Despoja's very constructive comments. I think it is something that could serve as a role model for other members of caucus. Certainly, that this is groundbreaking legislation means, by definition, that you cannot determine what the precise economic or social impact might be. That probably applies to the great raft of legislation introduced. If everyone knew in advance what the consequences would be, it would be very hard to argue against it. The whole stuff of politics is that people will argue completely different scenarios and claim they have legitimacy on their side—that, if you do not see reason and do it my way, the sky will fall in. That happens time and again, and this is no exception. The proper way to approach it is to say that these are legitimate concerns, they have to be balanced and they ought to be given a trial. That is why you have reviews. Labor would go even further and hit it on the head in three years time, which I think is far too draconian, because these problems are not going to go away in three years.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">BISHOP</name><name role="display">Senator Mark Bishop</name></talker><para>—They'll be different in three years.

It is not why you would have a sunset clause to hit it on the head. The point remains that if you are committed to those principles, which I think endure beyond technology changes, the responsible approach is to give it a try, have your review and allow the legislation to work in the organic manner that we have set out, but not to basically throw your hands up in the air and say that it is all too hard. That is why I was trying to encourage Senator Lundy. If you are talking about messages that you want to send, the take-out you get from Senator Lundy's contribution is that there is really hardly anything good going for this legislation, there are a hell of a lot of deficiencies and, at the end of the day, you might as well throw in the towel and have another go or, better still, refer it to committees where Senator Lundy can entertain herself endlessly for hours on end.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am delighted, Senator Lundy, that you have joined the IT committee at long last. 
 You will have plenty of opportunities to explore these issues, but that is no substitute for putting legislation on the statute books and giving it a fair go. No doubt there will be people who will want to do quantitative assessments of the economic impact. If one can predict it now, you are likely to get, once again, some fairly polarised assessments, depending upon who is making them. But, at the end of the day, if we do give this legislation a fair go, we will be achieving a very desirable social outcome. I am confident that we can avoid any significant deleterious economic impacts and we may well serve as a role model for other regimes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>5259</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Isn't this ironic? If it was legislation that was affecting any other group of small businesses in this country, this government would be leaping to their defence. Talking about red tape and additional regulation: an environment of deregulation and market freedom is what should prevail, according to normal coalition rhetoric. Here we have the minister saying that we indeed need to regulate, to place restrictions on a group of very dynamic and growing small businesses. I have to say that the irony that this government presents is almost amusing. Certainly, many of the statements that Senator Alston has made, in the course of various industrial relations debates in this chamber, will lend themselves to how governments do not have a place in imposing restrictions, regulations and so forth on the businesses, particularly the small businesses, of this country. I draw it to the attention of the chamber that this is, again, one of the great inconsistencies and ironies in the government's approach to this particular matter.</para></talk.start><para>I have a question for the minister arising from that.

I would have thought some of the groups out there would not shy away from suggesting that it might cost Australia billions of dollars. But I have not seen anything to that effect. I think most people recognise that it is utterly unquantifiable and the proper thing to do is to put in place a regime that has that breathing capacity, that allows these matters to be taken into account each time complaints are assessed. If you do it that way, you have a pretty good chance of getting it right because you will be constantly reviewing the impact rather than setting out with a predetermined approach irrespective of its consequences.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>5260</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For almost the last hour and a half we have had a pretty useful discussion fleshing out a range of the issues. However, even at this early stage, the debate is starting to degenerate somewhat. Senator Alston has taken to provoking opposition senators. As everyone knows, opposition senators, whilst they are not the government, are here to help. I might move to the business of the day. On behalf of the ALP, I move:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Page 2 (after line 2), after clause 3, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">4  Review of operation of Act</inline></para><para>	 (1)	 The Minister must cause a review to be undertaken of the operation of this Act.</para><para>	 (2)	 A person who undertakes such a review must give the Minister a written report of the review.</para><para>	 (3)	 The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after its receipt by the Minister.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">[review of Act]</inline></para><para>This amendment, which was deliberately drafted quite widely, seeks to add a review function to clause 3. It provides for the minister to cause a review to be undertaken of the operation of this act, for a person undertaking such a review to give the minister a written report of the review and, finally, for the minister to cause a copy of the report to be laid before each house of the parliament 
 within 15 sitting days of that house after its receipt by the minister.</para><para>As I said, the amendment is deliberately drafted widely. It is intended to cover all of the objects of the act as identified in the explanatory memorandum: the complaints mechanism to the ABA, the classification regime that triggers action by the ABA, the powers of the ABA in respect of service providers, the efficacy of indemnities in the act, the use of sanctions and the effectiveness or otherwise of the community advisory board. </para><para>In speaking to the amendment, I wish to raise three principal points for consideration by the chamber: firstly, that this legislation is essentially `world first' legislation; secondly, the changing nature of technology, which has been addressed by a range of senators already in this debate; and, thirdly, the impact of the legislation on the Internet, particularly the impact on so-called e-commerce.	Each of these key points essentially goes to the effectiveness of the act. It is probably trite to say that there is a strong tradition of media regulation and classification controls in Australia. TV, radio, books and magazines—nearly all forms of communication—are subject to self-regulation codes. Also, Commonwealth legislation and extensive regulation in many of the states prescribe what we may and may not do.</para><para>We are all aware that the Internet is growing rapidly in Australia. There are now, according to the EM, something in the order of 3.6 million users of the Internet. I am informed that at present something like 20 per cent of Australian homes have Internet access. I understand Australia to be the second highest user of the Internet in the world, after the United States. We appear to be moving towards the situation in this country where, in the next 12 to 18 months, the Internet is going to develop what is known as critical mass. This has not happened yet, but the trend line take-up of Internet use, both domestically and in business, indicates we are going to develop critical mass of the Internet in Australia. When that critical mass is fully developed, or becomes so large that it is just a normal feature of everyday life and com 
 merce, community attitudes are going to change. They will focus and become much clearer than they are at the moment.</para><para>People say—and yesterday a range of contributors to this debate said—the Australian community does not want control, regulation or censorship of the Internet. That may well be correct. I suspect there is some truth in that argument. But we do not have any clear polling on that. We have the personal views of senators and anecdotal advice, but I am not aware of any evidence tendered to the recent committee, or any research done by government or any halfway decent polls that show the Australian community has a view one way or the other on regulation, control and censorship of the Internet.</para><para>Over the last two months we have seen the haste with which the bill was tabled. There have been 20 hours of public inquiry over a week or 10 days or whatever and a move for urgent discussion in this chamber. Although we are not able to say we are without fault in this respect, the opposition has cooperated in those inquiries. We cooperated to list the matters here. But one of the unfortunate consequences of that haste is that the only persons who are paying serious attention to this debate are those who are intimately associated and closely aligned—the aficionados, if you like. It is my observation that out there in the community most people have not yet picked up on the significance of the Internet, the significance of this bill or the significance of this debate.</para><para>Senator Alston made reference to this in passing yesterday, when he said that he had not noted letters to the paper and had not received many pieces of correspondence in his office. He drew a particular conclusion—that there was not widespread opposition to the bill. I tend to draw another conclusion—that there is not yet the necessary degree of public debate in the community on this critical issue. It is not appropriate to draw the conclusion that Senator Alston drew last evening or indeed to draw the opposite conclusion, because the debate has not yet been held. That is why the opposition is particularly critical of the haste with which this bill has come forward. There has not been a large 
 degree of significant debate on what are really critical and fundamental issues for a very important and growing medium.</para><para>That is why we were also critical in the committee process—and I made some comments about this in my speech during the second reading debate—of the reluctance and refusal, to date, of the government to allocate extra funds for parent empowerment, community education and community awareness. The issues are linked. You cannot have a community view on important and critical matters until the community is aware of what the principles at stake and the positions for and against are.</para><para>This argument about censorship of the Internet, regulation or non-regulation, has been done in a vacuum, and that is a very unfortunate development. However, I am quite convinced that will change as the Internet develops critical mass. People are going to say, `Hell, what is going on here? Why is this stuff coming into my home? Is it appropriate it is coming into my home? How am I going to pass on to my children the values that I hold as important? Why is the government permitting interference with the legitimate activities of business? Why are extra costs via regulation being imposed on commerce?' That debate has not been held, and it should be held so that our community can address what is, as the government implicitly acknowledges, an important issue and resolve that issue so we can move forward over the next four or five years.</para><para>Social attitudes, community views and cultural attitudes are increasingly shaped by technology. The government's refusal to allocate additional funds to participate in the community to date simply means the real decision is going to be delayed. The core of this bill is going to be discussed in this amendment and the next amendment—the review clause and the sunset clause.</para><para>The review in three years time, if this amendment is successful, allows the effectiveness of the act to be analysed and for that debate to occur in the community. None of us can foretell the future. It may well be that the community decides that it wants to have regulation and it wants to have control and 
 that parental values and family values are more important than the other side of the censorship debate. But we do not know until we have that issue.</para><para>The second reason I outline for seeking a review is the changing nature of technology. I just briefly want to address three issues: firstly, filtering and blocking devices, secondly, software product development and, thirdly, the delivery units and the convergence of computers and TV through the one medium in our homes.</para><para>Basically, I think it is fair to conclude that the technology is not yet sufficiently advanced. It is fair to say that there are still problems with the filtering devices and the blocking devices. They are still somewhat crude. They still have unintended consequences. They are still somewhat slow in operation. However, developments are occurring which will, over time, allow those devices to evolve into worthwhile products that consumers are going to purchase in the marketplace and use as effective software filtering and blocking devices. By itself, when those products fully come on to the market and are fully operational, it is going to raise other issues of equity, privacy and consumer concerns.</para><para>Software and filtering products are entering the market in a huge way already. They are gaining significant market share. Many adults are caught in a quandary. Adults do not want Senator Alston, the government or the opposition to tell them what they can do, what they can read, what they can write, where they can go. They do not want to be told what they can think. However, they also want children to be able to remain as children. They want children to be able to grow and to form into socially useful adults. They are both two dearly held views of adults, parents and families in our country.</para><para>In evidence to the IT committee, we had a major company advise us that they had a subscriber base of 20 million consumers. Of those 20 million around the world in 11 countries, 11 million had families. Eighty-two per cent of those families pay a fee on a monthly basis to purchase that product marketed by that company, which essentially is 
 a filtered software product. Families are voting with their feet. That major company is quickly gathering market share, and a lot of parents are choosing to purchase that software product that allows filtered access. They are saying, `We think it might be appropriate to have a form of regulation.' However, that applies only to those with the ability who have disposable income to expend on those products.</para><para>In summary on that second point, adults and the opposition do not want control. We do not believe censorship is appropriate. We want a responsible attitude in the home for parents to carry out. We note with interest in passing that those products that are coming on to the market in terms of software development are being picked up in large numbers, and people are paying a lot of money to use them.</para><para>There is a note I received today—it came out of the USA on email—which refers to a filtering amendment unanimously passed in the Senate. It reads:</para><para>An amendment aimed at requiring the use of filtering software by ISPs passed 100-0 last week to seemingly unrelated S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act . . . </para><para>The act was sponsored by Orrin Hatch, who is a Republican from Utah, by a Democrat and by another Republican senator. It goes on to say:</para><para>. . . requires all Internet service providers with more than 50,000 subscribers to offer free filtering software to their subscribers within three years, following a period of encouraged self-regulation.</para><para>So the United States Senate voted 100 to zero to require ISPs to provide filtering products.</para><para>So the debate goes on. The United States, with the most advanced set of technology in the world, has not yet resolved the issues. This bill does not resolve the issues. The review clause that we are discussing now says that in three years time we can look and see how this world's first legislation is operating, whether it is effective or not, what do parents really want, what has been the changing nature of technology and how the effect of this—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>5262</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak briefly on behalf of the Australian Democrats.

Suffice it to say, we share the opposition's concerns in relation to the process pursued by the government in constructing this bill and, indeed, to what I consider a particularly rushed Senate select committee process.</para></talk.start><para>We know that the minister announced proposals to regulate Internet content on March 19 of this year; and a month later, on April 21, a bill was introduced into the Senate. Two days after that, the government referred its own legislation—and that does not happen too often—to the relevant committee, the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies. After what we considered a rather short period of investigation by that committee, a report was tabled on budget day. Even before that report had been tabled, I note that the government had requested that this bill be exempt from the cut-off rule and, indeed, this legislation was exempt from that cut-off rule yesterday. We are debating this bill today as a consequence of the government and opposition support to exempt the bill from the cut-off rule.</para><para>This has been a process that commenced with incredible haste. I am sure that the minister will respond by saying that over a number of years people have looked at the issue of Internet regulation, that you have had various groups in the community looking at various co-regulatory and other approaches and that there have been select committee investigations into online services. But a comparison can be made of the time period that people have had to examine the legislation.</para><para>I must acknowledge that—and Senator Harradine from a perhaps different perspective will put this very clearly before the Senate, as he has done previously—a lot of the recommendations in the online services reports have not been adopted in this legislation. Much of this legislation is different from those recommendations, although I put on the record that 
 the Democrats have not always agreed with the recommendations that have come out of those Senate select committee reviews. Not only that, there has been completely inadequate time for various people in the relevant sector and the community as a whole to have some input into this process.</para><para>In relation to the government's rushing of this process, the government provided a single sentence justification for the introduction and passage of this legislation in the 1999 winter sittings—and I think this was supposed to suffice as their justification for exempting this bill from the cut-off rule—and that was to `meet growing concerns about the potential exposure to children of classified material on the Internet, particularly given the increasing access to online services in the Australian community'. At this stage I believe we are still yet to have any substantiation by government as to this overwhelming and growing community concern.

In other words, if you simply have a drop-dead sunset clause, you are pre-empting the whole nature of the legislation, because you are essentially saying, `We don't think these problems are going to be around in three years time.'

Even if it does, he or she could do it some time after that and further down the line when, of course, it would be irrelevant. If you are meaning for this review to give the parliament information to determine whether the sunset clause three years down the line should stand or should be overridden, then you should say that this review must be undertaken before the date on which the sunset clause will come into operation.

A couple of words leapt out at me when I saw this amendment. The amendment states that the following matters are to be taken into account in conducting a review under subsection (1)—and I quote:</para></talk.start><para>(a)	 the general development of Internet content filtering technologies;</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>(c)	 any other relevant matters.</para><para>I am very curious about paragraph (b), which reads:</para><para>(b)	 whether Internet content filtering technologies have developed to a point where it is practicable to use those technologies to prevent end-users from accessing R-rated information hosted outside Australia that is not subject to a restricted access system;</para><para>I wonder whether the minister, for the benefit of the chamber, would outline the rationale behind that specific part of the amendment—why he has sought to specifically refer to the 
 accessing of R-rated information hosted outside our country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>5266</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This matter arose yesterday. I think Senator Harradine said that it was a non-sequitur to have R-rated arrangements domestically but not to have anything for foreign material; and were we simply travelling down parallel paths and intending that there should always be a different approach. The answer is no. We did not think we were in a position to impose requirements on offshore material that was R-rated, because the effect may well be that you closed down the whole site, which would not be your intention, and that material, because there is a great volume of it, potentially, could be in amongst a lot of other harmless material and you could therefore have a very unhelpful impact upon the inflow of material to this country.</para></talk.start><para>In subsection (5) we have spelt out the government's policy intention. That is, if and when we get to the point where it is possible to put in place a regime that would simply allow restricted access to offshore material, we should do our best to put that into effect. That is why that review under (b) would look specifically at that issue. As you rightly point out, (c) allows the review to be as broad as you like and to cover every aspect of the legislation, but we were particularly concerned to point out that in principle there should not be any reason why you would distinguish between domestic and foreign R-rated material. It is simply that the technology is not there to deal with it offshore, whereas it is quite possible for people within our jurisdiction to deal with it domestically.</para><para>I again commend that amendment to the chamber. I will just say in passing that I thought what Senator Bishop had to say was very constructive. Clearly the intention of the opposition is to have the review take place before the expiration of a three-year period and then, if necessary, make a decision about whether or not to go ahead with the sunset clause. But again the problem is that on its face this would simply mean—if opposition amendment 2 were to be passed—that the act 
 would drop dead. It would not matter whether you were half-way through a review, already had the review or whether the review came down overwhelmingly in favour of continuation, the act would require that it cease to be in force at the end of the three-year period. I do not think that is the intention.</para><para>What we have is a sufficiently broad form of review that picks up all the points of concern that I think we have. Unless you have a hidden agenda that you basically want this killed off, come hell or high water, there is no reason why you would want to support amendment 2, because it is premature. It prejudges in effect that the regime has run out of steam or is serving no useful purpose in three years time. Otherwise, why would you automatically close it down?</para><para>Sometimes that is a bit of a tactic with regulations, for example, because it puts the pressure on a government to review a matter fundamentally and decide whether to renew those regulations. But it is a very different circumstance when you have the numbers that we have in the Senate. You may well find that, despite the fact that a review comes down quite sympathetically to the continuation of the regime, the numbers are finely balanced and one party or another says, `Well, we're sorry. We're not going to repeal that sunset clause,' and it all runs into the sand. Then you have to start all over again and, presumably, Senator Lundy would make sure you had a three-year hearing before you actually got any further legislation up for consideration, and that is not what any of us would have in mind. So it just seems to me that we would be much better served by going down the path that we have indicated.</para><para>If the review were to say that there was no useful purpose, of course you could always bring the legislation to an end. But I do not envisage that would be the case; I do not think anyone realistically thinks this problem is going to go away. It is likely to need refinements and maybe fundamental changes if there are paradigm shifts in technology which would require legislative amendment. But they are all matters for the future and all matters for a review and I do not think we should pre-empt the outcome by imposing any 
 automatic sunset clause. So could I simply say that we are all wanting to head in the same direction; it can be achieved within our amendment which would come up later in proceedings. On that basis I do not think that there should be much disagreement.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>5267</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will be supporting the government's amendment if the opposition one does not succeed, because I think a review process of any sort on this thing is very important.

It is unlikely that a review will come out and say, `This act is an absolute disgrace and must be repealed tomorrow.' Similarly, it is unlikely to come out and give it an unqualified tick. What you will probably find is that the review will come up with a number of refinements and improvements and will reflect technology changes. On the basis of all of those matters you would then make a conscientious decision about the way ahead. If I had to have a guess, I would have thought the likely outcome would be that, after you have had your review, you would probably be seeking changes to this legislation; you would not be going down the path of simply repealing this legislation and starting again. Although it is conceivable, it is unlikely.</para><para>So, if that is the likely course of events, I do not see why you would want to commit yourself to an automatic shutdown of this legislation irrespective of the outcome. By all means, have it before the three-year period, but you would not be doing anything in relation to the automatic operation of the sunset clause. I simply commend to the chamber that, if you express it in the terms as we have done, the only difference would be nine months, really.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>5267</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In contrast to the view expressed by the minister, I think it is incredibly important that we do not define the conditions of the review that would provoke the implementation of the sunset clause. Indeed, the issues surrounding this bill are quite profound. The minister uses terms like `technological paradigms' to describe the scope of the issue at hand. At this point in time, it is worth making a comment about what the issue at hand is, beyond the exploration of the technological issues which—as the minister and every other contributor in this chamber have rightly pointed out—are very much at the forefront of this debate about what is possible.</para></talk.start><para>However, in the context of Australian public debate, another perspective has been relatively unexplored as yet—the social implications of the Internet. It is a very sad 
 reflection on legislators in this country—and, indeed, in many countries—that so much of the debate surrounding the Internet is on a regulatory platform and on how to constrain it. The debate is always couched in the language of concern, threat and change. Very rarely do we, as legislators and parliamentarians, focus on the amazing and profound opportunities that exist within what is a completely new medium. It is a converged medium which brings together telecommunications, computing and media. It creates a new environment of an almost three-dimensional information source—one that we have not seen before.</para><para>At the moment, the Internet and Internet content are presented only to about 20 per cent of the Australian community. That number is growing. It is absolutely correct to assume that, as we are presented with Internet content through different outlet points—moving from personal computers to TV sets—it will be a new experience for many Australians. We will not be confronted with narrowly defined debates about censorship, content, media ownership, portal ownership and who has what advertising revenues.</para><para>If we are to be true to the people who elected us, we should ensure that this debate extends far beyond those traditional regulatory parameters and that we take the time, as parliamentarians, to find good uses for Internet content. I refer you, Minister, to some of the contributions made not just in the second reading stage of this debate but in the ongoing international dialogue on Internet content and relative access. That dialogue shows that this new medium can be used as a tool for social progression.

A speech was given at that conference by the South African Minister for Post, Telecommunications and Broadcasting. He spoke about the opportunities within the new medi 
 um of the Internet to leapfrog communities beyond the phase of empowerment through telecommunications straight into technologies that afforded a source of information to those communities. He said that the Internet allowed them to participate in the global environment in ways that they would perhaps never have dreamed of and in ways that would facilitate their social progression at a far more rapid rate than would otherwise be the case.</para></talk.start></continue><para>A point that is often missed in respect of the Internet is that it is not just about constraint and defining economic outcomes; it is about where we can use the Internet for social progression and for the social good. If you believe that information is power in the community—and I certainly believe that—surely it is incumbent upon governments to ensure that as many people as possible in the community have equity of access to that information so that they can avoid being passively manipulated by the incumbent media or by dictatorial governments.</para><para>I note that the minister scoffed at the issue of human rights which was raised in some contributions to the second reading debate. However, it is actually one of the best examples of how this new medium is used for social progression. It is about the global sharing of information. It is about trusting the ability of this forum to lift common knowledge amongst any given community to allow people to participate in debates. This is quite threatening to governments, which are concerned that change, social progression, cultural shifts and the embracing of new technologies will mean a different way of life for many people in terms of how they work, live and spend their recreational time.</para><para>For governments to truly govern on behalf of the people that vote for them, they have to open their minds to experiences beyond their own life experiences as individuals. I am concerned that the tendency of governments generally not to look beyond the experience of the Internet in their own lives is going to constrain forever the parliament of this and other countries to not seeing the true social potential that lies within this new medium.</para><para>There are examples of this challenge being tackled in Australia. There are a number of very worthy organisations who have endeavoured to put forth this notion of social implication as an agenda item for serious policy discussion. In fact, most of the serious contributors to the IT select inquiry on this bill took the time to highlight and mention this point. Certainly, from my involvement with the Australian Computer Society, the Internet Industry Association, Electronic Frontiers Australia and a range of groups that specifically have the interest of their membership, I know that they have all taken the time to devote a clause or two, or a paragraph or chapter within their submissions to the social implications of the Internet.</para><para>What we are seeing is more like a plea from Australians, who have some knowledge, proficiency and confidence with the Internet, for legislators and policy makers to stand up and take note, to map out a future direction, to not exploit the information haves and have-nots and to not play on the fears, concerns and insecurities of those for whom the Internet is not a part of their lives. To continue to exploit those differences in our community, I do not believe is good policy. I do not believe it is socially responsible and I do not believe it will enhance Australia's ability to have a smooth transition into the new century and to what the minister describes as new paradigms in dealing with information technologies.</para><para>My final point is one of cultural impact. The point was made earlier by my colleague about the impact of media and the converging media on the day-to-day lives of ordinary people in Australia. It is true to say that the Internet and the content that comes across it will have an increasing impact and significance on our lives. Indeed, how we manage our involvement in that will be absolutely critical to ensuring a fair, just and democratic society in the future. It is worth noting that the government's current agenda includes several other inquiries and bills that go to the heart of where converging media is heading in this country.</para><para>Minister, I have some questions on developments in the datacasting arena. What is the 
 relationship between some of the definitions that are mapped out in this bill and the definition of datacasting, particularly with respect to OFLC ratings? Also, how do you see the impact of content delivered across the Internet falling within the proposed digital television datacasting regime that your government has outlined?

You may have an intuitive sense of what datacasting is but those who are drafting the legislation have not yet managed to come up with an agreed definition. In those circumstances, it is hard to even know what you are talking about in a precise sense. My only point about reviewing the act is that, clearly, in an area as fast moving as this it is quite likely that legislation will be subject to further amendment down the track, maybe even ahead of a review process, but one cannot predict these sorts of things or proceed on the assumption that they will inevitably occur. All I would say is that once we have an agreed definition of datacasting, we will have a clearer sense of how it impacts on online content. But it is not included in the definition at the present time.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>5270</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I draw to the attention of the committee the fact that there is a datacasting trial set for August in, I think, four cities in Australia, including Canberra, which I was pleased to note.

But, if he is suggesting that the online database of the OFLC is essentially replaying explicit video material, I do not quite understand why it would be necessary to do that, particularly in relation to material that might offend against a classification regime. In other words, you do not have any necessary right to access material that has been proscribed simply so you can know what is proscribed. The material has been complained about, assessed and determined to be unacceptable and is therefore taken down. It would be a device if somehow you were then able to have it replayed via the OFLC database.</para></talk.start><para>What I suspect is a more legitimate concern is to ensure that a description of the material does not disappear from public view. There 
 could not be any offence taken by being able to access a site that described the material or gave details of any take-down orders or the whole circumstances in which the material had found its way onto the classified lists. So there is no intention to somehow ensure that people are unaware.</para><para>I am not quite sure why they would have such an interest in being aware of what had been banned.

It is one of these cases where the government has to be very careful, through the nature of the proscription it is putting forward, not to trammel, through censorship, access to public review and understanding and information regarding what has been classified.

I suppose it is unlikely and would be quite unusual, but you should not rule out the possibility that someone might be perverted enough to call a web site by the most offensive title.

 words in a title, so you could have a sentence or a paragraph that was utterly offensive to every decent thinking citizen and would be perhaps criminal in its formulation.</para></talk.start><para>In those circumstances, I think it would simply be condoning an illegal practice to allow that to be posted by way of a title when it would not be able to be posted in any other form.

There may be a stronger case for banning the National Party web site; I have not seen it recently. But it is not something that I would have thought would be regarded as a legitimate complaint in the first instance if you were to approach the ABA wanting to ban the National Party web site.

The Commonwealth's power vis-a-vis the states is enshrined in part 9, 
 clauses 86 and 87, of this bill. Notwithstanding the fact that the bill has been constructed to provide the Australian Broadcasting Authority with an exclusive charter to regulate censorable material on the Internet, the rest of the bill makes it clear that the government does not want to interfere with e-commerce. That being said, the bill does have the effect of rendering ineffective unlawful gambling offences legislation of some of the states of Australia. For example, legislation in New South Wales which regulates gambling, on the face of it, would be overridden in so far as these offences will no longer apply to Internet service providers or to Internet content hosts.

So, given that it is not our intention to be curtailing online gambling activities on the one hand or regulation on the other via this legislation, I would have thought that we would defer to the New South Wales government in that regard, or to any other government that sought to regulate online gambling, certainly ahead of any decision we make of our own following the Productivity Commission report.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>5273</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me read out part 9, section 87 of the government's legislation before the committee.

There is already enormous concern about the increasing diversion of money from Australian pockets into gambling and the consequent social fallout. The Internet offers the potential for gambling to be much more easily accessed by all Australians. The facilities will effectively be offered in the living room of those people who have their computer facilities there.</para><para>The government, I think, has given this matter far too low a priority. I am alarmed to hear that, although the minister's department has had negotiations with New South Wales, he does not know what the New South Wales point of view is. At least New South Wales has taken action in this direction. It appears the government is confused. It does not have a policy. It is waiting for reports but is yet to discuss whether it is going to be the arbiter of 
 online gambling services. It appears to have no difficulty in taking up that responsibility as far as censorship is concerned, but it has not yet determined whether it has a role or whether it is going to be the responsible controlling authority for online gambling services. That is not good enough. I think the minister owes the committee a better description of the state of play.</para><para>I use the opportunity in this committee, in this chamber, to say to the minister that the government should get going on this matter. The government ought to have a formulated policy. It ought to at least know whether it is to assume the same responsibility for gambling that it has already undertaken for itself with pornography. What the minister has just said leaves me very alarmed that he has given no particular attention to this important matter. Discussions with the states about online gambling, even as far as the impact of this legislation is concerned, and unintended consequences have not penetrated the minister's office. At least they have not reached the minister. He knows these discussions have taken place—he has just received that advice—but he does not know what the attitude of New South Wales is. There is a lot of work to be done in this respect. I would submit that the government should be putting this matter in a place of high priority. I think the government has got its priorities wrong.</para><para>Amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown's</inline>) agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Chapman)</name></talker><para>—The question now before the chair is that the opposition amendment, as amended, be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>5275</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I ask whether the minister will respond to my previous submission that he ought to make it clear to the committee at what stage the government is at in developing policy on the important matter of online gambling.

Widespread public alarm has been expressed about this matter. We know that there are a number of reviews under way—the minister has referred to them—but the minister does not have anything to give the committee as to the Australian government's thinking on this. In effect, it has no thinking. It has proceeded with all rapidity and urgency to bring up this legislation to impose censorship today, but with the enormous potential of online gambling to harm the social fabric in Australia and to create a large number of victims, including those who are not the actual gamblers—we know that there are illegal as well as legal intentions by people involved in the gambling industry and, from anecdotal evidence at least, we know that where online gambling occurs it is not regulated to protect gamblers even from unscrupulous activities—it alarms me that the minister has not been able to inform this house about the process of 
 dealing with it or even about the federal government's intention to take it on in the same way that it has taken on the censorship role.</para></talk.start><para>If it is left to the states, I think we are going to get a very unsatisfactory outcome.

Proposed clause 5, under the heading `Expiration of Act', reads:</para><para>This Act ceases to be in force at the end of 3 years after the day on which it commences.</para><para>The opposition gave a lot of consideration to its position because, as the minister mentioned in the earlier debate, there was some degree of similarity in the issues facing us in terms of the review clause and our approach to the sunset clause. But in the final analysis we came to the view that they were separate and distinct issues and that we would box on with both regardless.</para><para>In the Senate committee minority report, in my speech yesterday and in Senator Lundy's speech during the second reading debate we made reference to a number of core principles that we had determined would guide us and assist us in our analysis of this bill as we went through the committee process and as we go through the committee stage here in the chamber today. Three of those matters that we regarded as particularly important were: firstly, the lack of full and open community debate on this issue of censorship, control, regulation and the overall effectiveness of the bill; secondly, the economic impact, the financial impact, on ISPs and more importantly on users of the Internet whether private or commercial; and, thirdly, we had much regard to, and were impressed by, the degree of the evidence given to the committee on technol 
 ogy convergence in this country. So we have had regard to those three matters and those three principles, if you like, have guided us in confirming our view that this legislation should have a sunset clause.</para><para>Turning to the first issue—the lack of full and open debate—I am not going to unnecessarily repeat the comments that I made in the discussion on the review clause. It might be appropriate to simply adopt them for the purposes of discussion in this sunset clause debate. But I do think it appropriate to say that the opposition have signalled on a number of occasions that we are concerned that there has been a lack of adequate and ongoing consultation with those in the industry. More importantly, as a degree of debate has developed and has been covered in the mainstream press around the issue of censorship and regulation, we have been concerned that there has been almost zero, nil, impact in the community. The issue has not registered on the radar screens out there in the community and people are not paying attention to it.</para><para>People are interested in issues of censorship. They are interested in issues of regulation. They are interested in issues of control. They are increasingly reticent to give support to government intrusion into their private and domestic lives. We often hear the government attack the opposition for not being sufficiently pro-market or not being sufficiently in favour of economic forces resolving nearly all issues in our community. We are often attacked for seeking to have unnecessary or too much regulation.</para><para>In this debate we are concerned that there has not been sufficient debate in the wider community. In my own community in Perth, if people know me or recognise me from the press or TV they often will wander up and have a yarn about different topical issues of the day. But I have not been approached, unusually, by one ordinary person of the community on this issue of censorship, control and regulation. I conclude from that, somewhat contrary to the minister, that it is just not on the radar screens and it is not a topic of debate. But when I raise it, when I give formal talks or speeches or when I am asked to pass comment and I go into the 
 detail of the Internet debate, of this bill and of regulation and control, people are interested and they do respond. So it is unfortunate that we have not had that debate.</para><para>That is the first reason why the opposition says this bill needs a sunset clause. This is unlike, say, Telstra or the new tax system where there has been copious amounts of information published in the press and where there is a lot of ongoing and active discussion in pubs, hotels, restaurants and social circles about the wisdom or otherwise of the new tax system, whom it is going to impact upon, whom is going to benefit, whether there should be tax cuts and whether the new business arrangements should be part of the GST debate. All of that is being actively discussed out there in the community.</para><para>Similarly, whenever Telstra—first wave, second wave or whatever wave—comes on the agenda, people have a view on that. It is not just the aficionados who write and say, `We are opposed to the privatisation of Telstra. Keep up the good fight,' or, `You are a pack of backward people. Get out of the way and let the government privatise Telstra.' You get both lots of correspondence. On this  Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 , apart from those who are in the industry, the aficionados and those who take a deliberate interest in the consequences and the impact of the bill, there is little discussion. We are concerned about that. That is why we hope, we are willing to participate in and we think it is appropriate there should be a full and open debate in our community over the next two or three years on the issue of regulation, on the issue of control and on the issue of what is suitable to be freely available and what is not suitable to be freely available in our homes and to our children.</para><para>I repeat my earlier comments: I have been much impressed by some of the evidence given to the Senate IT committee. Eighty per cent of families with children choose to purchase filtering technology. That surprised me when it came out. I was discussing it with one of my colleagues last night and he had not been aware of that fact. I asked him what he thought and he said, `I am amazed that parents would pay $10, $20 or $30 per month 
 to access filtering technologies.' That appears to be the case.</para><para>I think there needs to be that debate in the community. It is out there. It needs to be public. Both the government and the opposition need to put their position clearly on the table. They should do so not in terms of some of the simplistic notions of pro- or anti-regulation, either for or against, or some of the juvenile comments about government intrusion in the censorship issue that are published in the press. They should address the real debates as to whether it is appropriate now and in the future to seek to regulate and control material that comes from offshore. Senator Alston says repeatedly that in the real world, government has regulated and controlled material for many years. He starts from the point that, if it is regulated in the real world, it should similarly be regulated in the online world. A lot of other people do not accept that argument. We have not had that debate. The best thing that can occur, if this bill is passed with a sunset clause of three years, is that we have that full and open debate and perhaps resolve that issue of censorship, control and regulation in a proper and open manner for some time into the future.</para><para>The second reason the opposition puts forward for seeking to have a sunset clause, for seeking that this legislation expire after three years from the date of operation, is that we have received a lot of submissions on the economic impact of the bill and the financial aspects of the bill. Government outlays are going to be in the order of $1.9 million per annum in terms of operational costs attached to establishing the framework for administration of the bill. Apart from that, the impact on government outlays is minimal.</para><para>In terms of the economic considerations, the IT committee has received a lot of submissions that identified that there could be loss of business, businesses could be relocated from Australia to offshore, parts of businesses could be relocated from Australia to offshore, and some of the professionals and the more skilled workers in this industry would choose to relocate particularly to the United States where there is huge demand for their labour 
 because of some of the harmful and—I am prepared to say this at this stage—probably unintended consequences of this bill.</para><para>This morning a number of senators tried to pin Senator Alston down and explore the financial and economic consequences of the bill, but we were unable to get any hard information. One of the problems we have had is that the Senate IT inquiry was rushed. It was so quick that the witnesses from the three bodies that gave evidence on the first night of hearings—the Australian Computer Society, the Australian Information Industry Association and Electronic Frontiers Australia—all of whom had different views on the worth or otherwise of the bill but all of whom are in many respects expert in this industry, did not have prepared submissions. They had not been able to convene their executive. They had not been able to convene their committee of management. They had not been able to study the bill. They had not been able to analyse the bill. So we had a sitting that went for three or four hours on the Tuesday night—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">PATTERSON</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—We used to have the bill on the Thursday and then have the committee hearing on the Friday.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>—We had the sitting on the Wednesday night, and all of these people came along. The bill had been tabled for 24 hours, but no draft copies had been circulated. There had been no consultation. That is the problem. In the old days, when a bill was tabled, there had been extensive consultation with the relevant industry. In this case there had been no consultation. So they came along and said to the chair, `These are our submissions. We think these are our views. A preliminary reading of the bill, a preliminary analysis of the bill, suggests it has these shortcomings and deficiencies, but we really need to go away and study it in more detail.' That occurred on the Tuesday night; that occurred on the Wednesday night. It occurred again on the Thursday night. We then broke for about eight or 10 days and came back on the Monday, and a range of those associations came forward. They had then had the opportunity to give the bill some consideration in detail.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Two of those associations changed their position. One of them, in particular, had been very public in supporting the bill, but after a period of 10 days, having liaised with its membership and consulted as to their viewpoints, they came along and advised us that their position had changed; that the first press release was inaccurate; that they withdrew their comments and that they were now opposed to the bill. All of that occurred because there had been insufficient time allowed for consultation. That is a funny way to do it.</para><para>In their evidence, they highlighted that there were economic consequences of the bill, that they might have to rearrange their business, relocate their business, establish new internal control mechanisms. They said to us, `This is going to cost. We will transfer those costs to consumers. Consumers will pay a higher price, and that is something that is unfortunate and unnecessary.'</para><para>The real problem that we had in those hearings was that those organisations did not have any empirical evidence to support their point of view. They came forward and said, `We think this is going to happen; it's going to have these untoward consequences. This is a bad thing, by definition.' But when pressed, when asked, `Where are your sums? What do your accountants say? Let's have a look at your financial analysis statements,' they said, `We don't have those, Senator, and we don't have those because we simply haven't had time to adequately analyse the bill and to give consideration within our own forums, within our own organisations.'</para><para>That is the second major reason why the opposition seeks to impose a sunset clause. We seek a sunset clause so that industry participants can give consideration to the financial and economic consequences. They might well come to us in six months time and say, `The consequences are minimal. The regulatory regime that the government has imposed, whilst it is difficult and we don't like it, is not going to have any impact upon the way we run our business, for the simple reason that the number of complaints is minimal. We thought there might be thousands and thousands of complaints coming 
 from interested members of the public'—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>5280</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support my colleague and to commend this amendment to the chamber. A sunset clause is a fairly blunt instrument in this place, and it is designed for a specific purpose—that is, to call the government to account. We are dealing with a flawed piece of legislation which Labor is seeking to amend. The sunset clause places a distinct requirement on government to address the content and merit of that piece of legislation prior to its nominated expiration date, which we have set at three years.</para></talk.start><para>The reasons for doing this are quite clear. We are amidst a time of great change with respect to information technology. I traversed an issue earlier with respect to datacasting and convergence in media technologies that is occurring currently, but for whatever reason—and I think those reasons are quite clear—this government has chosen not to time the consideration of this legislation in the context of converging media, telecommunications and telephony, but to push ahead with a classification regime affecting the point of convergence of these technologies—the Internet.</para><para>The process by which we came to this has been well traversed—the condensed inquiry, the cynicism underlying the government's motivation to push forth with their agenda. I would like to comment briefly on the history of the IT select committee, given that it has been touched on by a number of contributors to this debate. In particular, the minister made reference to earlier work of the committee. The construct of the IT select committee is such that it has been very narrow in its addressing of issues in relation to the Internet. Indeed, it has serviced the agenda, particularly, of one senator, Senator Harradine, and his concerns in relation to censorship and online pornography.</para><para>I think it is a great shame that Senate processes have been used in such a narrow way to try to perpetuate his particular agenda at the expense of far broader issues. I think it was a great shame that the government chose to re-create or re-form that IT select committee, whereas in the lead-up to the last election 
 and the reconstitution of this Commonwealth parliament, the purpose and relevance of that IT select committee was certainly recognised by most of the major parties. I think that its reconstitution in the time, way and place that it occurred indicated very clearly that the government's agenda was to service what had been pre-established as Senator Harradine's particular concerns.</para><para>Nonetheless, I do not want to dwell on Senator Harradine's motivation—I think everyone is quite clear on that. Rather, I want to turn to the government's motivation. Not only is there the well documented expedient and cynical approach to this particular bill that they have embarked upon, but also there is the particular moral conservatism expressed by many on their side of the chamber about how we deal with community standards in the area of censorship and how we give effect to it through bills and indeed legislation.</para><para>It is fair to say that many people are concerned about access by minors to unsuitable Internet material that they may be able to peruse. We are concerned about that. My online survey demonstrated that, yes, we are genuinely concerned about that but there is no sensible reason for that genuine concern to be manipulated into a debate that we now find ourselves in where we have a bill that is not constructed in such a way that it will actually effectively service those concerns.</para><para>I believe the most effective mechanism for dealing with that community concern is the one which we have followed right from the start. It is about empowering those in our community to deal with this new medium, in the same way that empowering those in our community to be dealing with a lot of the challenges that confronts them is essentially the first base of social security responsibility in respect of any government. I do not believe it is good enough to rely on a half-baked regulatory approach without fulfilling the public obligation a government has to ensure that a community is properly informed about an issue.</para><para>This one is quite complex. It traverses a number of layers. I have mentioned on a number of occasions the issue of equity of access to the Internet and the fact that, for 
 people to actually inform themselves, they need to have the opportunity to actually participate in the first instance. If we are going to talk about public policy and Internet regulation, that really needs to be the first port of call. As with most legislative debates, it is never clear cut and there are always a multitude of layers.</para><para>The second port of call is actually looking at what is achievable, to try and dispense with some of the rhetoric that only serves to confuse the issue. In this case we actually have, as the minister said, a succinct report that outlines very clearly exactly what is capable in a technological sense online.

It is beyond doubt that material which is classified as illegal in Australia should not be available to Australian users, whether 
 via the Internet or other distribution means. And most people would agree that minors should be protected, if at all possible, from accessing Content on the Internet—either accidentally or wilfully—that may harm them in some way or another.</para><para>Our study of Content blocking relates to Content which is hosted <inline font-style="italic">outside </inline> Australia, but accessed by Australians. Content that is hosted in Australia should not be handled by blocking techniques. If locally hosted material is illegal, then the hosting organisation (which can easily be identified) is required by law to remove it. If the material is offensive, then the hosting organisation can again be contacted directly.</para><para>It is technically possible to block Internet-delivered Content at two distinct levels—at the application level, and at the packet level.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Packet-level blocking</inline> , based on examining the source address on Internet packets, is technically possible and can be carried out without performance penalty using appropriately configured top-of-the-line routers, although it is believed by some that this may not be able to continue scaling. However packet-level blocking is too coarse, and if implemented will create unintended `holes' all over the emerging global digital infrastructure. This is inconsistent with Australia's desire to become an electronic commerce hub for South East Asia.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Application-level blocking, </inline> based on the use of proxy servers, is technically possible but, as indicated in Chapter 4, it can easily be circumvented in more ways than packet blocking with the result that it would be largely ineffective. Furthermore, users do not have to be particularly experienced Internet users to bypass application-level blocking.</para><para>Our conclusion is that Content blocking implemented purely by technological means will be ineffective, and neither of the above approaches should be mandated. Work-arounds will quickly be devised for any technologically-based blocking system and distributed over the Internet itself.</para><para>Having said that, we propose two different solutions to the issue of Content blocking—one which can be implemented in the short term, and another for consideration as a development in the longer term.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">ISPs could offer differentiated services</inline></para><para>A wide range of filtering software is now available (34), accompanied by an ever-increasing set of associated URLs which are updated on a regular (sometimes daily) basis.

Their filters can either pass and/or block URLs—in other words, they can work with a permitted list, or a black list.</para><para>[(34) A comprehensive analysis of commonly available filtering software is maintained at http://www.research.att.com/~lorrie/pubs/tech4kid s/.]</para><para>Where there is a market demand, we suggest that ISPs be encouraged to offer differentiated services to clients, and in particular that services for minors be created, based on access to the Internet through a proxy server.

Several such proxy-based filtering schemes are currently available, providing access to a universe of thousands of permitted pages.</para><para>.	<inline font-weight="bold">A `best effort' service:</inline>  the proxy filter blocks a set of known sites, rated according to some prescribed criteria. The result is based on a best-effort approach by an ISP, and cannot be guaranteed. Bess filtering software (35), for instance, claims to have a black list of `hundreds of thousands of pages'.</para><para>ISPs would incur some costs in setting up services such as these. These could either be passed on to clients in increased fees, or an ISP may see some competitive advantage in providing such environment to clients (36). Alternatively the Government may consider providing some incentives to ISPs to offer such differentiated services.</para><para>To be successful, it is essential that the initial access to the ISP should be to the filtered service. This could subsequently be bypassed by parents, if necessary, with the use of a password.</para><para>In addition to the above, individual users can of course acquire and install client-based filtering software as a commodity product.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">International Cooperation is needed to determine jurisdiction</inline></para><para>Locally-hosted Content, that is either illegal or considered to be offensive, is best handled by a direct approach to the ISP or the organisation that hosts the material, requesting that the ISP or hosting organisation take appropriate action.</para><para>Most Content on the Internet, however, resides on servers <inline font-style="italic">outside </inline> Australia. Because it is outside Australia's jurisdiction, authorities in Australia have no authority to request the hosting organisation to remove illegal or offensive Content.

</para><para>It is proposed that Australia participate in international fora to create the necessary infrastructure, so that organisations which host Content would be able to determine the jurisdiction of the client software making the request.

The required infrastructure will not be driven by Content blocking, but will probably be driven by other needs such as taxation, i.e. determining the location of a purchaser so that the amount of sales tax payable in the purchaser's jurisdiction can be worked out.</para><para>[(35) See http://www.n2h2.com]</para><para>[(36) AOL and local ISP <inline font-style="italic">iinet </inline> offer filtered services.]</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name></talker><para>—The conclusion really sums up so many of the issues in the debate from a technological perspective. It is about introducing a little bit of reality and about rapid changes in technology, as we have described. So far we have heard about technological developments that actually enhance filtering technologies. But it is also certainly within the bounds of what is currently being reported that the technologies to circumvent filtering are not only currently available on the Internet but indeed are also developing at a very rapid rate. So, whilst the emphasis to date on technological change has been on the improvement in accuracy, quality and sophistication of filtering devices, the equal and opposite reaction can occur with the development of technologies that can actually bypass the filtering devices.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is obviously an issue in the context of the debate. It undermines significantly the government's credibility and its claim that this will actually be a solution. I think it is worth placing on the public record that there are already technologies available that can effectively bypass filtering mechanisms and that as time proceeds—maybe in a year or two—we will see very clearly that any filtering technologies in place will be immediately bypassable. All of these issues point us in one direction only: there is a critical need for a mechanism to be in place to force the government of the day to tackle once again what will be quite an interesting and much changed environment in which to consider Internet 
 regulation. For this reason we seek the support of the chamber for Labor's amendment to insert a sunset clause into the online services bill.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>5283</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Food</title><page.no>5283</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5283</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question without notice is directed to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp.

Indigenous unemployment is at least three times that of other Australians, and the package announced today will greatly assist in finding lasting jobs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</para><para>The comprehensive package, which will be progressively implemented from 1 July, involves a new $50 million Indigenous Em

The package also includes incentive payments of $2,000 to CDEP, or Community Development Employment Project, sponsors to encourage them to place their workers into permanent jobs; support to projects that focus on employment outcomes and structured training with private and community sector employers at the regional level; and a National Indigenous Cadetship Program that will assist potentially hundreds of indigenous job seekers to gain professional positions in the public and private sectors.

Trafficking in persons is a growing global problem. Officials that I met overseas recently confirmed that people trafficking is increasingly being run by organised criminal networks. That is certainly the view that was expressed in Thailand, in Vietnam, in Beijing, in Quang Zhou and in Hong Kong. These problems that we experience are not only being experienced by us. It is a global problem. They are having difficulties in the United Kingdom, in the United States and in Canada. The proceeds of people trafficking have been estimated at some $7 billion per annum. It is estimated that four million people are simply trafficked around the globe on an annual basis. People trafficking is lucrative and, compared to other criminal activity, relatively low risk in terms of penalties.</para></talk.start><para>No-one denies that the recent arrivals by boat are a serious problem, but it does need 
 to be kept in context. Ten times the number of illegal immigrants attempted to enter Australia via scheduled airline flights than by unauthorised boats in 1997-98. In contrast to that, overstays on legitimate visas are also a problem, and there are estimated to be some 51,000 overstayers in December 1997. There were 348 people who arrived by boat between 1 July 1998 and 30 April of this year. That is already double the number who arrived in the previous year. So we do need to understand what is driving the increase in attempts at coming into Australia.</para><para>Intra-Asian illegal immigration is much less attractive now. The impact of the Asian financial crisis, repatriation of immigrants from Malaysia and Korea, increased political instability in the region and, of course, decreased economic opportunity all make intra-Asian immigration less attractive. Changing economic markets in China mean that displaced rural workers are seeking opportunities for themselves and their families elsewhere.</para><para>We are a very attractive destination—geographically, socially and economically. Our appeal as a tourist destination makes Australia even more appealing, as does, of course, the presence of networks of friends and families that are already here. The Olympics has increased the perception that Australia is a land of great opportunity. While these factors operate, organised crime will look to the vulnerable to make profit.</para><para>The scale of individual desperation that people feel cannot be overestimated. Reports of the recent Somali trafficking racket show that people were prepared to pay fares around four times their annual average earnings to come to Australia. In 1997-98 some 1,555 people were turned around at airports. More than 75 per cent of these are believed to have had their travel arrangements facilitated by criminal traffickers.</para><para>The increasing size and sophistication of the vessels attempting to land indicate the involvement of organised crime. We are not talking about people washing ashore in wooden boats, hoping to find a land of opportunity. There is quite a bit that the government is doing about this. We, of course, have the task force set up by the Prime Minister 
 taking a holistic approach to the coastal surveillance question to ensure that our arrangements are adequate to meet this changing demand.

I would like the minister to outline how her government intends to respond to the resolutions of the New South Wales drug summit, particularly in light of the Premier's willingness to entertain reforms. I am also wondering what the minister's response is to comments at the drugs summit by the Police Commissioner of New South Wales when he referred to the quantity of drugs which had been seized in New South Wales and his claim that, despite the seizures, there had been no effect whatsoever on the purity or 
 street value of heroin. Could the minister respond to his comments?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>5288</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Stott Despoja for her question. I will deal with the second part of her question first. She asked me to respond to remarks made by Commissioner Ryan with respect to his allegation of the lack of effect on the price and purity of heroin as a consequence of seizures. I have already responded to that, Senator, in other places. You have no doubt seen that, but if you have not I will send you copies.</para></talk.start><para>The bottom line of the response is this: there are a number of factors that must be taken into account in considering whether a price will go up or down. Supply is, of course, one of them. The obvious point the commissioner misses is that if more heroin is coming in over the shores—that is, if we do not stop it; we let it simply flow in—there will be an oversupply, and you might expect therefore a reduction in price. So for him to say, `Oh, well, the price hasn't gone up' is only one part of the story.</para><para>The other response I made was to invite him to focus his attention on his force's appalling record of arresting heroin dealers. I am separating them out from users and referring quite specifically to dealers. With a population 1½ times that of Victoria, I do not think it is good enough to have an arrest rate for dealers that is only just over one-third of that achieved by Victoria. I would hope there would be agreement on that in this chamber.</para><para>As to a broad response to propositions that may involve the Commonwealth, I am not going to give that off the cuff now, but I can tell you that there are a number of factors that would of course be considered. The laws at the moment regarding street use and supply of drugs are largely a state matter. The Commonwealth attempts in its law enforcement to deal with the larger end of town—that is, with the importers and traffickers who are bringing drugs in from overseas. You will know that COAG met only a few weeks ago—that is, on 9 April—did not support injecting rooms and indicated that priority should be given to other measures such as improving treatment options available to those 
 people who have fallen prey to the problem of drugs. That of course fits in with the strategy that we are running, which, as you well know, is a three-part strategy covering law enforcement, education and health and harm minimisation measures.</para><para>We do need to have national cooperation on this problem. It will not help if we approach this in a piecemeal way. It is inefficient for state and federal law enforcement agencies to cover the same area of responsibility and it makes the task harder if we do not have a joint national approach. So I would hope, Senator, that the New South Wales government would not choose to act unilaterally and allow injecting rooms without reference to other jurisdictions. In the end this is a national problem and it should be addressed nationally. We have a very strong interest in this area, and serious consideration needs to be given to a number of matters at the Commonwealth level. The first is international obligations, which the senator has been very keen to support in the past. The type of injecting rooms established recently in Sydney is unlikely to allow us to comply with the medical and scientific obligations in international drug conventions. The Commonwealth does have a constitutional power to enact legislation to ensure those obligations are complied with. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5288</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

As I mentioned, his report today in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  did not acknowledge the growth in TAFE places or the fact that in 1992 there were some 240,000 people in TAFE compared to 261,000 in 1997. What Senator Carr has failed to acknowledge is the increase in the participation of young people in training today under the Howard federal government. Senator Carr has failed to acknowledge the inadequacies of the policies of 
 the former Labor government in addressing training and young people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>He has failed to acknowledge the quality of training in Australia, and in that regard he does a disservice to Australia. At the UNESCO conference in Melbourne last year which dealt with lifelong learning it was acknowledged that Australia was one of the foremost leaders in the world today in vocational education and training, and that was under the present federal government.</para><para>What Senator Carr also fails to recognise are the industry training packages which have been developed in consultation with TAFEs. In fact, there are a multitude of partnerships today with TAFE and the private sector—very successful partnerships—which have come about as a result of training reforms under this government's policies. He also fails to recognise the Australian recognition training framework, which means that you can train in Darwin and get a job in Hobart. That is great news for young people, particularly those who travel. It is no secret that young Australians like to travel around their great country, and they can use those skills they have learnt in one end of the country at the other end of the country.</para><para>Madam President, this is just part of the reforms that this government is embarking on.

He said that very recently on Radio 4BC. Yet these commitments have been broken time and again by the Prime Minister. Of course, we have seen a recent situation where quite clearly the stance of the Australian Democrats on the GST is softening. It was said originally by the Australian Democrats that exempting basic food was non-negotiable. On the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline>  program we had Senator Lees, however, say, `There is a whole lot of things that are on the table.' When it comes to diesel, Senator Lees was quoted this morning as stating, `We have to work within their parameters.' That means the government's parameters.</para><para>It is no wonder that in Australian politics there is such concern, such cynicism about politicians and the political process when you 
 get this sort of inconsistency from leading Australian politicians. But I am concerned about the issue of the Democrats' approach on the GST. I said yesterday that this was a matter that I believe Senator Lees should take back to the Democrat rank and file, but Senator Lees made it absolutely clear that the Democrat party members will not have a say in the negotiations with the government on the GST. Let me quote what Senator Lees said yesterday in answer to a journalist's question:</para><para>If the deal is struck, will it have to be referred to Democrat members?</para><para>Senator Lees: No, it won't, because we are within policy.</para><para>I ask the question: is it within policy? Democrat taxation policy was balloted to members in June 1998 and the ballot was reported in their journal in December last year—and I refer senators to that document, which is in the Parliamentary Library. Under item 6, members agreed to option C:</para><para>The mix of taxation between direct income and indirect expenditure sources should be restructured to increase the proportion of direct tax, increasing income tax and/or wealth taxes relative to indirect tax.</para><para>That is, Democrat policy demands no tax mix switch from direct to indirect taxation. The government's GST package involves a $19 billion tax mix switch from direct to indirect taxation—a net $6 billion increase in indirect tax plus a $13 billion decrease in direct tax. Unless the Democrats are able to negotiate this away, they will be supporting a measure in direct breach of their balloted policy.</para><para>Senator Lees is wrong. The government's GST package is so far outside the Democrats' policy that surely a new ballot must be held. Maybe some of the Democrat senators do understand what the Democrats' taxation policy says and maybe that is why there are so many concerns in the Australian Democrats' party room itself. There is a way forward for the Democrats, there is an option that meets their policy objectives, an option that gets us genuine tax reform, and that is Labor's alternative, which was announced by the shadow Treasurer at the Press Club last week and conveyed to the Australian Democrats earlier this week. In accordance with the 
 principles that Senator Lees has spoken about so often, as have other Democrats in this chamber, this is a matter that ought to go back to the members of the Australian Democrats for their endorsement or otherwise. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>5297</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not think it is any secret that the optimum position of the government is that there be a GST on food.

I am sure that the integrity of the government's tax package will be kept intact whatever the result.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Lees also gave some advice to the Labor Party: if they want to be in the tax debate then they should put down a tax policy. Otherwise they are out of the main game. Senator Sherry announced to the Senate a couple of weeks ago that Labor do not have a tax policy—a rare honesty from the other side, from a man fighting for his preselection. What is more, they are not going to rush into a policy. We do not expect to see the emergence of any sort of policy until their Hobart conference, which is some 16 months away. At the very least we are 16 months away from a Labor Party tax policy. What a farce. We get all this criticism and negativity without an alternative policy. And this is coming from a party that went into the election in 1993 promising income tax cuts. After the election, on their victory, which was very much on the basis of the income tax cuts, they pulled that promise from under the taxpayers. They replaced the income tax cuts with an increase in the wholesale sales tax and an excise tax to the tune of some 8.7 per cent GST. That was the equivalent of Labor's tax rise—an 8.7 per cent GST.</para><para>However, we do see the first emerging signs of a Labor Party tax policy coming out of the Evatt Foundation, the Labor Party think tank, led by no less than Bernie Fraser, the

On behalf of the Labor Party, I offer an apology to the listeners on the parliamentary network. We have had many letters and several phone calls pleading with us never to have a dedicated Senator Rod Kemp day again. We have let the listeners down because, once again, we have had one today. Listeners give a variety of reasons saying, `If I have to listen to another hour of Senator Kemp at question time I will go mad.' That is the more moderate one. Even a cab driver in budget week said to me, `Senator Kemp is a road hazard because every time he comes on air at question time I almost drive off the road.' We have let the listeners down badly. I apologise to them.</para></talk.start><para>We are just a soft-hearted mob really, because we do not mind sitting here for an hour listening to evasion, listening to waffle and especially tolerating the simplistic mantras that Senator Kemp has managed to shove into his head. No matter what the question asked, out come the tumbling phrases: `We are in favour of tax reform,' as though that is in fact an authoritative intellectual argument. Of course it is not. Every time Senator Kemp is asked a specific question we get a non-answer.</para><para>The fact is we felt a bit sorry for him today. We wanted to give him a place back in the sun. He has been ignored by the Prime Minister. How could a Prime Minister have negotiations as crucial as these with Peter Costello, Senator Lees and Senator Murray and leave the key Senate man out? How could they do it? What a heartless act. He is supposed to do all the hard yards in here. He has carriage of 27 bills, but when it comes to refining them, when it comes to reaching an 
 agreement, poor old Senator Kemp is left out in the cold—he is ignored. We will probably hear the details well before he does. I really cannot understand why the Prime Minister so dislikes Senator Rod Kemp. We know he did not promote him in March 1996. He got left out, even though he was the shadow minister for environment. It cannot be a family thing. The Prime Minister was happy to promote the brother and demote Senator Vanstone to an insignificant position. He was quite happy to do that, so we know it is not a family dislike. But why would the Prime Minister delete Senator Kemp from these particular negotiations? I find it extremely difficult to understand.</para><para>But some serious questions were put to Senator Kemp today. He was asked about the legal basis of the lock-in mechanism. We got no response from him at all. He said that he would not release the information. But at least he should mount an argument and say what the nub of the question is and what the answer is so the Senate can be reassured. He was asked about the New Zealand example. Mind you, the word `New Zealand' has not gone past Senator Kemp's lips for the last three years because of the rate of economic growth there. For five or six years in the 1990s all we heard about from the coalition was how great New Zealand was.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>—That's what's wrong with Collingwood.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—The Clarence supporter who got dudded by Burnie on the weekend wants to interject.

We have made them endure cruel and unusual punishment—a factor that is factored into the US Constitution, not ours. Lucky for us. The fact is that, while the Berlin-Moscow pact is being negotiated in some secret room in this thing, poor old Senator Kemp is excluded.

When we came to government in 1996 we did not go straight into tax reform. Why? Because the other side had left a mess of the economy and of the government's finances. So the first thing we had to do was live within our budget. We had to do something about tackling the debt left behind by the Australian Labor Party—$80 billion of debt built up over the last four years of the Labor government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have done that. We have set in train real government reform for setting the economy and the government's finances, and the economy has responded magnificently. Interest rates are the lowest for over 30 years, and inflation is the lowest for over 30 years. The government has had recognition of this by OECD reports. There has been recognition all around the world for its economic performance, and just in the last few days the credit rating has gone up from AA to AA plus. Are we stopping there? No. The Prime Minister announced almost two years ago that we were going on with tax reform. Why? Because it is needed for Australia, needed for all Australians, particularly for younger people—our children and our grandchildren. The Labor 
 Party know this, but they have opted no to play short-term politics.</para><para>Contrast that with the way the coalition treated the Labor Party when they were in power for 13 years. What were the major reforms—and they were major reforms—that they brought in for the Australian economy? Freeing up the Australian dollar, freeing up the finance markets, lowering tariffs and bringing in national competition policy were the four major planks they brought forward, but did they put any of them before the electorate at an election? No, not any of them. Not at all. How did they get them through the parliament? Largely because all four planks were supported by the coalition. Why? Because everyone knew, including the coalition, that they were good for Australia, good for the growth of Australia, good for the long term for all Australians.</para><para>Now that we are in power, what happens? They have taken the decision to play short-term politics and to hell with what is right for the long term for all Australians. That is what they have decided to do, that is what they are in the process of doing, and that is what we have seen here today. The government is committed to tax reform and we will push on. We have no choice but to try to negotiate with the Democrats. But if the Labor Party came to their senses and took a long-term view of what is right for Australia and for all Australians, they would be supporting the government's tax package and they would be seeing it through this chamber without change, including without excluding food, which is one of the issues they brought before us today. But they have not got the guts to actually do that. They want to play short-term politics. Let me remind them of a quote from their previous leader, Mr Keating, back in June 1985:</para><para>For too long the politically unpalatable decisions have been put off in this country because our politicians have not had the strength of purpose to tackle the hard issues.</para><para>When it has come to the crunch, short-term political interests have always come first.</para><para>I repeat:</para><para>. . . short-term political interests have always come first.  
</para><para>That was Mr Keating in June 1985 and it applies today. Here we have had a great example for all Australians listening to the Senate today. They have heard the Labor Party in action playing short-term politics against the long-term interests of Australia. This tax package is good for all Australians. This tax package is a requirement and it will see us through the next recession. We need to go on with reform. We must keep going with reform. Australia is too small to do otherwise. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>5300</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Deputy President, I am sure you would have noticed that today we did not hear any answers from the questions put to Senator Kemp. We were unable to gain from this session of question time any answers from the government to the questions that were put. I understand that Senator Kemp was particularly disadvantaged because the game plan has changed so dramatically. He has, unfortunately, not been placed in a position where he has been able to take up the trainer's brief because he is not able to actually join in the game at the centre circle. What has occurred is very much contrary to the way in which the Liberal Party has treated the Democrats in recent times.</para></talk.start><para>The new game in town—commonly known as the `Meg and Andrew Show'—centres upon what they might call the great political seduction of the Democrats. I saw this new show when it opened just last Thursday in Melbourne. Being a keen student of the geography of Melbourne, I noticed that the talks that occurred between the Democrats and the Liberals occurred at No. 4 Treasury Place. No. 4 Treasury Place, as we all know, is known locally not as Treasury Place but as `Treachery Place'. This is a lesson I think the Democrats ought to understand only too well.</para><para>Locals will also know that this fine building at No. 4 Treasury Place is centred in the Treasury Gardens. I am sure if Senator Lees had walked across the road she would have come across the Fitzroy Gardens, which are only a few hundred metres from where she was meeting. She would have noticed that the Fitzroy Gardens are the famous site of the Fairy Tree in Melbourne. On many occasions, 
 I have taken my children down to the Fairy Tree. I bump into the odd Democrat on occasions, and I am sure Senator Lees would have been only too happy to join with others at the Fairy Tree.</para><para>Senator Lees would also have noticed Captain Cook's Cottage in the Fitzroy Gardens. Captain Cook's Cottage is one of the great landmarks of Melbourne. From afar, it looks like a stately building but, up close, you soon discover that it is very much a rustic, country, outdated dwelling. From afar, it looks much bigger than it is in reality. When you get inside, you notice that tall people soon bump their heads because that was the way in which, I am afraid, Captain Cook's Cottage was built. It reminds me very much of this argument about the GST. For the Democrats, from afar Captain Cook's Cottage would look attractive, but up close you soon discover what a sordid and small instrument it is. We all understand that great seductions occur all too often in politics, because we know the old adage that power is the greatest of all aphrodisiacs.</para><para>When we talk of these power relationships, I am reminded of the old psychologist description of the Stockholm syndrome. The Stockholm syndrome arose from the debate that occurred around the time Ms Patty Hearst, the daughter of the great United States media magnate William Randolph Hearst, was taken hostage. Patty Hearst was taken captive by the Symbionese Liberation Army. She became so enamoured of this organisation, so fully in love with this organisation, that she went around America robbing banks on their behalf. I am reminded yet again of the Democrats and their relationship with the great and powerful government of Australia.</para><para>Like so many rich boys and so many rich girls, Patty Hearst was of the mistaken view that she knew what was best for the poor of the globe, that she understood what was good for people who were somewhat less well-off than herself. In reality, her little episode to rob banks on behalf of the Symbionese Liberation Army was a wild, bizarre fantasy which bore little resemblance to what the real needs of ordinary people were. If we look at the other element of this tragic circumstance, 
 we see that `Mr Charm', Mr Costello, is involved. He is sitting alongside `Mr Boring', the Prime Minister.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Please do not reflect upon individual members.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—They come together and the Democrats have the opportunity to spend many long hours with them.

 be reinvented, as it were. If that economy and new tax policy works, as so many economists throughout the world tell us it will, this coalition government will be in power for many, many years. That is why the Labor Party is not just being negative with respect to the economy; that is why the Labor Party wants to destroy what is good for Australia. The coalition team of the Liberal Party and the National Party have so managed the economy that it is the best in the world. It is the wonder economy that is going to enter into the Third Millennium.

Just the other day we received the first report card on the government's health insurance rebate scheme. That report card came in the form of the statistics for the March quarter, indicating what effect the rebate had had on membership. By any measure, the result did not live up to the expectations of the government, nor justify the massive amount of government funds spent on this policy.</para></talk.start><para>It is interesting that a few weeks ago Russell Schneider, the executive director of 
 the health insurance industry association, made this prediction about the impact of the rebate:</para><para>The March quarter result is going to completely validate the government's decision to introduce the rebate. The jump is certainly going to be more than 100,000, and that is just based on the preliminary sampling.</para><para>Russell Schneider was out there talking up the success of the scheme. It just so happened, for the interest of those journalists who ran the story, that it coincided with the lodgement of the industry's application for what I understand to be a six per cent increase in premiums. I am not sure whether those two events are connected, but it was interesting that while Mr Schneider was out there talking up the prospective success of the scheme, the funds were in there for their chop, for another six per cent increase in premiums, which I understand the minister will approve effective from next month.</para><para>The minister's view at this time was to say that we would have to wait until the official figures came out next month before making any comment. He was very keen that we not have this debate until those first quarter figures were released.</para><para>Those figures have been released. We now have a proper analytical assessment of the success or otherwise of the government's private health insurance rebate scheme. The figures show that only 57,000 extra people were covered by private health insurance in that three-month period. To put that in perspective, the number of people covered by private health insurance has risen from 5.68 million to 5.73 million—a 0.2 per cent increase. To meet the government's modest membership target of 33 per cent participation, set by the Prime Minister, a further 510,000 people would have to have joined. The rebate has barely reached 10 per cent of the government's own modest target set for the scheme in the first three months.</para><para>We have proof positive that the scheme is failing to achieve its objectives. I know the government will say we have got to wait longer, but their message up until now has been: `Let's have a look at the March figures.' Industry funds were out there saying, 
 `One hundred thousand plus. It's a great success.' But when the hard data came out we found there were 57,000 new members. That is to be welcomed—no-one is saying that we do not welcome that participation in private health insurance. But we have to make an assessment about whether this is good public policy, about whether the investment of $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money in order to gain that result is a good use of that taxpayers' money. We have got to assess whether we have a strategic policy, well thought out and well implemented by this government, or whether we have a series of ad hoc measures, throwing money at a problem in the hope that something will work.</para><para>It is quite clear, I think, from these figures that the government is vainly throwing money at the problem. It is also worth noting that the March quarter is likely to be the best quarter for membership increases, given that the government spent $7.5 million of our money advertising the rebate in the lead-up to its introduction, and that people were more likely to respond in that initial advertising stage and while it was receiving a lot of free publicity through debate within the community. But we have had a very disappointing result.</para><para>The government have since been trying to talk down the result; trying to put a different spin on things, trying to steer us away from examining those hard numbers. But the Prime Minister said when pushed that a 33 per cent participation rate would be the result of this measure—that is, 550,000 new members would be achieved. What we have got is 57,000. We have a very minor improvement in membership as a result of one of the largest financial incentives ever given to private industry in this country. As I say, the minister is now trying to change his tune by saying, `Oh, well, we'll need to wait a bit more time. We'll have to wait maybe 12 months until we can see the full picture.' In a sense that is right, I suppose—we will get a fuller picture. But the early indications really do give a fair indication of what will be achieved by this measure.</para><para>The government know the rebate has failed. They are out there making even more new policy announcements about private health, 
 trying to distract attention from a proper assessment of this particular measure. The minister has announced the introduction of no-gap policies and lifetime health cover, and the government is now indicating that the rebate was only ever intended to halt the fall in health fund membership.</para><para>So we have gone from the private hospitals talking up 45 per cent participation rates, Mr Schneider talking about over 100,000 new members in the first quarter and the government talking about increasing private health insurance by a minimum of 33 per cent, to now being led to believe that all they were really trying to do was halt the fall in membership, halt the decline. They were not actually trying to improve the percentage; they were spending that $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money just to halt the decline. I do not think the Australian public are that gullible. They know what claims were made for the scheme. They know what the government said it would deliver. They will make an assessment about whether it is good public policy on what it does deliver. It is clear from the first quarter figures that the rebate is not delivering the sort of outcome required to justify the massive expense of public funds pumped in to prop up private health insurance in this country.</para><para>The minister now describes the rebate as a `stopgap measure'—$1.7 billion as a stopgap measure. That is not $1.7 billion once; it is $1.7 billion every year to prop up private health insurance. Every year we are going to spend $1.7 billion that could otherwise have been spent on the health budget, that would almost have eliminated waiting lists in public hospitals in this country, on propping up private health insurance. What have we got to show for it? Fifty-seven thousand more people have joined private health insurance. Often they do not take out full cover when trying to escape the tax impost. A lot of them have taken out cheap and nasty cover, and they will still access the public hospitals. But we do have 57,000 more people with private health insurance.</para><para>As I say, we in the opposition accept the need to try to encourage some participation in private health insurance. But we have said all 
 along that the government have not had a strategy for this. They have not got a well thought out, coordinated approach to encourage private health insurance membership. They have got a series of ad hoc measures of throwing money at the problem, hoping that something will work. This measure is badly targeted and is clearly not working.</para><para>The government have got form on this issue. They should have learnt from their last failure. Who could forget that their last insurance incentive scheme, the PHIIS, was also a complete failure. They introduced the previous scheme at a cost of $450 million a year, predicting that it would increase membership from the then 32 per cent participation to 35 per cent participation. It was an understatement when the department admitted that they had got it wrong when assessing the effectiveness of the previous scheme. The reality is that membership continued to fall from 32 per cent to 30 per cent. They spent $450 million a year and membership continued to fall by about 330,000.</para><para>At the Senate inquiry into this rebate the department could not offer any reassurance that they would be any more accurate in predicting the impact of this rebate. They just do not know. They spent $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money on the basis of no research, no modelling, no analysis. They just hoped that, where $450 million had not worked, $1.7 billion might: `You keep throwing money at it and something might work eventually.' That is not a policy, that is not a strategy; it is a desperate attempt to prop up one's own ideological convictions.</para><para>On both sides of this debate we argue that the other side is ideologically driven, but let us look at the facts. Let us take that sort of heat out of it and look at exactly what is happening. We are going to spend $1.7 billion and we have 57,000 new members. The government, when forced to name a target, went for an increased membership of 550,000. That is a very modest target. I would have argued that $1.7 billion for only 550,000 new members is not a satisfactory result, that it is not a good policy outcome, that we are not getting a bang for our buck. To get 57,000 
 members for $1.7 billion is a joke. It clearly is not working.</para><para>The government need to have a proper strategy, a proper thought-out policy, and not just keep throwing money at the problem, announcing new initiatives by the day and pretending that they have a strategy. How many more announcements are we going to have that they are going to solve this? How many more times can the minister make an announcement about how he has another idea or proposes another bill to come before the Senate? There is evidence of the failure of the previous scheme. There is now evidence that this scheme is not going to meet even the most modest targets set for it by the government.</para><para>The private hospital industry claimed that the rebate would increase membership by 45 per cent. I do not think anybody seriously maintains that claim any longer. The Prime Minister went for a very cautious estimate, as he described it, of 33 per cent. The reality is that both these estimates and predictions were plucked from thin air. When the department has been asked about any detailed work being done to evaluate the likely impact of the rebate, the answer has been there is none. They do not know. The government have not got a plan or any modelling. They do not know. They are going to casually throw $1.7 billion at the problem and hope that something happens to somehow fix the problem.</para><para>There is a range of reasons why it is not working. One of them will rear its ugly head again in June: the health funds will be increasing their premiums. That will again eat into the rebate discouraging new members while encouraging existing members to leave. So any net increase in the subsequent quarter is likely to be small. The whole idea of the rebate was to make it more attractive for people struggling to pay the premiums. If you are going to pay a rebate and then take it back by increasing the cost of the premium, clearly you are not going to get the result you were seeking to achieve. We are seeing again the same cycle of increasing premiums driving out members, which leads to further premium increases because the rebate does 
 not address the fundamental problems with private health insurance.</para><para>We also have to remember that every new initiative the government announces—no-gap policies, lifetime cover, et cetera—will lead to higher premiums and therefore increase the cost of the rebate. They built in this flaw where we pay 30 per cent of whatever the funds charge. So for every new idea that comes on stream and every new cost built into the system we are going to pick up 30 per cent of it. It is like a blank cheque, with no results required from the industry. The government just shrug their shoulders and say, `Oh well, we've only got 57,000 new members. We were a bit more hopeful of a better result, but it's too bad.

It is a tactic that they often use in debate of this issue. They throw the dice and hope it comes up right, they put in a motion statistics that do not necessarily relate to one square or the other and they play around with those statistics. If we look carefully at the motion that has been put forward today by Senator Evans, it reads:</para></talk.start><para>The March figures for private health insurance membership which reflect the failure of the 30 per cent rebate to achieve the modest target set by the Government or justify the $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money spent on the rebate.</para><para>Senator Evans has failed to properly divorce those two issues very clearly. Private health insurance membership is something that this government need have no apology whatsoever in seeking to achieve. I will demonstrate in the course of my comments Labor's track record of what happened in that particular area. Certainly the 30 per cent rebate is there as an enticement to enable people to achieve a very proper identification and get back into it.</para><para>With regard to justifying taxpayers' money, the Labor Party are nothing more than a bunch of hypocrites on this particular issue. If we look very carefully at the waste of taxpayers' money, we only need remember 
 the period from 1984 to 1996, the 13 years of Labor administration.</para><para>I find it somewhat ironic that Senator Evans today did not bother to go back and check the economics of Labor's period in office. Instead, in Labor's usual manner, he attempted to put negative comments on the record to try to disparage anybody else who is seeking to do something good—in this case the government—as opposed to talking about the fact that they slipped off the slippery slide and went way out of the picture. The economics that we had to endure for 13 years under Labor were really serious in the areas of total health care. The legacy that was left to us by Labor means that we have had to look very carefully at this whole area.</para><para>Let me concentrate for a moment on high interest rates and how they impacted on each and every Australian's capacity to pay for health services, community services, any other services of government, or day-to-day living. The fact that the Labor Party raped the economy and pilfered can only be described as something that undermined the security of each and every Australian family. At the end of 13 years of Labor government, we need to ask the question: what did their economic management do to health care? I find the motion that has been put forward today nothing other than someone trying to salve someone else's conscience and looking for excuses for why the Labor Party is now—as Senator Evans quite rightly acknowledges—philosophically opposed to the government.</para><para>But there is a matter, if we look at Labor's health record, that is very important in this debate, and it goes to the fundamental issue of balanced health care and ensuring that every Australian family has access to quality health care at an affordable, cost-effective price. When we came to government in 1996, Australia's private health care industry—and, in turn, the entire health care system—was facing a very stark future. After 13 years of Labor government, private health insurance membership had spiralled down from the 50 per cent that Labor started with in 1984 to the 33 per cent that they handed over to the coalition government in 1996—a 17 per cent reduction in 13 years.</para><para>Senator Crowley smirks and smiles across the chamber—she was one of the ministers responsible for that particular program. In real terms, in 13 years Labor managed to drain private health insurance membership, at a rate of about 1.5 per cent per year, by over 16 per cent. These are not good figures; in fact, they demonstrate that Labor did nothing when in government to address the growing imbalance between public and private health care.</para><para>As we all know, Medicare was created back in 1984 on the basis that the Australian government would continue to maintain and, indeed, encourage a robust health care industry. You only need look at statements by then Minister Blewett and subsequent comments by former Minister Richardson to see the commitments that were given that were not honoured. Far from encouraging—or even accommodating—this essential sector, the Labor Party actively worked over the years to discourage private health care and therefore cost shift, placing increased pressure on the public system. This occurred over a number of years in what in retrospect appears to be a series of very ill-advised decisions.</para><para>Between 1983 and 1989, $100 million was taken out of funds by gradually phasing out the reinsurance pool scheme. In September 1986, $135 million was lost when the bed day subsidy was abolished. Then the Medicare rebate for in-hospital services was reduced to 75 per cent and, in 1993, the states were provided with incentives to increase public patient throughput at the expense of private patients. Overall, it is estimated that this systematic attack on private health care resulted in cost shifting from public to private hospitals of, in today's terms, $846 million—or a 39 per cent rise in premiums. So much for Labor's record in this area.</para><para>We need to look very carefully at what private health insurance underpins. Very importantly, it underpins the role of GPs in performing their vital function in communities around Australia. The viability of general practice is very much dependent on a functioning, robust private health care sector, and I am certainly aware that the AMA is working with the government to begin addressing the problem of gap fees. Private health insurance 
 underpins hospitals throughout Australia, and it underpins the very important Commonwealth-state relations on health. The fact that all governments, including Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania, have now signed off on important state health agreements is underpinned very much by this important pillar of health care. We need a balanced health care system with future access to health care in Australia dependent on an appropriate balance between the private and public sectors.</para><para>You only have to look at the 1999-2000 budget that is currently before the parliament to see the strategic directions in health care that take us into the century of healing. We are spending over $1 billion on new health care initiatives over the next four years. I invite senators to look very carefully at the commitment to doubling research, the focus on primary health care, enhanced quality in general practice and the revitalisation of general practice in primary health care—which is a landmark move. Previous governments, particularly the Hawke and Keating governments, have ignored or dismissed these sorts of policy directions as being too hard or politically too hard or too hot to handle. Certainly the initiatives that were taken with regard to the 30 per cent rebate are very important, but we also need to look at the government's 1999-2000 budget—the $24 billion commitment of the Howard government—compared with the ALP's paucity of ideas, which have not contributed in any way in this area.</para><para>There are so many areas that will benefit from this year's budget: medical research, biotechnology, primary health care, the commitment and extra expenditure of funds in rural and remote areas—and there are dozens of programs in each and every one of these areas that are worth looking at.</para><para>Meeting the health needs of indigenous Australians is probably one of the most serious and important commitments that we can make. But let me come back to the point of a balanced health system, which is so important. This can only be achieved in the long run by reversing the long-term trend of private health insurance participation that was 
 so rapidly and nastily taken back by Labor during its 13 years. We have reversed this trend. We have now seen the first increase since the quarter ended September 1997. It is certainly interesting to note that the largest increase has been in the age group of 20 to 24. This year's budget commitment to lifetime health care is something that we can also be proud of because it builds on an existing community rating system. It attracts younger members, rewards longer term membership, stops hit-and-run membership, cuts costs and counters the adverse selection that has been so necessary.<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>5312</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats did not support the government's Private Health Insurance Rebate Scheme when it was proposed. We believed, and we still believe, that it represents an inequitable and inefficient use of taxpayers' funds. The recently released figures on membership numbers of private health insurance funds show that we were right. The extremely small increase in private health insurance membership in the March quarter provides unequivocal evidence that the rebate scheme has failed. An increase in fund membership of only 0.2 per cent of the population cannot justify the cost to the taxpayer of $1.7 billion a year.</para></talk.start><para>The government did not set any outcome measures for this policy. Despite the Democrats' efforts to get the government to state publicly what it hoped to achieve by this expenditure, we were unable to obtain from the Minister for Health and Aged Care any statement at all concerning his goals for the rebate scheme. However, whatever measure is used to assess the success of this scheme, it is clear that it has been a dismal failure. The small increase in fund membership represents a cost to the government of over $29,000 for each new insured person. Clearly, this is a grossly inefficient use of funds when an annual insurance policy costs about $1,500 a year for a single person.</para><para>If the government had paid the entire premium for each of these 57,000 new members, it would cost the Australian taxpayer only $85,500 a year—considerably less than the $1.7 billion that we are spending to get 
 the same result. That is because for every new member the scheme manages to attract the government is paying 95 existing members to keep their insurance. This means that most of the $1.7 billion is going to existing fund members, many of them people on high incomes who do not need a hand-out to help them pay their insurance premiums.</para><para>The Democrats argued strongly when the rebate bill went through the Senate that the scheme was bad policy and bad economics. The recently released figures have proved us right. The most distressing aspect of this rebate scheme is that it is taking scarce health resources out of the health system when there are so many areas of desperate need where this money could be spent to achieve real health outcomes. As it now stands, most of the $1.7 billion being spent on insurance rebates is going straight into the pockets of existing health insurance fund members and it is not providing any additional funding for health services at all.</para><para>The Democrats receive letters every week from people who are desperate for extra health funding: people who are waiting months for an operation in a public hospital, people who rely on expensive medication which is not subsidised by the PBS and older Australians who are living in pain because they cannot afford the dental treatment, the physiotherapy and the medication that they need. These are areas in which funding is desperately needed, and the government has chosen to divert health funding into a rebate scheme which does not provide one new health service or address any one of these critical areas.</para><para>The government has been unable to provide any evidence at all to back up their claims that the rebate scheme has reduced pressure on the public system and has reduced waiting lists in public hospitals. This was one of the claims made by both the minister for health and the Prime Minister repeatedly during the last election campaign. The Democrats were sceptical of the claim at the time, and the failure of the government to provide any data at all to back it up has validated our belief that the rebate scheme has not had any impact upon waiting times in the public health system.</para><para>Of course there were many considered objections to this expensive scheme at the time. They included those of many of Australia's leading health economists as well as independent consumer groups, such as the Australian Consumers Association and the Australian Council on the Ageing. In fact, the only groups that supported the rebate were those that stood to profit from it—the AMA, the private health insurance industry association and the private hospitals. The credibility of these groups has been seriously called into question by their extravagant predictions that the rebate scheme would achieve private health insurance fund membership levels of 40 per cent to 45 per cent of the population.</para><para>These predictions, which have now been proven to be completely inaccurate, reveal the inability of the associations to understand the community's concerns about Australia's health system. They do not understand that most people would prefer a high quality, equitable public health system, funded fairly through taxation, than the expensive private system where people are faced with high out-of-pocket costs even after they have paid insurance premiums for many years.</para><para>The government should stop listening to the professional associations when developing health policy and start listening to the 70 per cent of the population who have not taken out private health insurance despite a 30 per cent rebate, a surcharge for high income earners and a $7 million advertising campaign. The failure of the rebate scheme should send a clear message to the government that it is time to stop trying to bribe, to cajole or to frighten people into taking out private health insurance and it is time to start fixing some of the real problems that we have with our health system.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>5313</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have said in this place time and time again that Labor's response to the issue of private health insurance has been characterised by a devious and cynical campaign of misinformation and misrepresentation, and it is no different today.

I hope I will not have to listen to you, but you will have your turn to spread more misinformation, as is usually done by the Labor Party. Under Labor, young people often moved out of the private health insurance system. Because they had acute injuries they found themselves able to go into a public hospital and push out of the way older people who were waiting for surgery which was seen to be not as urgent—maybe a hip replacement or another form of surgery that they could wait for. That is what was happening under Labor. When Labor was in government it recognised over and over—or somebody recognised—that something should be done about private health insurance, but it did nothing about it. Labor lacked the courage to bite the bullet and do something about boosting private health insurance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Labor's top politicians—I suppose they were top politicians; Labor saw them as top politicians, top paid politicians anyway—Mr Keating and Dr Lawrence, openly bragged 
 that they did not take out private health insurance cover, because they could self-insure. If something went wrong they could afford and they had the connections to get treatment immediately. They did not take out private health insurance cover and either self-insured or, most probably, would rely on taxpayers to fund their health costs. It is little wonder they never made the hard decisions to fix the system, because they did not believe in it.</para><para>Unlike our Labor predecessors, our government does not suffer from a stubborn reluctance to address the hard issues in health. We are not prepared to sit by and watch our public system grind to a halt because of Labor's history of mismanagement. What we saw was an absolute decline in private health insurance. It was on a hiding to nowhere. As I said, even heavyweights like Graham Richardson recognised the urgent need to bring back people into private health insurance. Regarding membership, he said in 1993:</para><para>It was 70 per cent when we came to office and it's 40 per cent now.</para><para>It was 70 per cent when Labor came to office and it was 40 per cent in 1993.

In Victoria, the State with the least per cent of public beds as against private, the drop was more than five per cent.</para><para>He went on to say:</para><para>If the drop continues at any rate like it has been over the next few years, it won't be long before there will be enormous pressure on the public health system.</para><para>Senator Crowley used to come in here when she represented the Minister for Health and answer questions by saying, `Oh no, if people leave private health insurance, they don't put pressure on the public health insurance system.' Well, I know who I preferred to believe. I preferred to believe Senator Graham Richardson at the time, because he knew that when people dropped out of private health insurance they put enormous pressure on the public health system. Senator Graham Richardson was saying it then. He was not listened to unfortunately. I suppose anybody 
 with a brain in the Labor Party got out. The Minister for Finance, Senator Peter Walsh, got out because they would not listen to him. Senator Richardson got out because they would not listen to him. Anybody who had an idea, who thought they might be able to do something for the country, left the Labor Party.</para><para>As I said, unlike our predecessors we are not prepared to stand by and watch our system grind to a halt. Even with the writing on the wall, Richardson, like Mr Beazley and many of his other cabinet colleagues, lacked the courage to do anything about it. They did nothing and let the Australian health system become a terminal case. We have resuscitated the health system through the introduction of Lifetime Health Cover. We now have a system in place that will acknowledge those people who have belonged to health systems over a period of time and have shown loyalty to private health insurance schemes. Labor did not do anything about that, which was a constant concern. People would come to my office and say, `I have belonged to a health fund for 25 or 30 years and I get the same treatment and pay the same the fees as somebody who has come in a year before.' We have addressed that.</para><para>We have the 30 per cent rebate to assist people and we are pursuing reforms to address the gap—another concern which people expressed: that they went into hospital and found they had to pay more than somebody else in the same hospital who was there as a public patient. We are addressing that. Labor was unable to do that. The then Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Carmen Lawrence, put in place a scheme that the medical profession just could not accept. That is how good she was—she failed to consult with them, negotiate and come to an agreement. We have also developed a coordinated care system in the private sector. All of these measures ensure that our health system remains viable and affordable for all Australians—something that Labor continually puts down by repeated, self-righteous misinformation.</para><para>We have to also look at comments such as those by the ALP shadow minister for health, 
 Jenny Macklin. And even now Graham Richardson further reinforces the total lack of reality that is Labor Party policy. Before she got into this place, as chair of the national health strategy, Jenny Macklin said in the 1991 report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Hospital Services in Australia</inline> in relation to private health insurance:</para><para>If increased funding to public hospitals reduces the perceived pressure on public hospitals . . . it is likely private health insurance will drop. This could result in increased demand for public hospitals and reduced revenue from private patients.</para><para>It is a shame she lost the plot on her way into parliament.

It is a very important debate, because it is essentially about the fact that this government's very expensive policy proposal in the area of health—that is, $1.7 billion (B for Betty) per year on the health rebate—has gone for near enough to nothing. There has been a mere modest increase of 57,000 members into private health insurance at an outrageous expense for each increase. The debate today argues that this clearly reflects a failure of that 30 per cent rebate to achieve even modest targets set by government and certainly a failure to justify the expenditure of $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money on the rebate.</para></talk.start><para>I have heard my Liberal colleagues Senators Tambling and Patterson having a shot at the total inadequacy of the Labor Party. As Mandy Rice-Davies said, they would say that, wouldn't they? It is a bit of a shame that they do not actually deal with the full truth, and 
 that is that in the 13 years of the Labor government Labor introduced Medicare, an extraordinarily good health insurance system. Something like two million people were without any health insurance in 1982 and in the years before the Labor government. After Medicare was introduced, nobody in Australia any longer feared big health bills. That is what Medicare has done, and that is why it is so popular in the electorate. Thousands of people, and I might say particularly women, have in the past faced the fear of big health costs. What do you do when the kids are sick? What do you do when you might need to go to a doctor? Lots of families became sicker and sicker because they knew they could not afford the doctor or the hospital, so they went without health care because they were afraid of those bills. Medicare removed the bills and reduced the fear.</para><para>Another reason for this failure of people to have private health insurance is that the community is not stupid. They pay their contribution to Medicare according to their income and they get an excellent product in return. Should they ever need hospitalisation, they will get it. They may have to wait sometimes, but if it is an acute condition, an accident or an emergency they will get treatment straightaway in our state-of-the-art public hospitals, and they will be provided that with no extra outlay than their Medicare levy. They are free of any worry about those costs. On the other hand, you could buy private health insurance, which will not do anything to help you in an accident or an emergency because in 99.9 per cent of the cases you either choose or are taken to a public hospital. Ring Kerry Packer on this matter. That is where he went and had his life saved after he had a massive heart attack playing polo. It was the Westmead public hospital that saved Mr Packer's life. And that is what it does for thousands of citizens—no questions asked; just take the patients and provide the care.</para><para>When I came into this place in 1983 I became a member of a Senate committee looking at private hospitals and nursing homes. Then Senator Janine Haines had introduced a reference because there had been 
 reports of 35 people, mainly children but not only children, dying in the private hospital system following tonsillectomy operations.

Why would you pay $1,800 to $2,000 a year to insure a family?

That is what private health insurance bought many of those people. For years and years they have contributed, and what did they get? A big bill. The only way you can get that bill is if you have got private health insurance. It is a rotten product.</para><para>The cost is one thing, but the 30 per cent rebate will not persuade most people because it is still an extraordinarily high price. But the government knows that one of the other things that turns people off is the payment of the so-called gap, the difference between what private insurance pays and what the doctors and the hospitals charge.

 seen?

If you have the dollars, clearly that is the preferable place to be putting them. It is fairer, it is more equitable and it is where people go. Fifty per cent of the people in New South Wales a few years ago were admitted to the public hospital system from accident and emergency and were dealt with very quickly through urgent admission for accidents and emergencies. For others, there is a waiting time. One of the reasons there is a waiting time is that so many people with private health insurance prefer to go as public patients to the public hospital system because then they will get no bill.

The quote jangled on my ears; that is totally in conflict with everything all of you over there and the minister have said to this point. The reason you want 
 to get people into private health insurance is to reduce the pressure on the public hospital system. Either you mean that or you do not. But it is not working, because most people know that if they can have their surgery or treatment through the public hospital system, whether they have private health insurance or not, they will have no extra costs to pay. The people are smart. They know the better and preferred way to go. You are putting funds into subsidising a rotten product—private health insurance long past its use-by date. You should be helping people make a fair and reasonable contribution to the health costs of themselves and all Australians and you should be looking at ways in which you can subsidise and put money into our large public hospital system.

They want to know that when they are sick they and their families can go to the public hospital system, get a bed and get the treatment and excellent care that is provided in this country without financially crippling themselves.

We have imported into Australia all the problems which used to characterise, and still do, the British National Health Service where there are long waiting lists.

Rather than that, what is actually happening is that a lot of very ordinary middle income people who could afford to pay for their health services are using the public health system because it is free.

We had a nice balance in the past. We had a public hospital system which served the needs of the public who required that system and alongside it we had an effective private hospital system. What 
 we have today is an overutilised collapsing public system and an underutilised private system. The government has recognised that the answer to making Australia's health system more efficient and getting it back to a system of equity where the public dollar spent in public hospitals is spent efficiently and provides good service to people who need it is to encourage people back into private health insurance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government has set up some incentives to get people back into private health insurance. The major incentive is the 30 per cent rebate on premiums. This system has been in operation only a few months, but already it has had a very dramatic effect. As has been said, some 57,000 people have joined private health insurance funds again. Interestingly, that exactly reverses the trend which has occurred over the years under the Labor government when something like 50,000 people a month were dropping private health insurance. We have turned that around and we are getting a positive result.</para><para>It is too early to assess how successful that will be, because these incentives are related to taxation and taxation rebates. It will be very interesting to see what the situation is not in the March quarter but in the September quarter of the year after middle income earners have put in their taxation returns and sought to get the benefit of belonging to private health insurance funds. I suspect the reason this debate is occurring today is that the Labor Party are very anxious to get it up before 30 June when people have to complete their taxation returns because they know that the figures after then will be dramatically better because people will be joining health funds in droves over the next month or so to get the benefit of the taxation deductions.</para><para>The rather ridiculous assertion has been made not only by the Labor Party but also rather surprisingly by Senator Bourne, who I thought perhaps had a better understanding of these things, that the $1.7 billion that has been spent on attracting people back into health insurance funds divided by the number of people who have joined so far means that it is costing the public purse some $30,000 a head to get people back into private health 
 insurance. That may seem to be a reasonable statement to make, but it is really quite nonsensical because, firstly, it is too early to tell how many are coming into the system. By the end of the year, as I have said, when people complete their taxation returns there will be dramatically increased numbers in private health insurance.</para><para>Secondly, it does not take into account the cost reductions to the public system of taking people out of that system and getting them into the underutilised private hospital system. There is a saving to government by spending this money on getting people back into private health insurance because it means that the public hospital system will work more efficiently and effectively for the people who genuinely need to use that system. As I have said, that has been the greatest flaw in this Medicare system in that it has been used by middle income people who are, in effect, abusing the system by seeking free treatment in public hospitals and that is what we are seeking to redress. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SURVEY OF SENATORS' SATISFACTION WITH DEPARTMENTAL SERVICES 1999</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>5319</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Chapman)</name></talker><para>—Earlier this year senators participated in the Senate department's biennial Survey of Senators' Satisfaction with Departmental Services 1999.

This has no effect on the intent of the bill and the explanatory memorandum remains unchanged.</para><para>The existing definition of an excluded superannuation fund will be replaced with a new definition of a self managed superannuation fund. In addition to requiring the fund have fewer than five members, the new definition will require that all members of the fund have a business or family relationship and that they are trustees of the fund.</para><para>The Financial Systems Inquiry found that under the present system there is little protection of the interests of beneficiaries who are at arm's length from the trustees in an excluded fund. In addition, that there is little practical scope for effective prudential regulation of such funds. As such, the inquiry concluded that excluded funds should not have beneficiaries who are at arm's length from the trustees.</para><para>Under the new definition, members of self managed superannuation funds will able to protect their own interests and as such, these funds will be subject to a less onerous prudential regime under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act).</para><para>With this bill, the regulation of self managed superannuation funds will be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office from 1 July 1999, while regulation of all other funds will remain with the 
 Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The ATO will have responsibility for ensuring that self managed superannuation funds comply with the non-prudential requirements of superannuation law and APRA will continue its more extensive role as the prudential regulator of all other funds. Again, these changes have been introduced by the Government in response to the recommendations of the Financial Systems Inquiry.</para><para>The legislation provides for a reduced supervisory levy for self managed funds. The new levy amount will be included in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulation and will reflect to a larger degree the actual cost of regulating such funds.</para><para>In conclusion, the fundamental goal of the Government in introducing this bill is to ensure that the regulation of small superannuation funds reflects the needs of members of such funds as well as the Government's retirement income goals.</para><para>I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned till the first day of sitting in the winter sittings 1999, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>5320</page.no><id.no>r739</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee</title><page.no>5320</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>5320</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Tierney, I present the report of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, together with submissions and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  report of proceedings.

Might I say from the outset that humour in this situation, the comedy routine that Senator Tierney wishes to engage in—and quite clearly from his response he sees this as a very funny situation—is overshadowed by the fact that the business before the committee on this particular matter was of the most deadly serious nature. This matter is about a government that is trying to silence student voices in this country—a government which is guilty of being hell-bent on trying to nobble the overwhelming student opposition that has developed to what it has proposed in regard to voluntary student unionism.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This report should be printed to demonstrate just how disastrous and depraved the policy being pursued by the government is. I trust that through the printing of this report the public at large will come to understand that this government seeks to decimate our higher education sector and our higher education system. What we have seen with this comic drama—which I believe the printing of this report will reveal only too clearly—is that the Senate ought not to allow this to go on; it ought not to allow this to go unremarked.</para><para>This committee received some 409 submissions and some 1,500 letters. It is important that the report be printed so as to record that this inquiry probably had one of the highest levels of public reaction that has been seen for some time. Some 94 per cent of the submissions that were received were strongly opposed to the government's voluntary student unionism plan.</para><para>What I found particularly annoying was the way in which witnesses before the committee were treated by members of the coalition. What we saw, of course, were desperate attempts by the government to rustle up some expert, some level of opinion, some level of representation to articulate its sordid view on this matter. From the numerous submissions 
 that were listed as being presented to the committee, we saw that only four persons could be found to even fog up a mirror on behalf of the government; that is, four out of the 26 submissions that were presented on the day of the committee hearing.</para><para>Turning to the committee hearing itself, the opposition sought on numerous occasions to ensure that people had the opportunity to present their views. The government, through the force of numbers, acted to prevent there being hearings across this country; it acted in such a way as to suppress representations being made to this committee. That report be published by the Senate to highlight these things is, I think, important. It is important that the report be printed to demonstrate how every major stakeholder in the higher education sector was quite clearly of the opinion that the government's actions were wrong.</para><para>That opinion has come not just from students. The report, when printed, will demonstrate that lecturers and even vice-chancellors were taking a position strongly opposed to the government's action. Almost every university put in a submission opposing the voluntary student unionism legislation that the government has sought to force through this parliament.</para><para>We have heard from such well-known groups—such radical bolshevik groups!—as the Association for Christian Higher Education; the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; the Catholic Youth Services, Archdiocese of Adelaide; the Australian Union of Jewish Students; the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties; the Bathurst City Council; the City of Greater Bendigo; Rugby Tasmania—a well-known militant group is Rugby Tasmania!

The Malaysian government supports students' rights to organise themselves—especially when that organising is done in Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have seen the government's own hitherto `tame cat' youth advisory body, the government-appointed National Youth Roundtable, also take the view that this is a very difficult proposition. So even organisations such as the Youth Advisory Body have opposed the government.

These are the people whose voice the government wants to suppress; it wants to make sure that their views are not articulated within the community at large.</para><para>What we have seen—and this is why I think the report should be printed—is a majority report demonstrating yet again a paucity of government thinking on these issues. We have seen a majority report that has sought to support the legislation that the government has faithfully presented to the Liberal Party—and which, as I understand, has been opposed strongly within the Liberal Party itself.	What it attempted to do was demonstrate its view yet again by unsubstantiated and misguided assertions that were made by a few persons before the committee as to what they believed to be the inappropriate actions of various students. This was farcical in itself.</para><para>We observed the committee's behaviour. Of particular concern was the behaviour of coalition senators on this committee. We heard this morning Senator Abetz's miserable, pathetic refusal to apologise for the outrageous allegations he made before the committee, despite the fact that he now understands and has come to realise that he made totally inappropriate claims about misappropriation of funds, allegations that turned out to be 
 totally baseless.

Mr Ramsey makes the observations after quoting at some length from the transcript of the hearing where representatives from the ANU were so viciously attacked by the members of the coalition. Having abused the Labor Party's offer of goodwill when Labor Party senators had to leave because they had to catch aircraft home, the Liberal senators proceeded to abuse witnesses without the protection of having the Labor Party there. Mr Ramsey wrote this:</para><para>This small window not a bare few minutes of an eight-hour hearing by the Senate . . . committee says volumes about the suffocating hubris of the Howard government these days . . .

This only reinforced the perception that student organisations are not interested in actual representation of the aggregate student body, but are more concerned about maintaining the status quo where a small handful of students who choose to be politically active control student finances.</inline></para><para>The point really says it all—quite clearly the report backs the growing sentiment of the silent student majority, and the general community that student politics has to be taken out of the equation in the delivery of student services.</para><para>It is true that there now exists an effective separation of spending powers in the control and spending of compulsory acquired student levies between the student union and its relevant SRC exists on some campuses.</para><para>In effect there are four models, which not taking into account fees from West Australia students, deals with the $125 million of annual student levies.</para><para>The Compulsory payment of student fees with non compulsory membership of the SRC at universities like the Uni of Melbourne where the collection of compulsory "amenities and Services fee" occurs with no breakdown in union, sports or SRC component. although the students fee payment is not tied to membership of union.</para><para>For Victorian institutions the auspice of Voluntary Student Representation has reinforced the fact that the fee not being tied to membership of the SRC and union.</para><para>Compulsory payment with conscientious objection provisions such as UNSW where the compulsory fee passed onto relevant student organisations. Conscientious objection to belong to student organisation can see compulsory fee placed in a special fund or account.</para><para>Macquarie University is an example where the Higher education institution collects compulsory student union/sports association, SRC membership and passes them onto the relevant bodies with no effective exemption to conscientious objection.</para><para>VSU inspired model of non compulsory payment / membership in West Australia's four universities.</para><para>There are some clear points that can be highlighted from these models that back the principles of the Government's bill.</para><para>.	 Conjecture exists to both the difficulties and indeed ability to conscientiously objecting to membership of a student union on all Australian campuses, despite the reassurances of the AVCC to the public hearing.</para><para>.	 The level of student body support to SRC's, on the basis of voting turnout at best underwhelming—at worst appalling. An exceptionally high 
 level of voter turnout was considered at 15% with a more standard turnout between 5%—7%.</para><para>.	 The accountability of funds spent by SRC's for improper political and questionable causes through their direct access to student fee levies or the support forthcoming from funds allocated to the student union.</para><para>.	 General absence of commercial principles in the delivery of student services by students—the injection of a greater imperative for the professional delivery of student services, or more responsive to the greater need of the student majority is not encouraged, and is some cases discouraged by the maintenance of a compulsory student unionism regime.</para><para>Examples of SRC improper spending were put to the Committee in written and verbal evidence. Two examples of objectionable spending paint a very poor picture of the sideline activities that SRC's in particular at times get up too—funded of course by compulsorily acquired student foes.</para><para>1996 Federal election campaign the guild of Queensland Uni of Technology spent $44 500 mailing out material for ALP, guild vehicles were used to deliver ALP? material all over the state, $7 000 spent on T-shirts and paid people to turn up to demonstrations.</para><para>In 1994—Flinders University Student Association held a dope day, with marijuana provided by union.</para><para>Further examples of funding of dubious causes and practices, one of the latest being the spending of some compulsory funded student levies by the Newcastle University Students Association, NUSA, in hiring buses, printing posters in marching on my electorate office back on 11 May (the rally was lucky to attract 50 people) reinforces the very point.</para><para>As I said to broader media at the time when organisations like NUSA continue to devote substantive time and precious resources to such activities, they are not keeping an eye on the ball to ever improve the delivery and style of student services the broader student population seeks.</para><para>Last week I met with both students and in particular representatives from NUSA—face to face for an hour of questioning at the Newcastle Callaghan campus.</para><para>Reasonable to say the existing regime of compulsory membership to the student union at Newcastle University is not delivering outcomes the majority of students expect..</para><para>The President of the University of Newcastle Liberal Club, David Williams, perhaps put it even more bluntly.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">"VSU is clearly the way forward to force student associations to act responsibly and to provide real services and representation, instead of wasteful

The government was well aware of that. I am just adding my support on behalf of the Democrats to the motion before us. I believe that some of the interjections we have just heard in the chamber and that honourable senators and gallery members have just witnessed are probably quite indicative of the Senate committee hearing that took place on the voluntary student unionism bill a couple of weeks ago.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I put on record the Democrats' concern with the way witnesses were treated in this committee. We also feel that, if we are not careful, we will undermine the public confidence in the committee system of people who appear before us. Representatives of organisations and advocacy groups such as the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the National Union of Students, as well as government departments and individuals, appear before us. We should respect the fact that they go to the trouble of preparing a submission and are available to appear before the committee to take questions from senators. They do not deserve to be abused or ridiculed, nor do those students deserve to have allegations implied, if not directed at them.</para><para>I do wish to put on record the treatment of Mr Jason Wood. I hope that as Senator Abetz has joined us in the parliament today with the intention of making a statement—I think it has been made public—an apology will be forthcoming. It states on the wire today that Mr Wood was never actually accused of a specific thing. It was not alleged that he had committed a particular crime or deed, but it was certainly implied that it related in some way to a misappropriation of funds. I listened to that part of the committee hearing. I was stunned to hear the treatment and the process to which this witness was subjected. It was quite an extraordinary example, as Jason Wood claims, of political thuggery.</para><para>For the record, the Democrats support universal membership of student organisations. We believe that the bill that is debated in this report, which we believe should be printed, is ideologically motivated. It is a political response in an attempt to emasculate 
 the services that are provided by student organisations—that is, those very basic services, representative functions and facilities that are provided for students on campuses. We believe that the government has tried to guise its ideological and blatant political motivations in the form of arguments about freedom of choice and freedom of association.</para><para>In fact, this government is not interested in looking after students or student welfare. This bill's motivation is to silence dissent in much the same way that this government has defunded or reduced funding for organisations that represent students or young people or, in fact, any organisation or advocacy group that has spoken against this government's policies. I include in that list ATSIC, the Office of the Status of Women and the Australian Youth Policy in Action Coalition.</para><para>It is hardly surprising that a sector that has actually argued against government policies—most recently, of course, the common youth allowance and income support for students—and has criticised the government for its blatant attacks on universities and, in particular, operating grant funding should have its funding threatened in this way. Make no mistake, this is a bill of blackmail: if student organisations do not allow non-compulsory student membership, their fees and their grants are threatened.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

I only hope that he and his colleagues will be so quick to jump to the defence of those witnesses who appear before committees in future, who are subject to allegations and who are subject to abuse. Again I put on record the Democrats' opposition to the bill. We supported the committee process, albeit a rushed committee process which had jam-packed witnesses and was short on time, and knowing that some senators were to be unavailable on that occasion.</para><para>This bill is probably not going to succeed before the Australian parliament, not simply because of the good sense of most non-government parties but because there are a number of backbenchers, a number of members of this government, who see how crazy it is and who know that they have so many students and academic and general staff as constituents that they would not dare legislate against universal membership of student organisations. They would not want to see for a minute an emasculation of those vital campus services that organisations and student unions and guilds provide—whether it is subsidised catering, whether it is child care on campus, whether it is representation in the form of advocacy on behalf of students, whether it is students who have a welfare issue or complaint, or whether it is providing those vital services in campus life like newspapers, student radio or even those sporting clubs.</para><para>I concur with Senator Carr's comments earlier. We hardly saw radical submissions come forth in favour of universal student membership. We saw an interesting group. We had religious groups, international groups, sporting and other representative organisations come before us in favour of universal student membership. The point of choice is the point 
 of enrolment. Universal membership is something that the Democrats will continue to support to ensure that students, especially those from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds, have the opportunity to participate in campus life and have a holistic campus experience—not just in academic life but in the whole university environment. That is for all Australian students—not just the rich elite, as most government policies in relation to higher education would have it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>5328</page.no><name role="metadata">Synon, Sen Karen</name><name role="display">Senator SYNON</name><name.id>FQ6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to incorporate a statement that neither demeans nor casts aspersions on any of my Senate colleagues or people who appeared before the committee.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator McKiernan)</name></talker><para>—Is leave granted?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Given the sorry history on this matter, I think the normal customs should be followed and we should see the statement before it is tabled.

Instead, I shall focus on some key aspects of the structural flaws and myths that exist under the current compulsory regime.</para><para>Firstly, I would like to dispel the myth that services that students currently use and enjoy will be placed at risk—this couldn't be further from the truth. The best guarantee to ensure that a service survives, under a compulsory or voluntary system, is when that service is in genuine demand by the student body. A case in point is University sports. As noted in the Committee report, the Sports Associations at the University of Western Australia and Edith Cowan University—both in a State with full VSU—are running surpluses. This has been achieved by a deliberate strategy of these Sports Associations to focus on service delivery and response to the sporting student body.</para><para>Secondly, there is an incorrect notion that student unions use the compulsory fee for provision of a range of goods and services that ultimately benefit the students. This Committee heard a range of evidence about extreme financial wastage that routinely occurs in student organisations. For example, at Latrobe University, their legal service pays a lawyer around $80,000 a year! Student fees are meant for students, not lawyers—and this is just one example.</para><para>The Melbourne University Student Union loses around $300,000 a year on badly run food and catering departments. There may be a temptation to call this a `subsidy' but this is not the case. The food isn't cheaper and the private operators on campus stay open almost the same hours as the Union owned shops do and operators just off campus are open around the clock.</para><para>These are not isolated examples. This practice is endemic to student unions that, with guaranteed revenue year after year, do not need to be accountable to themselves, let alone the students. It is a 
 deep, structural flaw inherent to the compulsory payment of these fees.</para><para>Voluntary Student Unionism means that students will not be forced to subsidise these practices. I can't emphasise just how important this fact is. This legislation is about students, first and foremost. This legislation states that we are prioritising each and every student who goes to university above any organisation or group. This should never be forgotten—universities and student associations are there to serve the students, not the reverse.</para><para>Leaving aside the question of how representative student unions are, and many would argue they represent a vocal or activist minority and not the mainstream student body, at best a compulsory system forces minorities to fund the whims of the controlling activists in student organisations. For example, quite a few students have pro-life views. Articles promoting counselling for pregnant women submitted by students opposed to abortion don't find their way into Orientation Magazines which routinely list under Women's Health the names of the local abortion clinics.</para><para>I do not wish to draw the Senate into a debate about the merits of pro-life views, or of the numbers of students on campuses, many of which are from Christian backgrounds, or the views that many student associations advocate. That debate would be missing the point. The real issue is not who is right or wrong for a particular scenario, but whether you should be forced to fund an activity that you are so clearly opposed to.</para><para>There are no institutional clauses to protect these sorts of students at university. Conscientious objection clauses, whose mere existence demonstrates that something must already be amiss, fail to cover instances such as those I have just discussed. If you're a part of an isolated or numerically smaller group on campus, you have no chance of winning control from the dominant activist majority.</para><para>For these students, the only safeguard they have is if they control whether their money is spent, to whom, how much and for what purpose. This safeguard will be guaranteed by the legislation that the Government has introduced to this Parliament.</para><para>Compulsorily collected fees will always result in students being forced to pay for activities that they don't want to fund. The Government's legislation will finally give students choice.</para><para>I recommend this Committee's report to the Senate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>5330</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>5330</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison</inline> to move, on the next day of sitting:</para><para>That the amendments circulated by the Government to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Bill 1998 on sheet ER229 be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 29 June 1999, with particular reference to:</para><para>(a)	 whether the amendments would result in an acquisition of property from a person within the meaning of paragraph (xxxi) of section 51 of the Constitution; and</para><para>(b)	 alternative options for the regulation of undesirable material in the context of the existing classification scheme for restricted material in publications, films and computer games.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>5330</page.no><id.no>s213</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>5330</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The committee is considering the <inline ref="s213">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999</inline> , and opposition amendment No. 2 on sheet 1397 moved by Senator Bishop.

All of that is true but that is simply supporting the case for a review, and I have no doubt the Senate will in due course support our review approach. That is then the time to decide whether you have a sunset operation.</para></talk.start><para>If you go down the path you are proposing, you will create a great deal of uncertainty because people will have to proceed on the basis that, irrespective of how well it might be working, or even if there is a mood to extend it in all sorts of ways, no-one can be sure of the numbers at the time. So what you will be doing is setting in concrete a process that none of us may want to see.

Our argument that we maintain the need for a sunset clause to be inserted now is simply that there has, in our view, been inadequate time for community consultation, public discussion, on the key matters con 
 sidered by this bill. We do not know what our position will be within three years, but we do want to have the review.

I think that is very sensible.</para></talk.start><para>As the minister said, this is groundbreaking legislation. There are very real concerns with it. Inserting this clause would mean that the review that is inherent in what the government is doing will have to have been done after a couple of years of operation. Parliament's mind will have to be focused on whether or not the legislation has served Australia well and whether the fears of people on this side of the parliament have been realised; in which case, a new look at the problem which the government is trying to meet through this legislation will have to be undertaken. This is an important way of ensuring that the whole matter comes back for review, debate and vote in the parliament within three years of the beginning of operation of this legislation, which has very big ramifications for everybody in Australia.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mark Bishop's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator S.

Labor believes the legislation must not impose unnecessary financial and administrative burdens on ISPs, degrade the technical performance of the Internet or detract from Australia's development as a destination for investment in e-commerce.</para><para>I think it is trite to say—it is probably common ground right around this chamber—that the Internet is a rapidly expanding medium. Earlier today we were discussing figures showing that Australia now has the second highest penetration rate of the Internet. It exists in almost 20 per cent of Australian homes and is a regular feature in business and commerce circles. It is almost impossible to engage in serious business and commerce these days without ongoing access to the Net and all the associated features that go with it.</para><para>On the evening news last night the Managing Director of Telstra was talking about investment in new technology, and how the increased demand has led to a doubling in the use of lines every five months. Not only is it important that domestic and business consumers be users of the Internet, but it is important, for a range of reasons, that we are able to develop an indigenous technological industry in this country. There has been a lot of discussion lately about outsourcing and whether that is an appropriate policy to follow but, in terms of the Internet, there is a significant amount of wealth to be generated and created through value adding in a range of areas attached to that.</para><para>The opposition listened closely to the evidence that was given at the Senate IT inquiry. There were quite strong arguments put by a range of associations and organisations that the bill as it is currently drafted does not have a proper degree of regard to the financial and administrative burdens being placed on ISPs. So the opposition regards this 
 amendment as quite important. We need to have this growth sector of the economy operating effectively. Unnecessary burdens have the potential to impede its growth and, worse, unnecessary financial burdens raise the option, for many providers, of locating their business offshore—and that is an unnecessary development.</para><para>It think it is trite to say that the Internet is a valuable tool for researchers, educators, those engaged in commerce, community organisations and the general population. In particular, it is a tool for communication, promotion and education. Degradation of the technical performance of the Internet will have an impact on these benefits. There was significant discussion by representatives from the CSIRO and a range of industry organisations which was quite technical in nature but was to the effect that the bill, as it was drafted then, did not have sufficient regard for the technical performance of the Internet. Imposing unnecessary blockages or filters at ISP level would degrade the operations of ISPs and  has the potential to spin out and degrade the performance of the Internet right around this nation.</para><para>It is common ground that we are a major trading nation. Our trading volumes are growing, and a huge amount of commerce is increasingly being done over the Net. Four, five or six years ago—in fact, it may have been in excess of that—when I was in another life at Coles Myer, that organisation made a major shift. All of the suppliers, purchasers, manufacturers and wholesalers that provided goods to or received goods from Coles Myer had to shift down the path of standard procedures via electronic commerce, and that was a rather novel move. Coles Myer made it mandatory and it has since spread throughout the manufacturing and wholesale sectors which provide goods and services to major companies. It is nothing novel or new, and any legislation that has the unintended effect of degrading Internet performance and affecting the ability to engage in rapid commerce exchange is something that has to be looked at quite closely.</para><para>In the final analysis, it becomes, like everything, a question of priorities and there may 
 well be good and sound public policy reasons why it is appropriate to say that we are going to marginally impede the effectiveness of the Internet and that the benefits to be gained from that marginal impeding of the Internet in terms of e-commerce are worth paying the price for.</para><para>The submissions that were put to us and the questioning of witnesses did not lead us to that conclusion. We are concerned that there are these demonstrable unintended consequences that are going to harm industry and, for this reason, we do not think it is appropriate.

Our concern is not so much with amending the objects clause in itself but rather that the effective section, 37(2), to a large extent turns on what is then contained in the objects clause. We have got a bit of tidying up to do of our own, but in general terms we want the examination by the ABA to proceed on whether it is technically feasible and commercially viable for a particular ISP—in other words, project by project, case by case.</para></talk.start><para>If you introduce notions such as degrading the technical performance of the Internet to a material degree—putting aside for a moment the obvious vagueness in those terms, because what constitutes `sufficient degradation' or `material'?—the real concern is that this could provide an out, even though an individual ISP may well be able to do something technically and may have the deepest pockets in the world and be able to afford to do it but, because of a generic concern for the industry, is effectively let off the hook. We do not think that is the way to approach this because it defeats the whole purpose of the exercise, which is to allow a genuine case by case assessment of each individual ISP's capacity to do its best.</para><para>The same comment would apply to amendment (3), because your first amendment is essentially a repetition of what is already there. So amendment (2) is the degrading and amendment (3) is inhibiting the development as an attractive jurisdiction. Again, that is remarkably broad and it would not be an acceptable outcome if one were to say, `Well, okay, ISPs can do all of this, but because we have a concern to ensure that Australia remains an attractive jurisdiction for electronic commerce we are basically not going to enforce these rules.' I do not think that is what is intended by the whole thrust of the legislation and we do not want the objects to address it in that form in any event, but we certainly do not want any exemptions to be allowed for on that basis.</para><para>Our amendment, which would add in the supply of Internet carriage services at performance standards that regionally meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian community, is designed to put a floor under the process; in other words, just as you have a safety net arrangement built into the Telecommunications Act where the universal service obligation is to provide a standard telephone service—a minimum level of service. It is not specifying what it should be; it is simply saying it cannot fall below that particular level. So we think it is helpful to insert in the objects clause that we do not want the supply of Internet carriage services to fall beyond a level of reasonability, but 
 beyond that we do not want the objects clause to serve as a backdoor means of exempting ISPs who would otherwise have the capacity to do what the act is intended to require them to do.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>5334</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand the comment that you are making, Minister—that is, if the particular ISP can meet the provisions in the act, the operators of it should and should not find the out in the general wording in the amendment. Our particular concern—why we put forward the amendment—is that there be a continuing review of the effectiveness of the bill and how it affects particular ISPs on an ongoing basis. The way we seek to achieve that end is to put that general provision into clause 4 so that the ABA will have regard to it.</para></talk.start><para>Minister, going through your amendments (1) to (4) leads me to ask you to explain to us the difference between `undue' and `unnecessary' and why you have chosen to go down that path.

For my part, the most appropriate wording would be `unreasonable', because that would allow for scalability—in other words, you would get a different result depending upon the impact of the obligations on a particular ISP. As we know, there are some 631 of them and, obviously, the precise burden will vary enormously, even if the requirement is identical. Larger ISPs can clearly do a lot more than smaller ones. So it seems to me on reflection that `unreasonable' probably best meets our concerns. But `undue' we still think would be more satisfactory than `unnecessary', because `unnecessary' is likely to be a one size fits all 
 approach which does not reflect the overall intent to take account of different circumstances.</para></talk.start><para>I should say, just in terms of your ongoing review point, that I think we all expect that there will be effectively an ongoing assessment made by the industry. What we do not want is for the ABA in the context of making a particular decision to be taking a more general approach because, in a sense, it could depend on where you are in the cycle. If you are the first cab off the rank, someone might say, `It is not going to pose any problems to the industry.' If you are the 10th cab off the rank, they might say, `Enough is enough.' It is just your good luck if you happen to be the 10th cab—you are exempted. We do not think that is the right approach to take; it ought to be a judgment made on the merits of the offensive material on the one hand and your capacity to deal with it on the other. So we do think there will be plenty of effective ongoing review, because each time a decision is made the industry will be responding in various ways and, if they have particular concerns, no doubt they will approach us all and seek to have those matters addressed. So I do think you will get your ongoing review, but we do not want it to be in the context of specific decision making.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>5335</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On the first point you raised, Minister, you prefer the word `undue' over `unnecessary' and then you seemed to be tossing around in your mind whether you should not go to use of the word `unreasonable'.

The question that was raised, presumably in Senator Alston's mind, is that the word `unnecessary' might not have an element in it which would have regard to other than what was necessary for the purposes of implementing the decision. I think myself that `unnecessary' is the word. `Unnecessary' is defined in the dictionary as `not necessary, superfluous or needless'. I do think that we need to go back to what the legislation is all about. What if you have a smaller ISP which is making money hand over fist through a porn site, for example, or any of these other sites—whether they be violence or porn?</para></talk.start><para>What I am asking the minister is whether he is suggesting that the word `undue' or indeed the word `unnecessary' will allow those ISPs to simply argue that the implementation by them of their obligations under this legislation would cause them undue economic loss. And what does `undue' mean and what does `unreasonable economic loss' mean? With such an ISP, it will surely be necessary for them to take action; otherwise you might as well not have this legislation at all. It is largely those organisations which are going to be the problem. If under that you are suggesting that it is considered unreasonable in economic terms for the ISP to observe its obligations under the legislation, what is the purpose of the legislation?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>5335</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think the concern that we have, and I apprehend that Senator Harradine is approaching it in the same manner, is that we do not want a situation where someone can simply say, `This might be a bit expensive for us, so don't impose the burden.' We want to ensure that, whatever precise word is used, it is considered in the individual context. In other words, if you are 
 looking at the impact on a particular ISP then you strike the balance and you will have regard to `technically feasible' and `commercially viable' in the same way as you look at whether it is `unnecessary' or `undue'.</para></talk.start><para>I suppose the worry we had about `unnecessary' was that it might involve determining in the abstract what is necessary and then applying that irrespective of the capacity of any individual ISP. As long as we accept that the intention is to allow case by case assessment to be made, I think we could probably live with `unnecessary', because I would then be confident that it would be interpreted in such a way that it will allow for those variations. If it does not, you can have the converse of Senator Harradine's point. Once you have decided that a burden is unnecessary for one purpose, you simply apply that automatically to everyone else, and a lot of other people might then find that they can get away with things which they could well afford to fix up. So, if we proceed on the basis that it is part of a case by case analysis, I do not think there will be a difficulty.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>5336</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Can I follow that through.

Clearly they would be warranted if there is an obligation that is imposed upon the ISPs. They could probably not get out of it under that definition. Excessive or too great: what is the too great financial burden? We are dealing with, for example, an ISP which is almost predominantly being used by the content providers of hard-core porn or violent material, or even RC material. Surely you are 
 not suggesting by the use of `undue' that the definition `excessive and too great' should apply to the exclusion of the purposes of the legislation, namely, to deal with the prohibited material or potentially prohibited material.</para><para>Going to the word `unreasonable', `unreasonable' means `not reasonable; not endowed with reason.

I accept that `undue' and all of these words have boundary problems in the sense that it is always a matter of how far it needs to go before it is undue. If `undue' is defined as `excessive or unwarranted', at what point do you reach those points? I would have thought it was out of all proportion, but there is no doubt a range of definitions of `undue' which could muddy the waters. If `unnecessary' is understood in the context that we have been discussing it, and that is considering the burden that is placed on an individual ISP or ICH, and accepting that necessary financial and administrative burdens can be required to deliver on the policy content, it is then a question of what is beyond that point that would render it out of the reach of that section. I can live with `unnecessary' if it is in the context of making those individual assessments. </para></talk.start><para>`Unreasonable' is a term we are all familiar with. I thought the virtue of it was that it 
 allows you to make a case by case decision. The assessment would then be: at what point is the burden so overwhelming that you are almost putting them out of business? That becomes unreasonable. I suppose it is something that lawyers are more familiar with. In any event, you can arrive at the same result with `unnecessary', so I would not want to die in a ditch on that one because I think we are generally all of the same mind.

If the matter is to be litigated, then again it would be very undesirable, if the court is to use the objects clause as an aid to statutory interpretation, to be, first of all, having to determine what something ought to be in the ABA's opinion.

That arises only if there is no code registered. If you look at 37(1)(b), if a code is registered you notify the content to ISPs, et cetera, and ask them to take action. If (b) does not apply, then a written notice is given directing the provider to take all reasonable steps, et cetera. In determining what are reasonable steps, the ABA would have regard to the objects clause. You do not want the ABA, under 37(2), to be having regard to its own opinion in 4(3).

It is not unique by any means for the parliament to be confronted by conflicting principles, as we all are on a regular basis. Parliament does the best it can. Obviously, we are concerned to maximise the 
 benefits on both sides of the ledger. We do not want to unnecessarily put anyone out of business. We do not want to impede the growth of electronic commerce; we do not believe that will occur. But if there were a choice to be made between some slight degree of regression on those fronts and doing nothing at all to control the flow of offensive or illegal online content material, then I would be very surprised if you stood up and said, `We ought to do nothing.'

That is not the case. It has always been our intention, in line with a decision taken several years ago, that the responsibility for content regulation should remain with the states, as it does in a number of other areas relevant to content such as defamation and censorship, but that service providers should be regulated via the telecommunications power.</para></talk.start><para>That being the basis of the action, it would still be our hope that the first port of call will be the content providers, certainly within 
 Australia, because they are the ones who are responsible for generating the offensive material in the first place. It is much more difficult offshore, for obvious reasons, and that is why the burden of the legislation is directed more towards service providers, because they are the gateways through which this material comes. But the principle remains the same. It is simply a matter of the practicality in terms of offshore material that ISPs will normally be expected to accept responsibility for doing what they can under the codes of practice.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>5342</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the minister for his answer.

It seeks to include that in a new clause 1A. I think it is appropriate at this stage for the opposition to remind the government of its principal concerns with respect to this bill, which go to five particular matters. The first is the indecent haste—we use that phrase and do not resile from it in any way—with which the government has approached this issue and the apparent and blatant disregard that the government has had for a lot of the views of the community on this issue of censorship and control and regulation.</para></talk.start><para>I said earlier today that there is a divide in the community; it manifests itself in this discussion on the worth of regulation and the worth of control. Last evening we had several contributions that raised some pertinent matters on the issue of censorship. I think it is fair to say that the views in the community are divided on this issue, but it is more important to note that this bill has now been around for about six weeks. It was tabled and 
 referred to the Senate select committee on IT. We sat for in the order of 20 hours on three evenings and a full day and heard submissions from a range of interested parties.</para><para>As we sat down after that and examined the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and the views that had been put by a range of industry representatives and interested participants in this debate, what was and remains a glaring omission is that there appears to be no feedback from the wider community as to the nature of this debate. We certainly understand the views of the ISPs and the relevant industry organisations. We understand the views of the Australian Consumer Association, putting arguments on behalf of consumers. But what has concerned me over the last four or five weeks is that there has been little, if any, correspondence.</para><para>Since I have been in the parliament I cannot recall a bill on which I have not received ongoing correspondence from constituents all around Australia expressing a particular view one way or the other. Members of parliament receive streams and streams of emails, form letters and photocopies of documents stating points of view from all around Australia. Many of these are obviously organised and part of a lobby process, and you give those the amount of regard they probably should have.</para><para>A lot of the bills that have come before us in the last three years have dealt with economic matters, social security matters, giving benefits to particular sectors of the community, restricting benefits to particular groups in the community or taking benefits away from people who have enjoyed them for many years. You do get reams and reams of correspondence—usually handwritten, always signed and with a contact number to follow up and discuss over the phone the person's particular concerns.</para><para>With respect to this bill, I have received a lot of submissions from industry organisations. I have received reams and reams of emails, as I suppose all senators have, and we all acknowledge that. But I have received very little correspondence. Indeed, when I checked with my office back in Perth today, there had been hardly any calls at all to the office expressing a point of view.</para><para>It seems to me that discussion on this bill is occurring in isolation, away from the community. It is obviously occurring in this chamber, but it is most unusual for that discussion to occur in isolation from community sentiment. It is of concern to the opposition that the government is putting forward a bill which has not been properly aired. It has been the subject of much ongoing and often bitter discussion within industry groups as to a particular point of view. But out there in the community—amongst families, in social groups and community groups—there is no awareness whatsoever as to what is going on. It strikes me that that is a significant failure, I suppose on the part of all of us, and to some extent it demonstrates our distance in this respect from community attitudes. I ask why that is the case, why the community is not involved in this debate. Is it irrelevant? Are they bored? Are they not interested? The answer to those three questions is no. It is relevant, they are interested.</para><para>From time to time we are all invited to address a meeting or put forward a point of view or do an after dinner speech. At the end of the meeting there may be general discussion involving what people are interested in, what they want to talk about, what their points of view are. You may open the discussion by saying that we are discussing the issue of pornography at length in the parliament, that we are discussing regulation, and that it involves issues such as freedom of choice and whether the government should be interfering or involving itself in the mores of the community. My observation is that people pick up, they do listen, they are interested, and they have a point of view. But that has only been emerging in the last three or four weeks when members of parliament, or those particularly interested in this debate, take the opportunity to raise the issue and prod the audience, if you like, to invite a reaction.</para><para>With respect to any other matter that we have had division on in the last three years—child care, social security, superannuation, taxation—I have found that whenever you go into public and community forums, people are surprisingly well informed of the progress of debate and the issues at stake. They may not 
 express it in the detail that members of parliament do, but they are certainly aware of the principles involved in the discussion. But that has not occurred here. It has struck me for some weeks as a very odd development, because people are concerned about those things. It comes down to a very bold issue: if the government or the opposition say to people, `You can have access to this material, you can look at it, you can do what you like,' people give a nod and say, `Yes, that's right. Who are the government or politicians or a group of senators, to be interfering with our basic rights?'</para><para>As the argument develops and you say, `Well, listen, if you think that's right'—about the material relating to race, race hatred, race vilification, bomb making, incitement to vicious and violent acts, access to pornography and material of the like that is not generally circulated in the community—people do pick up, they do respond. They say, `Oh well, there's a little more to this debate than we thought.' There are two issues for them. One is: `Should we, as adults and as responsible members of the community, be free to go about our daily lives without government, politicians and all of those people in Canberra restricting the rights we have come to enjoy over 100 years in this country?' At the same time, as they calm down and reflect upon the nature of the debate, people are increasingly concerned that their young children are becoming somewhat distant from them.</para><para>Indeed, I have discussed this with my colleagues in the opposition, particularly those who are in a similar age group to me and have young families with children aged from four to 12. I have also discussed the issue with a number of government members of parliament. They have all volunteered the fact that basically they believe in their hearts in freedom of choice without a great deal of government intrusion and regulation. But when you ask them if they have taken the option of subscribing to devices, mechanisms or products that will not harm their children, to a person they say, `Yes, we have. We pay $10, $15 or $25 per month and we access those particular products.'</para><para>That, to me, is something of a surprising comment because it exactly mirrors the divide that is out there in the wider community. Yes, adults should be free to go about their daily lives and engage in legitimate social and community activities without the intrusion of Big Brother. But when it comes to their family, their home, their immediate concerns, they say, `We make a choice, and the choice is that we want our children to have access to the wealth of information that is out there in the community. We want them to work hard, to attend libraries, to study after hours, to access all the information that is out there on the Internet. But we don't have the time, the ability or the information to be policemen in our own lounge room or in our own bedroom and watch over our children 20 hours a day.' When it comes to children going up to their bedrooms and doing their homework or whatever it is, parents on both sides of this chamber have said, `I want to know that my children are not accessing, or being exposed to, material that I, as a parent, regard as being inappropriate or offensive.' They subscribe to those things.</para><para>This whole debate we are entering into is really just beginning. Earlier today I read out to the chamber an email that I had received from the United States. That email was to the effect that, within the last 48 hours, the United States Senate, in a 100 to zero vote across both parties, unanimously amended a bill mandating that ISPs provide the option of filtered products. We hear constantly that, in the land of the free, the issue of choice is absolute; that anything that infringes upon the ability of corporations or individuals to maximise their returns is distinctly not part of the culture of the people of the United States. But there you have a motion amending a relatively innocuous piece of legislation being carried 100 to zero. That is as a result of ongoing discussion in that country. That country is probably some three or four years ahead of us in debating this issue. They have been having that discussion.</para><para>The United States Senate has now had at least three attempts to regulate, control or restrict access to the Internet and the material that may be accessed via the Internet. Each 
 time the relevant legislation has gone through by a significant majority across both parties. Each time it has worked its way through the United States legal system, each time it has gone to the Supreme Court and each time the Supreme Court has struck down the relevant legislation. But the Congress over there still revisits the issue, both parties still appear to deal with it on a non-partisan basis and each time the issue is revisited in a different form. That tells us that the issue will not go away; that a lot of people, a lot of families, a lot of people in the community—and it is not just fringe right wing pressure groups, it is not just those who subscribe to particular family values or family matters in the United States; it is across the board—feel it is a significant issue. It is so significant that 100 senators out of 100 in the United States Senate feel obliged every 12 months or every two years, because of pressure from their own communities, to revisit this issue. The issue will not go away here.</para><para>We have put the view that this bill, the  Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 , is flawed. There will probably be a review mechanism. I understand the government's position. The sunset clause has been defeated but there is a need to have a proper and serious debate over the next 18 months or two years on the worth of control, on the worth of censorship. I do not believe it is appropriate to hide the issue, and I do not for one minute say that this government is running away from the issue. They have a particular solution to the mischief they have identified. We do not believe their solution is appropriate. We do not believe their solution is the best one that could have been achieved. We are somewhat alarmed by the haste involved in the tabling of the bill. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>5345</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Government amendment no. 5 tells us many things about the <inline ref="s213">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999</inline> .

Australia, being a federation, has Commonwealth and state laws which all have application with respect to attempts such as this. For the first time, this particular amendment tried to clarify many of the concerns that were raised through the course of the hearings.</para><para>Minister, I have a series of questions in relation to this amendment to clarify even further its intent and indeed its effect. I would like to turn first to the third component of the amendment which talks about the proposed scheme and a range of non-legislative initiatives directed towards (a) monitoring of content on the Internet and (b) educating and advising the public about content on the Internet. So many of the witnesses during the inquiry and in their personal and professional representations to me and other senators have raised parental education and community awareness as being the key to what constitutes an effective regime with respect to controlling access by minors to offensive Internet content.</para><para>Whilst your explanatory memorandum goes some way to describe the work in this non-legislative area of what the government proposed, I am wondering whether you could be quite specific in outlining for the committee just exactly what the government is proposing to do, and what resources have been identified and funded to date, for the purposes of educating parents and raising the general awareness of not just the online community but all of the Australian community who no doubt are going to be confronted with this issue, if not now, then in due course.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>5345</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I hope I do not smell a filibuster because, having had 15 minutes from Senator Bishop essentially repeating what he said on an earlier occasion, I am now being asked about the very clauses on which Senator Stott Despoja asked me to elaborate, and I have given the explanation in relation to Commonwealth-state responsibilities.

Certainly, as I think we traversed at an earlier stage, there are a number of people in the industry who see commercial opportunity in promoting material. You will find in the United States that there are very many organisations and service providers offering a range of filtering technologies or access to ISP controlled blocking devices. We certainly think that there should be the opportunity taken to ensure that parents understand what is available to them, but at the end of the day this legislation is designed to ensure that there are minimum provisions put in place to ensure that people do not accidentally come across material, through either ignorance or a feeling of uncomfortability about technology. We believe that the combination of those measures will be suffi 
 cient to ensure that we get the maximum level of community protection.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>5346</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, I am seeking more detail.

At the end of the day, unless it comes to the ABA—either from the public direct or via something like a NetWatch committee—there is the risk that the matter will not be properly handled.

To the extent that people want to know the detail of how that process works, there would be no reason why the NetWatch committee would not pass that on, if asked. However, the primary concern of complainants is not likely to be, `Tell me how the code of practice works,' but, `I find this offensive. What are you going to do about it?' To the extent that the codes of practice provide a mechanism for resolving those complaints, they will have that degree of relevance, but there will not be any formal interaction between the two.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>5348</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The next dot point in the explanatory memorandum for amendment No. 5 says that part of the ABA's additional functions are:</para></talk.start><para>.	 to conduct and/or co-ordinate community education programs about Internet content and Internet carriage services, in consultation with relevant industry and consumer groups and government agencies.</para><para>That moves in the direction that I would have expected, but it seems to run a little bit counter to the explanation that you just provided.

You cannot dot every `i' and cross every `t' in these matters until you know whether you have survived the vagaries of the Senate process, apart from anything else. Clearly, once these aspects have been put in place, we will be in a position to take the process further. But we are making it plain that we expect the ABA to ensure that a number of different aspects of these matters are addressed—that it is not simply all left to government or all left to parents—so that we have an ongoing process of ensuring that everyone is up to date in terms of industry research, community attitudes and industry developments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>5349</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, I do find it astounding that you make statements like, `Well, we will nut out the detail once we have dealt with the vagaries of the Senate.'

And where does that leave the evidence from the ABA themselves that was quite explicit: `We will be the port of call for complaints'? This was actually quite a significant point in the early stages of this debate. It was certainly supported by the industry that the ABA be the first port of call for dealing with those complaints. It is now a little more vague as a result of your answers than it was before.

If one strips away most of the pejorative rhetoric, there is not much left, but let me simply make the point again that until the legislation is in place there is no basis on which to make final decisions. It is utterly 
 normal practice to spell out the matters that will be addressed and the bodies that will be established once the legislation is in place.</para></talk.start><para>As Senator Brown rightly points out, a community advisory body will be established `to monitor material, operate a "hotline" to receive complaints about illegal material and pass this information to the ABA and police authorities, and advise the public about options'. Quite clearly, the ABA remains the formal port of call. The community advisory body, along the lines of NetWatch, is simply a mechanism for having a bit more of a consumer friendly approach about it. It will provide the opportunity for ordinary citizens to be involved rather than simply bureaucrats manning some body which might as well be in the ABA itself. It also provides, I think, an additional and helpful means of ensuring that community concerns are properly addressed. So I do not think there is any doubt in the minds of consumers about what we are doing. I have not heard the industry raise any concerns about this matter at all. As far as I am concerned, they all see the virtue of this approach and, given that we have already provided the funding in the budget, all that now remains is for you to support that appropriation and we will have the necessary wherewithal to set about establishing the necessary structures.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>5350</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I get the distinct feeling that if I ask more than one question, as Senator Lundy has done, I might cop it. However, I will take that risk. I am going to ask the minister again, because this is based on Senator Lundy's questions too, as to what the nature of this community based organisation is. In dealing with similar pieces of legislation I recall, for example, the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust Fund where a community body was set up to overview—or at least to report to the minister or give comment to the minister, powerless and toothless as it turned out to be—the distribution of those funds across the country. The amendment that was adopted there had the set-up of the committee—where the representatives of the committee were coming from. So that important body helped the consideration of senators as to 
 whether they were going to support the legislation at the end of the day or not.</para></talk.start><para>I think Senator Lundy is quite right here. We are being asked to support something of a pig in a poke. We are being asked to support a committee that we do not know the make-up of. We do not know how the government is going to establish it. We do not know whether the government is going to simply go around and seek a group of people who are feeling censorious about issues or whether we are going to see a committee of free thinkers. A community based organisation is one that reflects community views. It is a pretty difficult thing to do. I think the committee could be helping the minister if he had a proposal before us and we could comment on that. I would certainly feel much more secure about the process which is afoot here if the minister was outlining how he is going to ensure that it would in fact be a community based organisation and would not be a selection of people who have a particular point of view that ends up not reflecting what the community thinks at all.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>5351</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not know to what extent some senators do not want to understand this, but we are very much concerned to ensure that the community is properly involved in this process, that it is not simply a top-down bureaucratic structure that they have to live with whether they like it or not.

You might not like it, Senator Lundy. It suits your purpose as an opposition to pretend that somehow there are perfect models that should be identified down to the last degree, but there are not. Otherwise I do not know why you are shaking your head, because what we have done in this legislation is to spell out our determination to fully involve the community in this process.

That is what got you into trouble at the last election, basically, having that sort of negative approach. But it does not in any shape or form detract from legislation that commits a government to being very specific in terms of community consultation. If we do not deliver the goods, then you can quite rightly criticise us when the time comes.

You have a go at the opposition because we raise concerns about the lack of specificity in what your consultation mecha 
 nisms are going to be in the establishment of the NetWatch committees. Don't you think that, having regard to your record as a government and your winding back of just about every mechanism that has existed in Australian society, there is some degree of distrust on our part about your commitment and your ability to actually deliver a genuine consultative mechanism? I think that is a fair and reasonable point to make at this stage in the debate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With respect to your general comments about NetWatch, it is a little rich also to expect the community who are listening to this debate to continually have to backtrack over your rhetoric to find out whether or not you are actually using international models. Yes, there are plenty to actually look at to see how various countries are trying to tackle this, although I make the point once again that none have trod the legislative path that you are seeking to tread. How about some consistency coming into it from your rhetoric? How about some consistency in the messages you are trying to put across? It would be refreshing indeed for this committee to be able to proceed through this debate on the basis of at least your coming clean on a whole series of issues where so far you have resorted to provocative, emotive rhetoric—and I do not want to go through that because I think that only perpetuates the situation of all the dreadful reasons why we need, in your view, to proceed with this legislation. You need to actually have a look at the exact mechanisms that are put in place and to remove whatever degree of ambiguity you possibly can. I do not believe that has happened to date. Unfortunately, it will mean that, as we move through this debate, gradually the picture you are trying to paint with this bill will become fuzzier and fuzzier, and that benefits no-one.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>5352</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also have a couple of issues to pursue arising out of this discussion on NetWatch.

 flesh out the composition and the detail of that committee and thought it appropriate that that be done only after you had consulted with the industry. That goes to one of the key points that the opposition has been making all along. One would have thought that if community awareness and community empowerment were going to be one of the tiers of regulation, supervision and surveillance—surveillance is probably too strong, but regulation and supervision—in a policy approach to this issue, it would have been appropriate that consultation concerning that committee had occurred prior to the bill being tabled and going through the Senate committee.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">LUNDY</name><name role="display">Senator Lundy</name></talker><para>—That would mean they would have had to think about social policy.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>—That is right, Senator Lundy.

But I do have two serious issues to raise with you, Minister. Presumably, once this committee consisting of community citizens, activists or whatever from around Australia who represent particular points of view is established, it is going to be making some sorts of threshold decisions. When members of the community, parents or aggrieved citizens think a matter is over the top, offensive or illegal and should not be available, they will make the complaint to this body, NetWatch. Presumably, that committee then makes threshold decisions. Is there worth to this complaint? Is this complainant a nutter with nothing better to do than ring up NetWatch and involve it in things that do not really matter?</para></talk.start></continue><para>I presume that it is going to have some sort of threshold decision making ability: yes, there is substance to this complaint; yes, we think that prima facie it raises serious issues in respect of offensive material; and, yes, it requires referral on to the relevant agency, the ABA. Alternatively, is it simply intended to be a post office box where the complaints go and get bundled up at the end of the week and referred on to the ABA for appropriate action? Do you envisage NetWatch having that threshold role of filtering out real complaints from complaints that might otherwise be characterised as nonsense? That is the first issue I ask you to address, Minister.</para><para>Secondly, in the estimates process—and I see Ms Holthuyzen over there in the advisers box—we had a discussion on the components of the $1.9 million allocated to operational costs. My memory is that Ms Holthuyzen advised us that the government anticipated an extra five staff being employed. Is she shaking her head? My memory is that someone advised us in the estimates process that an extra five persons were going to be hired as part of the administration framework of this act and that those persons were going to be seconded from within the organisation and that they would be, for want of a better description, multiskilled—they could receive complaints, follow them up, do some policy analysis, write advice and all of those types of things. Minister, is this NetWatch going to have a secretariat? Will it be staffed or are those additional five persons allowed for in the $1.9 million going to be part of the support mechanisms for this community organisation?</para><para>Unless I am wrong, and I stand to be corrected, there was no suggestion in the estimates process that the five staff with a budget of around $¼ million per annum were going to be involved in this type of community liaison and involvement role. They were essentially policy people—middle to senior level officials within the department carrying out those sorts of tasks. Minister, so that we do not waste too much time, could you advise us whether NetWatch is going to have that threshold role of filtering out complaints from members of the community, what its staffing 
 structure will be and whether that staffing is going to be only those five additional persons discussed in the estimates process?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>5353</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The advisory body will have a range of functions, but it will not be there as a filter. It will not be making threshold decisions in the sense of arbitrarily deciding whether a complaint is legitimate. It will be a point of reference. It will generally channel people in the direction of the ABA. To the extent that people might want advice about whether something is likely to offend against the classification regime, then I suppose there will always be levels of informal advice offered, but if people want a proper response they will go through the ABA and normal processes will follow. We do not envisage this as being a bunch of community activists.

It appears to the opposition that the amendment attempts to make a somewhat ridiculous assumption that there is somehow a difference between an ordinary email and an email posted to a newsgroup. The provision in the bill relating to Internet content already covers the instances where newsgroup content becomes Internet content. It details that such content must be (a) kept on a data storage device and (b) accessed or available for access using an Internet carriage service. Arguably, it is only once the email has been incorporated into such an archive that it would fall under such a provision. The express attempt to divide or delineate between an ordinary email and one that is destined for a newsgroup is therefore, in our view, irrelevant. It only adds to the confusion caused by the original failure to expressly indicate whether emails and newsgroups were incorporated into the definition of online content.</para><para>So ordinary emails are outside the bill but emails to a newsgroup, which are archived and available for public access, are caught by the bill. We do not understand why the government has attempted to bring in this division. We do not understand its consequences, and we would ask the minister to explain the difference in substance between communication between two persons via ordinary email and an email between two persons where the recipient archives it via a newsgroup. We do not understand that difference and we would ask the government to give us a fair amount of detail as to why it seeks this difference, why it draws this distinction, what is being sought to be achieved or what mischief is attempting to be remedied. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>5356</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The mischief is clearly the offensive material and the way in which that is normally accessed.

If that is a source of offensive material which is then excluded from the ambit of the legislation, it would seem to be a very easy way of circumventing the legislative intent.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>5356</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the minister for that explanation, but if the email is received, stored and accessed, isn't it caught by the bill anyway?

Whilst I acknowledge the sentiment that we are trying to protect minors in this country from undesirable material, once you enter this area of what constitutes public and private communication then you are dealing with a medium that extends far beyond the notion of what we used to be able to consider as a private communication via a phone call into an area now where an email constitutes a private communication. You have already spoken about how that, in your view, is worthy of exemption and you have identified that in your amendments.</para></talk.start><para>If that is the case, I would like to point out a few technical issues that highlight further inconsistencies and inaccuracies in your treatment of email, both in the general and in the specific senses. First of all, it is a complete misnomer, and indeed a technical inaccuracy, to use a definition of `storage' or `archiving' of email as a means by which to preclude it from the bill. Right here in Parliament House every email that is shunted between the range of LANs within the offices and the wider area network that constitutes the parliamentary network is stored on a server and is available for perusal through a criminal investigation. Is this not the case with email that traverses through ISPs? It is not publicly available, that is true, but to use a definition of `storage' as a determinant in this bill is, I think, technically incorrect.</para><para>The other issue is that of what constitutes public or private communication. If I choose to forward an email to a group of people that I select out of my contact database, does that constitute a mailing list of my choice? Does that mean that that particular email that I choose to circulate amongst people who want to receive it constitutes a mailing list and is therefore subject to the regime that you are seeking to implement?</para><para>It is a very fine line between that type of personal mailing list—and that is what they are called in many of the applications—and going to the next stage of organised mailing lists between friends. For example, a group of friends who ski together in winter and use the Internet to communicate. It is a formal mailing list. They use a list server, they organise it properly and they make sure they keep coordinated.</para><para> Then you go to the next step. Perhaps a sports club utilises a mailing list for their membership. They register online, keep track of events online through the web page and use a mailing list to communicate on a regular basis. I have to say I am a member of at least two sports clubs that use precisely this method of communication.</para><para>Is that content going to be subject to the application of this bill? Where is the next layer? Where is this cut-off point where mailing lists become the subject of scrutiny under this legislation? Firstly, how under this legislation are people to raise a complaint about a mailing list? And, secondly, depending on the location of the server of that mailing list—and it could be anywhere—how do the formal take-down notices of private circulated correspondence occur? I would be interested in the minister's explanation of where these cut-off points lie within the definitions he has described.</para><para>I would be very interested to know what advice you have received with respect to the ability for records of personal communications—be it on these more informal or, indeed, more formal types of mailing lists—to actually be taken down or removed from the public record. Why? Because these emails have evidentiary status in a court of law. That has been established for quite some time. Indeed, the mechanisms and the processes that the government has talked so long about but has not, in fact, legislated to date formalise even further the role of email in terms of its status in the eyes of the law.</para><para>How do you apply a take-down notice to something where there is actually a statutory obligation upon those who store it to actually preserve it? Minister, if the issue is one of public access to this material, where do you 
 draw the line on a mailing list as to what constitutes public access and what constitutes a series of private communications amongst two, three or a wider group of people?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>5359</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am just a bit concerned about this amendment.

It would be much more sensible to deal with this change at the same time as introducing the NVE classification because I assume it is to this classification that the legislation will have to operate in future.

I think that is a worthy endeavour because I do recall, Minister, for some time in the early stages of this debate, attempts on your part to try to sidestep the framework put in place—by our Constitution, no less—to provide for a telecommunications power that allowed the Commonwealth to involve itself in the transmission of voice data but not content storage.</para><para>This bill tightens up that distinction and protects Internet service providers from liability with respect to content that is placed on their servers via the technology of the Internet. This is a point that I think is not only recognised in this legislation but this series of technical amendments seek to reinforce it. I would like to put on the record that not only is this direction the correct one but I think we will find that the Internet service providers, with the goodwill that they have shown with their code and development to date, will provide a very cooperative base for developing the complaints mechanisms and responding to the process that the government is putting in place.</para><para>There is a lot of goodwill out there, Minister, and I think you did a lot to undermine and damage that goodwill with the path you set upon.

At the same time, they are arguably the group that have shown the greatest goodwill in cooperating with the government to try to find a worthy outcome. I think the minister should at least, at some point, acknowledge that goodwill shown by the Internet service providers and perhaps even put a little emphasis on acknowledging the flaws in the original draft of the bill and speak some words of support as to why you need to clarify their position.

The bill contains a take-down notice of 24 hours and, as we sat through the Senate select committee inquiry on the issue of 24 hours, it was a recurring complaint of industry that 24 hours was insufficient time. If offensive material has been the subject of complaint and the subject of inquiry by the ABA and, as a result, has been the subject of a take-down order, industry complained to us that 24 hours would be 
 insufficient time for them to properly attend to the lawful command of the ABA.</para><para>The opposition, in considering that issue, came to the view that there was some substance to the complaint of the industry. In particular, as we all now know, this is an industry that is characterised by half a dozen large providers—Telstra Big Pond and the like—a degree of medium sized providers and a significant number of smaller providers. Some of those smaller providers, being so small, are one-person operations or husband and wife operations with one casual or part-time employee. They are not really different or distinct from many new industries. There is a concentration of volume and value at the top, but the barriers to entry are not so high that persons with modest amounts of capital can enter, set up a business, capture a degree of the market and turn their small business into a viable concern.</para><para>Of course, if you are a one-person operation or a husband and wife team or you have only one or two employees, it is not practicable to be in attendance at your business all of the time. I think it is fair comment that a lot of small business operators in a lot of industries do work excessive hours—12, 13 and 14 hours a day, seven days a week, are not untypical and, indeed, a range of surveys increasingly demonstrate that is becoming the norm in our society. I think it is fair to take the evidence at face value that a lot of the smaller operators in this growing industry are already working excessive hours and it is not unreasonable that they have some evening time and some of the weekend to themselves.</para><para>So the problem would arise that, if the ABA—acting lawfully and properly, pursuant to complaint and investigation—should issue one of the various take-down notices in the bill and deliver and serve it properly on the ISP, the operator of the ISP may well be away from his place of business for 24 or 48 hours and hence unable to comply with the directive of the ABA. That is obviously going to occur and it would be silly for us to pretend that it is not going to occur. Indeed, the ABA might be going about its business quite properly in issuing the take-down notice at midday on a Friday and serving and deliver 
 ing it in the early afternoon, but the operator of the ISP might not access the notice, for no fault of his or her own, until opening time of business on Monday. That is a result, but I am sure it is not one that the government wants. It is certainly not a result that the opposition would countenance in any way. It is just an example of silly regulation that is not appropriate or necessary.</para><para>The government has taken on board some of those comments, because our amendment seeks to extend that period of notice, the take-down notice, the period of compliance by the ISP operator, from 24 hours to 48 hours. We considered going out longer, but I think there has to be a line drawn and, whilst a person can legitimately be away from his business for 24 or 36 hours, in the ISP industry you are in a service industry and you do have to comply with the demands of your subscribers, of consumers, and 48 hours struck us as being a reasonable position.</para><para>The government has come back with an alternative proposition that the period of notice, the take-down period, be extended from 24 hours out to 6 p.m. on the following day of business. For example, if a notice was served at nine o'clock on a Thursday morning, the ISP operator would have until 6 p.m. on the Friday to take down the notice—certainly two full days of business, perhaps not 48 hours. I think it is fair to characterise the government's proposed amendment as a serious reaction to the legitimate complaints made by those witnesses in the industry to the IT committee inquiry.</para><para>The opposition regards it as a halfway house. We think, all things being considered, that extending the period from 24 hours out to 48 hours is a preferable solution. It avoids any grey periods, everyone knows the outside boundaries and they have to comply. So our position is that we will press on with the position of 48 hours and see what emerges from the comments of the other parties.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>5367</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was keen to hear the arguments put by both the government and the opposition on the amendments specifically in relation to the take-down notices. 
 I think the government's amendments indeed are a reaction to evidence presented before the Senate select committee's inquiry and it is a not unreasonable response to that evidence. While I understand Senator Bishop's concerns that it is not necessarily a 48-hour period as outlined in the opposition amendment, I am quite attracted to the government's definition of `business day' and also ruling out a Saturday or a Sunday or a public holiday in the place concerned. At this stage I am inclined to support the government amendments, unless there are issues that I have failed to acknowledge in them.

Our approach allows the flexibility that is required. In a normal working week, it would be less than 48 hours, as it should be, because action ought to be taken as promptly as possible. But where it is reasonable not to expect people to be at work then it takes account of those working arrangements.

 impact on small Internet service providers. These amendments have come forward in direct response to evidence received through the IT select committee about the burden imposed upon those small businesses and their ability to comply. It is relevant in this debate because of the relationship between small ISPs and larger ISPs and their operation in what is an intensely competitive environment. If this bill imposes restrictions on the smaller ISPs, you are actually putting in place a mechanism that will somehow thwart or impact upon their ability to compete in an environment. Obviously, larger ISPs do have 24-hour shifts operating to keep their businesses up and running, so their ability to comply at short notice is far greater. It would be with the smaller ISPs, which are one-, two- or three-person operations without that round-the-clock staffing of their technology, where this problem would arise.</para></talk.start><para>I am not sure if I will have the opportunity to touch on this issue later in the debate, but the difference in the impact on small and large ISPs with respect to the various provisions of this bill should be of major concern to the government and has been of major concern to the opposition and other parties. With regard to its representation in the form of the amendments, as my colleague Senator Bishop said, we needed to do something, and it is interesting to see that the government has also seen it necessary to do it.</para><para>Once again it indicates the lack of thought and lack of preparation in the original drafting of this legislation that once again the government neglected to consider the issues confronting small businesses which are out there on the ground and subject to the provisions of this bill, if it is in fact to be supported in this place. Why is it important not to put in place legislation which will undermine the ability of these small Internet service providers to operate in the marketplace? It is important because they offer a range of services, a diverse service. If you support the notion of having some consumer choice and the presentation of a range of methodologies to end users on how to resolve their particular concern about online content, it is absolutely essential that there be a vast range of Internet 
 service providers from which they can actually choose to source their service.</para><para>Earlier in the day we had quite a lengthy debate about the various competing filter technologies. What if there is a complete consolidation of ISPs, facilitated by legislation that puts pressure on the smaller ones and puts them out of business? What if the filtering options that subsequently become available in the market are presented to the community in a way where diversification is reduced and consumer choice becomes severely curtailed? I suppose these are esoteric concepts and a lot of what ifs, but this government, within their rhetoric on many other pieces of legislation before this place, probably most notably one recently in relation to unfair dismissals, consistently emphasise the impact on small business. Yet with this particular bill it became an irrelevancy, and the concerns of small business are only now being addressed in the context of a range of amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>5368</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I might just indicate that as far as the actual business hours of large ISPs, which might effectively be open 24 hours a day, are concerned, they would not automatically have the benefit of 6 p.m. the next business day.

The opposition put, through its questions to the witnesses, a number of questions on notice arising out of this matter and foreshadowed that we might have a problem with respect to clause 37(2). We believe the reference to clause 4(3) on its own is too narrow. In response to questions, the witnesses advised that the matters set out in paragraph (b), `technically feasible, commercially viable and cost effective', were appropriate matters for consideration in a discussion of reasonable steps.</para><para>Indeed, I have a memory of a lengthy discussion with Mr Granger on what was meant by reasonable steps. He outlined to the committee the sorts of things that he thought were appropriate to be considered by the ABA and what was comprehended by reasonable steps. The examining senators had to put a series of propositions to Mr Granger as to 
 the relevance of commercially feasible, commercial contracts and a range of technical issues. After time, Mr Granger did respond. The conclusion of that evening's discussion was not particularly satisfactory and Mr Granger undertook to go away and consider the position of the agency and respond in writing to the opposition. That question was properly responded to in due course. When the response came and we considered it, it was difficult to argue against the proposition outlined by Mr Granger.</para><para>The phrase `technical feasibility, commercial viability and cost effective' has been running around now for a couple of months. The reason we regard this as a matter worth contesting, as an issue of significance, is that by analogy if you allocate a sufficient degree of capital any enterprising person can grow strawberries in the Arctic. You just need the heating, the protection, the water and the soil. It can all be imported if cost is not an issue. It can be achieved with the required degree of capital. It is possible to mandate or to say that reasonable steps include million dollar technology, but we do not believe that to be the intent of the government.</para><para>There has been no suggestion by the government in the committee process or in negotiations over the various amendments that it is their intention to mandate particularly expensive forms of technology for small-end ISPs. It would certainly be possible to mandate it. The effect would be to put small-end ISPs out of business because they do not have the capital to purchase the technology. If they did, it would probably achieve the purpose of the government. The opposition does not believe that is the intent of the government and, accordingly, the amendments we put seek to overcome those sorts of issues and problems. We are keen to ensure that the act sets out an effective code for the ABA to have proper regard to in the discussion in clause 37. They are the thoughts that have been motivating us and why we have sought at this stage to have the phrase `technically feasible, commercially viable and cost effective' included. They are appropriate matters for consideration and we urge the government to support our amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>5371</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will indicate the government's attitude. We have our own amendment, to be considered immediately after this one, that will address the issues of technically feasible and commercially viable. We use the expression `technical and commercial feasibility of taking the steps' and then we simply reiterate the reference to section 4(3).</para></talk.start><para>The great concern we have in relation to that opposition amendment is that it goes on and adds a clause which would effectively allow service providers to avoid being caught by the legislation because reasonable steps could well be regarded as including the fact that the ISP has taken steps to inform end users about what filter devices are available. In other words, the whole purpose of the exercise is to ensure that they put systems in place irrespective of whether parental education programs are undertaken. We do not want to see a means of avoiding all of that by adding in an additional ground of reasonableness which may well tip the balance in favour of giving them an exemption largely because they have embraced self-regulation. That is not what is intended here.</para><para>We certainly encourage ISPs and others to draw the attention of parents and end users to the availability of filter technology, but this is not an either/or arrangement—it ought to be both. The great danger we see in the opposition's amendment is that it would allow people to slide around what we think is a reasonable test of technical feasibility and commercial affordability into areas of whether they have taken reasonable steps to promote self-regulation. Whilst we hope and encourage them to do that, it should not be a basis on which they would be exempt from take-down notices.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>5371</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is one of those crunch points in this particular legislative debate. What we are discussing here is the issue of do we or do we not mandate the provision of filtering technologies at ISP level. It is very interesting to hear the minister slide around, in his own words, about whether 
 or not they are actually moving down a path of mandating filtering technologies at ISP level. The government's amendments that the minister has foreshadowed do mention the words `technical and commercial feasibility', but I would argue that they have gone no further in progressing the position than the minister's weasel words during public discussion and as recorded in a range of press releases and media commentary.</para></talk.start><para>The minute the minister realised that his promise of making the Net safe for children was completely undermined by the fact contained in the CSIRO report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Blocking content on the Internet: a technical perspective</inline>, he adjusted his rhetoric to say, `Technical feasibility includes this qualification of what is actually technically and commercially viable.' The conclusion of that report I mentioned goes to the heart of the matter and says, in the first instance, `No, it is not technically feasible to achieve the blocking of content or the filtering of content.' Then the minister, through the National Office of Information Economy, sought an additional opinion from the CSIRO, which did serve the purpose of helping the minister adjust his rhetoric in relation to what was technically feasible and what was not. It went like this: the minister said, `Yes, it is technically feasible to implement filtering technology, but it is not going to be 100 per cent effective.'</para><para>So what is technically feasible and what is not? What we know is that it is technically feasible, because the products actually exist, to implement some sort of filtering regime at a range of levels including the ISP level and certainly including the ability of the end user to install on their own PC some form of filtering application. So we know it is technically feasible. But what it is not is effective. It is not effective because it cannot provide the guarantees of which the minister has been so quick to try to assure the public.</para><para>So here we have an amendment in which the government are arguing they are putting qualifications of technical and commercial feasibility. It is an interesting step. I do not think it changes their position one iota, whereas the opposition's amendment identi 
 fies the substance of the issue—that is, we do not support the mandating of filtering technologies because they are not effective, albeit they may exist and in some respects, depending on your definition, may be technically feasible. The opposition's amendments go a step further and, once again, to the heart of the matter—it is empowerment of end users. The third part of our amendment states:</para><para>(c)	 whether the particular steps enable end users to be better informed about the use of, or assisted in the actual use of, filter devices for self-regulation of Internet content.</para><para>This is a crunch point in this legislation, as I said. It is about putting in place a mechanism that encourages Internet service providers to tell their clients about what options are available to them in the first instance. Surely this is one of the most useful mechanisms for educating the community—not trying to pretend that you are not mandating filtering technology, not trying to pretend that you are qualifying it on commercial grounds, but stating unequivocally that part of what constitutes reasonable steps is the proactive presentation to potential Internet users of the range of options that are available to them. They are not predetermining a filtered system, but our amendments best reflect what is the most effective way to enable the community or parents—let's be specific about this; it is about parents protecting their children from undesirable content—to have the power, the capability, the knowledge, the confidence and the skills to put in place something that suits them.</para><para>Again, this is a question of diversity. If this provision is not included with respect to what constitutes reasonable steps, what options are parents going to have to make informed choices about the range of filtering technologies? This actually requires or identifies particular steps being taken by ISPs to promote differential services. It is interesting that in that first report by the CSIRO the whole notion of differential services was one of the key recommendations. It does go to the point I raised earlier about the importance of having a diversity of options available for the filtering of content for people who choose to go down that path.</para><para>It is important that users of the Internet also have a choice not to filter their content. More than anything else, the government's plan lends itself to not allowing Internet users in Australia the option of choosing not to filter their content. I am concerned that, despite this qualification identified in the government's amendment, that option will not be available to some people, perhaps inadvertently because they will sign on with an Internet service provider that offers a filtered feed service and for whatever reason—perhaps lack of awareness or lack of communication by the service provider—people will get a filtered feed in terms of the content they can access and they will not be aware of it. The issue of end user empowerment once again comes to the fore. I believe that only with this additional item contained within our definition of what constitutes reasonable steps are we at least trying to steer this bill back in the right direction and putting the emphasis on end user control of content.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>5372</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Can I simply respond to that by saying that Senator Lundy—I presume, unintentionally—fundamentally misunderstands the whole concept of what is being put forward here.

I do not know whether it has currency at branch meetings, but it does not mean much in the real world.

What this is about is what should constitute reasonable steps in the absence of a registered code. Under our proposal, reasonable steps would be constituted if you have had regard to the matters set out in subsection 4(3) and the technical and commercial feasibility of taking the steps. The opposition has gone a crucial 
 stage further and said that a basis for saying a provider has taken all reasonable steps is if it has undertaken some sort of end user education campaign. That is an entirely different proposition to saying, `Are you in favour of end user empowerment?' What you are saying is that it may be sufficient for you to be exempted because you have got some education program going. That is not what this is about at all, and you ought to be absolutely clear on what you are saying.</para><para>Your amendment takes the matter a whole stage further to the point where you will effectively allow people to be in a situation where it is technically feasible and commercially affordable but, nonetheless, they will be immune from action because they can demonstrate that they have taken particular steps to ensure that end users are better informed. That is not the basis of this whole approach. It might be your preferred escape route. I have heard what you say on a regular basis and you are not interested in regulating the Internet at all; you have a preference exclusively for information and education campaigns.

 solution—but I do not know if we should be introducing the filtering devices into this part of the bill.

I share that concern. The Democrats have pointed out in the chamber during this debate and in the committee report our concerns about those technologies for a range of reasons.

Senator Alston alleges that, by including paragraph (c) in our amendment, the opposition is somehow or other making the reasonable steps process ineffective and easier to achieve and that we have effectively destroyed the operation of this critical clause within the bill. That is a plain and obvious misrepresentation of the opposition's position.</para></talk.start><para>If you look at the three paragraphs—(a), (b) and (c)—you will find at the end of paragraph (a) and at the end of paragraph (b) the word `and'. So it is (a) and (b) and (c). If the word `and' was not there and the word `or' was there—so it was (a) and (b) or (c)—the minister would be right. But by using the word `and' at the end of paragraph (b)—so it reads (a) and (b) and (c)—it includes all the reasonable steps identified by the government and, in paragraph (b), whether those steps are technically feasible, commercially viable and cost-effective. Where did we obtain those words? We obtained those words from the government's own explanatory memorandum and the minister's press statements. So on those two paragraphs, we are on all-fours with the government. In paragraph (c), all we offer is the option of ISPs advertising, educating and informing.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>5374</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

When I first became a senator in May 1997, one of the first tasks I undertook was visiting all my patron seats. When talking to local constituents I asked them all the same question: what is the one most important issue for your area? The answer that dominated in Corio and Lalor was `upgrade the Princes Highway'. During my term I have made regular trips to the Bellarine Peninsula and, without fail, every time I go there I am asked the same question: when is the Geelong Road going to be upgraded?</para></talk.start><para>The city of Geelong and the surrounding areas are of increasing national importance. Tonight I wish to highlight some of the worthy results that have been achieved in Geelong through the active involvement of the City of Geelong council and local state members of parliament. Included in these is the addition of an $11.4 million watersports complex. The Central Activities Area Revitalisation is a project involved in the greening of Geelong to promote aesthetic appreciation of the area to further induce retailers to choose this city. Similarly, there is $30 million for the waterfront project. No-one who has been to Geelong could fail but be impressed by the regeneration of the harbourside and waterside down there. More recently and very importantly Qantas has announced a $30 million investment with its intention to locate its Boeing 747 maintenance hangar at Avalon, which will bring a much needed industry boost and more jobs into the local area.</para><para>The city of Geelong provides Victoria with one of its greatest industrial centres. The area has car manufacturing plants, glass works, petroleum refining, paper mills, dairy farming and clothing production, to name but a few. Geelong is located on Corio Bay with a busy port linked via the national standard gauge 
 rail. These all contribute to make Geelong and Corio one of Victoria's most important industrial centres. However, to reach its full potential, this area needs to be connected to Melbourne and the only road that provides this connection is the Princes Highway West or, as it is better known, the Geelong Road. The electorate of Lalor supports several important industries such as the petrochemical and aerospace industries, as well as a saltworks and market gardens. The highway runs through the south-east of the electorate and, once again, it is the main link between many of the industries and the city of Melbourne.</para><para>One of my first speeches to the Senate was regarding the upgrading of the Princes Freeway West to national highway status. I urged back then, as I still urge now, that Geelong Road's importance be given prominence. Why is the state of this road such an issue of great concern to all the people who live in these two electorates? A look at the facts is illustrating. Between 1990 and December 1998, 86 people have died on the road. The total number of crash victims exceeds 6,000, with 1,000 of them being injured as a result.</para><para>The journey is not a long one compared with many roads in Victoria—it is around an hour from Melbourne to Geelong in non-peak traffic. But, despite this short distance, the number of white crosses that mark deaths on the road has kept increasing. Having driven down the road regularly, I have witnessed serious accidents and I am ever grateful that I am not required to drive along it on a daily basis. However, thousands of Victorians are compelled to drive on the highway daily. In some sections it is estimated that the road carries approximately 132,000 vehicles per day—they have no choice. The road is not dangerous because of particularly vicious corners, crests, dips or hills; the main danger comes from the vast carriage of traffic travelling on far too few lanes.</para><para>Putting aside the high risk and accidents that frequently occur, we must also consider the other effects of the resulting delays. The people in the cities of Melbourne and Geelong are suffering routine economic hardship because of the delays caused by the numerous accidents and the resulting traffic jams along 
 this road. These accident-induced delays are above and beyond the usual congestion of peak-hour traffic.</para><para>Geelong Road is a road of great economic significance to Victoria, and its upgrading will result in further growth for the Victorian economy, as I outlined in my first speech to the Senate. I am heartened by the news that the Victorian government is willing to contribute $118 million towards the upgrading of the road. I, along with many other Victorians, welcomed this announcement. The estimated expenditure to upgrade the road and change its classification is just over $200 million, according to VicRoads. So we are only some of the way there.</para><para>Tonight I would again like to add my personal plea that any further reviews to Victoria's federal road funding arrangements give urgent consideration to the Princes freeway upgrade. The federal government, in a prudent and responsible budget delivered just two weeks ago, has put aside $195 million of additional funding to the national highway and Roads of National Importance (RONI) programs. These include worthy projects such as the Goulburn Valley Highway, maintenance of the Hume Highway and improving safety on Victoria's national highway network, including further duplication of the Calder Highway between Melbourne and Bendigo. I hope that future reviews will see the merits of the Geelong Road upgrade.</para><para>No-one can visit the dynamic city of Geelong and environs without being impressed by the resilient spirit, dogged determination and optimistic vision of the local people and the councillors of the city of Geelong. My term as a senator for Victoria is due to end soon and I am disappointed that I will be leaving this place with the knowledge that the Geelong Road is still in a fairly deplorable state. I have made recent representations to my colleagues the federal Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Costello, and the Prime Minister on this issue. An upgrade of this grisly stretch of road will bring positive safety, social and economic benefits not only for the people of Geelong but also for all of the people who rely on this road either directly or indirectly.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Questionable Trading Practices: National Facsimile Directory</title><page.no>5375</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>5375</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to draw attention to a practice which I think is, to put it mildly, questionable and I think bordering on illegal perhaps and a rort. I go back in history to last year when my office received a phone call from a group calling themselves the National Facsimile Directory. On the phone their first approach to us was to ask whether my staffer would confirm that this wording was the appropriate wording for the entry that they were going to put in the directory. We do not operate like that in taking phone calls—and there was money attached—and they were told to put it in writing.</para></talk.start><para>We then received a one-sheet facsimile saying `proof wording'. When we looked at what was written, it outlined my name, the street address, the phone number and the fax number, and listed us as a political organisation. All of the information contained in that was nothing more than was available in the <inline font-style="italic">White Pages</inline> and, for that matter, the <inline font-style="italic">Yellow Pages</inline> that Telstra puts out each year—for nothing, I might add or, if it is paid for, it is paid by the Department of Finance and Administration.</para><para>After we received the second facsimile last year, I wrote back across the top of it that if they were a reputable organisation they would know that this was not the correct practice to adopt, and I did not hear any more. I thought it had all gone away. But in April of this year I received—we have received several—a phone call again asking whether this was the correct wording for our entry in the National Facsimile Directory. Fortunately, my senior staff member took the phone call and said, `Put it in writing.' Again, we got the usual one-page blurb from them with no more information than is available on the public record. We ignored that and got a further fax, followed by another fax.</para><para>There is always a price attached to this as well. The price that we were being quoted was something like $640. I actually searched the Internet today and found their directory. Everybody's entry there is about four or five lines long, and it obviously has not been 
 updated since at least before the election because they have listed a number of old departments. I bet the departments do not know they have paid this money. There will be some interesting estimates questions for them.</para><para>They rang—they also adopt a very aggressive phone manner—demanding that we approve the entry there and then, to which none of my staff would agree. I took one of the phone calls and left the person on the other end of the line with no uncertainty as to what I thought of their organisation—that I thought it was a rort, that if they were reputable they would not be doing this, that they would not be undertaking business like this, and that it was not the way I expected a reputable organisation to conduct their business.</para><para>I was advised by this particular person that she would remove my name and my staffers' names from their database. I thought that I had fixed it. But on 14 April we received another note from them with a bold headline saying `Important notice', again addressed to my staff member, advising me that we had not requested inclusion in the entry faxed to them.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Give it to <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair</inline> .</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name></talker><para>—I can say things in the chamber that I cannot say on <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair</inline> .</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McKIERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator McKiernan</name></talker><para>—You can say them, but you can't afford to pay for them.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name></talker><para>—That is probably correct.

She came to me saying, `No, the addresses are different.' But I looked at the telephone numbers, and it was the same 1800 number and the same 1800 fax number. It says that it is also a division of Telecommunications Group Australia—the same ACN, the same email address. I was incensed at this, and I thought I would ring them up and abuse them. I thought, `Blow that. I will go up and talk to Fair Trading.' They are only three doors away from my office.</para></talk.start></continue><para>While I am actually talking to Fair Trading a second facsimile arrives, again with `Important notice' written on it.

I have to say that when we looked at the Internet site today, only two of my colleagues are listed there, and they have failed to note on the listing that the 1800 numbers only work in the state in which they reside. So I have passed that on to Fair Trading for them to look at.</para><para>I then decided to ask the Parliamentary Library to do a company search for me of Mr Des John O'Keefe with those ACNs. It appears he is currently a director and the company secretary of the Australian Computer Awareness Association. He is a previous Principal Executive Officer of Australian Yearbook Publishing Pty Ltd, which ceased 
 to exist on 7 July 1995 and is deregistered. He is a previous director of Australian Purchasing and Tender Service Pty Ltd.

That is deregistered.</para><para>In the organisations on this list, he is noted as being a current director of Telecommunications Group Australia Pty Ltd, which position he was appointed to on 4 July 1997. That company has strike-off action in progress. My understanding from the information that the Library gave me after their conversations with the ASIC is that this indicates that this company has failed to lodge all the financial statements and reports that are due by the correct dates. They have been written to by the ASIC, asking them to comply by a certain date, after which time, if they fail to comply, they will be deregistered. So they are obviously on very shaky ground. So there are two strike-off actions in progress. Australian Business Publishing Pty Ltd is deregistered, Australian Industrial Marketing Pty Ltd is deregistered. Strike-off action is in progress in relation to Ibiza Queensland Pty Ltd, and Australian Business Publishing Pty Ltd again is noted as being deregistered.</para><para>It is quite apparent that the gentleman that is running this organisation has a very poor history in business. His actions and attitudes and the things he is expecting his staff to do are not appropriate from members of business in this country.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Rural Finance Summit</title><page.no>5377</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>5377</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When the government was elected in 1996 we undertook as a priority to hold a National Rural Finance Summit. This was aimed at addressing some of the pressing financial problems facing the farming community, based on a record of high interest rates, high inflation, low commodity prices and the disastrous drought of the early 1990s, which probably stands as the worst on record. From the summit's outcomes the government determined basically to do three things. Firstly, we determined to provide farmers with the capacity to plan for economic and seasonal downturns in the future. Secondly, we determined to provide where possible for farming families to have the same access to the welfare provided to other Australians in times of a loss of income through severe drought or misadventure. This resulted in the introduction, among other things, of family farm restart and assistance in generational transfers of farming land. Thirdly, the government made a commitment that there was a vision for agriculture in this country, not just for traditional broadacre farming operations and production of commodities but for everything ranging from grazing to intensive horticulture.</para></talk.start><para>In line with these three intentions, I want to bring to the attention of the Senate tonight three direct initiatives that came out of the National Rural Finance Summit which are important to Australian farmers and to the local communities on which they rely. Probably the most important was the introduction of the Farm Management Deposits Scheme. This was an entirely new scheme and legislation for the scheme passed through both houses of parliament before the election. Farm management deposit regulations were tabled in the parliament at the end of the last sitting period in December and were on the table for 15 sitting days. That  period concluded at the end of March 1999, so the scheme has now been operating since the end of March. The previous Income Equalisation Deposits Scheme and the Farm Management Bonds Scheme were considered inflexible by many producers. Extensive consultation, both with 
 rural industries and the finance sector, including the Australian Bankers Association, resulted in the revised scheme.</para><para>Farm management deposits will be available commercially through those financial institutions which meet the government's prudential requirements for deposit taking institutions. This is expected to include banks, credit unions and building societies, but not pastoral houses. Not all of those eligible institutions will offer the farm management deposits. For those that choose to, it provides an opportunity to include those facilities as part of their commercial product range, offering farmers choice and flexibility in their commercial decisions.</para><para>Depositors must be recognised as primary producers by the Australian Taxation Office. Taxation benefits from deposits are available only to producers with off-farm income not exceeding $50,000 in the year of deposit. The maximum amount of deposits held by a taxpayer cannot exceed $300,000. Depositors must be individual taxpayers. The scheme is not available to partnerships, trusts or companies, although individual taxpayers of a partnership or beneficiaries of a trust may make deposits. Interest will be paid on the full amount of the farm management deposit, and that is probably the most striking difference between this and the previous arrangements. Taxation benefits will be available only on deposits held in excess of 12 months.</para><para>Not all primary producers will be able to afford access to this scheme—perhaps later they will be able to do so—but for those who can it does provide a very big advantage. Although the scheme has not been operating very long, one bank predicts that the new Farm Management Deposits Scheme could attract $1 billion of deposits in the next three to five years, given a reasonable run of seasons and prices. That is a big potential plus for primary producers and to rural communities.</para><para>The second matter that came out of the National Rural Finance Summit was the introduction of the Agricultural Finance Forum. The Agricultural Finance Forum is a direct outcome of the summit, and was announced as part of Agriculture—Advancing 
 Australia. It is a package to promote better communications and regular consultation between the farm sector, financiers and government on rural financial issues. The forum includes representatives from major financial institutions, pastoral houses, credit union associations, the National Farmers Federation, the Rural Counselling Program, farm consultants, business people, accountants and government. The parliamentary secretary who is in the chamber at the moment, Senator Judith Troeth, presently chairs that forum.</para><para>The first forum meeting was held on 20 November 1997, and subsequent meetings were held on 19 February, 18 June, 18 November 1998 and, quite recently, on 2 March 1999. I think Senator Troeth chaired that meeting at the Wimmera field days. The next meeting is scheduled for July 1999.</para><para>The forum's terms of reference are to: investigate ways to increase the finance and rural sectors' understanding of the implications of a deregulated market where there is rapidly changing technology and fluctuating farm incomes; identify new and improved financial products and services, including commercialised farm management deposits—about which I have just spoken—and encourage their usage; examine codes of practice and mediation processes between financial institutions and rural clients; and examine ways to promote improved business skills, including in relation to risk management, succession planning and farm business structures.</para><para>Some primary producers out there might feel the forum is just another opportunity for a lot of words, but these things are important. Communications and education are important to everybody trying to run a business, and that is especially so in the farming community, who frequently do not have access to the range of financial products that many other small business people have. It is part of the tranche of advantages that we have put in place—and there are others that we have and will put in place—that will make their job of running their farm businesses easier.</para><para>The last aspect of a range of things that came out of the National Rural Financial Summit was our continuing commitment to 
 provide financial counselling by the Financial Counselling Service. This service is part of the Australia-Advancing Agriculture package under the Rural Communities Program. The Financial Counselling Service, through the Rural Communities Program, provides rural community groups with Commonwealth grants to contribute towards the cost of employing a financial counsellor and associated administrative costs.</para><para>I think it goes without saying that the nineties produced an enormous need for rural counselling and guaranteed the continuation of this very important program. I think the nineties especially have left many farmers very weakened and very chastened by a run of bad seasons and difficult financial circumstances. I think that almost everybody in regional areas really appreciates the very important role that financial counsellors play. I think that some people perhaps had a jaundiced view of independent farmers who previously had withstood everything and were able to handle almost any situation but who, in the nineties, needed assistance from outside. But I think that, in the way it has worked, the Rural Counselling Service has been an enormously helpful aspect of meeting the very difficult structural challenges that the farming community has met.</para><para>The Commonwealth has committed some $11.7 million in funding over a three-year period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2000 for financial counselling services under this program. To date, 72 community groups have had funding approved and some 98 financial counsellors have been employed—a very impressive number. The Rural Communities Program as a whole offers the opportunity for people in rural communities to identify their needs and develop local solutions to meet those needs. Funding is directed towards small rural communities. These communities manage the funding provided and direct their projects to those areas identified by the communities as their highest priority. A further assessment round is currently being completed, and my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald and Minister Vaile will announce further community grants in the near future.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Sport: Soccer</title><page.no>5379</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>5379</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am going to use a few moments of the time of the Senate tonight to indulge myself in one of my passions in life. I also want to tip a bucket, and then I will end on a happier note by handing out some bouquets.</para></talk.start><para>One of the joys in life that I get is watching sport; not participating in it, but watching it. The sport that I enjoy perhaps most of all is soccer, and I am very pleased with the developments that have occurred in Australia in recent years with Australia reaching near world standards in the world game. I want to speak particularly about the phenomenon that is the Perth Glory soccer club. It is a young club—it is only in its third year of participation in the National Soccer League—and this year has been its most successful to date. It gave me great joy during January this year to be able to attend three games. We only won one; nonetheless, it was a magnificent spectacle to be there among the greatest crowd of soccer supporters in Australia.</para><para>Glory attracts an average of 15,000 spectators to each home game at the Perth oval. That attendance is not matched by any other club in Australia, although Northern Spirit, a new club out of Sydney, is going very close to matching Perth Glory.</para><para>I want to reflect very briefly on the events of the last three weeks. I had the great pleasure of being at the second elimination semi-final of the Ericsson Cup at the WACA on Saturday, 8 May. It was the second leg and Perth were playing Adelaide City. There were over 25,000 people at that game—a sell-out at the Western Australian Cricket Association ground. Perth won 2-1 in the second leg, and went on to the minor semi-final at the same ground the following Sunday, 16 May, when they played Marconi out of Sydney, a game which attracted some 27,000 people. It is a record crowd for the National Soccer League of Australia. That brought Perth Glory to the elimination final in Sydney just a couple of days ago at the Marconi Stadium where they played Sydney United in front of a crowd—a very disappointing crowd—of 8,000, almost the capacity of the stadium.</para><para>Unfortunately, Perth lost 2-1 to Sydney United and I must say that the best team won the day. They had luck with them and deserved their victory. I wish them well in the final in Melbourne next week when they play Melbourne.</para><para>What I want to dwell on now is tipping the bucket. Some dreadful incidents occurred during this game. Early in the first half, a firecracker was tossed onto the ground and passed very close to the Perth Glory goalkeeper, Tony Franken, and then exploded. It could have injured that individual or, had it been thrown at a different time when there were more players in the area, it could have injured a number of other people, possibly causing eye injuries.</para><para>There were a number of flares let off in one particular section of the crowd. I personally noticed two going off. I was informed later that police had broken up a crowd disturbance where they had had to use capsicum spray and arrested one offender. I am a bit disappointed that there was only one person arrested. To the best of my knowledge, nobody has been charged with an offence following the game.</para><para>Another huge disappointment to me was the unfurling on two separate occasions of a huge Croatian national flag. The unfurling of nationalistic banners has been banned at soccer games in Australia for a number of years, following provocation between crowds and disturbances, but this happened on two occasions last Sunday. Nationalistic chants were also heard by me on a number of occasions. Again, this has been banned at soccer.</para><para>The most disturbing and unprofessional thing that happened was when an injury occurred to one of the Perth players, Craig Deans. He clashed with another player, got his shoulder dislocated and lay writhing in agony on the ground for a number of minutes when the referee authorised a stretcher to be brought to the ground, but no stretcher turned up. A stretcher was not available at the second most important game of the National Soccer League in Australia. In agony, that player had to be dragged to his feet and walk with assistance off the field. Then we heard over the loudspeaker a call for a doctor. There 
 was not even a doctor available at the ground at the second last game of the National Soccer League.</para><para>Then it got worse. They had to wait half an hour for an ambulance. There was a near-capacity crowd at this stadium and an ambulance was not laid on and was not available. That injured player remained in agony all of the time. That really is not good enough for a sport that seeks to join the international league, that seeks to hold its place at a national level in this country. Events such as those would not happen at the Australian Football League. They certainly would not happen at the National Rugby League. They would not happen at the top level in cricket, in Super 12 rugby, nor, dare I say it, in most other national competitions. It reflects very poorly on the administration of soccer in Australia. They really will have to lift their game after that. Perth Glory is showing them the way in pulling the crowds in, but you have to provide services to the players and to supporters. That is the bucket, Madam President.</para><para>Now for the congratulations. Obviously I have passed them on to Sydney United. I do wish them well. They deserved the victory last Sunday. What I am saying tonight is not sour grapes because we lost the game. I want to pass on congratulations to all of the Perth Glory players who have carried themselves very well through the year. It is by far and away the most successful year ever and augurs well for the future of this very young club. I congratulate the officials of Perth Glory, particularly the general manager, Roger Lefort, Paul Tana, the chairman, Paul Afkos, the deputy chairman and the wonderful coach, Bernd Strange, and last of all the Perth Glory spectators.</para><para>In all of the games they played in Perth with the huge crowds they attracted—I remind you again, four times the number attended there the week before the incidents of last Sunday—there has been no crowd disturbance at all with 4½ times the number: 27,000. Indeed, there have been very few problems over this season or in previous seasons. The loutish, unruly, hooligan behaviour of a few last Sunday spoiled a wonderful spectacle. It harmed soccer in Australia and the administrators really have to crack down on this and 
 make sure that it is not allowed to continue. Events such as those of last Sunday should not be allowed to occur at the final next Sunday.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>Senate adjourned at 11.05 p.m.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>5381</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>5381</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Advance to the Minister for Finance and Administration—Statement and supporting applications of issues—March 1999.</para><para>Centrelink—Social security compliance activity in Centrelink—Report—July to December 1998, including a statement by the Minister for Community Services (Mr Truss).</para><para>Science and technology budget statement 1999-2000.</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>5382</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Attorney-General's Department: Value of Market Research</title><page.no>5382</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 233)</subtitle><id.no>233</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5382</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 26 November 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) What was the total value of market research sought by the department on a month-by-month basis between March 1996 and November 1998.</para><para>(2) What was the purpose of each contract let.</para><para>(3) In each instance, what was the involvement or otherwise of the Office of Government Information and Advertising.</para><para></para><para>(4) In each instance, (a) how many firms were invited to submit proposals;

VH-HYB crossed the runway while the aircraft on approach was well clear of the runway, there was no breakdown of separation.</para><para>9900515	 - this report alleged a breakdown of separation within the Cairns Terminal Area. Other than the CAIR report received on 3 February 1999 alleging a breakdown of separation (BOS) standards, no incident reports had been received from pilots or air traffic controllers reporting a BOS occurrence on 28 January 1999.
