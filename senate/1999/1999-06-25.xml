That is not the case. I have been advised by officers of the party that the first stage of the process under Democrat rules for leadership requires that relevant officers check the membership details of the petitioners against the official membership rolls. That is happening at the moment. Until that first step has been undertaken, there is no ballot and there is no change to the status of either the leader or the deputy. If anything happens to change that, I will advise you, Madam President.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL

the committee stage debate about the process of the committee, and ask the minister at the table if he can give some consideration to a number of matters and, if necessary, in the time available if he is unable to indicate a response immediately, ask him if he would take this issue up with the Leader of the Government in the Senate and perhaps respond to the committee as soon as possible.</para></talk.start><para>After listening to the debate closely last night, I did become concerned, particularly when Senator Woodley was waxing lyrical about events in his local football club, that there was an attempt—perhaps a subtle one, and I am not suggesting there was a great deal of malice in this—for the debate to proceed more slowly. When you are operating under the guillotine that has serious consequences of course, and that is of particular concern to the opposition when the government and the Democrats have actually imposed such a guillotine.</para><para>This is the point I would like to make to the minister at the table through you, Madam Chair. The minister may not be aware, but I know the Manager of Government Business is—as is the Leader of the Australian Democrats and the Democrats Whip—that we did have a discussion in the margins a little earlier this week about dealing in a sensible way with key amendments to the environment bills which were before the chamber at that time. I would now like to seek an assurance, while there is still ample opportunity before we will be voting on a range of issues, that what was accepted as a principle around the table will apply.</para><para>Obviously it is not appropriate at this time, but I want to flag that the opposition would believe it appropriate that four amendments be taken separately. Those are Labor amendment No. 1 on sheet 1327, the issue of GST price transparency—I think senators in the chamber would be aware of the views of the opposition in relation to the significance of this amendment; this is something that the committee has examined previously—the amendments on sheet 1452, which are Labor amendments Nos 1 and 2, which were circulated last night relating to the GST-free supply of membership to a student organisation; government amendments 3, 66 and 68 on sheet FA210, which I think relate to the casino issue and on which we would be intending to vote separately; and, fourthly, government amendments 79 to 82 and I think government amendments 93 and 104 on sheet FA210. Senator Cook will confirm that at a later stage in the debate.</para><para>I just want to get some clarity about this. This is within the spirit of what was discussed around the table but outside the actual chamber itself a couple of days ago when we were making little progress in the voting procedures around the environment package. I flag those four and would like an assurance from the minister either now or at a later stage that leave will be granted to ensure that procedure works smoothly and with efficiency.</para><para>I also acknowledge that the view of the opposition was that, if minor parties or senators or Senator Harradine were keen to put an amendment, a similar approach should then be 
 taken by the committee as a whole. I acknowledge that Senator Brown has indicated to me that, in relation to Greens amendments Nos 1 to 3 on sheet 1428, which relate to GST-free books, he is keen to progress that particular matter to a vote.</para><para>I raise that at this stage because it might require the minister at the table receiving some advice from Senator Hill. If he feels that that is appropriate in these circumstances, he might have a word to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate or the Government Whip. But I do appreciate that he might want to speak to Senator Hill about this matter. If we can get some clarity about that issue at this stage or as soon as the minister is able to provide that information to the committee, the opposition would certainly appreciate it and will respond accordingly when we hear from the minister.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>6447</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Faulkner has raised a number of issues and a number of requests have been put to us.

The situation that we face at the moment—let me stress again—is that we have a guillotine. We have very limited time for debate. We have a situation where there is a growing concern on the part of the opposition that Australian Democrat senators are either raising interesting issues like what is occurring with their local football clubs or bowling up dorothy dix questions to the minister for long and boring responses.</para></talk.start><para>That is fine, we take the view that these things can happen in politics, but when you impose the guillotine on other political parties and put these sorts of constraints on a committee stage debate on such an important issue as this, all senators have a responsibility to ensure that the committee stage evolves efficiently and effectively and that we have 
 maximum opportunity to debate the key issues of substance before the chair. So what I request of you, Minister, is that, if you can get an urgent response, that is going to make a difference to the way the committee stage progresses. I would ask you if you could come back before 10 o'clock and provide a response on those issues.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>6447</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will be in the chamber, but I will provide advice as soon as possible.

Wanting to assist Senator Cook, I of course took up the invitation.	 In relation to the Australian Democrats, they can speak for themselves, but my view is that they were seeking to get some views in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> , and they are quite entitled to do that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The truth of the matter is that, when the history of this debate is written, the people who will be accused of delaying the political debate will be the Australian Labor Party. Frankly, at five minutes to midnight, it is a great dose of irony that Senator Faulkner has come in here and complained about people wasting time. Senator Faulkner, I think you should review exactly the tactics your own party has adopted throughout this debate.

I would rather see us getting on with the debate on the substantial issues than talking about dry, process issues. The point I make is that there will be some people who will want to make short and succinct contributions. I do not think anyone from the coalition has made a contribution of more than a couple of minutes at the very most.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What I want to say to Senator Sherry, through you, Madam Chairman, is that regardless of the contributions in the past two days, the reality for the government is that we want to see this debate go in an orderly fashion. If we do not have cooperation around the 
 chamber—regardless of the guillotine being in place—then we cannot have a decent debate on the issues, we will end up with disrupted votes, we will all get grumpy, we will all get tired, we will end up sitting all through the night and we will not get the result we want.</para><para>So the government is committed and it shares the view of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate that, if we all have an agreement on how we proceed with this debate, if we can accommodate the wishes of as many stakeholders as possible in this chamber, if we get resolutions and if we have the votes done in a sensible sort of way, then that is in the interests of good public policy and good governance, and that is what I think we are all here for, especially in the spirit of the valedictory speeches last night. We are going to try to bring that into the chamber this morning, Senator Margetts. We are going to try to maintain that glorious spirit that pervaded this place only four or five hours ago at 3 o'clock this morning. We were all being so kind to each other.</para><para>It is my commitment today on behalf of the government to ensure that that takes place. We will ensure that, if any coalition speaker does make a contribution—and we certainly will be trying to limit those—they will be short, sharp and to the point and they will not waste time. I am sure Senator Sherry will swear that he will do the same thing today, as will Senator Conroy and others. We can all agree that when Senator Kemp makes contributions they are short, sharp and to the point.</para><para>On the detailed issues that Senator Faulkner has raised, we will come back to the chamber. If there is a need for further discussions outside the chamber because of any problems, I am happy to convene little powwows around tables. If anyone sees a problem occurring, I am very happy for that to happen and we can move things along.

The government's expressed intention was that no net revenue would be raised from gambling and this would be achieved by reducing state and territory taxes by similar amounts to the GST. However, in the case of raffles conducted by charities, states and territories do not levy gambling taxes and it is not possible to achieve the government's intent merely by reducing state and territory gambling taxes.

It was one which, I might say, they sought and one which resulted clearly first from the negotiations with the charities and further from the negotiations that the Democrats had with the government. I think that this particular amendment is, as you say, an important one. We believe that it certainly resolves one of the concerns that charities have.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>6450</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, the charities who are affected by these amendments have written to us, and presumably others, saying that GST-free status and these amendments will be of little benefit to them because the effects of a GST on the other side of the ledger will be detrimental to them—namely, paying GST on goods and supplies they purchase and services they purchase. The consequence of the GST regime will be that they will be involved with higher costs—I think they were specifically 
 the points Senator Brown was making yesterday—and, indeed, higher administration activities by introducing new systems and all that sort of thing. I would appreciate it if you would indicate to what respect these amendments on GST-free goods and activities would actually not only improve their costs and their accounting matters but also improve their ability to benefit from this tax package.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>6450</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The truth of the matter is that, with regard to the non-commercial activities of charities, their costs will fall. There are significant embedded taxes in the costs of charities, even though they may at face be value exempt from wholesale sales tax. But in a lot of the goods they purchase there is a range of embedded taxes. The most obvious of these is the wholesale sales tax. In many of the products that they buy there is an embedded wholesale sales tax. In other areas, such as the cost of running vehicles, there are taxes which are embedded there also. With the initiatives we have brought forward in this package, many of those embedded taxes will be removed. That is why we think that the costs for non-commercial activities of charities will in fact fall. We see this as an important advantage that charities are receiving from the ANTS package.</para></talk.start><para>Once this is explained and once we try to forgo the hysteria that Senator Brown always attempts to bring to debates, when a fair balance is made, a lot of charities will see that there are major advantages to them in this package. We are as aware as you are that there are concerns by charities. That is why the government has already spent a great deal of time in consultation with charities. In fact, I have had a range of meetings. I know the officers of Treasury and the Taxation Office have had meetings with charities to go through in detail what the proposals are. As I have said earlier in this debate, I think that those meetings have been very helpful and quite a range of the concerns of charities have been effectively addressed. When some of the fears of charities are properly explained to them, they are considerably comforted.</para><para>I think there are very big pluses in this package for charities. There are very big pluses, not the least, it has to be said, in the social services area with real rises in pensions and benefits to some of the poorer clients who use the services of charities—a very big plus. In terms of fundraising activities, and I think that they have been genuine matters for debate on this bill, there are very substantial income tax cuts. This package delivers $12 billion in income tax cuts. These are the largest income tax cuts in Australian history. The average family will benefit, if my memory serves me correctly, by $40 to $50 per week. It is a very substantial rise in disposable income for families.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—Mr Temporary Chairman, on a point of order: the question of tax cuts is not for the chair at all.

The point I am making, which is directly relevant to the question that was asked of me, is that there are very substantial tax cuts which will provide increased levels of disposable income through which people are able, if they so wish, to make contributions to charities. It is a pretty obvious and important point, I would have thought. Given the scare campaign, which has been run by people like Senator Brown, who never considers the whole picture, who never looks at the whole picture, I think it is entirely relevant.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—I had already ruled and asked you to draw your attention to the amendment.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—I note that Senator Murray has sought the call.

Others will need to look closely at their procedures and to make sure that they comply with the law. What we are doing, of course, is undertaking a major education campaign with charities to make sure that they understand what is required. We believe that the systems themselves are not complicated. The reporting arrangements are very straightforward. We believe that perhaps, once the general excitement around the charities and the introduction of this bill calms down, people will see things more objectively. We believe that the accounting procedures are very straightforward and that they are not complex.</para></talk.start><para>We do not anticipate that charities—or, indeed, other bodies in small business—are going to find the obligations required under the new tax system onerous at all. In fact, in the RIS that has been passed around with the bills, I think the net recurrent costs are estimated at $240 a year on average. Of course, I accept that this will vary between the types of organisations, but we do not feel that once the systems are in place people will find the reporting obligations onerous. In fact, I think the experience in New Zealand has been that one of the many beneficial effects of the new tax system is that it encourages people to have better accounting systems, so they have 
 a better idea of just where they are at. That is a real plus out of this, and I think one of the things which flowed through to many of the people in small business—and, I suspect, in many charities—was that it was an advantage to have effective and proper accounting systems. Once that was in place, people did not see that as onerous. They saw that as an advantage, because they knew exactly where they were at any point in time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>6455</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, yesterday Senator Forshaw asked you about sporting clubs.

Fundraising in relation to a charitable body through donations from individuals or a business will not be affected, as there will be no GST on a donation to a charity. In relation to fundraising done through sponsorships from business, we believe it will be largely unaffected by the GST, as the extra cost to the business sponsor will be offset by the input tax credit that the sponsor can obtain.</para></talk.start><para>We do not accept that the sponsorships will be affected. We do not accept that donations will be affected. I have given the rationale for sponsorships but, in relation to donations, let me repeat that there is no GST on donations to charities. You should remember, Senator Boswell, that the large income tax cuts to individuals will provide significant extra disposable income for people to make donations to charities. I have indicated to this chamber that, where a body is a charity, a raffle is GST free. Equally, some bodies will 
 not be registered. Senator, you spoke about a large number of very small bodies—community organisations and others—and, of course, if they are not in the GST system, there is again no GST on any raffles they may conduct. The important thing is that this particular amendment is a very big plus for charities. We have responded to community concerns and to the concerns expressed by the Australian Democrats.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that government amendments Nos 31 and 67 be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>6459</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are about to move to Senator Brown's amendments.

Having failed to get any support last night for our comprehensive amendments to protect charities right across the board, including student unions, the Greens are now moving the Democrats' own amendments put before the chamber some weeks ago. When introducing these amendments of the Democrats which the Greens are now moving, Senator Bartlett said that the impact of the GST on charities was totally negative and quite avoidable. He continued:</para><para>Why should the Government be interested in taxing lamington drives, chook raffles, country dances and tuckshops?

That government position has now of course become the Democrats' position, and us Greens, in the fall back, are putting forward the more narrow proposals that the Democrats mooted just a couple of weeks ago to offset the very real impact on non-government organisations, including unions, and charities right across the country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator McKiernan)</name></talker><para>—Senator Brown, could you clarify with the chair the second group of amendments, just so we are certain.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Yes.

I am speaking to a number of amendments. Firstly, on sheet No. 1454, the reason for this amendment is simple. There was a process leading up to the introduction of this legislation whereby some practitioners would have been in a position to know of the anti-avoidance provisions and may have been able to put into effect arrangements which commenced before 2 December 1998. Accordingly, this amendment proposes to backdate the period from which anti-avoidance amendments would be effective from—the release of the ANTS package. The Democrats should support this, but since they apparently now support tax avoidance I expect they will not.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is quite extraordinary. It became clear from the ANTS document, from that moment, what an effective tax planner or tax avoider could do to get around the provisions in the ANTS law. I find it extraordinary that the Democrats will be party to opening up that window of opportunity. We have the chance right now to close that window of opportunity for people who are smart tax planners, tax avoiders. The Democrats have got themselves into a position where they are in bed with the government on this. It is quite an extraordinary position, but it is another of the sell-outs consistently being shown this week.</para><para>Because there is not much time, I will leave it at that and move on to the amendments on sheet No. 1452. These amendments relate to one issue only—that is, the defence of students and student organisations from yet another assault by this government. We do not think that students should pay tax to belong to a student organisation. It is wrong in principle and Labor opposes it strongly. I hope we will get the chamber's support for it; I hope we will get the Democrats' support for it; I hope we will get Senator Stott Despoja's support for it, given her strong position on many student organisation issues. Again, it is quite extraordinary that the Democrats have joined in the persecution of student organisations in this country. They have had consistently strong views on this, but where are they today? You are not going to support this.</para><para>I would also like to move on to what is known as the `high-roller amendment'. In this 
 chamber, the Democrats said they were not going to be supportive of it. Now they are trying, as they have done with a number of their other commitments, to back out. This is the famous high-roller amendment. This is the amendment that sees the Liberal Party look after their mates. This is the amendment that says if you go to a casino, if you are Kerry Packer and you wander in, and the casino decides to put on all these lavish things for you, all these lavish offsets to your losses, they get to claim them as being GST free. This is extraordinary. You can be a student organisation and the Democrats will not support you, you can be a charity and the Democrats will not support you; you can be a tax avoider and the Democrats will support you, but if you are a Kerry Packer, a high roller, they are going to let you out of the GST.</para><para>They are going to let Ron Walker and Lloyd Williams—their backers in Victoria—off the GST, but not students, not charities and not people who eat different types of bread, different types of food from the Democrats. You are going to be supporting the high-roller amendment. You should stand up right now, Senator Murray, and give us an explanation of why you are going to be letting the government's mates, the government's political backers, get away with this today, in about five or 10 minutes time. We demand an explanation and you deserve to give one to the voters of this country—to the charities, to the student organisations, to the people who are going to be paying GST on food. It is good enough for them. But it is not good enough.</para><para>You can argue that it is just another input cost. There are lots of other input costs that are being GSTed. If you are a financial institution, notwithstanding the new amendments that you are putting up, you still have to pay tax on your inputs. Why are casinos, why are your mates, being let off on this? Lots of financial institutions will not get a GST exemption for their inputs. But the casinos are a special case; they certainly are special to the government. They certainly are special to the government!</para><para>What we have here today is a disgraceful sell-out by the Democrats—no principle. Senator Woodley has convinced himself that this debate is being characterised by a Labor Party telephone tree. You can go on convincing yourself. They have argued, `Oh, all these Labor Party people are sending faxes backwards and forwards; they're making telephone calls; they're approaching me.' That's right, Senator Woodley: after Brian Harradine agreed to vote against the GST, we organised 2,000 people to send in faxes and letters and make telephone calls! That is right, 2,000—after he has agreed to support us. You can go on deluding yourself. You can go on pretending that this is just about an organised telephone tree. I said it yesterday, but you were not here. Newspoll did a survey, and guess what? They found that an overwhelming majority did not want the GST. What did they do, Senator Woodley? Did they actually phone Labor Party members only? Is that what happened with Newspoll?</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> conducted a phone-in. They asked, in relation to the GST, `Do you agree with the deal?' The number who answered yes was 230. The next day they held another telephone poll: `Do you agree with the Ku Klux Klan?' More people—633—supported the Ku Klux Klan than supported this GST deal. But I guess it was just another Labor Party telephone tree, was it, Senator Woodley? Smell the roses. Look at your party membership, look at what the polls say and look at what ordinary Australians are saying. They oppose this package, and so should you.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Order!

I think we should just wait until we see whether we can get agreement.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>6464</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I will propose that we move to consideration of the next bill, which is the New Tax System (Goods and Services Transition) Bill. We will review the situation in one hour at the latest and we will undertake that all of 
 the divisions that have been sought by the Leader of the Opposition and the Greens senators at this stage will be called. I have already given this commitment. We hope that the bells will be operating in a short time. I think it is sensible that, as soon as practical after the bells are back in operation, we recommence those divisions. We would not interrupt a senator speaking, or we might do that very politely. If the bells take up to an hour to fix, we will then convene a meeting in an hour's time to discuss proposals.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>6464</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I think the procedure that the Manager of Government Business has outlined is a sensible one. I had a quick talk with Senator Campbell and Senator Hill. In what are probably very unusual, if not unprecedented, circumstances we have to be a bit creative about the way we handle this. The opposition's imperative—and I hope it is shared by other senators in the chamber—is that these divisions on crucial issues are essential. We need these divisions to take place and if at all possible they ought to be done in the normal manner.</para></talk.start><para>I think it will best facilitate the work of the committee if we proceed in the way that we have agreed and that Senator Campbell has now outlined to the Senate. If there is going to be a difficulty with the bells into the longer term, the sensible approach is for all of us to have a bit of a chat about how we might deal with progressing the work of the committee at that time. But my hope would be that within an hour or so we can fix this up and work through the difficulty. Senator Hill will be pleased to see this is the one piece of mismanagement I am not going to blame the government for.

The other two appear to reduce sales tax as a part of the phase-down operation and therefore there is no reason for them to be requests. They will be treated as amendments. So one will be treated as a request and two will be treated as amendments. Is it the wish of the committee that the bill be taken as a whole? There being no objection, it is so ordered.

This bill starts to talk about the transitional impact of the GST, and we are close to having the final vote, so transitional impacts over the next 12 months are very important. This covers some of that 12 months. What we are seeing from the government is an attempt to conceal. We have just had a string of votes which saw the transparency of the GST on price tags defeated. Those are the issues about which even Allan Fels from the ACCC said, `I need help with the transitional provisions of this bill; I need to have the prices revealed in the 12 months beforehand.' I am reading from an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>  of Wednesday, 16 June titled `Call to reveal GST to public'. You may think that is a call by the Labor Party, but in actual fact it is a call from Allan Fels. He is making the point that the transitional impact of the GST is very confusing. The article says:</para></talk.start><para>Price tags should reveal the amount of GST being paid so shoppers understood the reason for higher charges, prices watchdog Allan Fels said yesterday.</para><para>Professor Fels said he would be urging all businesses to explain the GST overhaul—and detailed price tags will be one of the best options.</para><para>That is Allan Fels from the ACCC. He is saying, `How am I going to handle the transitional impact? What do I need this government to give to Australian consumers to 
 enable me to handle the transitional impact?' The article goes on:</para><para>Shoppers should be able to see instantly the pre-GST price, the amount of GST, and final price, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said.</para><para>That is Allan Fels. And what did the government do? We have just defeated the amendments for transparency and display. Allan Fels, who has said that this is one of the key things that he needs for the transition period, this 12 months that we have got coming up before it is introduced, needs this. Nobody in this country should forget that, when you cannot see GST listed on the price tag, it was the Democrats who voted against the amendments, the Democrats voted to keep the GST hidden. Professor Fels went on to say:</para><para>. . . more detail would be useful in the early months on the GST, although the final price must be displayed.</para><para>"We see some merit in stores saying this is our former price, this is our current price, the difference is tax' . . .</para><para>The ACCC cannot force firms to produce detailed price tags but would be urging them to explain the changes when the new tax hits . . . </para><para>You have a situation where the ACCC has said, `Here are the guidelines for the transition period. This is what we want you to try to do.' And what has been the response from business? It has been headlines like `GST plan—the anger grows' and business groups describing the ACCC's calls on the transitional effects `unworkable and will cut profit margins':</para><para>If the profit margin rises on a particular product once the GST is introduced, the ACCC will be alerted to profiteering.</para><para>And they are complaining:</para><para>Industry groups are furious that the ACCC's pricing guidelines will add further complexity and costs because of the compromise deals. Small business was already wary about the cost of collecting GST revenues every three months. Adding to business disquiet is the ACCC's insistence that firms work out how the change in tax arrangement affects their business costs through the introduction of tax credits on the GST on any business inputs.</para><para>But it is the ACCC's ruling on profit margins that has really upset them. What has Tony Aveling from the banks—now there are some fine corporate citizens; banks making billions 
 and billions of dollars worth of profits—said about the ACCC's attempts to monitor the transitional effects? This is what Mr Tony Aveling said:</para><para>Mr Tony Aveling criticised the consumer watchdog for assuming that price exploitation is occurring whenever net margins rise. To quell some of the concerns in banking and insurance, though, the ACCC has agreed to allow guidelines to be tailored by the industry to suit its needs.</para><para>And those mugs in the Democrats signed up to this. They said, `We are going to vote for the bill by 30 June and we will leave the ACCC in charge of monitoring with none of the teeth that they need to be able to monitor the transitional effects.' The next 12 months are going to see firms trying to edge their margins up, edge their prices up. So after the GST is introduced you will have a system where the comparison will not look as bad. They will not look like they are profiteering. You have Allan Fels responding to the sorts of criticisms I have just mentioned in this way:</para><para>The ACCC moved yesterday to soothe business concerns that its GST price monitoring guidelines were are unfair and would force many to cut profit margins saying there was still room for them to be changed.</para><para>So the ACCC will get to issue its guidelines after the Democrats have agreed to put it into legislation, after the Democrats have said, `Yep, let's do it. We'll make sure they say the ACCC has got the resources.' But the ACCC is backing away. Every time the business groups start complaining, every time they stand up and demand that the ACCC back down, what is happening? Allan Fels says, `We're going to soothe business concerns; there is still room for them to be changed.'</para><para>That gives me about as much comfort as standing in this chamber believing the Democrats are going to cross the floor and actually give the ACCC some real teeth. How can you sign up to a deal that says you support monitoring and that you support making sure the ACCC has got teeth when the ACCC has not reached its final position and, worse, is saying that it is going to allow industry to actually dictate to it the guidelines. It is going to allow industry to tailor its needs.</para><para>We want the ACCC to make sure that profiteering does not happen. We know they do not have the resources. The extra money that they have been given is a drop in the ocean. They are not planning on going around the country monitoring prices; their plan is to have consumer complaints. When the ACCC appeared before the Senate estimates committee a couple of weeks ago, I asked them, `Suppose somebody phones up and alerts you to what they believe to be profiteering, what do you do then?' They said, `We go back, look at the business, talk to business and disaggregate their costs, and we have a look to see.' I said to the man who will be in charge of this section in the ACCC, `Let's say that, on day one, I get all these extra cost savings and I lower my price. On day two, I say that I have decided I can increase my margin, that I think there is room for me in the marketplace to put my price up a bit and that I have made a conscious decision to increase my price in this period. What could you do about it?' And he said, `Nothing.' So if you decide that you can increase your price and widen your margin because you believe the market conditions allow it, what does the ACCC say it can do? Absolutely nothing. So when the ACCC comes and knocks on the door, every business in the country simply has to say, `Well, yes, I've put my price up. I've decided the market can bear an increase in my price,' and the commission has nowhere to go.</para><para>We asked the ACCC what will happen when the Olympics are on. We all know demand is going to increase and market conditions are going to be that there is a huge influx of tourists. We all know what happens around these sorts of events: the prices start to go up. We asked whether the Olympics will be a defence to profiteering. You have a huge increase in demand; how are you going to measure what is an acceptable level of profit during the Olympics? They said, `Well, we accept that that won't be possible.' So ordinary businesses before the Olympics can say, `Well, the market can bear it. I'm putting my prices up,' and what will happen during the Olympics? Everyone knows that the prices will go up. I would not want to be living in Sydney during the Olympics because you are really going to get slugged.</para><para>The ACCC have admitted on the public record that there are no teeth in this legislation, that they do not have enough people to police it and that they are not even going to try to police the transitional provisions in this bill.

They want Allan Fels to do big glossy photos like this one in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>  Weekend Focus last Saturday, 19 June: `GST policeman Allan Fels will be tough on those who exploit the new tax, because the price must be right for GST.' That is a big article in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> , the big daily, so people can feel reassured that Allan Fels is on the job. If you read right to the end, though, you begin to have a few concerns. He says that firms will have to show there is no change in their profit margin per item under one of the key tests, but ACCI industry chief executive Mark Paterson said that very few companies had exact details. `We would see the guidelines as unworkable,' he said bluntly. This is the same Mark Paterson who has championed tax reform—in his guise, the GST—for the last two or three years.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Every time the government have needed to trot out one of the most vocal advocates of the GST—and they have trotted him out, day in day out, for the last two years—it has been Mark Paterson. So what does Mark Paterson say? `We would see the guidelines as unwork 
 able.' And who do the government listen to? Are they going to listen to Allan Fels or are they going to listen to Mark Paterson, who pushed them into tax reform—in their words—in the first place? Mark Paterson is one of the key influences on this government. His words are very important to them; they will listen to him. The Democrats understand that Mark Paterson is a key influence, and what have they done? They have let a situation arise where Mark Paterson, after the legislation is passed, can go and sabotage the legislation. He can go into negotiations and force the ACCC, because the ACCC knows the government will never stand up to the Mark Patersons of this world. And here it is: Professor Fels, in the very next paragraph and in response to Mr Paterson, admitted `there was some scope to clarify the guidelines, but remained confident they would be ready on 1 July'.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—I have a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman.

I know it is a shock—and the minister shakes his head—but they are there to make sure that these provisions are workable. They put on 
 the public record at estimates that they know they cannot. The government want to push Fels out into the limelight—and he is never shy to get out in the limelight—to do glossy little articles like this to try to convince ordinary Australians that he is going to look after their interests.

Clause 1 deletes reference to diesel fuel credits, as these are no longer part of the GST and will be covered by an outlay program. Clauses 2, 3 and 4, on sheet EF237 and amendment 1 on sheet EF240, give effect to the government's intention to tax goods delivered and services performed after 1 July 2000, provided that they are not supplied under an agreement that was entered into prior to 2 December 1998 or royal assent in certain circumstances. These amendments cover rights which effectively deliver goods and services.</para><para>Amendment 5 on sheet EF237 ensures that a supplier revives an opportunity before a grandfathered agreement is subject to GST. Amendments 6 and 7 ensure that businesses that import second-hand goods are entitled to a credit for any wholesale sales tax that has been paid on stock for resale held on 1 July 2000. Amendment 8 on EF237 provides less stringent registration requirements for acupuncturists, naturopaths and providers of herbal medicine until 1 July 2003. This is a consequential amendment on the amendment that was passed yesterday, one which was strongly supported by the Australian Democrats.</para><para>Amendments 9 and 10 ensure that input credits are available to insurers in cases where 
 the timing of an event giving rise to a claim is uncertain and could have occurred before or after 1 July 2000. In these situations, the time of the claim being made will be used as the time of the event for GST purposes. Amendment 11 on sheet EF237 allows input credits for insurance premiums if a business notifies the commissioner that they are claiming the credit. This amendment ensures that businesses will be fully aware of their GST obligations for any insurance payout under the GST. We anticipate that most businesses will claim input tax credits and that insurance companies will adjust their policies to ensure that businesses are better off due to industry cost reductions which flow through to their businesses. Amendment 12 on sheet EF237 is a consequential amendment to section 126 of the main GST bill.</para><para>The further amendments the government intends to move are Nos 13, 14 and 15 on sheet EF237 and Nos 2 and 3 on sheet EF240. These amendments ensure that the 32 per cent wholesale sales tax rate falls to 22 per cent from 21 days after royal assent. Many businesses have requested that the date of the change be certain to allow planning.</para><para>I commend these amendments to the Senate. They do reflect the consultations that the government has had with industry and others, and I hope that they will receive speedy passage through the chamber.

One of the moving parts of that report was the reporter asking a storekeeper if she had made provision to purchase the new equipment she will need in order to computerise goods through the checkouts that are GSTable and those that are not, and the storekeeper looking somewhat shocked and surprised that a major outlay on her part will be necessary in order to comply with this government's bill.</para><para>That is just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout Australia thousands of small business people are concerned about their future and how they will comply with the law once there is a GST. Many more millions of Australians who are consumers are concerned about how they will detect how much the goods should be, given that there is a reduction in wholesale sales tax and an increase in GST, and whether the final price they are being asked to pay is an accurate reflection of the cost cut and the cost increase, so that the net price is true and there is no profit taking by individual storeholders or business people.</para><para>Part of Senator Conroy's contribution was certainly relevant to the transitional stage, and that is how the price changes will be effectively monitored in the transitional stage to ensure that Australians pay the proper price and there is not an element of inflating prices or using the GST as an excuse to claim a higher price than would otherwise be the case.</para><para>We received a great deal of evidence on this matter during the Senate inquiry, but you have to start out in the street talking to real people rather than being in the closeted confines of this building talking to academic economists. If you ask real people, `Do you think that there will be an opportunity here for retailers to actually maximise their price and load a bit on?', most people say yes. But, if you ask the academic economists at the Treasury, `On what assumptions is this package predicated?', they say they assume that there will be a 100 per cent pass-through of all price changes and there will be no price taking—that there will be no attempt to use this as a chance to ramp up prices. The basis of all the government's calculations on how well off you will be after a GST—which are, to say the least, fraudulent—is in part the assumption that no-one out there will take a higher price because of the GST. You can laugh at that, but that is the basis of this legislation.</para><para>We have had given to us a number of clear examples where companies are worse off. Car manufacturers in Australia are concerned that they will suffer a buyers drought and that workers in the car industry will be put out of work. Because of the nature of this bill, 
 production lines will have to be closed down, not completely but to some extent, and there will be hardship visited on people where it otherwise could have been taken care of. They are concerned that because of the reductions in wholesale sales tax there will be a buyers drought while people wait for those reductions to occur and that no-one will buy cars between now and then.</para><para>Some people might think that is an understandable concern but not a realistic one. All they have to do is point to the economy of Japan. The economy of Japan used to be one of the strongest economies in the world. It is the second biggest economy on the face of the earth. Its economy now is in recession. When did the recession occur? It was triggered last year—this is agreed between economists who study the Japanese economy and the Japanese writers on their own domestic economy—when in Japan they increased the equivalent of the GST from three per cent to five per cent. What happened? People brought forward purchases of goods and services prior to the price increase clicking in. As a result there was a downturn in the Japanese economy, and other factors of demand, domestic and foreign, meant that the Japanese economy, one of the strongest in the world up to that point, moved into recession. It remains in recession now, and the bane of many Japanese politicians is how you get out of it. So let us not think that the introduction of a new rate of tax does not affect consumer behaviour and does not affect the wellbeing of industry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—It can't create a recession in Japan.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—It was the trigger of the recession in Japan. If you want to contend with that argument, go and talk to any number of Japanese economists who have looked at what is the problem with the Japanese economy. The purchasing drought that the car manufacturers are concerned about is one element of the transitional phase of this bill. The other element concerns fleet lessors, those companies that make major purchases of motor vehicles for fleet purchases. That includes a number of Australian companies which compete against each other in a very 
 tight and highly competitive market. In car hire, Avis and the others all compete against each other in a market where the margins are extremely thin and where the competition is extremely fierce, and they have no scope to take on board the extra costs that the transition phase to a GST will require them by government fiat to do. They will just have to absorb them, when they have got no margins to do so. Their problem is that in purchasing cars in advance, as they have to to provide a stock of vehicles for their rental businesses, the second-hand retail price, when they sell them back into the market and recover part of their initial capital outlay, will be much less than would otherwise have been the case and they will suffer in the normal course of their business a considerable impost while they have to cover the gap and have no scope to do so.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Is there any provision to protect those companies? No, there is not. They are greatly concerned about that. In fact, they have advised me and advised the GST inquiry, and I am sure advised the government, that as a consequence they have already loaded into their hire car charges a compensatory price increase because of the GST. We know that the government says there will be stiff penalties applied to those who do that, but these companies are saying, `The only way we can survive is by doing it, and as a consequence we are.' One can forgive them and understand their doing that when there is no compensation for the extra costs they will have to shoulder because of what the government is proposing to do.</para><para>Let me turn to the policing of the GST. My colleague Senator Conroy had a fair bit to say about the ACCC. In essence, the story comes down to this. There are fines for artificially inflated prices, if you can prove that prices are artificially inflated for this reason and this reason alone. However, if some sharp operator can make a case that it was the Sydney Olympics or wages went up or they had a review of their price structure and changed it for market reasons—that is, if they can create a fog of uncertainty as to the real reason for the price rises—they get out of the net; they are home free. You actually have to prove 
 that it was because of the GST, and if you cannot prove it then there is no case. That is a very difficult hurdle in proof to clear to begin with.</para><para>If you can clear that hurdle and get a few cases proved, they will face heavy fines. That is right. You would have thought that takes care of this issue. But does it? Of course it does not. You have to be able to police activity that is going on in the marketplace. You have to police every stall, every retailer and every service deliverer in Australia and make sure that the prices they are charging post-GST take account of any price reductions, if there are any, by the abolition of wholesale sales tax and any price increases by the imposition of the GST. It would have made this process a lot easier if retailers were to display on their cards, or at the checkout have at the bottom of the customer's receipt, an amount showing how much tax they paid on that good or that service transaction. That would have been a sensible way of doing it. We put up an amendment to cause that to happen. The government and the Australian Democrats voted it down, for the reason that they do not want people to know how much tax they are paying on these transactions and they do not want consumers to have the ability to understand how they are being duped and ripped off. People will not be in a position to know whether or not the prices charged after the GST is introduced are solely because of changes in the GST or for other reasons.</para><para>So the argument that consumers are the best guarantee is a fraudulent argument. Consumers will not have the knowledge in most cases to be able to see through the hocus-pocus and understand whether the prices are fair or not. They will not have the knowledge, and the ability to find out has been denied to them by this government and by the Australian Democrats—and that is now a matter of sorry record in this chamber. So, if the consumers do not know, will the ACCC—the watchdog that is supposed to police proper business regulation in this country—know? The answer is it will not. The ACCC will have a feeble budget and an insignificant number of additional staff to do 
 the job. If you look at how many price changes there are on every service deliverer and on every business in Australia, the number of policemen we will have on the block to check to see that people will be doing the right thing will nowhere match the need.</para><para>So it is a false dawn to say, `Well, the fines are going to be high but we are not going to put anyone in the field to check. We are not going to allow consumers to know because we are not going to show the issues on the consumer receipt so that they can calculate for themselves what the price changes are.' That is why it is a fraudulent proposition and that is why the nightmare on main street begins with this bill. We have tried to change these things; the government has refused to do so.</para><para>We know from the ACCC, the watchdog that polices this activity, that in fact it is going to spend the additional grant that the government is giving it—to cover the transitional phase—on education. That is a useful idea: `If you have some determined business person who actually wants to use the GST's introduction as an excuse to hike their prices, we will educate them. We will put a few ads on television; they might actually see them. Maybe they will read ads in their trade journal and that will stop them from trying to rip off consumers because of their ability to inflate prices.' Does anyone believe that is going to work and can anyone in this chamber seriously put it to us? Why will the Democrats, who have signed off on consumer protection, now support this in this form? This is the most fraudulent example of how you dupe Australians, how you rip off people on prices and how you let those who do that get away with it: not providing the police, not providing the mechanisms for policing and hiding the real tax on the consumer receipt.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>6502</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the brief five minutes allotted to me, I will just deal with a couple of the points made by the opposition speakers. I will start with the Japanese analogy to Australia. Japan is one of the 105 countries that have introduced a GST or a VAT, and the comparison is inadequate in the following sense. As Senator Cook well knows from the 
 evidence given to us, when wholesale sales tax is removed in Australia at the various levels of 32 per cent, 22 per cent or 12 per cent in fact many goods will fall in price and part of the transitional arrangements process is to try and even out that effect. As he knows, there are large industries which are concerned with this matter, such as cars, for which there are very material transitional provisions. Others who are concerned are jewellers, video retailers, et cetera.</para></talk.start><para>In Japan, as you quite rightly made the point, people advanced their position of purchase. In Australia the danger has been that people will delay their purchase, and these transitional effects always occur whenever any one of those 105 countries embarks on an exercise such as this. You know from your own period in government that, when the fringe benefits tax was outlined and the capital gains tax—which you introduced—was outlined, business and the community were in an uproar about the new systems and the new forms. I am quite sure that, if you look at the fringe benefits tax debate way back then when it happened—and some of you have a longer corporate memory than mine—you will find the same kinds of remarks being made about the potential disaster that was facing us all. It is true that no compliance system will be without holes. It is true that some people will fall between the nets. That happens with the police force, Customs, the coastguard or the Army. You can never make everybody do the right thing.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—Only six per cent of Australians pay any fringe benefits tax but 100 per cent of Australians will pay the GST.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—If you want to follow that argument—and I take the interjection, Senator Cook—I will remind you that billions of people and tens of millions of businesses in 105 countries have coped with this. The idea that you and your party seem to have—that Australians are somehow less capable than people in other countries of dealing with this matter—I think is wrong, and I have said that consistently.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As for the point about the pricing that will go on in shops and all the outlets which have to do with a GST, there is nothing—and the 
 minister can confirm this—in the legislation to prevent any retailer from showing it in the prices if they wish. There is nothing to prevent a retailer saying there is a 10 per cent GST on this good—nothing. You cannot prevent that.</para><para>I will point out that, when we are referring to the transitional provisions, we are referring to provisions which will deal with this issue as well as they are capable of being dealt with and in line with foreign precedent. I can see the political advantage for you to beat the issue up in the way you have, but I do not concede that the other countries which have done it have had the problems that you outline and expect for Australia. I think that once this thing has settled down people will understand that to be the fact.

We will be bigger than that and allow the remarks to be incorporated.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The statement read as follows</inline>—</para><para>I just wanted to speak briefly to this transitional bill. The bill deals with a number of important matters. One of those matters is contracts which have a term that spans the implementation date of the goods and services tax—that is 1 July 2000.</para><para>I am referring to clause 12.</para><para>The Democrats received a number of submissions in relation to this provision and the arbitrary cut-off 
 date of 1 July 2005 for the non-imposition of a GST on supplies under those contract.</para><para>We have considered those submissions and believe that the government's rationale for not amending that provision is sound but I note for the benefit of those people who made those submissions that we will be monitoring the operation of that provision to ensure that no unfairness results.</para><para>We also received a number of submissions and held discussions with the Insurance industry in relation to clauses 11 and 20 and some other concerns that that industry has. We have discussed and considered those issues and we have raised these concerns with the government—we still have some concerns about those issues and we will be monitoring the operation of the transitional provisions in that area also.</para><para>In this regard I just wanted to refer briefly to the insurance amendments (9)—(11). The basis on which a determination is made as to whether an insurance company will receive an input tax credit for the payment of a claim is whether the event giving rise to the claim occurred prior to the 1 July 2000. To ease the burden of administration amendments to this bill will allow an insurance company to refer to the date of the claim rather than the date of the event in circumstances where the date of the event cannot be ascertained.</para><para>As a general comment, I would like to say that whilst the Democrats fully support the revised goods and services tax package, we still retain a degree of apprehension in respect of the implementation. These reforms are very far reaching and we believe that the government will need to be vigilant to ensure that no sector is adversely affected. I am not just referring to mainstream compliance issues for retailers, but I am talking about closely monitoring the impact on all Australians, individuals and businesses alike.</para><para>My own view is that if the government believes that it will pass this transitional bill and it will all be smooth sailing from there with no further intervention—then the government is probably deluding itself. In my view, and I don't have any concrete evidence to support this at the moment, so it is only a prediction but I expect that there will be a good degree of fine tuning the transitional arrangements between now and 1 July 2000. In that vein, I would encourage anyone who has concerns or expectations of being adversely affected to raise those concerns with the government so that they can be resolved one way or another. The conclusion of this debate on the transitional arrangements does not close the book on these or any other issues.</para><para>One additional issue which I did want to canvass was the practical implementation and changeover on 1 July 2000. That day, I understand, is a Saturday—Saturday is an ordinary trading day for 
 most retail businesses and indeed it is a day on which many retail business conduct substantial trade. I have concern for those retail businesses and burden they may suffer as a result of having to rearrange their prices and reprogram their cash registers and point of sale terminals on the Friday evening preceding 1 July 2000.</para><para>I don't know what measures we can undertake to ease that burden and I would like to take this opportunity to remind businesses to plan for that changeover day so that the work which must be undertaken, presumably on the Friday before 1 July 2000, does not place an undue burden on the owners and staff of those businesses.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Sherry)</name></talker><para>—It being 1.30 p.m., the time allotted for this bill has now expired.

One of the central reasons why we have opposed the GST has been the fact that the compensation package has been totally inadequate. We have said that from the start concerning the agreement between the Democrats and the government. That position has not changed. In fact, if anything, in the new Democrat GST compensation for ordinary Australians is worse than it was in the original bill. That has been clearly stated, particularly by organisations like ACOSS.</para></talk.start><para>Over the past two or three days, we have heard ACOSS's name being bandied about in relation to submissions it put before the Senate inquiry on the GST. Yesterday, Senator Knowles ran a whole lot of arguments and selectively quoted ACOSS's position on the GST. But at the end of the day when this package hit the deck publicly, after being negotiated under the table in secret rooms without any participation of other parties—only the Democrats and the government—what was ACOSS's position? What is the position of most of the organisations which represent the welfare lobby in this country? It is that their membership has been sold out, that the compensation is totally inequitable and that this is an inequitable, unfair tax. It is the people at the bottom of the ladder who 
 will suffer most as a consequence of this package being introduced. In a press release from ACOSS released at 10.15 a.m. on 3 June, under the heading `Tax package will widen inequality and is still not acceptable', ACOSS said:</para><para>After careful analysis, the Australian Council of Social Service has concluded that the new Government-Democrat tax package is still fundamentally unfair and is unacceptable.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>The package will therefore widen the gap between rich and poor, and the whole nation will suffer from greater division between the haves and the have-nots.</para><para>The Senate should not pass this package in its current form.</para><para>I note that Senator Harradine is in the chamber. I note in particular the comments he made in his `I cannot' speech. He was right to make the point that this issue is not just about compensation for food or taking food out of the package. He was right to make the point that a whole range of other areas will go uncompensated, areas where this GST will have a significant impact on low and middle income earners—such as payment of utilities, transport fees, clothing, and bus and train fares to get to and from work.</para><para>It will be some time, I suggest, before the real impact of this tax is measured as it hits low and middle income families. In that respect, I assume we will not hear the howls that would be associated with a piece of legislation that has an immediate impact. But the other side of that equation is that those families in our community who can least afford it are going to feel the impact of this tax over a sustained period, despite whatever rhetoric we hear from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister or, more importantly, whatever rhetoric we hear from the Leader of the Democrats—or the acting Leader of the Democrats, I think it is now, or the temporary Leader of the Democrats. I am not too sure what the position is in respect of that party—is it their spokesman on tax matters or Treasury matters or the potential pretender to the throne for the leadership of the Democrats or the deputy leadership of the Democrats? We will probably know the eventual outcome of the issue of the leadership of the Democrats more quickly than ordinary Australians will 
 feel the impact of this legislation on their living standards.</para><para>On the compensation issue, in the hearings of the GST committee inquiry right across the country we heard from a range of organisations about what impact the GST package would have on them and their organisation. We heard from sporting organisations, welfare bodies, charitable institutions, pensioner organisations, self-funded retirees, more substantial people in the welfare lobby such as ACOSS. The full range of impacts of the GST that would be felt by wide sections of the community were represented. None of those organisations said at any time during that inquiry that the compensation package being put forward by the government was adequate. Since the Democrat GST package was announced and made public, I have seen no evidence from any of the organisations that put submissions to the original inquiry that the current package of compensation is adequate. In fact all of those organisations and all of the comments I have seen with respect to compensation have come down on the side of its total inadequacy.</para><para>What has emerged from the debate since the Democrat GST package was announced is an absolute confusion by a whole range of groups as to what the ultimate impact of the package is going to be upon them and upon the people they represent within the wider community. I think the most descriptive terms for this were those used by the Leader of the Opposition: that there is no other way you can describe this than as a dog's breakfast of a tax. It will turn out to be a dog's breakfast as it is implemented and proceeds to have an impact across our community. More and more people, as they are impacted by this tax, are going to be sitting around scratching their heads and wondering, `Why did we ever get ourselves in the position of allowing people to put such a tax as this upon the Australian community?' Senator Lees, in conjunction with the government, you are not going to be able to deal with the myriad of complaints that are going to emerge from the community once this tax is out in place. You are not going to be able to deal with them because the complaints will be so extensive, so all- 
pervasive that people will not accept any assurances you give them.</para><para>And why would they accept assurances that you give them? You are the one who has fitted them up with this taxation.

You did not have the courage to come in and have yourself photographed voting for them.</para><para>I have to say to you, Senator Lees, that you will get your compensation. Your compensation package is in the making now. Your compensation package will be delivered to you at the next election. That compensation package will be worked out by the people of Australia, particularly by that section of the community that had some belief in the Democrats and actually believed that you were a party of principle and that you put principle before pragmatism in politics. But you turned that on its head over the past couple of weeks. When the issue of compensation is discussed amongst the community, the one thing that those people in the community are going to be focused on is giving you your 
 compensation for your actions over the past couple of weeks.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>6516</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to begin by saying that I do not think that I have heard for a while such an extraordinary lot of nonsense. I realise that we have been hearing over the past couple of days a lot of criticism—and, okay, we expect that—but when one so misrepresents the truth I do find that I actually have to say something about that. To begin with, the one issue where I think you were close to the situation—not quite there, but close—is that we have an ongoing dispute with ACOSS. I can say categorically that never have they said that the deal we have done is any worse—indeed, they have agreed that it is better—than the government's original tax package.</para></talk.start><para>The argument that we are having with them is about two issues. Firstly, it is about the fact that some of the state taxes have stayed. We will have an ongoing debate, no doubt, because they argue that that is regressive and we argue that it is not regressive. We will continue that argument. The second problem we have with them is that, on about page 4 of the document that I think Senator Campbell was just quoting from, we find that they have left a blank space in the section relating to base broadening.</para><para>Why? Apparently it is because they say that it has not actually all been done, and so they are going to ignore it. That is $7.7 billion, which of course skews the figures and which of course give us quite a different answer. Let us look at what the base broadening is. Abolishing the savings rebate is $2 billion; closing FBT loopholes, $760 million; taxing trusts as companies, $760 million; company tax deferrals, $210 million; improved business tax compliance, $1.43 billion; company tax payment arrangements, $2.6 billion—and all of that they have chosen to simply leave out.</para><para>This debate with ACOSS is going to go on, but I can say to you that they have congratulated us on a number of measures in the package. The last release I saw was congratulating us for the increase in rent assistance for those who were renting privately. They have congratulated us on the pension and benefits 
 increases and on the money that we have got for the homeless, et cetera.</para><para>Putting that debate and those discussions aside, because I say that they will go on, I want to go back a little in history. We said very clearly before and during the election that tax reform had to be fair. Once we saw the government's package and analysed it, we said very clearly—as indeed Senator Campbell himself and the Labor Party have said—from the start that this package was unfair. From the start, without looking at what we have done, I do not think it acceptable, Senator Campbell, to simply ignore the changes we have made.</para><para>No doubt you are going to keep doing that. I realise that there is no point in asking you to actually look at the detail. But let us go through why, now, those on the lowest couple of rungs of the ladder are indeed winners—that is, better off than they are under the current tax system. It does not matter which lot of modelling you look at, adding on to the pensioners the low income earners who are actually out in the work force, that group have gained significantly. It does not matter which lot of modelling you look at from among those modellers that were used by the committee, and I will go into some of the details later.</para><para>Looking at various modellings, it is not until you get up into the $100,000 plus per week range that you start seeing losers. Obviously, everyone cannot be winners. They are winners up there if they have not been using some of the systems that the government has just closed, but that $7.7 billion comes from somewhere. If we have people up there who have been using fringe benefits tax options or savings bonuses or have been turning themselves into companies, they are going to be losers. Indeed, across the board, when you model the group over $100,000—because so many of those people using the loopholes were up there—there is a couple of dollars per week. By the time you get to over $200,000, you add a few more dollars per week.</para><para>I acknowledge that that was the government's doing. It was they who closed those loopholes. We have referred several more of 
 the opportunities to maximise the tax take to the business tax package, but the end result is that those at the bottom are a lot better off. I will go through the results from Access Economics and Australia's foremost modellers, Professors Ann Harding and Neil Warren. As I said, they were the ones chosen by all sides on the tax inquiry.</para><para>It is important to note that Professors Harding and Warren found that essentially all of those households modelled for the committee would be better off. They then looked at a second set of modelling, changing the way in which they allowed for tobacco and housing. Clearly, the professors have given us an A+ for our efforts in making this tax package fairer and making the new tax system fairer than the one that we have at the moment. Modelling by Access Economics published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> earlier this month shows that, as a result of the Democrats' changes, a single aged pensioner will be $3.30 a week better off. This is not how much the pension is going up. It will go up, as it usually does, in line with male average weekly earnings. It is the additional above that—it is the extra four per cent that we have now locked in.</para><para>That is a lot more of an increase than the Labor Party ever brought about in 13 years in government in one hit. For an aged pensioner couple, the Access Economics modelling shows that the gain in real terms is over $7 a week, while single unemployed people will be $2.82 a week better off, or more depending on their rent circumstances. The Access Economics findings also highlight that sole parents are clearly the big winners. I will go through the figures. Under their modelling, sole parents with one child are six per cent better off, in other words, over $7 per week. Again, that is after you take the costs associated with the GST into account. That is the net effect.</para><para>Modelling by Professors Ann Harding and Neil Warren also confirms that pensioners and low income earners will make significant gains from the tax reform package that we are considering today. Their research shows that a single aged pensioner, even after paying for the GST and using their worst case scenario—as I will discuss, they have now put tobacco 
 and housing back into their modelling—gains $2.61 a week. This worst case scenario treats us as though we all smoked when only 25 per cent of Australians do—I wish it were fewer—and as though all of us were suddenly going to buy a new house. That is not likely in the year that the tax system changes. Only 15 to 20 per cent are going to do that.</para><para>The third thing that they have done is to base this assumption on the fact that there will be a 0.5 per cent increase in the CPI because there will not be any business tax input reduction to improve the value of the dollar. We have gone further and looked at that assumption, and we believe that is unduly pessimistic. Why? Because they are saying that around $9 billion of business taxes are basically not going to be passed on. That simply is not the case when you look through it. If we take out the impact of tobacco and housing, and go back to the style in which they were modelling for the committee during the inquiry, we get the best case scenario. Under the best case scenario, they are now predicting that the amount by which a single aged pensioner will be better off goes up to over $5 a week. An aged pensioner couple will be up to $8.50 a week better off.</para><para>These findings also predict that students will gain between $2.50 and $3.90 a week, unemployed persons probably up to as much as $4 a week and a disability pensioner between $5.11 and $9.41 a week. Again, under their modelling, sole parents are the big winners, those with one child gaining between $27 and $31 a week, depending on the assumptions that you use. I really do find it extraordinary that the Labor Party can come in here completely ignoring the statistics and modelling that have been in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. They cannot claim not to have seen these somewhere and they cannot criticise the modellers because they were the ones that were used in the committee.</para><para>A further finding by Access Economics is that most food prices will fall under the GST, giving us at the end of the day a two per cent reduction in what we buy. Their modelling also shows that the overall price of health and education services will fall. A criticism levelled in here has been that education is 
 going to go up. It is not. It does not matter what modelling you use, education across the board will fall, and I think that is further good news. Whichever way you look at it, low income families, pensioners and low income single people are going to be better off under the changes than they are now.</para><para>The research from both Access Economics and Professor Harding have left me with little doubt that we have achieved exactly what we set out to do. Our promise in the election campaign was to make this package fairer and greener. We will get onto the green aspects in the next couple days, as we get onto the diesel fuel package. But certainly it is fairer than the current tax system.</para><para>Just a few other details—I did talk a little bit about this yesterday—looking at why food was so important. Food is the single biggest spending item for pensioners and low income earners. About 24 per cent of their income is spent on food, whereas for people on high income it is around 12 per cent. Because food is largely untaxed now, suddenly taxing it would have a much bigger impact on those who spend more on it. By taking food out the Democrats have eliminated the most regressive aspect of the GST, at a cost of $3.6 billion. That is the estimate for the year 2001-02. This means that for pensioners, for example, the price effect from the GST falls from over three per cent down to 1.9 per cent.</para><para>With food out, the entire population now faces a similar cost of living change from the GST. As a result, a flat rate compensation can be paid to deliver real term gains. Under the government's original plan, the four per cent compensation eroded over time, something that Senator Harradine was also concerned about and discussed with the government. If we look at the package we now have, we have insisted that the four per cent compensation be paid as a separate payment on top of the increase in either pensions or unemployment benefits. Remember, pensions are tied to male average weekly earnings and they are set at 25 per cent. This effectively puts them permanently at 26 per cent.</para><para>For those on unemployment benefits, their payment is tied to the consumer price index and this effectively puts it four per cent 
 permanently above the consumer price index. One of the good things is that we have managed to keep the states out of that as far as public housing is concerned. The cost of these pension increases is $800 million a year, year after year, increasing as inflation and male average weekly earnings increase. In achieving this, the Democrats have provided the first real increase for benefits in many cases since the 1970s, certainly the biggest increase since the seventies. There have been a couple since, but nothing as big as this.</para><para>This independent research by Access Economics and Professor Ann Harding and Neil Warren, I believe, puts beyond absolutely any doubt that the changes that we have achieved will result in real gains. It is a good deal for families and it delivers better economic outcomes for Australia. Indeed, I am very pleased to say that we are proud of leaving pensioners, low income earners and the poor much better off. I think effectively what we have done is to inject some $5 billion of fairness into the package.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>6518</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—May I congratulate Senator Lees on her second reading speech in the committee stage! It did not go to any of the clauses of the bill, any of the concepts; she did not even mention the title of the bill. So I assume that that precedent will give me a bit of latitude as I address these issues. Of course, what Senator Lees has done this afternoon is graciously and kindly allowed us two hours in committee to debate this very important bill. She has taken up one-eighth of the time already. No doubt the Democrats this afternoon will line up to take up more time. That is, they come in here with a compact with the government, they gag the debate and then they come in and absorb the debate. They have a legal right to do that; they do not have a moral right to do that.</para></talk.start><para>I suggest that they get back on the chicken run right now and head out the door like they did this morning at 100 miles an hour every time a previous Democrat policy was put in the form of an amendment before this chamber and they were not here to vote against it. Some people have the courage when they reverse to back it up with a vote. All you 
 people on the Democrats side did was make a bolt for the door so there would at least be no record in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> or no photographic record that they were dudding their own membership on previously established views. But, as I say, having guillotined the debate—allowed two hours on this one and an hour on other ones—they come in here and absorb all the time. How generous of them.</para><para>Part of it of course—not this time—is to ask dorothy dix questions across the chamber to dot i's and cross t's that were not dealt with during the deal negotiations so the minister can read out by rote the standard answers. They are basically saying, `The rest of you have no rights.' I can remember the Democrats objecting to guillotines on principle in the past—something I have never done. They were absolutely opposed to them, screaming that it was undemocratic. But the guillotine is in because they want the agony to stop, they want the criticism to stop and they want the scrutiny to stop. They think it will all go away. `Once you have done the deal on the environment, for heaven's sake vote on it that day, don't let anything interfere with that, don't let any phone calls come in.'

But here over the next two hours we are going to see the spectre of anything that was left out of the negotiations, anything that was not covered, going across in the old dorothy dixers and the minister reading out the answers—the Democrats off the hook. But, for heaven's sake, finish the debate as soon as you can. This is not a time for scrutiny. This is not a time for debate. This is not a time for the exposure of the Democrats. No wonder they have a leadership challenge coming up. It is like the good old days of Albania: we are going to have a leadership vote with only one candidate.

 what the GST is costing? Because all the public know at this stage is that GST is a core promise and compensation as reflected in this bill is a non-core promise. You can take that to the bank, Senator Murray. It will be a non-core promise, and it will be eroded over the years and be a defacto income redistribution mechanism. One of the great myths about the GST is that it is basically cost neutral, yet constantly the argument theoretically used for it is that it is going to be a growth tax. You cannot have it both ways. This affects the compensation. If it is a growth tax, it will basically affect the set compensation measures. This is how it has been sold to the states: the GST will be your future, you can get rid of all of your indirect taxes and you will have an ever-broadening tax base into the future, even if you leave it at 10 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If that is the case, it means people are paying more taxes. If that is the case, where are the compensation measures in this bill that will match that taxation growth? They are simply not there; it is simply not guaranteed.

I understand those internal dynamics but, in the end, you get a better result if you are good negotiators, if you do not have the Prime Minister playing you like the local trout in the pond, and that is exactly what happened.

With respect to all those criticisms the Democrats used to make about procedure in the House of Representatives—and I have been present on many occasions when they have said, `It is not a house of review, it does not give serious consideration to legislation'—on this particular area, I never want to hear a pompous, unctuous speech from the Democrats again. I do not want to hear them moralising to us as they have in the 18 years that I have been here that they are in some way morally superior.

Let us look at why the ALP is so upset about us discussing compensation in a tax package. Let us go back in history again. I would like to compare the compensation that we have won in this package with what Labor offered low income earners when it put up sales taxes in 1993. In 1993-94, sales taxes and excises were increased by $3 billion or 0.65 per cent of GDP. In 2000-01, sales taxes and excises will be increased by about the same percentage of GDP—0.65 per cent. In 1993-94, the ALP offered no compensation to social security beneficiaries other than the deferred indexing of pensions and allowances eight months after the tax changes. In 2000-01, as a result of the Democrats' changes, the government will be offering $3 billion of extra compensation in social security payments and $2.5 billion in extra family payments. Indeed, the modelling shows that all major beneficiary groups—those on the bottom two or three rungs of the ladder—will be massively overcompensated.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am sorry to see Senator Ray has left the chamber. He does not seem to want to listen to this. In 1993-94, the Labor Party was using all of the increase in sales taxes to pay for tax 
 cuts. Who did the tax cuts go to? There were no tax cuts below $20,000. The maximum was for those above $50,000 a year. In 2001, all of the extra revenue from the GST effectively goes to social security payments, while two-thirds of the tax cuts are funded by base broadening—the $7.7 billion that we talked about before. Indeed, when you subtract all of the base broadening measures—the trusts, the savings rebate, FBT, crackdowns, business tax compliance, et cetera—these claw back most of the tax cuts for high income earners. Indeed, taxpayers on more than $100,000 a year will, on average, pay more tax under the new tax system than they do now. Labor never, ever managed to deliver tax cuts where two-thirds of them were paid for by base broadening. Not ever. No, their tax cuts were paid for by regressive sales tax increases. I am quite happy defending this deal as far as fairness is concerned. It is much fairer than any tax package Labor delivered in 13 years of government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>6522</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am obliged to respond to some of the quite extraordinary statements that Senator Lees has made today. She asserts that this new package is going to produce substantial benefits for low income earners. She asserts that the Labor government was never able to match any of the payments that are going to be made, according to her, under the Meg Lees GST package. She asserts that the compensation package is now adequate. Having denounced it for months upon months, she goes into a private series of discussions with the Prime Minister and comes out converted. We have said before that there is nothing quite so zealous as the recently converted. The new tories are the Democrats. We see before us today a converted Democrat. Quite clearly we have a political party very much on the right of this government.</para></talk.start><para>What does ACOSS say? What do the welfare groups in this country say about this new Meg Lees GST—this new package of measures? They ask the simple questions: does it protect and improve the living standards of people on low incomes? Does it strengthen public revenues? Is it fair? Does it maintain and improve community access to 
 essential health, education and social welfare services? They say no. This is ACOSS, the people that you have held up as the great paragons of virtue when it comes to the question of social policy in this country. They say that this package exposes those very persons to a higher risk of future social expenditure cuts. When Senator Lees discusses the question of the last Labor government's commitment to social wage policies, she should look at it in the context of actually what was done.</para><para>My understanding is quite simple. There was about $96 a week in social wage payments transferred to ordinary working people in this country by the last Labor government. Since this tory government has been in power, we have seen education, child care, health—every possible area of social expenditure—slashed. This package exposes the poor and the needy of this country to the sorts of policies of this tory government. You are working hand-in-glove with this government to expose them for ever more to the ravages of the bean counters of Finance and Treasury—to the social expenditure cuts that inevitably come from governments such as this one.</para><para>We are going to see community and charity organisations needing more and more, as this government seeks to withdraw from its responsibilities for servicing the people of this country. Those organisations are going to find that they are less able to meet the need to fill the gap resulting from this government's direct policies. This is particularly significant in this particular context today because it is the actions of this group of people at the end of the room—the Democrats—who, in league with this tory government, have sought to gag this parliament, preventing Labor senators in particular from exposing the fundamental inequities of this package.</para><para>Has this position always been held by the Democrats? Clearly, the answer is no. As I say, there is nothing quite so zealous as those recently converted. For many years, we have been witness to the evangelistic high-mindedness and piety of the Democrats, the rectitude of the Democrats, when they lecture other political organisations of this country, 
 in particular the Labor Party, for not being committed to social justice issues, for not being concerned about the environment and for not being concerned about meeting the needs of ordinary Australians. Now the truth is exposed. This unctuous, pretentious, sanctimonious attitude we have seen for so long has been completely exposed.</para><para>As a result of the secret deals done behind closed doors, these Democrats are now demonstrating to the world that they are only too happy to accept the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table. That is all you have done. The fundamental questions remain the same. The basic issues remain the same as they were throughout the Senate inquiries, the process of investigation, in which the Democrats did participate until such time as they were duchessed by a conservative government desperate to secure the passage of this fundamentally flawed and inequitable package.</para><para>What we have of course established, however, is that the normal processes which the Democrats would uphold have been torn aside, have been ripped up. For instance, in only March of this year—she said this on 31 March 1999—Senator Lees told us in a speech to this parliament:</para><para>. . . that it was sometimes uncomfortable to stand between the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and absolute power, by dint of our position in this chamber.</para><para>She found out how uncomfortable it was. She found out all right. In the previous year she had told us that this was a `thuggish' government. That is how she described them then. On 4 March 1998, on a matter of public interest with regard to the Howard government's commitment to parliamentary processes—or for what she said at that time was their lack of it—she said that there was a contempt for the parliament by this government. She said that this was a `bullying' Prime Minister. She said that this was a government that had sought to turn their intentions to attempt to pre-empt the decisions of the Senate.</para><para>Of course, we are seeing just what that has all meant. As far as she is concerned, when it is issues of concern to the Democrats that have not been given a public hearing, there is 
 no time like the present to discuss them. But when the issues are locked up in private session between the government and the Democrats then it is quite all right to pre-empt the decisions of the Senate. She went on to say on that occasion:</para><para>It is no secret that this thuggish government—and I stress the word thuggish because that is what it is—has set its sights on the independence of the Senate, the body described by the former Auditor-General John Taylor as the last effective brake on executive government.</para><para>Well, so much for those noble sentiments. She went on to say:</para><para>This government has shown far greater contempt for this parliament than any government in memory. Democracy and the people of Australia are the losers if this government with its born-to-rule mentality succeeds in avoiding the checks and balances provided by the parliament. Australia will not be served by a parliament that cannot hold the government to account, that does not provide a balanced and fair forum for debate on day-to-day issues, that does not provide a pressure valve for the public to actually have a say to express its views on government proposals that are either plainly wrong or unpopular.</para><para>It is quite apparent that those are sentiments which are now null and void. It is not a view that she currently holds because she is quite prepared to support the guillotine to prevent an examination of the issues which are quite fundamental to whether or not this is a fair compensation package for what everyone knows to be a very regressive tax which will inevitably hurt the poor, will inevitably hurt people on low incomes and will inevitably work to the disadvantage of people who can least defend themselves.</para><para>That is why people look to this parliament—that is, to seek redress from the way in which our society works. It is the weak in our society who need this parliament the most. It is the weak in our society who look to politicians who claim to be interested in social justice issues to come into this parliament and put their views, to express their interests and to demonstrate a genuine commitment to equity. But what we have under this new government-Democrat alliance is that these principles will be closed down. There will not be debate. There will not be an opportunity to assess the validity of the 
 claims made by the Leader of the Democrats when it comes to the issue of just how fair this package is.</para><para>Might I say that this is a proposition that has clearly been assessed by ACOSS with regard to its concern that this package seeks to benefit those who are already wealthy. For instance, it says that the tax cuts are available for taxpayers under this proposal, but the predominant benefit will go to those who enjoy incomes of over $60,000 a year to the tune of some $62 per week, thus widening inequality. The ACOSS analysis, which I have before me, states:</para><para>What it shows is that this government's ambitions to fund large income tax cuts from those on above average incomes is still not matched by an equally ambitious drive to close income tax loopholes and shelters. As a result, the tax cuts are not funded in an equitable and economically sustainable way.</para><para>Could there be no clearer indication of this principle that ACOSS has argued here than what we have seen today with regard to the amendments moved by the Labor Party to stop the high rollers in our casinos enjoying the fruits of the largesse of the taxpayer? What did the Democrats do when it came to defending the Ron Walkers of this world? What did they do? As we have all said here today, they have engaged in the chicken walk. It is a bit of a waddle out the door, out the back, because you do not want to be seen for what you are—as apologists for the high rollers at Crown Casino.</para><para>I am particularly concerned and very disappointed by Senator Allison in this regard. She has been one of the strongest critics of the iniquitous social policies that are inherently involved with the encouragement of the casinos, particularly Crown in Melbourne. We in Victoria are seeing just what sort of a damaging impact that that casino has had. What has she done today? She has, by her actions today, along with her colleagues, walked out that door and allowed that amendment to be defeated and, as a consequence, provided millions and millions of dollars to the very high rollers that she has, up until so recently, complained so bitterly about. In relation to what this has been demonstrated to be, ACOSS says, `On fairness grounds alone, the revised package is unacceptable in its 
 present form.' I think that in this way we can clearly show that ACOSS, on this occasion, is right.</para><para>However, I will not stick with that proposition. The Democrats have also demonstrated in the past a keen commitment to education. I am very disappointed that their actions in this debate have not reflected that past commitment. For instance, only last year the education minister said that the average family, under this government's proposals, would be some $40 to $50 a week better off. He said that the improvement in their benefits would come in very large measure as a result of the reduction in costs of schooling in particular.</para><para>Senator Lees says to us today that there has been substantial modelling that demonstrates the correctness of her position. I ask: what modelling? What modelling has been done on the effect of increased prices for average families that will now have to be met as a result of this GST package? What modelling has been undertaken which demonstrates the proposition, whether it is incorrect, that we heard in evidence before the Senate education committee that average families would be in the order of $200 per child worse off under this government's policies? That is the equivalent of 50 per cent of the compensation package. Fifty per cent of the compensation would be eaten up in increased education costs alone—no other measures. You can go through the list if you like.</para><para>Just think about what that means—increased costs in regard to uniforms, school camps, excursions, sports, textbooks, paper and photocopying, travelling to and from school, school photos, computer disks, materials for assignments, attendance at concerts or other entertainments by the school, elective subjects, general fees, various levies, contributions to PC associations, purchase of fundraising materials. All of these issues, according to the material put before the Senate committee, showed that there would be an increase of some $2,062 per annum in primary school and $3,103 per annum in secondary school for a child who wishes to have the opportunity to participate in an education setting. </para><para>I am sure Senator Lees will get up and say, `Some of these issues have now been addressed in our negotiations.

If we were given the time to discuss it, we might establish precisely where it is, but on my perusal of this legislation we will not find it here. If there are any matters outstanding, the Prime Minister, in a letter to `Dear Meg' of 27 June, says that the government will write to the Commissioner of Taxation to seek a ruling on the definition of educational services that will be GST free.

Senator Conroy indicated that Senator Carr is capable of much greater abuse. I accept that as a possibility. I must say that it was parliamentary abuse, not the worst kind. I do wonder what its source is. I do know that many Labor members and senators feel very strongly about the GST and are against it; others have a more moderate view and some are supporters of it. But the issue here is that of tactics. I wonder whether one of the reasons for the outrage, especially when you have a master tactician such as Senator Robert Ray come and talk to us, is that of tactics, because if the Labor Party had not taken so very long in the early debate they would have forced Senator Harradine to a decision earlier. We would not have been offered the opportunity to negotiate and this whole business would have been out of the way.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The tactic or strategy of the Labor Party, having done the hard yards in the committee process—and Senator Cook and Senator Conroy really did do the hard yards in terms of the select committee, along with Senator Ferguson and, may I say, myself—was not to offer any improvements to the bills, not to support any improvements to the bills but simply to vote against the whole thing. The consequence of that is that we did not have the benefit, which we often do have, of the quality of Labor's researchers and senators providing appropriate amendments and assistance as to where we should go.</para><para>The other aspect of all this in terms of tactics and strategies has been their emphasis continually on the undesirability of making food GST free and their constant comment—again repeated by Senator Robert Ray, which may not be the view of all Labor senators—on the disadvantages and the unattractiveness of making food GST free. In fact twice, although they have told us very clearly on the record it was for strategic reasons, they have voted to tax food.</para><para>You cannot stand up and start talking at us about social compensation measures we have won and all the billions and billions of extra dollars that we have changed this package by for pensioners, for allowees and for the homeless, and then say at the same time, `But, by the way, we want to tax food and take away $3.6 billion worth of benefits which go, amongst other things, to low income people.' Twenty-four per cent of all food is consumed by low income people. Here we have the Labor Party accusing us of not providing sufficient improvements and increases on the social security side, and yet they have voted on the record twice for food to be taxed. The consequence of that is extraordinary because it indicates that they are perfectly willing to make a $3.6 billion hole in an advantage which all Australians get which they would not have had if we had not interceded in this.</para><para>They have also made great play of ACOSS's appraisal and analysis of the package, and I think they are quite right to take the political opportunity that that offers them. However, we should examine exactly what ACOSS has said. ACOSS, in their summary produced on 24 June 1999, said:</para><para>The modelling of the original and revised tax packages conducted by Professors Warren and Harding shows three things:</para><para>First, the Government's original package would have left many low income households (especially pensioners) worse off and substantially increased inequality in Australia, notwithstanding the benefits in that package for many low income families with children.</para><para>This was mainly due to the fact that consumption taxes (including a GST on food) would have been increased by $6 billion to fund unfair tax cuts that offered $86 per week to all tax-payers on $75,000 per annum or more.</para><para>I should stop there and say that Ray Regan of the accountants association has issued a press release today which actually condemns us for taking away the benefits the rich were going to enjoy. It seems that the game here is to kick the Democrats from whichever side you are on. ACOSS went on and said:</para><para>Second, the changes introduced by the Democrats significantly improve the bottom line for pensioners and low income families and significantly reduce the benefits of the package for high income earners. 
</para><para>This is due to the exemption for basic foods—</para><para>which Labor have voted to have taxed—</para><para>and the reduction in tax cuts for those earning more than $60,000 per annum. These changes are a major step in the right direction.</para><para>Then comes the qualification:</para><para>However, more detailed analysis of the assumptions underpinning the research suggests that some low income groups (especially unemployed and low full-time wage earners without children) still face the risk of a decline in their living standards in the short term. In this context, the recent decision to increase Rent Assistance for social security recipients by 7% instead of 4% provides a welcome additional buffer of around $1pw for many unemployed singles and couples without children.</para><para>That is an extra $33 million that the Democrats negotiated this week. They continue:</para><para>Third, while these changes appear to protect the majority of low-income households from a fall in their living standards in the short term, the revised package is still likely to substantially increase inequality.</para><para>We have to go to their reasons for saying so. They put their fundamental emphasis on the fact that the bank account debit tax has not been taken out of the package. That is the economic reason for saying so. We believe that the bank account debit tax, whilst it is an indirect tax—and all indirect taxes are regressive, as people in this chamber know, including the wholesale sales tax—is not regressive in the sense that ACOSS are saying it is.</para><para>Secondly, if you look in the ACOSS package, under income tax base broadening they have left a hole. There are something like $7.7 billion worth of base broadening measures which have not been taken into account by ACOSS which have been announced by the government—that is, abolishing the savings rebate of $2 billion; closing FBT loopholes of $760 million; taxing trusts as companies, $760 million; company tax deferrals, $210 million; improved business tax compliance, $1.43 billion; and company tax payment arrangements, $2.6 billion. The reason they say they cannot take it into account would be the same reason that Labor would advance—that is, it is not yet law. Yes, that is so, it is not yet law, but it is proposed by the ANTS package to make it law.</para><para>The question is: will that amount be adjusted? It is almost certain, through the process of politics and the Senate, that that $7.7 billion figure will be adjusted in some way. I know that Senator Conroy, for instance, is a strong advocate of trusts being taxed as companies. The fact is that the government has made a clear commitment for taxation in that area. Whether the National Party, in terms of its recent announcements, will adjust that or not we will have to see.</para><para>We are not foolish in this area. We are aware that there are political pressures to change this. But anyone who thinks that the government will walk away from $7.7 billion worth of base broadening measures completely, or even in a majority way, I think is wrong. If you start to factor those kinds of things back into the package, you see that the package is very advantageous to Australians. The key issue is the bank account debits tax in ACOSS's mind. They say:</para><para>This is mainly due to the way in which the exemption for basic foods is paid for, by maintaining regressive financial taxes such as Bank Account Debits Tax.</para><para>You can use regressive, as I said, for any indirect tax. They go on:</para><para>While the GST is less regressive with basic food exempted, consumption taxes still increase by $5 billion per annum and all tax-payers on more than $60,000 per annum still receive a tax cut of $62 per week.</para><para>We know they wanted those tax cuts lowered.

This is why they get so upset with the Senate—they believe if they can just get the numbers in the Lower House, they have complete right not just to run the country in terms of monetary policy, but to stop all dissent, to actually push aside or eliminate from any public view all those who oppose them or in any way disagree with them. The pure economic rationalists are so wrapped up in their proper set of numbers and complete control of power . . . effectively silencing all their opposition."</para><para>There are two points I would like to make out of that, and I am glad Senator Lees has returned. She talks about the economic rationalists. The Holy Grail to the economic rationalists is the GST. That is why it is compulsory for members of the European Union to have the GST.

This is not what was passed by your membership. What was passed by your membership is on the record, and this does not come close. So the Democrat policy on tax and the GST has been exposed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Then you go to the Warren-Harding piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline>, which is so proudly quoted as proof that this package is fair and that there are no losers. Unfortunately, we now have Senator Lees having to grasp that claim—like the government—that there are no losers under the new, revised package. As John Hewson said, `It's just a Goebbels chant.' It is no more true today than it was when the government started running it around. It is a terrible disappointment to see those involved in the Democrats—the high moral ground politicians, those who are better than all the rest of us because they are just not into grubby politics; they are into principle and policy and those sorts of things—adopting a government tactic of a Goebbels mantra. That is what this is. I will go to some of the raw figures before I get to why it is a Goebbels chant. This is from George Megalogenis's article, which was on the front of the Warren-Harding analysis:</para><para>Single workers earning up to $35,000 a year, dual-income families on up to $65,000 and pensioner couples with modest private incomes are the forgotten people of John Howard's tax reform.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>In contrast, upper middle-income earners on $60,000 and single-income families on around $35,000 to $40,000 have replaced higher-income earners as the taxpayers who win the most out of the revised GST.</para><para>Some of that is good. They have kept or become slightly improved on where they were. But we are still seeing a massive shift of the bulk of the tax cuts up the income scale. What happens to some of the other categories that the Democrats do not want to mention? If you go through the fine print, the detail, of the Warren-Harding analysis:</para><para>Single workers on $15,000 to $35,000 a year will gain between 94c—</para><para>no losers, 94c—</para><para>and $5.22 a week out of the compromise tax package. But those on $50,000 to $90,000 will get between $30.79 and $39.38.</para><para>I will just repeat that: 94c and $5.22 as compared with $30 and nearly $40. That is what this package does. That is why I oppose it and I am proud to oppose it. I will vote every single time to defeat it. This is a package that delivers to the rich; it does not deliver to the battlers. The article goes on to say:</para><para>In percentage terms, this reflects a boost to disposable income of 0.3 to 1 per cent for the battlers, compared to 2.9 to 5.1 per cent for the well-off.</para><para>That is the revised Democrat government package: Warren-Harding. That comes along with the following statistic:</para><para>On the other hand, a dual-income couple on $45,000 with one child aged between 5 and 12 is only 0.1 per cent (39c) better off, exploding the myth of the family-friendly tax package.</para><para>That is Mr Megalogenis, who is known to many in this chamber. He has been an avid supporter of the GST. He is not here to try and run the GST down; he has been an avid supporter of the GST. He has exposed your claim that nobody will be worse off.</para><para>And why is even this not the true story? It is because, as has been debated at length, it relies on assumptions. A couple of the assumptions were mentioned as recently as 
 yesterday—by who else but Ms Harding, on ABC Radio here in Canberra? When asked whether it seemed everybody was better off, Ms Harding said:</para><para>There are a couple of important assumptions, as always for economists, that underlie the liftout in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> . One is that when we calculate how much extra tax you are going to pay we base it on average expenditure pattern for people like you. So there is always going to be some people who are above the average and some people who are below the average, just because they have different spending habits.</para><para>So they have averaged the results. These are not real people; they have created averages. When the average gain for one income group is 39c, that means that some people may get 40c and some people may get 38c. What you have got is averages.</para><para>I know that when the original Warren-Harding analysis was produced for the Senate inquiry, Senator Murray and Senator Lees could not believe that Warren and Harding did not break down the information, in the way that we wanted, that we paid them to produce. And they have done it again. They have not produced figures that are based on real people; they are actually based on averages. Averages can mean that maybe one person on that income is $1 better off and maybe someone else is $1 worse off. There are those terrible words, `worse off'. Warren and Harding have never hidden the fact that an average can disguise losers. Those were Ms Harding's exact words before the Senate inquiry: averages disguise losers.</para><para>To put out press releases and claim that this revised package shows that there are no losers is a travesty of the truth. You can laugh, Senator Woodley, but you have got to look at yourself in the mirror each morning and sleep at night, because you are supporting a package that disguises the losers with averages. There are losers, and there are losers in vulnerable areas. You set yourself the challenge that you wanted to make people better off. Senator Murray said during the inquiry, `Why don't we have a system that sees the poor better off and people lifted up?' The figures in here are averages. There are losers in this package; not everybody in this package is a winner. But you have got the Goebbels 
 chant down pat now, Senator Lees: no losers, no losers. John Hewson's statement applies as much to you as it applied to the government before the revised package. You can keep pretending, but you are going to have to sleep at night knowing that you have supported a tax package that increases money to the rich and makes other people worse off. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>6531</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is the filibuster you have when people are mad because they cannot filibuster forever. The people who have made themselves quite irrelevant in national debate generally, and particularly in tax reform, are now wanting to spend hours and hours of Senate time saying nothing much at all about tax reform—it is simply intimidation and abuse of fellow senators. To have odds and sods in the Labor opposition coming in here and trying to while away the time by talking about economic rationalism and talking about democracy in political parties just shows it up for what it is.</para></talk.start><para>The only virtue of Senator Conroy's contribution is that it was not delivered at the same level of decibels that we received from most of the other Labor senators. I think most of them have conducted their contributions at a level that is quite in excess of what is needed by the acoustics of the Senate. I heard Senator Crossin make a comment about Senator Carr's contribution. She said that he did not even get into first gear. I think the senators present would probably have a case for doing something about occupational health with the delivery volume that Senator Carr usually addresses us at. I think at least we could ask for his microphone to be turned off, because we can hear him all too well and he certainly does not need the assistance of a microphone. I think he must have spent a lifetime at strike rallies with a megaphone. He certainly does not need amplification in here.</para><para>The sad thing is that this irrelevant opposition thinks it can try and make a case by shouting and by attempting to intimidate senators. Senator Lees and her colleagues do not deserve the treatment that has been meted 
 out to them here today. People should understand it is not just what has been meted out today—this intimidation has been going on for days.

Australia does not deserve that sort of an opposition; it deserves better. As long as the senators opposite continue to portray the Labor Party in that light, so they will stay in opposition.</para><para>Senator Lees spoke about Labor's record back in the earlier part of this decade. I want to remind the chamber of the l-a-w tax cuts, the ones that Labor actually put into legislation and said were going to be delivered. They went to an election promising the Australian people that they would give l-a-w tax cuts. What happened? The people did not get the tax cuts. But Labor did more than that. They did not go to that election saying they were going to jack up the wholesale sales tax.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Schacht interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator McKiernan)</name></talker><para>—Senator Schacht, I call you to order.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>—Oh no, Labor came back into government after the election, dumped their promised l-a-w tax cuts and hiked up the wholesale sales tax. Was there a cent of compensation or concern for those on low incomes or social security payments then? Not at all, and that is what makes this debate this afternoon so absolutely sick. The track record of the ALP is so bad. They are not interested in tax reform for Australia for the next century but they were certainly into dudding the voters in the 1990s, and shame on them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the Labor senators said earlier that there are no real compensation or substantial benefits under the tax package for low income earners. I would point out that not only is there substantial compensation under the bill that we are discussing but there is the very fact that the GST revenue goes to the states, who are the service providers and are the first port of call for the people of Australia. It goes to where the people who are on the lowest incomes need public sector services. Services such as public hospitals, roads, public transport, welfare, aged care in the home, welfare care and policing—these are the things which people on low incomes need, things which currently are starved of funds because the states do not have a growth tax as they will get with a GST.</para><para>Do not forget that one of the substantial benefits of these tax reforms is the melding together of the tax and social security systems so that poverty traps are diminished. Incentives for people on low incomes, particularly with children, to take up even low paid work are enhanced. That is very much an under-recognised benefit that comes out of this tax reform package. For people on low incomes with kids, I think the reduction from about 85.5 cents in the dollar, lost by a combination of increased taxation and a reduction in family payments, down to about 61 cents in the dollar is a considerable improvement on anything that the ALP were prepared to do for people on low incomes. So, 
 once again, their rhetoric is transparent for what it is.</para><para>Let me go briefly through the measures that are before us now in the government amendments. These are done by way of increases in payment rates, more generous income and assets test free areas and income test taper rates. These are all very important but of course the ALP wasted its time in this debate; it was not even prepared to look at those to see what they meant for people who were on low incomes. It is very important to raise the assets test free areas, to have more generous income test areas and to have more generous income test taper rates—graduated taper rates. It is true, and I welcome the fact, that after constructive discussions with the Australian Democrats we have decided to make a number of amendments to the bill.</para><para>I would summarise them in this way. There is the increase in rent assistance of seven per cent. That means that changes are being made to the bill to increase the rate of rent assistance by seven per cent, instead of the current four per cent. To avoid double compensation, CPI increases that occur after 19 March 2001 will be adjusted until the real increase in rent assistance is five per cent. The adjustment of CPI increases for benefits and allowances—all benefits and allowances are increased by four per cent up front. To avoid double compensation and to ensure a two per cent real increase in maximum rates of assistance, the adjustment provisions—as they apply to social security and veterans benefits and allowances—will be modified so that CPI increases are adjusted from the first indexation day after 19 March 2001, and adjustment occurs until the overall increase in benefit and allowance rates is two per cent.</para><para>There is a four per cent increase in pension rates and the introduction of a new pension supplement. As currently drafted, the bill provides for a four per cent increase in social security and veterans pensions. Under these amendments, instead of including the four per cent increase in the maximum basic rate, a new pension supplement is introduced. The rate of the pension supplement is set at four per cent of the maximum basic rate and after that is subject to CPI indexation in March and 
 September each year. This is consistent with the indexation arrangements for maximum basic rates of pension. By keeping the maximum basic rate and four per cent pension supplement separate, pensioners are assured of a maximum basic rate of pension that is at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, and the additional pension supplement. The supplement is always in addition to the 25 per cent of MTAWE guarantee and ensures that pensioners receive a two per cent real increase in their pensions over and above whatever is the impact of the GST on prices, and that will be maintained forever.</para><para>The bill also provides substantial relaxation of the income tests for pensions and allowances. There is a 2.5 per cent increase in the income and assets test free areas for all pensions and allowances and there is a reduction in the pension income test taper from 50 cents to 40 cents in the dollar. The 40 per cent taper will mean that over 50,000 aged people will become newly eligible for the age pension and the associated pensioner concession card. You just wonder how the diatribe that we have been listening to for the last hour and a half could possibly have anything to do with what is actually in this bill, which is beneficial to Australians, which is something which was never done to any degree at all by the previous government when they changed the tax system. They just simply hiked taxes up and gave no compensation.</para><para>Senator Lees used dollars in her comments about the impact on pensioners of these changes. The advice that I have received is that, taking the rent assistance into account, the net cash gain for a single pensioner renting privately is $8.95 per fortnight or approximately $4.50 a week. The equivalent figure for a pensioner couple is a $15.70 increase per fortnight or approximately $7.85 a week. Compare that with the compensation provided by Labor when they welched on the l-a-w tax cuts and they hiked up the wholesale sales tax without a jot of compensation.</para><para>I welcome the Democrats' recognition that this is a far fairer tax package than any 
 produced by Labor in 13 years of government. I commend it to the Senate. It is what will be needed by Australia in the century ahead and is very good at protecting those who are most vulnerable, for whom my portfolio has a special interest. I only hope, when this legislation is passed with the support of the Democrats, that over the break the ALP will look seriously at itself.</para><para>Australia does not deserve an opposition which plays the games you are playing, spending your time in the gutter, not working on policy matters. Being obstructive and intimidatory is not a reputation which any political party should be aiming for. I hope that people like Senator Cook and some of his other former ministers will think about their future in parliament. They are obviously restless and frustrated and can see themselves in opposition for many years. Maybe they should be looking for gainful employment somewhere else. I have heard some of my colleagues suggest some of the occupations that they might well be suited for, but I do not intend to produce them on the public record. Nevertheless, I wish them well in whatever career they chose and think they should be thinking about it very seriously over the break.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>6534</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish not to comment on the restlessness or frustration of the opposition but to make a few general points in relation to the <inline ref="r701">A New Tax System (Compensation Measures Legislation Amendment) Bill 1998</inline> . I only half agree with the minister, that is, I believe the compensation measures do make the package fairer than the original package put by the government to the electorate, to the community and to our party for discussion. I commend the efforts of my leader and other senators in negotiating amendments that would improve this package, but I need to put on record my decision not to support the goods and services tax per se and the fact that on a number of occasions today I have exercised my right as an Australian Democrat to vote according to conscience. In some cases, that can mean disagreeing with and differing from the position of some of my colleagues.</para></talk.start><para>To take a point made by Senator Conroy, I believe that the Democrats are a better party, that we are a party based on principle. One of our fundamental principles is recognition of that right, indeed encouragement of that right. Where we may differ or disagree, we grant all our elected members of parliament the right to cross the floor or exercise a conscience vote, but we are bound by our constitution to explain to our members why we choose to exercise that right.</para><para>I am also cognisant of claims and assessments that have been made by various organisations and lobby groups, including ACOSS, as to the fairness or otherwise of this package. I was very much an integral part of the Senate Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education. I participated in those committees and I signed off on a report which, among a number of its recommendations, concluded that books should be tax exempt. I was a signatory to that report in my own right as a Democrat and I was the person who signed that report. I put that on record as one of my many reasons earlier today—I do not seek to reflect on a vote of the Senate—for my not supporting a tax on books.</para><para>All the Democrat senators support tax reform. However, we may differ in our preferred ideas as to how to achieve that. I know all of us support measures that we perceive are sustainable and equitable. I do not see a goods and services tax as a necessary or fundamental component of tax reform, whether it is being proposed by the Labor Party or by the Liberals. Certainly I acknowledge Senator Robert Ray's comments in relation to consistency. In this debate, I seek not only to stand up for what I believe in but also to be consistent. I believe I have been consistent, certainly in all the times I have run for election—in 1993 and in this last campaign—in relation to my views on this issue.</para><para>One of my main concerns in relation to the bill before us and the ones we have dealt with and are yet to deal with has been the government's narrow focus in this taxation debate. The government has made two central claims throughout the debate. The first is that 
 the current taxation system is broken and needs to be replaced. I believe there are fundamental difficulties with our taxation system, especially in relation to fairness and simplicity, but the system is not entirely broken. It continues to provide revenue which funds the diminishing services of government. However, areas such as health, unemployment benefits and higher education continue to be squeezed under this government. It is my belief that these particular services provide a way out for the most disadvantaged in our society. I certainly agree that a society must be measured by the treatment of its most vulnerable.</para><para>The second claim is that the bills we have been dealing with, including the transitional provisions and compensation bills, constitute in themselves a complete tax reform package. I am disappointed that the government has not been willing to investigate taxation reform in what I consider a consultative, considered or comprehensive way. I am certainly concerned that business tax reform has been regarded almost as a postscript in this debate. Certainly as employment spokesperson—and this view is echoed by all the Australian Democrats—we are all disappointed that the issue of payroll tax was not dealt with.</para><para>I do believe that we need taxation reform but I do not believe that the only guiding principle should be the adequacy of the revenue stream. It has been said that tax reform is one of the most important mechanisms of social justice available. With this view in mind, I state my belief that fairness is one of the most important principles which must guide taxation reform overall. I do not believe that this package will make the Australian taxation system fairer. We need to broaden the tax base and we need to bring about a better tax culture.</para><para>On that point, I suggest that bringing about that culture will not be assisted by a tax on books. No matter what compensation packages we debate, I do not believe that that difficulty of taxing knowledge in the form of books will be alleviated. However, I do commend the work of Senators Lees and Allison in particular in working with the book and publishing industries to negotiate some 
 form of compensation package. However, for me, the principle remains unchanged: a tax on books is a tax on knowledge. This is not simply a symbolic objection. It is also about the deleterious impact that this tax will have on the book industry, on jobs, local authors and Australian publications.

The bill before the chair is a bill about compensation for the GST. People might wonder why it is that we have taken the attitude we have. We have taken the attitude to this bill for the simple reason that if you do not have a GST you do not need to compensate for it. All of the measures that the minister is so proudly expounding as measures, supported by the Australian Democrats, are necessary because you are imposing a new 10 per cent GST on everything. That is why compensation is necessary. You will excuse us if we take the view: why would you need to compensate if you did not impose the tax? This government has not shown itself to be altruistic and concerned about the poor or the needy before and, by its own actions—and I exempt some honourable senators from this statement—nor have the Australian Democrats. Up until now, they have based themselves on what ACOSS have said. We had a speech from Senator Murray referring to the ACOSS press release. I remind the Senate of the oath of witnesses: you are supposed to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Senator Murray told the truth as far as some parts of this press statement are concerned but I point out, with the greatest respect, that he did not tell the whole truth. This statement says in its fourth paragraph:</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Senate should not pass this package in its current form.</para><para>Listening to what Senator Murray said you would have thought ACOSS were approving of this package. They are enjoining us to resist it. That and a number of other reasons are why the Labor Party is opposed to it. The 
 St Vincent de Paul Society, who do know something about underprivileged people in Australia because they work with them, day in day out, ask us to oppose this package too. So let us cut this cant that the poor are getting a good deal here. The organisations that represent them do not believe so. They have said so in writing and have asked us to act to prevent these changes.</para><para>I conclude by acknowledging that on a Friday afternoon you get some very good speeches in this chamber. Three Fridays ago, Senator Harradine stood up and condemned this package. He said, `I cannot' and decided he could not vote for it. We have just had a speech of conscience from Senator Natasha Stott Despoja saying that she will not support this legislation either, despite the fact that it has been worked out by her party. It was a statement of conscience, and I commend her for her moral courage in making it. I would suggest though that if other Democrats in this place have conscience they follow her lead and turn down this proposition that has been put on the table by the Prime Minister and Senator Lees.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Order!

 to the federal election, when a gentleman whom I believe to be named Mr Turner, who was a solicitor operating in Sydney—and who later became a Senate candidate, incidentally—got some publicity about the matter of dual nationality and the ability of those holding dual nationality to stand for membership of the Australian parliament. I recall getting my picture on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>  and thinking at that time that I had finally made a mark in public life. I have learned a lot since then.</para><para>A number of members of the federal parliament at that time sought advice from the Attorney-General's Department and were given advice that perhaps, if we did hold dual nationality, we should take steps to relinquish the nationality of our birth. Certainly, in my case, I did. I believe that probably all did so; I do not know for certain. I know that one particular member at the time invited people like Mr Turner to challenge him in the High Court to show whether he had relinquished his citizenship. That was Mr Graeme Campbell, the former member for Kalgoorlie, who had been born in London. He is no longer a member of parliament. There was no action taken against Mr Campbell then, but a number of us did take measures at that time to relinquish the second nationality.</para><para>We also had the matter addressed at a later time in 1988, when the nationality of a colleague in this place, Senator Woods, was addressed in the High Court, and Senator Woods lost his seat for the reason that he was not an Australian citizen. But the matter of dual nationality was indeed addressed.</para><para>It was addressed again in the High Court case in 1992 of Sykes v. Cleary, when the then member for Wills was ruled ineligible to hold office because of another provision of the Constitution and two of the other candidates were ruled to be ineligible to be included in the count-back because of their holding a second nationality and not taking steps to relinquish that nationality.</para><para>My party, the Australian Labor Party, took all these challenges very seriously. I known that personally, because each time in elections that I have participated in, either as a candidate or as a manager of some other function 
 ary in the election, our attention has always been brought to the fact that this provision exists in the Australian Constitution and that we have to be aware of it at all times. To the best of my knowledge, in all of the campaigns in which I have been involved—and not only at a Commonwealth election but also at a state election and, indeed, in the state of Western Australia, at a local government election—the Australian citizenship provisions of the Constitution do indeed apply and the candidates are consciously aware of them.</para><para>The fact of the High Court decision of the other day—when Mrs Hill, the senator-elect from Queensland, was ruled out because she was not smart enough to keep up with the public debate on these points—does not give Ms Hanson, goose that she is, the right to issue press statements such as the one she has issued today, `Good for the goose—good for the gander'.

By the north, I mean the north of Western Australia, the north of Queensland and the Northern Territory. I make these observations partly from my own personal experience of having lived in the Pilbara for 22 years and also from the conclusions drawn about FBT based on my observations of its application to the mining industry, the pastoral industry, local government and small business. I will also draw upon a report on the impact of the fringe benefits tax on the Pilbara region of Western Australia, prepared by BSD Consultants and others for the Pilbara Development Commission—the board of which I was formerly a member.</para></talk.start><para>The fringe benefits tax was introduced on 1 July 1986 and was designed to tax the non-monetary sectors of the `remuneration packages' that executives of big companies in places like Sydney and Melbourne received. Such benefits included houses in up-market suburbs, luxury cars, private school fees for children, holiday airfares and so on. Other countries such as the United States, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa also have fringe benefits taxes designed to minimise the distinctions between monetary and non-monetary remuneration for high paid metropolitan based executives or `fat cats', as they are colloquially known.</para><para>In many of these countries it was recognised that the FBT could have unintended effects in regional areas and specific exemptions were provided so as not to hinder regional development. However, this has not been the case in Australia, and when the FBT was introduced it had an immediate deleterious impact on the towns of the Pilbara region. Until the mid-1980s, the great Pilbara iron ore and salt companies largely ran their operations locally with senior management, administrative and engineering staff on-site in the Pilbara towns where they lived and happily enjoyed the beautiful winter weather and relaxed lifestyle of the north-west. These families were high income earners and contributed to the local economy and community. To meet their personal needs, excellent educational, health and recreational services were provided and subcontractors established a multitude of businesses to service the needs of the mining industry.</para><para>These developments had a very positive impact on regional development in the Pilbara with modern new towns being established for a population which grew from a few hundred in the early 1960s to around 55,000 by the mid-1970s. Those working directly for the mining industry—subcontractors and in support services for the population in the mining and port towns, such as school teachers, civil servants, employees of local government and so on—had for the most part their living conditions subsidised to compensate for living 1,000 miles north of Perth. For example, housing rentals were subsidised as was 
 the cost of electricity for the airconditioning necessary to alleviate the summer heat. Meals for workers in messes at mines and railway yards and other workplaces were also subsidised and were either cheap or free. Many employees and their families were provided with an annual airfare to the city which was regarded as a necessity for people living in remote areas. While these subsidies were generous, they were necessary both to attract a work force and supporting services to what was then regarded as a very remote area and to ensure that a near average suburban life style was possible in these areas.</para><para>But when the fringe benefits tax was introduced, all of these subsidies became taxable benefits. The impact on the Pilbara and other remote areas was both swift and devastating. To avoid FBT the big Pilbara mining companies quickly transferred management, and all senior staff not physically involved in the extraction and export of iron ore, to Perth. Many small businesses and subcontractors closed down because the tax on subsidised housing and airconditioning could not be afforded. Small mining operations and pastoralists were similarly affected, as tax was now payable on meals and housing provided to employees such as shearers. I personally witnessed these outcomes, which resulted in a significant loss of population in the mining and port towns of the Pilbara. As I learned when I attended North Australia Development Conferences, these adverse outcomes on regional development occurred across the whole of northern Australia and were directly attributable to the perhaps unintended impact of the fringe benefits tax and the fact that the Australian government had not provided any exemptions to support regional development—as had been done, for example, under the Canadian fringe benefits tax regime.</para><para>While these adverse impacts were obvious to those who lived in the north and were concerned about regional development, it proved very difficult to make bureaucrats in Canberra, under various governments, understand the seriousness of the negative impact of the FBT, particularly on the mining and pastoral industries, which are both so vital to the Australian economy. The negative impact 
 on regional development has been compounded by the mining industry turning to fly-in fly-out operations as a cost-cutting measure. Fly-in fly-out operations mean that, instead of building a town to service a mine site, a camp is constructed and the work force is flown in and out from the nearest capital city. Were the Pilbara mining industry to be set up today, there would be no new towns built like Newman, Tom Price, Paraburdoo, Pannawonica, Dampier, Karratha or Wickham.</para><para>These subjective impressions of some of the negative impacts of the FBT on the Pilbara and, by implication, the whole of northern Australia have recently been confirmed by a study jointly undertaken for the Pilbara Development Commission by BSD Consultants, the Centre for Regional Economic Analysis of the University of Tasmania, and McKessor Tieleman and Co., chartered accountants. This report found that:</para><para>the present system of FBT in Australia has had a significantly negative impact on the development of the Pilbara since the introduction of this tax in 1986. Economic modelling results indicate that without FBT (and assuming an increase in income tax to compensate for FBT) the gross output of the region would have been 3.4% higher than under the existing system, over 670 additional jobs (supporting 1400 residents) would have been created, an additional $14.5 million would have been invested and over $413 million in additional consumption expenditure would have been incurred. This is equivalent of an additional $50,000 for every retail establishment in the region. It is estimated that FBT cost business enterprises the equivalent of four jobs per establishment.</para><para>In 1997, the Howard government exempted the pastoral industry from FBT on housing. In 1998, remote area housing for the mining industry was also exempted from FBT. However, small business, subcontractors and local government continue to be liable for FBT on benefits paid to employees—with significant adverse affects on their operations and on regional development in general.</para><para>The thrust of my argument today is that, in the interests of promoting regional development, all industries in remote areas should be exempt from FBT on housing and services associated with housing such as electricity. The iniquitous impact of there not being an across-the-board exemption from FBT on 
 housing for all industries in remote areas can be understood by a simple example. The subsidised housing provided to the employee of a large, wealthy mining company in Port Hedland or Karratha is fringe benefits tax exempt, while the housing provided to the employee of a small contractor to the large mining company is subject to FBT. The impact of this is to create a differential disadvantage for the small contractor, who not only has to bear the expense of providing subsidised housing and airconditioning to his employee but then has to pay tax on those subsidies, while the large mining operator is exempt from such taxes. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of this speech.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>:</para><para>This issue is addressed in the PDC report and I quote "At present non-mining enterprises have difficulty competing with the more wealthy mining companies to attract professional staff. Exempting only the mining companies will widen this disparity and will make it even more difficult for non-mining enterprises to attract and retain professional workers. On equity grounds it is important to at least level the playing field between mining and non-mining companies in the Pilbara". (53-54)</para><para>Similarly local government has to offer subsidies including housing, electricity, a car and holiday airfares or their equivalent to attract employees to the towns in the North of WA. Local Government pays punitive levels of FBT. When I was Mayor of Port Hedland the Town Council paid $300,000 per year in FBT which could otherwise be used to provide community services or reduce the exceptionally high rates characteristic of towns in the North West.</para><para>The PDC report of FBT addresses the question of FBT on income tax exempt organisations like Local Government and I quote: " The present FBT regime also treats income tax exempt organisations such as local governments and non profit organisations differently compared with income tax paying entities. The grossing up provision effectively doubles the FBT payable by income tax exempt organisations. Correcting these anomalies would benefit the Pilbara as they would reduce the FBT paid by local government and allow them to improve services and reduce rates. (54)</para><para>In conclusion, I believe that the impression that the FBT has had a devastating impact on regional development has been confirmed by the PDC study. 
</para><para>Further it seems obvious to me that Australia should follow the examples of Canada and other countries and provide exemptions from the FBT to support regional development and that specifically—exemptions from FBT should be provided in remote areas for all industries for housing and air conditioning subsidies and for the provision of other benefits necessary for employment.</para><para>Finally I cannot overemphasise the importance of regional development.</para><para>Behind the cities on the coasts of Australia is a vast hinterland from which most of the wealth of Australia is generated.</para><para>Promoting regional development has long been part of the ethos of Australia and as things stand, the fringe benefits regime is hindering regional development and this must be changed.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Uriarra Settlement, Australian Capital Territory</title><page.no>6541</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>6541</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to talk about the Uriarra settlement, a matter of genuine importance to the people of the ACT for a whole range of reasons. The ACT government is planning to resettle dozens of ACT families who have made a lifestyle choice and chosen to live at Uriarra, which is 30 kilometres from Canberra city. It wants to move these families into urban public housing because, it claims, the cost of providing basic infrastructure—in this case water—is too high. Let me outline the situation with respect to the Uriarra settlement.</para></talk.start><para>The forestry settlement was first established in 1928 as a tiny community established around the forestry workers cottages, a machinery depot and a primary school. For 50 years this settlement existed in virtual isolation, accessible by only one poorly maintained road. A sealed road was built only in 1978. By the early 1980s, the decline of the forestry industry meant that the workers cottages were no longer needed, and their management was transferred from ACT Forests to ACT Housing. Over the past two decades, ACT tenants have taken up residence at Uriarra and continued to build a small but thriving community life, with the Uriarra primary school a major part of their village style life.</para><para>Despite the enormous amount of time, money and resources that community members have put into their village, ACT Housing 
 have decided that the returns are too small and the maintenance costs are too high. Their solution is to stop non-essential maintenance and relocate the residents away from this rural environment. However, in doing so the ACT government refuses to understand or recognise the significant benefits that the entire ACT community can enjoy from the Uriarra settlement. In the first place, Uriarra is already quite self-sufficient, and its residents do more to alleviate the burden of providing government services than do most other communities: they treat their own sewage and water; they do most of their own maintenance; they work with local forest rangers; and they provide facilities and services to a range of quite interesting and innovative tourism events, such as the quite prestigious FAI Rally held in that vicinity.</para><para>But, most importantly, the Uriarra community has established a bush school where students from Weston Primary School travel out to the community and join Uriarra children in learning about the environment, Aboriginal culture and flora and fauna. This wonderful initiative is fully supported by local rangers because it is one of the best ways to teach young children about how to enjoy our natural environment without damaging it or degrading it. The Uriarra settlement obviously provides a range of benefits for the whole community to enjoy. This is just one example of the benefits that exist.</para><para>Now the people of that settlement want to establish an independent and secure future for themselves and their families. They are not asking for anything different or special, just the same treatment that every other resident enjoys. They have proposed that their settlement become a rural village based on private home ownership. We already have this village type arrangement in the ACT at Hall and Tharwa. Like Uriarra, these villages have maintained a historical and rural character. The residents recognise that continuing to provide services for public housing at Uriarra is not sustainable. That is why the existing tenants want to have first option to buy the cottages and then have any remaining properties opened to the general market. This approach would be consistent with the ACT 
 government's plan to date, although a highly criticised plan, of selling off public housing stock.</para><para>They also recognise that there is a limit to the number of families that this settlement can sustain, and so they are proposing that no more than 50 cottages be inhabited. This also means that there would be only minimum investment required to ensure the adequate provision of services such as water, sewerage, power and communications. In return for being provided with the same level of services that the rest of the ACT enjoys, the people of Uriarra have come up with a detailed proposal that they believe will provide many benefits and substantiate their claims of not being a burden on the ACT community. To quote from their proposal, which has been submitted to the ACT government, they plan to develop:</para><para>. . . a more contributory role for the village within the ACT landscape and economy, focusing on the development of the long-term recreation and tourism potential of the Brindabellas and the north-west of the ACT.</para><para>In conclusion, we have here in the ACT a proposal to develop a village environment that will financially contribute to the government through the sale of these cottages to the tenants. It will deliver alternative housing options. It will preserve part of the ACT's important heritage for future generations. I believe the ACT government is beholden to remove the blinkers they have been so willing to wear in relation to this issue and explore the possibilities that are contained within the submission prepared by the residents of the Uriarra settlement community.</para><para>I believe the economic arguments are unsubstantiated at this stage. I have certainly written letters to the appropriate officers both within the ACT government and Actew, the electricity and water corporation servicing this area, asking them for their confirmation and substantiation of the costs that they have put forward to date. So far, I have not received a response. There is no explanation also or an early indication by Minister Stefaniak that in fact there was a great deal of interest and, indeed, sympathy for the plight of the Uriarra settlement. We have had no explanation of what seems to be a backflip with respect to his attitude.</para><para>There is a point in time when governments must look at the opportunities, not the problems. In this case, rather than homogenise a community and move towards conformity as a mechanism to save money, to put the economic priority first, I think it is reflective of an example of governments having to try to look at what value is added in this proposal. It is not all take from this community. The services they provide back to Canberra and to children through the environmental programs that I have discussed are the sort of initiative that one would contemplate for a government grant. I know that it is exactly the type of initiative where people get together and say, `How can we actually support promoting our wonderful environment here and bring people into contact with it?' So I find it quite disturbing and quite ironic that here we have an initiative, which is in fact in practice, and examples of a very successful program in place, and yet it appears that the ACT government is determined to undermine it for the reasons I have outlined.</para><para>The principle is one of taking a community's right to live in the lifestyle and manner they choose seriously but, in doing so, it is also recognising many of the benefits that that subsequently returns to the broader community. I have a huge amount of respect for the people of the Uriarra settlement in their diligence and commitment to working out a better future for themselves and their children. I look forward, hopefully, to a more positive response from the ACT government in the future.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Pauline Hanson's One Nation: Citizenship</title><page.no>6543</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>6543</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not want to take up too much time in what has been a very busy week, but the press release that Senator McKiernan spoke about earlier needs to have a few other remarks made about it. It is a press release from Pauline Hanson's One Nation called `Good for the goose—good for the gander'. In this she names—and spells the name wrong of at least one person—four persons for whom she says she is collecting enough money to take to the High Court so they cannot sit in this place. Looking at the list, at 
 least in the case of good old Senator McKiernan, he has been here so long that he might not mind a break out of the place anyway. I really do not know what this person is on about.</para></talk.start><para>Until I saw Pauline Hanson, I thought the only people who simplistically knew how to run the world either cut your hair or drove you around in a taxi. I now know that they fry fish and chips. I do not want to be too hard on fish and chip shop owners because, when you get to my size, you have obviously been in a few. I have a few mates—who are usually Greek, by the way—who cheer me on in my political life because Greeks tend to be quite interested in politics. I wind up around at my local chippy every so often. My kids enjoy going there. They play the gaming machines. That is the way it goes. When I say `gaming machines', I mean those things you drive and put two bob in. Also I remember when growing up that my mother used the fish and chip shop not to buy fish and chips but for another purpose. The fish and chip shop owner was the local SP bookie as well, so they provided more services than one.</para><para>I just thought I would educate Pauline Hanson a bit here this afternoon on how you actually get rid of dual citizenship. Through no accident of my own—my father had something to do with it and so did my mother—I was actually born in the United Kingdom. I came out here at the age of 8½—and I have been here ever since. I took out Australian citizenship on 9 May 1974. I found out because somebody put an FOI statement in about me some 12 months ago. I think I and a number of other members of this place were named in this FOI statement. They wanted to know whether I was an Australian citizen. I was quite happy to tell the department that I am proud of the fact that some 24 years ago I had taken out Australian citizenship. I did find it bizarre that I had to swear an oath to the Queen when I did it, but I will fix that problem—or at least do my part—on 6 November this year.</para><para>Indeed, the whole business seems somewhat strange after the Cleary case and after all the other cases that have gone on that Ms Hill, whom I have never met and for whom I bear 
 no malice, did not understand that there was a process for the renunciation of citizenship. Indeed, as I understand it, the High Court says that you have to take all steps possible to renounce that citizenship. In the case of the United Kingdom that was easy enough: you rang the British High Commission, they sent you a form, you filled it out in duplicate, you signed it before a JP and, at least when I did it, the fee was $126.50. I sent the money by bank cheque. It was receipted, sent back and some time thereafter—I think it took a few months—the British Home Office sent me a piece of paper saying that I would no longer be welcome on those shores, except as an alien, which really did not matter anyway because I had to queue up with the aliens with my Australian passport. So it did not make much difference.</para><para>That process, as I understand it, for Greeks and Italians is a much more complex one because there is no formal procedure as there is for members who are born in the United Kingdom. I find it rather vindictive that this person, Pauline Hanson, says that she is going to try to do these four people she named in the High Court and presumably she has a fair bit of money—she is certainly awash with public funds, as I understand it, from a few elections around Australia—to do that. So I think you have to take these threats seriously. The other thing is that there are probably people out there who would send money to some person like this to achieve these sorts of goals but to actually drag people of Greek and Italian extraction into the High Court to try to tyrannise them because of an accident of where they were born I find is absolutely abhorrent and is probably one of the good reasons why sensible people would not vote for a crowd like this.</para><para>I just want to make a couple of other remarks. I remember when I had been here for about four weeks and some friends of mine alerted the press that I may have dual nationality. This has actually happened to me twice in my life. I will not name the persons concerned. One of them rang me afterwards—he wanted help with preselection—and told me that he had spoken to the press only after the press had spoken to me. A reporter rang, 
 having rung all my friends trying to find out where I was born, et cetera. I was curious as to why this reporter had such an interest in my past. I spoke to the reporter and asked, `What are you trying to say?' The reporter said, `You were born overseas. Have you taken all steps to renounce your British citizenship?'</para><para>Obviously this person was well aware of the process that you have to make every endeavour you can to renounce foreign citizenship. I said, `In fact I do and, you know, I was waiting for this. I have been waiting for this for four weeks. I actually have a file here with a receipt on it for $126.50.' The person said to me, `Could you send me the receipt?' I said, `No. I'm saving it for when we go to court, because if you print it just make sure your lawns are kept neat and trim because I have an interest in your house.' The person said, `How does a person know that you have done this before you nominated for the Senate?' I said, `Well, that's another problem you've got, because the good cabinet of South Australia put me in this place.' She said, `What's the nomination procedure?' I said, `I suppose a nomination is when I physically sign a form saying, "I will accept the nomination of cabinet to the Australian Senate".' Indeed, when I supplied all the other documents saying everyone else was happy with me going to the Senate—not quite everyone but more than 51 per cent—then that probably would be the nomination procedure.</para><para>The person was then silent at the other end of the phone. She said, `Did you renounce it before then?' I said, `Sadly for you, I did.' I never heard any more about it from this person. Of course I went through this procedure when I was a member of the South Australian parliament. I had my neighbours at that time doorknock to ask if I was a British citizen, which I found bizarre. They can ask my neighbours if I owned a dog, if the dog barked too much or if I watered my lawns or weeded the garden—and I will not tell the Senate one way or the other what sort of a gardener I am.
