The Authority was established as the only law enforcement agency in Australia whose investigations would not be limited by jurisdictional boundaries and its existence reflects the seriousness with which the Commonwealth and States view organised crime. The Authority is not confined to only investigating breaches of Commonwealth law. It is truly a national body with powers to investigate organised crime offences against Commonwealth and State laws.</para><para>The States confer powers, duties and functions on the National Crime Authority in relation to a variety of State investigative laws such as controlled operations and electronic surveillance. These laws are the essential intelligence gathering tools used by law enforcement agencies in the States and by the Authority.</para><para>This amendment makes clear that the States can confer such powers, duties and functions on the Authority. Those powers may extend to the investigation of any relevant criminal activity, provided the Commonwealth has legislated to confer powers of the same kind.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</para><para>The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 proposes amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to:</para><para>.	 improve opportunities for the live television coverage of designated events and series by introducing an `anti-hoarding' regime for free-to-air broadcasters;</para><para>.	 protect regional broadcasters from "look alike" metropolitan free-to-air programming on regional pay TV services;
</para><para>.	 allow the ABA to approve broadcaster transmissions beyond the originating licence area to address black spot reception problems; and</para><para>.	 increase the time allowed for sponsorship announcements on community broadcasting services from four to five minutes per hour.</para><para>The anti-hoarding and regional protection provisions, together with retransmission provisions, were originally introduced in the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 1998 last year, before lapsing with the calling of the last Federal election.</para><para>This bill introduces refinements to the anti-hoarding and regional protection measures, which reflect the Senate Legislation Committee process, further consultations with the industry and the opposition parties, and resultant amendments agreed by the Government in the House of Representatives.</para><para>The proposed anti-hoarding scheme in Schedule 1 of the bill consists of a `must offer' obligation to be imposed on free-to-air broadcasters and their regular program suppliers who have live broadcast rights to designated events or series, but who do not intend to facilitate live television coverage of these events. Free-to-air commercial broadcasters in this situation will have to offer, normally at least 30 days before the commencement of an event, the unused rights to the ABC and SBS for a nominal charge. The ABC and SBS will have to offer such rights to each other in similar circumstances.</para><para>Under the current provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act, free-to-air broadcasters are given priority access to the purchase of broadcasting rights to a wide range of major sporting events set out in the anti-siphoning list. However, there is nothing in the legislation to actively encourage free-to-air broadcasters to exercise the rights they have acquired. Broadcasters may delay coverage, or televise only a small proportion of an event.</para><para>The current provision for the Minister to remove events from the anti-siphoning list is unlikely to be effective in situations where a broadcaster decides, at short notice, not to fully televise an event. Such a situation occurred in 1997 when the Nine Network decided not to show the first session of play in the test matches of the Ashes cricket series in England, to the disappointment of many cricket supporters.</para><para>The operation of the proposed anti-hoarding amendments will be confined to events and series designated by the Minister. It is envisaged that the Ministerial designation power will be used only in limited circumstances—for example, where there is a widespread public expectation, based on past practice, of the full live televising of an event. The designation of events and series will be made in the form of a disallowable instrument.</para><para>However, the Minister will be empowered to allow, on an event by event basis, the delayed televising
 of designated events in Australia's Western and Central time zones on the grounds of, for example, viewer convenience. This provision responds to difficulties sometimes faced by viewers in these time zones.</para><para>In a situation where, for example, a day-night cricket match is being played in the Eastern states, the Minister will be able to allow a delayed telecast of that game in the Western and Central time zones by no more than the time difference with the Eastern states. Any such decision by the Minister will also be made in the form of a disallowable instrument.</para><para>Schedule 1 also provides for a review of the effectiveness of the anti-hoarding provisions to be conducted within two years of their commencement. A report on the outcome of this review will be tabled in the Parliament.</para><para>Schedule 2 of the bill introduces measures to support the integrity of the licence areas of regional television broadcasters. The Government considers that it is very important to retain television services in regional areas, which incorporate programming relevant to local events and interests, including local news and weather.</para><para>Accordingly, it is proposed to restrict the importation by regional pay TV services of prime time programming from metropolitan commercial television services. Schedule 2 requires pay TV operators to take all reasonable steps to ensure that their services in regional areas do not include three or more consecutive programs identical to three or more consecutive prime time programs on metropolitan commercial television services, without the approval of the Australian Broadcasting Authority.</para><para>As introduced in the House of Representatives, Schedule 3 of the bill provided for a new retransmission regime, based on broadcaster consent. The regime would have fulfilled a previous Coalition election promise to give broadcasters control over their own signal, consistent with the general approach adopted by the Copyright Convergence Group (CCG) in its 1994 report <inline font-style="italic">Highways to Change: Copyright in the New Communications Environment</inline> . An anomaly in the current retransmission rules allows pay TV operators to retransmit free-to-air broadcasting services without consent or compensation.</para><para>However, despite the fact that the CCG was established by the former Labor Government, the Opposition has proposed an arbitration regime, in lieu of the broadcaster consent model. The Democrats have also indicated support for the arbitration regime.</para><para>It has not been possible for the free-to-air broadcasters and pay TV operators to reach agreement in the short term on arbitration arrangements, or
 any alternative retransmission model. Further consultations will clearly be required with the industry and the opposition parties to resolve outstanding issues.</para><para>Accordingly, the Government agreed to amend the bill in the House of Representatives to remove the retransmission provisions in Schedule 3, to permit the other non-contentious elements of the bill to be progressed, and to facilitate further consultations on a new retransmission regime. It is in the mutual interests of the free-to-air and pay TV sectors to reach agreement on new retransmission proposals in the near future, rather than the Parliament being forced to impose a new regime on the industry.</para><para>Removal of the retransmission provisions means that the existing retransmission rules in section 212 of the Broadcasting Services Act continue to apply. These rules allow retransmissions without the agreement or compensation of broadcasters.</para><para>However, Schedule 3 provides that provisions in the associated Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 1999—which require payment of equitable remuneration to underlying rights holders for the retransmission of copyright material contained in broadcasting services—will still have effect on commencement of that bill.</para><para>Very importantly, provision has been retained in Schedule 3 to allow the Australian Broadcasting Authority to approve out of area broadcaster transmissions—including by satellite—to overcome black spot reception problems, or in exceptional circumstances, such as natural disasters. These provisions will support the black spot program under the Government's $120 million Television Fund, which will provide significant benefits in many regional areas.</para><para>Finally, Schedule 4 of the bill gives effect to the Government's election commitment to increase the community broadcasting sponsorship limit from four to five minutes per hour. This will assist the viability of individual stations, and bring the community sector into line with similar limits imposed on the SBS.</para><para>The amendments in this bill are expected to have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1999</para><para>The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 seeks to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to make the Australian content licence condition for subscription television broadcasting licensees enforceable; and to limit the scope of international agreements that apply to the functions of the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA).
</para><para>Firstly, the bill gives effect to the outcomes of the Ministerial review of Australian content on subscription television broadcasting services conducted in 1997. The review identified that the existing Australian content licence condition is unenforceable because it does not take into account the operating practices of the subscription television industry. In view of the high level of non-compliance with the existing requirement over successive years, the Government has decided that legislative amendments are necessary to make the licence condition enforceable so that the intended policy outcomes are achieved.</para><para>The Government recognises the important role of television drama in developing and reflecting a sense of Australian identity, character and cultural diversity. The aim of the licence condition is to require the subscription television industry to contribute to the production of Australian drama programming for the cultural benefit of Australian audiences. The licence condition will also promote the further development of the highly acclaimed Australian drama production industry, providing further employment opportunities and new Australian product available for export. The amendments will also ensure that the licence condition complies with Australia's obligations under the Protocol on Trade in Services to the Closer Economic Relations Agreement with New Zealand, by treating services provided by New Zealand personnel to the production of drama programs no less favourably than services provided by Australians.</para><para>The Government will closely monitor the operation of the enforcement measures contained in the bill to ensure that they are effective in delivering the intended policy objectives. A review of Australian and New Zealand content on subscription television broadcasting services will be conducted by 31 March 2003. This review will, amongst other things, provide an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the enforcement measures contained in this bill. The Government expects the subscription television broadcasting sector to comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the new enforcement arrangements over the next three years leading up to the review.</para><para>The Government recognises the importance of the documentary genre in developing and reflecting a sense of Australian identity, character and cultural diversity, and believes that the extension of the requirement to documentary channels warrants further consideration. The Government is also aware of some industry concerns in relation to the treatment of development expenses under the bill. Therefore, the Government will be asking the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) to consider both of these issues and report back to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts within twelve months.
</para><para>Secondly, the bill will limit the scope of international agreements that apply to the functions of the ABA, following the decision of the High Court of Australia in Project Blue Sky v the ABA. The High Court held that the Australian Content Standard for commercial free-to-air television was unlawfully made because it was not consistent with the CER Services Protocol, as required by section 160(d) of the Broadcasting Services Act. Section 160(d) provides that the ABA is to exercise its functions in a manner consistent with Australia's international obligations. This bill will amend section 160(d) to limit its scope to the CER Services Protocol with New Zealand. By doing so it will protect the level of Australian content on free-to-air television so that foreign access to local content quotas under the section will be explicitly confined to New Zealand. The amendment will accommodate the CER Services Protocol and retain the special position of New Zealand, while making it clear that there are no flow-ons under the amended section to other treaties. It will also assist the ABA in the exercise of its regulatory responsibilities.</para><para>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT BILL 1999</para><para>The proposed amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 repeal the current 30 November 1999 closing date for Farm Family Restart Scheme (FFRS) re-establishment grants.</para><para>The Government intends to extend the current deadline by 7 months to 30 June 2000. The new deadline will be contained in the instrument which establishes the Restart Re-establishment Grant Scheme under section 52A of the Farm Household Support Act 1992.</para><para>The FFRS is the Government's key program for delivering improved welfare support to the farm sector. The FFRS is available to low income farm families who cannot borrow further against their assets and wish to consider their future in the farm sector. Assistance through the FFRS is flexible and can be tailored to meet the needs of each farm family. FFRS provides income support for up to one year and professional advice to meet individual needs, such as financial, legal or career advice. The FFRS re-establishment grant of up to $45,000 is also available to assist those farmers who take the decision to leave agriculture.</para><para>Over 2,900 farm families have received income support under FFRS since the scheme commenced in December 1997 and over 240 re-establishment grants have been paid.</para><para>Extending the FFRS re-establishment grants will assist farmers in severe financial difficulties to
 assess their future in agriculture and, if necessary, leave the industry with dignity.</para><para>APPROPRIATION (EAST TIMOR) BILL 1999-2000</para><para>It is with pleasure that I introduce the Appropriation (East Timor) Bill 1999-2000. This bill makes provision for special appropriations to the Department of Defence and the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) in relation to operations in the East Timor region.</para><para>In the bill, the Parliament is asked to appropriate monies from the consolidated revenue fund to meet these necessary additional expenditures. The monies are additional to the appropriations made in Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1999-2000 last Budget, and the additional appropriations proposed in the Appropriation Bills (Nos 3 and 4) 1999-2000 to be tabled in this session.</para><para>In order that the Department of Defence and AusAID can operate, financially uninhibited, in fulfilling the Government's commitment to the East Timor region, it is necessary that they have timely access to the supplementary funding. For this reason, the appropriations are sought outside the additional estimates process, and introduction and passage of the East Timor Bill in this session is being sought.</para><para>The appropriations in the East Timor Bill total $920.0 million.</para><para>$860.0 million is provided for the Department of Defence for the deployment and peace enforcement in East Timor, new investments that may be needed to augment the capability of the forces in East Timor and an increase in overall ADF numbers so that the deployment can be sustained and acceptable levels of overall readiness maintained.</para><para>-	 Of this total amount some $845.0 relates to operational expenses and net capital investment of the department, and $15m to fund the capital user charge. The latter amount is an internal transaction to Government and so does not impact on the overall budget bottom line.</para><para>$60.0 million is provided for AusAID to fund Australia's contribution to the humanitarian and reconstruction needs of East Timor and to support the establishment and operations of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.</para><para>Ordered that these bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CRIMES AT SEA BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11550</page.no><id.no>r929</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>11550</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>11550</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>11550</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:</para></talk.start><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>This is a bill to give Australia a modern crimes at sea scheme.</para><para>The increasing incidence of people smuggling in the last year has highlighted the importance of having an effective legal regime to govern the seas around Australia's coastline. This bill complements the important measures that the Government has announced in the coastal surveillance context.</para><para>The new crimes at sea scheme will be simpler to understand and apply, and will result in more effective law enforcement.</para><para>The bill implements a new national, uniform, co-operative scheme to apply Australian criminal law offshore. The scheme was developed by the Special Committee of Solicitors-General and has been endorsed by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.</para><para>The existing crimes at sea scheme under Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory legislation is seriously flawed. In many situations, it is a complicated and confusing task to identify the law that applies in connection with a suspected offence. This creates difficulties for law enforcement and prosecution authorities and could mean that an offender escapes conviction because of a technical error.
</para><para>Under the current scheme, the criminal law applicable to a vessel is determined by reference to whether it is registered in Australia or overseas, and if registered in Australia, to the State or Territory in which it is registered and whether it is engaged in an interstate or intrastate voyage.</para><para>This mishmash of rules is not only difficult to understand and apply, it can also give rise to an overlapping application of laws, adding to the confusion. The uncertainty relates not only to determining which body of law applies but also to determining who is responsible for enforcing those laws and which set of procedural rules apply to their enforcement.</para><para>Even when the applicable law is clear under the existing scheme, the results are not always sound. For example, the scheme contemplates the possibility that investigators from one State would be obliged to operate according to the investigatory laws of another State.</para><para>That is why the Special Committee of Solicitors-General devised a clearer and simpler scheme, which has been approved by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and has Australasian Police Ministers' Council support.</para><para>Under the new co-operative scheme the States and the Northern Territory have agreed to enact uniform crimes at sea acts that will apply their criminal laws in their respective offshore adjacent areas out to 12 nautical miles. The Commonwealth bill will, in turn, apply the criminal law of each jurisdiction, as Commonwealth law, to the respective offshore adjacent area of each State and the Northern Territory from 12 to 200 nautical miles or the outer limit of the continental shelf, whichever is the greater.</para><para>The adjacent area of each jurisdiction is defined in Part 6 of Schedule 1 of the bill.</para><para>For ease of reference, a map showing the adjacent area of each State and other legally significant boundaries has been incorporated with the bill. The scheme will not apply to Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory laws excluded by regulation from the ambit of the scheme. This is to cater for currently operating schemes applying in the offshore zone relating to subjects such as fisheries.</para><para>Under the new scheme the authority that is investigating an offence will do so in accordance with its own procedures. For example, Victorian police investigating an offence which under the scheme is an offence under New South Wales law will investigate according to Victorian investigative procedures. When a State offence and a Commonwealth offence are being investigated simultaneously the investigating authority will, as at present, follow the procedural requirements which are the more stringent.
</para><para>Prosecutions under the new scheme will be conducted on a similar basis. Commonwealth proceedings will be run according to the law of the Commonwealth. State and Northern Territory proceedings will be run according to the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings started. In the example I have just given the New South Wales offence would be tried in a Victorian court according to Victorian procedural law.</para><para>Under the new scheme, a single body of law will apply in the adjacent area of each jurisdiction, regardless of whether a vessel is `connected' with another jurisdiction or is on an interstate or intrastate voyage or is an Australian or foreign vessel. These archaic and unnecessary distinctions will simply have no place in the scheme.</para><para>Greater simplicity is a central aim of the scheme, so that crimes do not go unpunished because of legal technicalities. The bill will eliminate the situation in which determining which body of law applies depends upon facts unrelated to the offence itself—such as the State with which a vessel is connected. It will also put an end to the situation where the applicable law depends upon facts which may be particularly difficult to establish—like the vessel's intended destination before an event occurs.</para><para>The new scheme will also be more effective because all jurisdictions will enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement to enforce the criminal law under the scheme. These agreements will also enable the Commonwealth to confer powers, duties and functions on State and Northern Territory authorities under the new Commonwealth act.</para><para>The agreement has been endorsed by both the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australasian Police Ministers' Council.</para><para>A significant feature of the agreement is that the States and the Northern Territory will have primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting crimes committed in their respective adjacent areas. However, where practicable, the jurisdictions will provide assistance to one another in the investigation of offences arising under the scheme. The agreement will also provide that where more than one jurisdiction is empowered to prosecute they should consult to determine the jurisdiction most convenient for prosecution.</para><para>The agreement will provide that the Commonwealth also has the primary enforcement responsibility for criminal conduct on or from a Defence Force ship when it is outside the limits of a State or the Northern Territory.</para><para>As well as the uniform provisions that I have outlined, the Commonwealth bill also applies the Jervis Bay Territory's criminal law to certain criminal acts committed outside the new scheme's coverage area.
</para><para>Jervis Bay Territory law will apply on Australian ships, to Australian citizens on foreign ships who are not members of the crew and on a foreign ship that first lands in Australia after an offence is committed.</para><para>In these cases, the procedural rules for investigating and prosecuting offences will be the same as those applying to any other offence under Commonwealth law.</para><para>Proposed Part 4, which regulated the enforcement of criminal laws in Area A of what was known as the Australia-Indonesia Zone of Co-operation in the Timor Gap, was omitted from the bill in the House of Representatives. In light of recent developments in relation to East Timor, Part 4 no longer reflected the current position in relation to the Timor Gap. New provisions are being developed to deal with criminal law enforcement in the Timor Gap to take into account the changed circumstances.</para><para>The new crimes at sea scheme will not affect the substantive criminal and procedural laws that currently apply in the 12 nautical mile territorial seas of the external Territories. The criminal law of Norfolk Island, for example, will apply in the territorial seas around the island and Western Australian criminal law will apply in the territorial seas around the Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</para><para>Finally, the Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory bills all provide that the Commonwealth Attorney-General's written consent must be obtained before a prosecution can proceed in cases in which the alleged offence also falls within a foreign country's jurisdiction. This requirement is necessary to promote compliance with Australia's international obligations. Before granting approval the Commonwealth Attorney-General must take into account any views expressed by the country concerned. The absence of consent, however, will not prevent preliminary steps such as arrest, charges being laid, or extradition proceedings beginning.</para><para>In accordance with the agreement reached by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania have enacted the uniform State model bills required for the new regime. After the Commonwealth and the remaining jurisdictions have done the same, the new scheme will be uniformly proclaimed by all the jurisdictions.</para><para>The new scheme is, as I said in my introduction, simpler to understand and easier to apply, making it more effective and convenient for law enforcement. Although policing offences at sea will still present operational and logistical challenges, this scheme will give Australian authorities the legislative basis they need to enforce the criminal law off Australia's coastline.

The provision in the bill requiring programs to `contribute to' the achievement of equal opportunity is broad enough to encompass both substantive measures and promotional activities.

The opposition was very disappointed in the level of cooperation we evidenced in this matter and to see what can only be described as a tawdry press release from Minister Reith in relation to the arrangement that was reached with the Labor Party. We know how desperate Minister Reith was to get this through. We know that he was intent on trying to torpedo the Labor Party amendments. However, kicking and screaming, he was dragged to a position whereby he agreed to the Labor Party amendments. So we have a substantial retention of the original provisions in the Labor Party bill which was put in place when the Labor Party was in government.</para></talk.start><para>Just to give the chamber some idea as to the level this minister will stoop to when he actually gets an agreement—this may be a salutary lesson for the Democrats as to how mean-spirited he can be once an agreement has been reached, never mind when there is dissent in relation to an agreement—I will
 read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the press release he issued. Essentially, he attempted to portray this arrangement as a humiliating backdown for Labor. He indicated that Kim Beazley has been exposed as being opportunistic and rhetorical and that his own shadow minister, who brokered these amendments, has `overthrown' him. He went on to say:</para><para>Two weeks ago, Labor was attempting to hijack the government's positive agenda—</para><para>what a joke!—</para><para>for women by opportunistically attaching amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act dealing with the <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and Productive</inline>  report.</para><para>He then went on to accuse the opposition of grandstanding in relation to the <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and Productive</inline>  report. And what do we have now? We have a churlish response by Minister Reith to an in-good-faith arrangement with Labor in relation to the Equal Opportunity Act. We have an agreement which we—and I signal this to the government on behalf of the shadow minister—intend to keep the government to, that in relation to the recommendations of the <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and Productive</inline>  report, Minister Reith has agreed that they will be considered very early next year. As the government knows, we have amendments drafted and we have the Democrats' support in relation to that. I doubt whether the Democrats will resile from their position on our amendments on enacting the <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and Productive</inline>  report on this issue, because to resile from that would mean, essentially, that we continue the situation whereby women who are pregnant or potentially pregnant continue to be discriminated against in this country. So I doubt whether that will happen.</para><para>As far as the opposition is concerned, Minister Reith is on notice. If this is not dealt with expeditiously, if this matter is not dealt with in a way that comes to a practical outcome, we will be back here and will be moving our amendments again, I suspect with Democrat support and obviously with the support of minor party senators. I just wanted to make the point because it is really illustrative of the nature of this minister, when an agreement is struck, that we get the political rhetoric yet again. I venture to suggest that
 this is why he will never get anywhere in his continually failing attempts to turf Peter Costello as the heir apparent.</para><para>We all know what the majority of the government members think of Minister Reith. We all know that he is not popular among the majority of his colleagues. We all know his propensity for crash through or crash tactics, usually emanating in the crash part rather than the crash through part. We all know that he is ideologically opposed to what has been brokered by the Labor Party as a good deal for women in terms of the  Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 1999  and we know that he has no interest whatsoever in discrimination against pregnant and potentially pregnant women.</para><para>I say to the government that the opposition says this is a very serious matter, particularly at a time when this country is looking at the issue of underpopulation. We need to ensure that women feel secure when they choose to become pregnant, we need to ensure they are not discriminated against when they choose to become pregnant and we need to ensure that the recommendations of the report are enacted in legislation. We will be back here if they are not. We have our amendments drafted. We are confident that we will get the assent of the Senate and we will be determining the time line. If it is not expeditious, we will bring it back on ourselves. That is the warning we give to the government.</para><para>We do not want this report, <inline font-style="italic">Pregnant and Productive</inline>, sitting on the shelves in Peter Reith's office for years and years with nothing being done in relation to it.

I am glad that Senator Harradine raised that issue in relation to potential pregnancy or breastfeeding. I would like to advise Senator Harradine that I am informed that Minister Reith was in fact the most trenchant in opposing that particular proposition. In fact, it was
 the one that Labor was most insistent on. We got Minister Reith to a situation whereby he had to cave in in relation to that in particular. I just want to put that on the record. It is not by any good grace of the minister involved; it is because of the nature of the numbers in this place.

A number of people with homosexual tendencies would be able to testify about what I have done in regard to their actions against discrimination in the work force. I defy anybody to suggest that I have acted in any way in a discriminatory manner against the people concerned. Indeed, a number of people would come before any inquiry to indicate some of the work I have done in this particular area.</para><para>But that is not what we are dealing with here; we are dealing with a proposition that was put forward yesterday for the government, presumably, to have laid on the table no later than 4 p.m. on 6 March certain details of all legislative changes that would be required to ensure the recognition and equal treatment of same sex couples under Commonwealth superannuation and taxation legislation. I put this to you, Madam President, and particularly to the opposition: what is meant by `equal treatment'? Is this proposing that the government accept that same sex relationships have the same status as marriage? Is that what is being said? Is that what is being indicated in this measure?</para><para>We are going to have to face this situation very clearly, and I want to know this from the proposer and the supporters of the motion: is the phrase `equal treatment of same sex couples' based on the proposition that homosexual relationships should receive the approval of the government and the parliament
 of Australia as being of the same status as marriage? That is the nub of it. I would like an answer to that question from those who are promoting this proposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>11559</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support this motion, of course. I have a male partner, so I have an interest in the matter, but I am not speaking on my behalf here; I am speaking on behalf of commonsense. We are an egalitarian society which is moving towards the elimination of discrimination against people in our society. What we have just heard from Senator Harradine will lay down a marker of discrimination. I would ask him to say where he draws the line at discrimination against same sex couples. I do not believe that that line should be drawn.</para></talk.start><para>That is not the matter at hand here; the matter at hand is a request for the `production of details of legislative changes required to ensure recognition of equal treatment of same sex couples'. Why is that motion before the chamber? It is here because we have been dealing with superannuation legislation time and time again in this place this year, yet the discrimination against same sex couples remains, so that the benefits of superannuation are not transferred to a partner in a same sex relationship anywhere in this country under Commonwealth legislation, and that is wrong. It causes harm and material detriment, and it is discriminatory.</para><para>For years this chamber has seen moves to end such discrimination, which is real, financial and unfair, and it always falters when we get to the point of doing something real about it. There is going to be argument here that this not being the right procedure. There is always an argument as to why we cannot proceed. The simple fact is that this motion says to the government: please put before the chamber when we return next year the direction which should be taken to end the discrimination. If there is a different form of words, then I will support them. If there is not a different form of words I will support this form of words. But I am not going to be part of a subterfuge which knocks this item out of carriage because behind it is ongoing discrimination. That is what is really at the heart of
 this matter, and it is time it was stopped; it is time it was finished.</para><para>The fact is that we ought to have an all-encompassing piece of legislation before us which ends discrimination right throughout the statutes at Commonwealth level. There are thousands of people who are manifestly being discriminated against in real terms by the legislation that we fail to change time and time again. It is time that was finished. Here is a move to say to the government: give us the prescription that you think is the best one to get rid of the discrimination in superannuation and other matters.</para><para>It goes much wider than that, of course—it includes discrimination in state laws, in the law relating to wills and testaments and in the ability of hospitals to stop same sex partners visiting their partners even if they want to, and this is all under the law. It is time this discrimination was finished, and surely there is nothing wrong with asking the government to come up with a formula.</para><para>I suspect this motion will not succeed here today, and I think that is a pretty awful way for this matter to be left hanging at the end of this parliamentary year. We should do better than that. If there are people who are going to vote against this but say that the intent is right, the formula is wrong, then they should come up with a better formula. Just don't leave nothing, which has been the situation for the last however many years.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>11560</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me say that I think that is a very reasonable challenge that Senator Brown places before the chamber on an issue like this. But let us be clear. I think Senator Brown, as is often the case with such suspension motions, did deal with the substantive issue that Senator Bartlett's motion addresses. Let me make this general point: Senator Bartlett's return to order, if you like, or order of the Senate goes to the creation of a document. The government is being asked to create a document and lay that document on the table. I think senators in the chamber would know that the opposition consistently has had concerns about that sort of approach for an order for the production of documents.
 There are two different categories of document here, and it is important that a distinction be made. One is a document that exists and can be laid on the table. The other is a document which does not exist, needs to be created, and then can be laid on the table.</para></talk.start><para>I must admit that I think there is a way through here that is sensible. Senator Bartlett, as the Democrat spokesman, has had discussions with me addressing the substantive issues that this motion goes to. It is an issue on which the opposition have indicated to Senator Bartlett—I have indicated this, as has the shadow Attorney, Mr McClelland—that we are very happy to progress some of the concerns that Senator Bartlett has. It just seems to me that, given the fact that this particular order for production of documents directly reflects a second reading amendment moved to legislation in this place yesterday, a sensible course of action in these circumstances would be for Senator Bartlett to place a question on notice very much in the terms that this order for production of documents is in. That is a proper mechanism to use in this circumstance to create an answer and a response.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—It is a research project.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—Members of parliament are entitled to ask questions of executive government and receive this sort of information. The question here is whether it is proper for the Senate to order this or for Senator Bartlett to use other mechanisms, in the circumstances that we are in on the last sitting day of the year—and a debate on the substantive issue that is dealt with might well have some very significant implications for the program. I think there is a course of action that can be pursued here by Senator Bartlett which will have the same effect.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Although I have indicated that the opposition have concerns about this general approach of returns to order for the creation of documents, if push comes to shove we will vote for this. But we would much prefer this to be progressed in another way and, with the constraints that we are operating under at the moment, we do not think that a suspension of standing orders is warranted. What I do think
 is warranted, and I would commend this course of action to Senator Bartlett, is to place a question on notice in the same terms for the government to undertake the activity that would be required to respond to a question on notice. It is a similar time frame to the one that Senator Bartlett has proposed.</para><para>If there are any weaknesses in the process, and there ought not be—Senator Bartlett and all senators will have, in response to a question on notice, the substantive issue addressed that he wants to have addressed—then I think it might be appropriate for Senator Bartlett to bring it back to the chamber. What we are being asked here is to suspend standing orders. In these circumstances I do not think that is warranted, but I think there is another course of action which means that Senator Bartlett can in fact receive the information he wants and the Senate's program will not be delayed unnecessarily. I would commend that course of action to Senator Bartlett in the circumstances. I do impress upon the Senate this general issue that we have in relation to orders for the production of documents in the case where it requires the creation of the document.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>11561</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I listened carefully yesterday to Senator Bartlett when he tried to hook up a similar resolution to this to the SLAB No. 4 that was being dealt with yesterday.

If this resolution were carried, it would immediately send a signal to all Australians that the Senate allows a single interest group to dictate the legislative agenda.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday Senator Bartlett indicated disappointment with the lack of progress on his private member's bill in trying to achieve similar things. I will tell you that Senator Bartlett's private member's bill is going nowhere: it does not have the support of the overall population of Australia—that is what
 it is about. We come here to represent the various interest groups of Australia and overwhelmingly people do not support this type of legislation. Senator Bartlett said yesterday that people are getting tired of waiting. Well, I ask Senator Bartlett if he is getting tired of giving people their choice—that is democracy. If you cannot get a private member's bill up because there is so much opposition to it, that is the voice of the people coming through this parliament saying we do not want a bar of this type of legislation.</para><para>If we pass this motion today, it will send a message to all Australians—young and old—that mainstream society sees no essential difference between a homosexual and a heterosexual lifestyle, that society not only condones it but is indifferent to the bonds which make the typical family the fundamental unit of society.

We have a superannuation regime in this country which I support but which is compulsory. That means that all lesbian and gay citizens are required to subscribe to it under most circumstances. But in doing so we are being asked to subscribe to a system that then deliberately and specifically discriminates against us. At the end of a day it is our money. We are forced to pay superannuation into a fund, as are most people in these circumstances, but if we should die we are denied the opportunity to leave our superannuation to our partners or vice-versa. That is appalling. That is apartheid.</para></talk.start><para>In terms of a person's sexuality, I want to make the point repeatedly that for the vast majority of people, including me, our sexuality is not a choice, and in that regard homo
 phobia, as it is being exhibited in the Senate today, is as morally repugnant as racism or anti-Semitism. This is no different to denying superannuation rights to someone perhaps in a multiracial relationship; it is simply a different relationship.</para><para>Senator Boswell argues that his constituents are not in support of that. I do not deny that. But it appals me, given the youth suicide rates in rural and regional Australia and the empirical evidence from within Australia and overseas that shows that more than one third of youth suicide rates in this country are directly related to young people and their sexuality—that is, their anxiety or the discrimination or the persecution because of their sexuality—that those people who represent the bush, such as Senator Boswell, do not take a leading role in not advocating homophobia. It is not enough for Senator Boswell to stand up in here and say that he does not persecute gay and lesbian people while at the same time saying that our rights and our relationships do not exist. It is appalling.</para><para>Australia is behind Canada, South Africa and New Zealand in terms of dealing with human rights for lesbian and gay citizens. I also make the point that recently New South Wales passed partnership recognition for gay and lesbian citizens in that state, and I applaud it. The Queensland government is on the brink of doing it, the Tasmanian government is currently investigating it and has said that it will do it, and I know that the West Australian Labor Party has indicated that it will do it if it wins government at the next election. So we have critical mass here with most states and territories. As for the ACT, the territory we are now in: as you well know, Madam President, it already has partnership recognition laws for gay and lesbian citizens in this place. The sky has not fallen in as a result.</para><para>Senator Boswell argues that the Senate is not the place in which to push this issue. If the parliament is not the place to push issues, where is the place? This is the precise forum where we need debate—sensible, reasoned, intelligent debate—on all issues, including this one. I would also make the point that, in my 10 years as an advocate and an activist
 with Australia's gay and lesbian community, I have never met one lesbian or gay person who wants gay marriage. In fact, my experience is that the vast majority of gay and lesbian citizens do not support the notion of marriage as it currently stands because they see it as a very heterosexual and outdated institution that should be modified and not copied.</para><para>To that extent, what lesbian and gay citizens have only ever been asking for is some form of partnership recognition, not marriage. Senator Harradine suggests that, if we support the notion of same sex couples in a regulatory way, that is putting same sex couples on the same platform as those who are married. I do not believe it is and I do not believe that gay and lesbian people are asking for that.</para><para>When we are calling for the recognition of our relationships, what we are asking for is the right to superannuation on the basis that it is our money. It is the right to be able to enter a hospital to see our partner if they are sick or injured. It is the right to have access to property settlement in wills and estates. It is about having coronial rights in terms of deceased bodies, body parts and whatnot. I know people who have suffered from this. I know people who have been in long-term same sex relationships where one partner has died and the superannuation has not been forthcoming. The financial penalty on the surviving partner is appalling. But it is more appalling for the children who so often exist with same sex relationships.</para><para>There is nothing remarkable or outrageous or absurd about what is being proposed here. Lesbian and gay citizens are simply asking to be treated equally within legislation, including superannuation legislation, and equally within financial regulation. There was a particular case of Mr Greg Brown in Melbourne some years ago. He and his partner had been together for some seven years. When his partner died, he was not entitled to receive the superannuation that they had accumulated. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>11563</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to indicate that I will oppose the motion.

It is clearly as appropriate today as it was when it was instigated. I do not believe that in our modern society couples are excluded from being with any person who is in a hospital. As I said before, I am yet to see how a same sex couple, whether it be homosexual or lesbian, can naturally conceive a child. I do not deny that there are children who are under the parentage of same sex couples.</para><para>I would like to very clearly place on the record that Pauline Hanson's One Nation is absolutely opposed to any moves to have homosexuality or lesbianism placed on the same level as the institution of marriage. Maybe one reason—and I only proffer this as a possibility—that there are certain members of this chamber whom I have not, in the short period that I have been here, seen present for prayers in this chamber is that God's word clearly says to us that the acts of lesbianism and homosexuality are an abomination.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>11563</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I spoke on this issue at some length yesterday with regard to the superannuation legislation Senator Boswell referred to, so I will not go on today at length. The intent of moving this motion was simply to address an issue that often arises when amendments are moved in relation to superannuation legislation, for example, to remove discrimination against same sex couples. Any amendments made would be piecemeal and leave anomalies, et cetera, so it was simply an attempt to ensure that, from the government's perspective, all material was available about what overall changes would need to be made to remove discrimination in superannuation legislation and taxation legislation.</para></talk.start><para>This motion was not asking the government to adopt a policy in favour of that; it was simply an attempt to ensure the information
 was provided. As Senator Greig outlined, changes along those lines have been made in most state parliaments and the sky has not fallen in. The institution of marriage has not been abolished. Indeed, the world has gone on much as before except that a significant proportion of the community who were discriminated against financially and legally are not now. That is all that this issue is about.</para><para>In some ways I guess it is not surprising, but it is always very disappointing to hear the types of comments that have come from some speakers in the last half an hour in terms of the degree of fear and misunderstanding that still exists in the community. I would ask those senators, genuinely, to consider the basic issue that lies at the heart of this which, as Senator Greig said, is simply equal treatment for people. The degree of antagonism and the degree of discrimination against gay, lesbian and bisexual people is as unsupportable an action as that of racism, which is roundly condemned in the community.</para><para>I believe the community is supportive of equal treatment. That has been shown by the general support for changes that have been made by state governments, including supposedly conservative states like Tasmania and Queensland. I find it a great shame that the federal parliament and the Senate are lagging behind community views in that regard. Certainly the Democrats will continue to try and ensure that we get positive outcomes so that that level of discrimination ceases to occur and ceases to exist in federal legislation.</para><para>Question resolved in the negative.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—Could you please record my positive vote for that motion?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Certainly, Senator.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>11564</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economics References Committee</title><page.no>11564</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Extension of Time</title><page.no>11564</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>11564</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Murphy, I seek leave to incorporate a brief statement relating

</para><para>Let me speak briefly to this amendment. This was a matter that was canvassed last night in the committee. Let me outline to the committee why the opposition moved this amendment.</para><para>You will recall, Mr Temporary Chairman, that the issue has arisen in relation to a charitable trust being able to receive a tax deductible gift or donation from either a private individual or from a corporation. I did raise the concern very clearly in the Senate last night that there are some organisations like the Greenfields Foundation which are self-confessed charitable trusts. In fact, I made it clear that the trustees of the Greenfields Foundation—namely Anthony J. Bandle, for the trustees—wrote to the Australian Electoral Commissioner on 15 January 1998. Let me quote Mr Bandle directly, in relation to the Greenfields Foundation:</para><para>The Foundation is a Trust Fund, established for charitable purposes, administered by the Trustees.</para><para>It goes on:</para><para>Under the terms of the Trust Deed, establishing the Foundation, the Trustees hold the capital and income of the Trust Fund upon trust for such charitable institution or institutions and for such charitable purposes generally as they from time to time in their absolute and uncontrolled discretion determine.</para><para>You will recall, Mr Temporary Chairman, that the minister at the table, the Assistant Treasurer, refused leave to allow that particular letter to be tabled. I did raise this issue. I think it is of massive concern that an entity like the Greenfields Foundation—which is effectively a funding arm of the Liberal Party—can masquerade as a charitable trust.</para><para>Sure, we know there have been some donations to charities from the Greenfields Foundation, but the problem is that well in excess of $4½ million has been loaned by the Greenfields Foundation to the Liberal Party. As a so-called charitable trust, they might have given $80,000 in donations to registered charities, but their real operation is about supporting the activities of the Liberal Party.
 Of course, what the Liberal Party is really on about is trying to ensure that those responsible for providing moneys to the Greenfields Foundation are not disclosed. It is a mechanism established for the sole purpose of exploiting a loophole in the Commonwealth Electoral Act—a breach of the intent and spirit of the act in relation to our disclosure laws. That is the problem we have.</para><para>What I sought from the Assistant Treasurer yesterday was a categorical commitment that the Greenfields Foundation would not be a prescribed fund for the purposes of the act. In other words, I wanted to be assured that the Greenfields Foundation—this shonky operation that has been established by the Liberal Party—would not be able to receive gifts or donations from individuals or corporate entities with those individuals and corporate entities being able to have those gifts and donations treated as tax deductible.</para><para>Also, an associated issue goes to the disclosure of those gifts and donations, but that is a matter for the electoral legislation, on which the Labor Party has worked tirelessly—I acknowledge with the support of the minor parties and Independents in the Senate—to try to ensure that this loophole in the act that has been exploited by the Liberal Party through the Greenfields Foundation is closed.</para><para>Yesterday I sought a commitment from the Assistant Treasurer that the Greenfields Foundation would not be a prescribed fund for the purposes of the act. Senator Kemp was not willing to give that particular assurance, so the debate went on. I then pointed out that prescribed funds would not include a fund that is declared in writing by the Treasurer not to be a prescribed fund, so the Treasurer can take this action himself. I asked for a commitment from the Assistant Treasurer that the Treasurer would declare in writing that the Greenfields Foundation not be a prescribed fund. The Assistant Treasurer would not give that commitment.</para><para>So then I attempted to ask if the government would be willing to separately make a regulation for the Greenfields Foundation so
 that, if needed, that regulation could be disallowed by the Senate. We know that a number of prescribed private funds will be prescribed in the income tax assessment regulations. That is fine—everyone expects that to happen—but in this case we did not want the Greenfields Foundation actually lumped in with a whole lot of worthy charitable trusts, as opposed to shonky charitable trusts like the Greenfields Foundation. So I asked for that assurance from the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, and that assurance was not forthcoming.</para><para>The only conclusion a reasonable person can come to in this circumstance is that there is a conspiracy here on the part of the government to try to ensure that the Greenfields Foundation is a prescribed private fund for the purposes of the act. The government wants to see this bill go through in the form it is before the chamber so that individuals or corporations can donate moneys to the Greenfields Foundation, receive tax deductibility for those donations to the Greenfields Foundation and not have them disclosed in accordance with the spirit of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That is the issue.</para><para>The Assistant Treasurer refused all the reasonable suggestions and approaches that I made in this chamber yesterday. I am a very reasonable person, as you know, Mr Temporary Chairman, and we make these sorts of suggestions to the Assistant Treasurer—not across the legislation; we know that—to try to help him out. At least three suggestions were made and either not understood—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—All of them polite.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—All of them polite, but not understood by the Assistant Treasurer. Unfortunately, he was either unwilling or unable to give the Senate the sorts of assurances that it required in relation to this matter. I am very concerned that we have another rort on our hands here from the government in relation to the Greenfields Foundation. So there is no alternative but to move an amendment in the form that I have moved, which makes clear that a private fund which makes, or has ever made, a gift or contribution or provides, or has ever provided, a benefit of
 any other kind, including a loan, to a political party that is registered under the Electoral Act or an associated entity within the meaning of that act is incapable of being a prescribed fund.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think this is the only responsible course of action for the committee in this circumstance where the minister who is responsible for handling this legislation in this committee is either unwilling or unable to give the Senate and the Australian people the sorts of assurances that are perfectly reasonable when it comes to the integrity of our electoral processes. We do not want to see a situation where, under the cover of the philanthropy provisions of the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999 , the government tries to sleaze and sneak in a device whereby a shonky outfit like the Greenfields Foundation can have donors, either private or corporate, receive tax deductibility for gifts or donations to a so-called charitable trust when the charitable trust, in the case of the Greenfields Foundation, is just an electoral funding front for the Liberal Party of Australia. That is the problem, and it is my intention to close off that option here in the committee stage today with the amendment that I have moved.</para><para>As I said, we have offered the minister many alternative approaches, but the minister appeared to be unable to grasp the detail of the issue. I commend any interested member of the public—and there may not be many who are interested in this particular issue—who wants to have a look at the level of competence of government ministers in the Howard government to read last night's Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the committee stage of this debate. Have a look at what Senator Kemp, on behalf of the government, was saying. To be fair to Senator Kemp, he is probably the worst or the second worst minister in what is a very ordinary government, so we should not set too high a standard for him, but just have a look at the sort of information that was provided by Senator Kemp in this debate. Have a look at his answers to reasonable questions asked by not only me on behalf of the opposition but also other senators in the chamber. It was a rather tragic performance, I think you would agree, Mr Temporary
 Chairman. I commend the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to anyone who would like to see how it ought not be done. That is why I have had to move to fill the breach here where Senator Kemp is simply either unwilling or unable to give the Senate and the Australian people the sorts of assurances they are entitled to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>11568</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will be brief. I do not want to waste the time of the Senate anymore. Senator Faulkner has already wasted the probably 1½ to two hours of the Senate on a total nonsense. Later this evening Labor senators will probably wonder why they are being detained. The answer is that their leader proceeded to waste hours of this Senate on an absolutely total nonsense, which I will be explaining to the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>My second point is that I suppose we can all make political points across the chamber about levels of competence and who is good and who is bad. I put on the record that the truth of the matter is we do not regard as an insult what comes from Senator Faulkner because we do not care what he says. Senator Faulkner as minister for the environment was the first Labor minister to lose the environment vote and he earned the contempt of his colleagues for the incompetence with which he ran that portfolio. We all remember with great affection, as the truckies and workers surrounded Parliament House, Senator Faulkner being removed by the Prime Minister from being in charge of forests because of his hopeless, pathetic performance.</para><para>Senator Faulkner has stood up in this debate and suggested rorts by the Liberal Party here and there. Let me just indicate to the gallery that Senator Faulkner comes from the New South Wales Labor Party, the party of former Senator Richardson, the party of Mr Knight of SOCOG fame. This is a political party that has finessed rorting to the greatest extent possible. I would say it is a badge of shame to say that you belong to the New South Wales Labor Party. The New South Wales Labor Party is the synonym for political rorting. We only have to see the way Senator Faulkner's best mate, Mr Knight, is running SOCOG. Senator Faulkner never complained once about the performance of Mr Knight.
 And Senator Faulkner gets up here and attempts to lecture the Liberal Party. It is an absolute joke.</para><para>Let me not get into these personal comments, because the one thing I do not like to do is to make personal comments about people.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Cook interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—As Senator Cook knows, I am famed for my restraint on these matters.

I sat here and listened quietly while you sort of went up hill and down dale and marched up to the top of the hill and marched down again. You just learn to take it a bit. If you give a bit in life, you have to learn to take a bit. He has wasted the time of the Senate hugely, all on a complete nonsense.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will take the risk of repeating myself, because Senator Faulkner may take a little bit of time to learn. Obviously, quoting from the EM was a bit too complicated for Senator Faulkner. Item 6 of schedule 5 will provide that a fund can only be a prescribed private fund if it is established solely for the purpose of providing money to a fund or institution that is listed under subsection 30B. I shall repeat that for Senator Faulkner, because he is a bit slow. It will provide that a fund can
 only be a prescribed private fund if it is established solely for the purpose of providing money to a fund or institution that is listed under 30B.</para><para>Senator Faulkner, when you go to section 30B—you have got your advisers and I actually think you have got quite bright advisers; they are not as bright as mine but they are fairly bright—you will see the general categories like public hospitals, public benevolent institutions and public museums. You will also see specifically listed such meritorious institutions as the Girl Guides, the Scouts, the RSPCA and the Australian Conservation Foundation—all very worthy bodies.</para><para>Senator Faulkner, can I get this through to you so that we can see what a nonsense you have been creating? If a fund is established to provide funds to any non-listed institution, such as a political party, it cannot be a prescribed fund. Has that got through to you, finally? Senator Faulkner, we have wasted hours of this Senate. A fund that does not provide funds to those listed under 30B cannot be a prescribed private fund. So the whole construct that Senator Faulkner has created—the paranoia which covers this bloke because he thinks that the Liberal Party acts like the Labor Party—is a total nonsense.</para><para>Let us go a bit further. Let us, for example, say hypothetically that the government attempted to bring in a regulation on a prescribed private fund which Senator Faulkner did not agree with. The truth of the matter is that it could be disallowed by this Senate. The whole thing is a complete nonsense. I urge the Senate to put this matter to rest and to reject the amendment moved by Senator Faulkner so we can move on and do some serious business.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Faulkner's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>10:55:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para></para><division.data><ayes><num.votes>0</num.votes><title>AYES</title><names><name>Allison, L. </name><name>Bartlett, A.

The bill wants to allow a deduction of $1,500 to donors of property worth more than $5,000 to political parties. This is nothing more than an attempt by the Liberal Party to subsidise their wealthy
 benefactors through taxpayers' money. Amendments (4) and (5) on sheet 1557 seek to restrict the proposed $1,500 limit to the current cash donations limit of $100. People are free to make whatever political donations they like, but the taxpayers should not have to subsidise that donation process. A nominal amount of $100 is tax deductible for individuals. This means that people of ordinary financial means are able to get the same taxpayer subsidy rather than the wealthy being effectively able to get a lot more, which will happen if the government gets its way in the current bill. I commend to the Senate opposition amendments Nos 4 and 5.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>11571</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The amount of $1,500 merely brings these provisions into line with the yet to be enacted political donations bill.

This amendment will bring that into line with what currently exists. Given that the legislation the government has put forward but has not brought on for debate yet to increase that existing limit from $100 to $1,500 has not been determined by the Senate, we think it would be more appropriate from the government's point of view to make an amendment to lift $100 up to $1,500 in this area at the same time as it does with the other one, rather than try to put in $1,500 for donations of property and then move to lift the level of tax deductibility for direct donations up to $1,500. The Senate has not expressed a view on that and may not support it, in which case we would have a clear inconsistency. I know this item in the bill does not come into operation until that other bill is passed, but it would leave a messy anomaly in the tax law which we could do without. It would be much better to have a consistent $100 limit across the board. Then, if the Senate does want to change it in the
 future for donations of cash to $1,500 or $500 or $200 or $105 or whatever, then that change can be made across the board at that time. So for those reasons the Democrats believe this is a sensible amendment to ensure consistency in the level of allowable deductions to political parties, whether it is cash donations or donations of property. That would be consistent across the board in the legislation at $100 until such time as the parliament might choose to change it. So we will support these opposition amendments.</para></talk.start><para>Amendments agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>11571</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—Amendments Nos 13 to 15 essentially followed early amendments which were lost, so I withdraw them.

The legislation we have allows a five-year spread of tax deductibility if it is a cultural donation. The same should apply to donations of land. There is obviously the ability for somebody, for example, to donate a block of land which could be worth half a million dollars and with a one-off deductibility have a much smaller deduction than if they were to spread it over five years. That is clearly why the provision is there for cultural donations. If you donate a painting worth half a million dollars you will be able to, roughly speaking, take $100,000 off your taxable income each year for five years to gain a bigger tax advantage. The same should apply to land. I could put a strong argument to say that there is an even better case for land, environment and wildlife,
 donated to protect them forever, to get this tax advantage. That is what the amendments do.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>11572</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have received technical advice overnight that, consequential to the Democrat amendment that was passed yesterday, a couple of amendments contained in these Green amendments should be passed as well; that is, Green amendments Nos 16 and 17.

The government spent most of this week and previous weeks of this pre-Christmas sitting fiddling around with the program and marking time and not dealing with legislation according to its importance, but dealing with legislation in order to fill the gap available in order to have these bills ambushed on us at the last dying gasp of this year's sitting. My threshold point is that it is outrageous that we should be held to a deadline on tax legislation of such complexity as this and be expected to debate it in the time available before we rise this evening.</para><para>There are 454 amendments for one of these bills— A New Tax System (Indirect Tax and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999 . In the time available it is not possible to give them the due weight and scrutiny that this chamber ought to give them. These are amendments to the government's own GST legislation, which was foisted on Australians by the joint pact between the government parties and the Australian Democrats earlier this year. In the rush to legislate they got it grievously wrong and there are now 454 amendments to that pack of legislation that they want to remediate at the last minute prior to Christmas just before this Senate rises.</para><para>That is not good enough for Australians out there having to contend with trying to grasp and understand what the GST is all about. It is not good enough for Australian business, particularly small businesses which the government affects an interest in and which are taking contradictory advice from accounting companies as to what they must do to get their books right before the GST descends on them on 1 July next year. Just when they think they understand it prior to Christmas, 454 new amendments come along and they have to go out and try to understand it all
 again. It is not right from the point of view of ordinary Australians knowing what the law is supposed to be and being able to plan their income lives accordingly. We all know that ignorance is no defence before the law, but when you keep changing the law with this degree of complexity and with this rapidity—and constantly—it is a reasonable cop for ordinary citizens in this country to say, `We didn't know.' How could they be expected to know when even the government does not know?</para><para>Before I commence my substantive remarks on this legislation I want to make the point that we object to the timetabling of this legislation so late in the sitting as to prevent the Senate giving due and full consideration of all of the details. The Labor Party are going to support most of these amendments, and we are going to move some of our own. We hope we can have a substantive debate on them. If we are told that the Senate has to rise and we have to terminate the debate and speed it up, we will not be impressed. Already the government has made overtures to us as to whether we would agree to impose a guillotine on ourselves in order to complete the business. We are not going to agree to a guillotine; this is tax legislation. If there is ever a case for other legislation to be guillotined, there is no case for tax legislation to be guillotined. Tax legislation is about what the government taxes the community, and tax legislation therefore imposes on corporations and citizens and business transactions a penalty that has to be paid to the government. That is a serious thing and requires full and proper consideration, as I have said.</para><para>With those remarks, and under protest, let me turn to the substantive remarks that I wish to make in particular to A New Tax System (Indirect Tax and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999 . With these bills before us today, we have a continuation of the nightmare on main street—just like the movie <inline font-style="italic">Nightmare on Elm Street</inline> and the five sequels, the last one titled, interestingly enough, <inline font-style="italic">Freddie's dead: the final nightmare</inline>. I wish the same could be said for the continuing nightmare known as the Howard-Lees GST but, unfortunately, this package of bills continues the nightmare and
 no doubt will be part of a continuing number of sequels as the government and the Democrats continue to amend what was presented to us as their perfect, simple, efficient and easy to understand GST package.</para><para>Who can forget the commercials leading into the last election, from which the government now claims a mandate for the GST? This was going to be a simple tax; this was going to be an efficient tax; this was going to be a fair tax. `We have spent time developing this tax and we have got it right.' The lie to all of those inducements for people to vote for the coalition and endorse a GST before the last election is now revealed with these bills containing, as I have said, 454 amendments. Unfortunately, this is what those bills do. In the first instance, the  A New Tax System (Indirect Tax and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999  introduces another 454 amendments to the perfect tax package, the one we were told ad nauseam required no further amendments because it was perfect. We had the rhetoric that everyone would be a winner, that there would be no losers. Just like Freddie Kruger in the <inline font-style="italic">Nightmare on Elm Street</inline> movie and its sequels, this GST package has returned and continues to return time and time again to continue the nightmare, all thanks to the GST.</para><para>I still have ringing in my ears Senator Lees's famous words which she uttered upon agreeing to the GST. Those words were:</para><para>We got more from this government in 13 hours of negotiations then we did in 13 years from Labor.</para><para>I would now say to Senator Lees: given this great package you negotiated, this parliament looks like spending another 13 years clearing up your and the government's GST nightmare. Well done, Senator Lees. I hope the tea and biscuits with the Prime Minister were worth it, because the Australian public and Australian small business will be paying the cost of the Democrat-government botched negotiations for the rest of their lives.</para><para>These 454 amendments add to the 302 amendments the parliament has already had to deal with—a total of 756 amendments to the GST package in all. And the bill itself is not yet even operational. But that is not the end of it. In a horror scenario, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian
 Financial Review</inline> reported on 25 October that another 1,000 amendments were expected on top of the 454 amendments we are dealing with today. That means that before 1 July 2000 the original perfect, simple and easy to understand GST package will have a total of about 1,756 amendments made to it after it was carried in its allegedly pristine condition. This must indeed be a record for a bill that as yet has not taken effect.</para><para>What is also alarming is that the Democrat architect of the GST package, Senator Murray, who is in the chamber, and I acknowledge him, was quoted as saying he would not be surprised to see another two volumes of amendments to the bill. If he was talking volumes by reference to the existing tax act, this could run into several thousand pages of further amendments. One must remember that a selling point of the GST, one that the government pounded into the minds of Australian voters, was that this was a simple tax. Simplicity was a selling point. If this is what the Howard-Lees definition of simplicity is, let us hope they do not get into anything too complicated. And remember that, in relation to the education campaign that the government is funding from the taxpayers' purse to instruct business and the community about their obligations under this tax, the goalposts keep changing. The education effort must alter every time there is an amendment, because the law has changed. There is more and more taxpayers' money used up in explaining what the latest changes are and there are more and more obligations imposed on small business to alter their arrangements. There is more and more confusion in the general community about what they are up for and inability to plan household budgets because ordinary taxpayers are faced with a continuing stream of amendments from the government. This is indeed a nightmare scenario for small business already struggling to cope with the obligations of tax law, and it is imposed on them by the Howard-Lees GST.</para><para>Senator Murray has not been a lone voice on the subject. Mr Alan Smolak of the GST specialist firm The Gang of Four was also reported as saying that thousands of changes
 to the legislation might not be that far off the mark. He also said:</para><para>If you look at the amendment bills that are coming down, they are nearly the same size as the original legislation.</para><para>He went on:</para><para>There are stacks of issues out there that are unanswerable, and that should not be the case given that Australia is the last country of any jurisdictions to introduce a GST.</para><para>Just on the size of the package, to give some sense of the proportion of it, my colleague in the other place the member for Rankin, Mr Emerson, had an official weighing of the amendments. So far, the Howard GST package and amendments come to a total weight of 4.6 kilograms, and it is growing—not bad for only five months work. Not even the Income Tax Assessment Act, originally passed in 1936 and amended for over 60 years, weighs as much as that.</para><para>We have also seen in recent weeks the growing chorus of despondency, in particular from small business and business in general, about the havoc and mayhem the continual amendment of the Howard-Lees GST package is wreaking on their capacity to be GST ready by 1 July. Added to this is the growing failure of the government, through its Australian Taxation Office education campaign, to be able to explain to business how the GST will in fact work. This is not the fault of the tax office. I believe they are trying to do their best. But how can they explain a package that continues to change, like shifting sand? As I have said, we have 454 amendments today and the possibility of another 1,000 before 1 July 2000. Even Mr Jordan, the chairman of the government's GST Advisory Committee, has said that in the first weeks of seminars the Australian Taxation Office have been unable to answer questions about how the actual GST will operate—questions put to them by the business community, expecting the tax office to know what the legislation means and how it will function.</para><para>Furthermore, Mr Rick Matthews, the Deputy Commissioner for the GST, said the seminars were `pitched at delivering basic awareness'. Given the government's botching of the package, as evidenced by the bills
 before us today, is it any wonder that the Australian Taxation Office can only provide basic awareness? No doubt anything that involves detailed awareness and detailed explanation will be amended.</para><para>Even with these comments, let us see what a member of the government thinks of the government's own education campaign. Mr David Hawker, a senior Liberal backbencher, was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> newspaper on 13 October as saying that the GST seminar in his electorate of Wannon had been `a joke with officers unable to answer basic questions'. I must say that personally I think it is a bit unfair of Mr Hawker to be blaming the Australian Taxation Office. They are the messenger here and they are doing their best with what is a dog's breakfast of a tax. Shooting the messenger is not the answer; dealing with the message is the answer. That is the government's responsibility. If Mr Hawker wants to blame anyone, he need look no further than the Treasurer, the Prime Minister or Senator Lees. Maybe he should invite one of them into his electorate of Wannon and have that person explain to his constituents how the new, efficient, simple, easy to understand—one has to be ironic here—Howard-Lees GST will work.</para><para>It is also of concern that reports are starting to appear of a shortage of Australian Taxation Office technical staff who can advise on the Howard-Lees GST and draw up the necessary rulings that businesses require to make the GST operational. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> reported on 26 October that senior tax office executives had privately admitted to industry groups that they were behind schedule on the release of GST rulings because of the shortage of technical staff. How are businesses meant to comply with the Howard-Lees GST by 1 July 2000 when the government continually moves the goal posts and then denies the Australian Taxation Office adequate resources with which to do its job? Staff cuts to government services is one thing but, when you do not have the personnel to explain technicalities and to make rulings on areas of doubt so that there is clear guidance, then what you have is total confusion in the business community, and the false economy
 of cutting back staffing positions is thus revealed as a danger to business balance sheets.</para><para>This is symptomatic of the government's general incompetence on issues of major public policy. The list is endless: the GST deal, described by the Treasurer himself as a nightmare on main street; the handling of East Timor; the sacking of the Defence secretary by Minister Moore; the leaking of sensitive budget information by Dr Wooldridge—or his office—to his medical mates so that they could rip off the Medicare system through the MRI scam affair; Senator Newman's failed attempt to punish those who cannot work due to a disability by trying to force them back to work when they cannot; and let us not forget Dr Kemp's proposal to try to introduce $100,000 university degrees. Every major policy issue that this government has touched has turned into a disaster, and here we are today once again being asked to clean up one them, one of the centrepieces of government policy: the Howard-Lees GST.</para><para>Let us look at some of the issues these bills address. Firstly, the government is seeking to introduce some rules for small businesses in order to minimise the administrative nightmare they will face. There will be a special regime for small retailers selling both GST free and GSTable items under the simplified accounting measures. Under the proposal, a small business can elect to be covered by the system which applies a percentage figure to the total sales figure. In theory, this nominated figure should be reflective of the average proportion of sales that will be subject to the Howard-Lees GST and therefore the business should not need to separately account for each GST sale. Can I interrupt my remarks, Mr Acting Deputy President, to say that I understood there was an agreement between the parties in this chamber that I would have extended speaking time, given the number of bills rolled together. I see that the clock light is on and I just do not want to be sat down.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>—I was not in the chair, but that is the understanding.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to speak for another 20 minutes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">MURRAY</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—Given the comment by Senator Cook, on the same issue I was given the same leave through the chair—just so you understand.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Senator Murray, that is noted.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I have no objection to my colleague from the Australian Democrats having extended speaking time. I have said—and will continue to say—a few things about him and he may wish to have the ability to reply.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I was explaining some of the measures in these bills and I will go on with the explanation. As with the whole Howard-Lees GST package, problems still emerge with the approach that has been outlined in these amendments. The proposed system only applies to dealings between the retailer and the Australian Taxation Office. It does not affect the law regarding whether or not a particular item is taxable or non-taxable. All pricing of items will still have to be done on the correct basis and GSTable and non-GSTable items will have to be identified.</para><para>While this may be helpful, it still leaves consumers in the dark because they will not know what goods are GSTable and what goods are not. As part of the dirty deal done between the Democrats and the government, we had the Treasurer, who railed against hidden taxes, conspiring with the Democrats, who preach openness, transparency and accountability, to ensure that Australian consumers will never know how much GST they are in fact paying. They did not want the GST printed separately on receipts, as is international practice, because it would be a permanent reminder of the Democrats selling out there constituency, an issue I will come back to later.</para><para>When the GST bills were before us, I moved in this chamber, so that Australians would know how much GST they were paying and what the real price of a good or service was, that on the ticket advertising the
 price there would appear an amount saying what the tax was, an amount saying what the actual price was and a total amount. It is a matter of enduring shame that that amendment was defeated by the government and the Democrats. Now Australians will see only a total price and not the price that they are required to pay in tax added to the real price of the good or service.</para><para>Moving on to some other anomalies, I note that there are two specific ones with regard to the GST treatment of food and beverages. Firstly, still water will be GST free, irrespective of the packaging in which it is sold. Under the current legislation, bottled still water is GST free, but if the same brand of water is in a cask it gets hit with a hidden GST. This was one of the great outcomes that Senator Lees negotiated in 13 hours of talks with the Prime Minister—GST-free bottled water but GSTable cask water. Well done. That is a fine example of your negotiating prowess, which I am sure future Democrat leaders will look to for guidance and inspiration. Given that Senator Lees's leadership is currently the subject of a Democrat membership ballot, we may have a new Democrat leader sooner than we think. I have no doubt that Senator Murray, for instance, is savouring the prospect of becoming the new Democrat leader. I wish him well in his endeavours.</para><para>The second anomaly that I will address deals with milk. Unprocessed cows milk will be subject to the GST, although processed milk will be GST free. This will put milk processors in a cash flow negative position in the same way that meat processors will be. Dairy farmers will not be penalised in a cash flow sense. However, this means that unprocessed cows milk will be taxable while other unprocessed animal milks, such as goats milk, will be GST free. This is just another glaring example of this nightmare on main street and the myriad of different GST rules which will apply to milk, depending on whether it is processed or unprocessed, cows milk or goats milk. Once again, well done to the Democrats and the government. It is quite clearly a victory for simplicity on that issue!</para><para>There are literally hundreds of other issues dealt with in this bill and I look forward to
 Senator Kemp's succinct and timely explanation of each one of them in the committee stages of the bill. I hope he does provide an explanation. It is essential to the transparency process and to the processes of this Senate that an explanation be recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as to why the amendments are being made.</para><para>I remind the Senate again that at the beginning of my address I protested, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, that this complex and detailed bill containing over 454 amendments was being brought on just before the Senate shuts down for summer and just before the beginning of the Christmas recess. The placing of this bill as the last bill before we close is meant to stifle debate. One of the ways the government can overcome my objection on that is for the Assistant Treasurer, who is the minister in charge of this legislation, to make an explanation as to the purpose of these amendments so that it is in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and thus on the record and available.</para><para>I would like to move on to three amendments that Labor will be moving to this bill. These amendments are not new and were moved by Labor in the main GST debate. But, due to the government and Democrats combining to ensure that Labor could not debate these amendments in full, it is appropriate that they should be revisited and that Labor's position and that of the Democrats and the government in particular be put on the public record. The first amendment deals with transparency, the second is known as the infamous high-roller amendment and the third deals with anti-avoidance.</para><para>The first amendment is a very simple but important amendment. It would require all goods sold for which a receipt is provided to have disclosed separately on that receipt the amount of the GST that the consumer is actually paying. When this amendment was put the last time, it was voted down with the full support of the Australian Democrats. This party of openness, transparency and accountability ensured that the Australian public would never know how much of the $30 billion of hidden taxes they were paying.</para><para>The words of Senator Woodley in rejecting this amendment now ring in my ears. He described it as a political stunt. The term
 `political stunt' is not something that you could apply to this amendment. This amendment is about empowering Australians to know what their tax bill is. If the amount of the GST is not shown on the price tag and there is just one figure, how will Australians know what the real price of the good is and whether the tax has been calculated accurately? `No taxation without representation' was the slogan of the American Revolution. The Boston Tea Party gave rise to it.</para><para>This is not quite in the same category, but taxation without the taxed individual knowing exactly the amount of tax is unfair. Citizens and consumers have a right to know how much tax they pay. Ordinary Australians who receive their wages or salaries know what the gross amount is, what the amount deducted for tax is and what the net wage or salary is. It is on their income slips. That is correct, fair and proper. They should know how much tax they pay. But under a GST, when you go to the supermarket or you go for a haircut or you consume some other service, you will not know.</para><para>All the opposition are saying is that, while we oppose this tax, we recognise that it is now going to be imposed. At the very least, rather than hide the amount, show the amount. Be honest, be open, be transparent. We will be moving an amendment to provide for that. This amendment has become even more important as there is a much broader range of GST exemptions, and the public surely has a right to know which goods are GSTable and which ones are not. How can any ordinary Australian be expected to know, given the complexity of the changes, what is GSTable and what is not? If it is on the price tag, you then know whether you are correctly paying the tax or not, and you will know what the tax applies to or what it does not. It is the view of the Australian Labor Party that that knowledge should be given to consumers.</para><para>From the position the Democrats took in the last debate, it appears that they do not share that view. They are obviously quite happy for consumers to be ripped off and exploited because they will never know how much of the Howard-Lees GST they are paying unless they have read all of the 4.6 kilograms in
 weight of amendments. The growth of the new, simplified, efficient and easy to understand GST system is such that we now have 454 amendments before us today.</para><para>Having said that, I now want to turn to the opposition's second amendment, the debate on which produced one of the most shameless and cowardly performances in this chamber I have seen and an attempt by one Democrats senator to subsequently rewrite their role in what is known as the infamous Crown Casino high-roller amendment. Under the government's original and intended proposal, Crown Casino high rollers and Liberal mates such as Lloyd Williams and Ron Walker would not get any special treatment under the GST legislation. But we then had the secret Crown Casino submission to the GST committee which sought just that: special treatment for millionaire high rollers and Liberal mates.</para><para>Isn't it interesting to compare this with the Prime Minister's stance on the application of the GST to premium Olympic tickets? On his decision to now apply the GST to Olympic `tickets for the rich', the Prime Minister said the following in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, on 16 November this year:</para><para>But you are talking about $50 million and you are talking about perceptions of fairness about the application of the GST.</para><para>So he is saying that it is fair to apply the GST to premium Olympic tickets, which he had never proposed to do, but it is unfair to apply the GST to casino high rollers—and these are people who gamble at the level of three-quarters of a million dollars and above per throw—even though it was his original proposal to do just that. This is because under Mr Howard's original proposal, where a casino decided to reimburse losses sustained by high rollers, such a repayment would be GSTable—an entirely fair and appropriate measure which ensured that wealthy gamblers paid the GST. This was Mr Howard's position until the secret submission from the bagman of the Liberal Party, Ron Walker, came along—the same individual who paid off the Liberal Party's $4 million debt to the NAB—seeking a GST tax break for his millionaire high-roller mates.</para><para>We would expect this from the government—rewarding their mates—but the last group of people who we would expect to put millionaire high rollers and mates of the Liberal Party before the concerns of charities, the poor and the underprivileged are the Australian Democrats. But they did, and they voted for it. In what was one of the most shameless and cowardly acts the Senate has witnessed, five Australian Democrats—Senators Lees, Murray, Bourne, Allison and Woodley—when asked to take a stand on principle, did the exact opposite. Rather, they did the chicken walk straight out of the Senate doors, thus ensuring that millionaire high rollers, along with their Liberal mates, got a multimillion dollar GST tax break. By absenting themselves from the Senate chamber in the full knowledge that the government would then have the numbers and by not voting, they ensured that the amendment would be carried.</para><para>The only Democrats who took a principled stand on this issue were Senators Bartlett and Stott Despoja, who joined the opposition to try to vote down this outrageous proposal. We also now see how the Democrats deal with those who try to take a stand on principle. Rather than adulation and respect for their decision, the knives are out, led by Senator Lees's senior advisers, John Schumann and Stephen Swift. If anybody doubts this, look at the recent press. On 23 October in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, under the headline `Democrats knives out over GST deal', it was reported that the politics of revenge was at work in the party, whereby senators seen as disloyal over the GST deal had been targeted for punishment. The source is quoted as saying:</para><para>There was a hope that people could forget about things, but that hasn't happened yet . . . I don't want to overstate it, but there is a view that considerable punishment should be meted out to people who are disloyal.</para><para>The article goes further to quote from Mr John Cherry, who said:</para><para>There are some hard feelings on both sides. The GST deal was still the great unmentionable in the party room.</para><para>The article gets better, claiming that Stephen Swift is said to be strongly opposed to Senators Bartlett and Stott Despoja.</para><para> We know why Mr Swift is opposed to Senator Stott Despoja—that is, because she beat him to become Senator Coulter's replacement in the Democrats preselection. At least in that case we know that naked ambition is alive and well. Why Mr Swift is similarly opposed to Senator Bartlett is not known. Maybe Senator Bartlett's principled stand against the GST tax breaks for millionaire high rollers upset Mr Swift's and Senator Lees's notion of fairness and equity that they believe millionaire casino high rollers deserve. What needs to be answered is why these comments were allowed to be made at all. The answer must be that they were sanctioned at some senior level in the party in an effort to undermine Senators Bartlett and Stott Despoja. How else would such comments ever be authorised, unless the leader gave approval in some form to do so?</para><para>I would now like to turn my attention to Senator Allison who, in recent times, has tried to rewrite history with regard to the role she played in ensuring the multimillion dollar handout to casino high rollers. Senator Allison has deliberately and wilfully sought to mislead the Senate on her voting record.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>—Senator, I do not think you can say that.

Senator Conroy said:</para></talk.start></continue><para>But I particularly find it galling for Senator Allison especially to stand up here and criticise Steve Bracks about his position on gambling, because Senator Allison is an individual who gave $10 million to Jamie Packer. This is an individual who improved the bottom line of Crown Casino when she walked out of the chamber to allow passage of some of the worst amendments you will ever see. They were called the GST high-roller amendments. When the five chicken Democrats walked out, they gave the government the numbers to pass the high-roller amendments, and that put $10 million in Jamie Packer's pockets.</para><para>Senator Allison's reply was:</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Conroy is misrepresenting my position. I did not walk out of the chamber; I did vote on that occasion.</para><para>Unfortunately for Senator Allison, this is not the outright truth, and is a very poor attempt to revise the history on the part of Senator Allison, when the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  and the <inline font-style="italic">Journals of the Senate</inline>  show otherwise. In particular I refer the Senate to the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  of 25 June, page 6461 onwards and to points made by me, Senator Conroy and Senator Brown.</para><para>If we look at page 1248 of the <inline font-style="italic">Journals of the Senate</inline>, which recorded the vote, Senator Allison's name does not—I stress, does not—appear as either for or against the amendment or paired for the amendment. In other words, Senator Allison did not vote and she did leave the chamber. I think her remarks, therefore, are misleading. One can only assume that it would be embarrassing for this information to get out.</para><para>In conclusion, we have 454 amendments to deal with in the number one bill, and I look forward to Senator Kemp's explanation of each and every one of those amendments in the committee stage of the bill. In the absence of such explanations, I fear the committee stage of the bill could indeed be a time consuming and lengthy process. So I ask Senator Kemp not to disappoint us.</para><para> A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill 1999  and  A New Tax System (Pay As You Go) Bill 1999  are significant in their own right. They deserve to be fully debated separately. However, because of the government's mismanagement of its program, we are forced to debate these important measures in conjunction with the other GST amendment bills. There are many issues dealt with in these bills. I will confine my remarks to some of the more important provisions in the legislation; namely, the pay as you go proposals, the business activity statement and the provisions dealing with charities.</para><para>The pay as you go provisions are supposed to simplify the administration of a business taxpayer's obligations both for withholding amounts which are taken out of payments made by a taxpayer and for remittance of

The Democrats are very strong supporters of the pay as you go tax system, which replaces 11 existing payments and reporting systems, including the harshness of the old provisional tax system. The Democrats started campaigning in 1994 against the provisional tax system for small business. That was when the provisional tax system of the then Labor government was assuming every year that small business incomes were rising by eight per cent a year and taxing them on that basis when the inflation rate was actually around one to two per cent a year. That ruse by the Labor Party was costing small business around $200 million to $300 million a year.</para><para>The Democrats moved in 1994 and 1995 to have the uplift factor reduced, but the coalition did not then support us. Finally, after the change of government in 1996, the coalition government reduced the uplift factor by several percentage points. But, even still, the assumption was there that all businesses have
 a common business experience that incomes rise with economic growth.</para><para>Senators may not remember that the pay as you go tax system was in fact a recommendation of the Senate inquiry into small business taxation set up by the Democrats in 1995. The proposition was very simple: small business should pay tax on the basis of their income as they earn it—a simple proposition, but one that was too complicated for the Keating government to grasp. We are pleased to lend our support to the establishment of the pay as you go tax scheme for small business. The introduction of the GST and the calculation of turnover implicit in that have made the pay as you go system a possible and practical reform.</para><para>I note that these bills also increase the threshold for which small business can access the cash accounting rules for GST from $½ million to $1 million. The Democrats, among others, made representations to the Treasurer on this basis and we therefore welcome this significant concession which will mean, on government figures, that 95 per cent of small business will have access to the simplified payments associated with cash accounting. This is another significant improvement which will reduce the compliance costs. These bills indeed contain dozens of provisions that reduce the compliance costs for various categories of businesses and fix problems that have now been identified.</para><para>The Labor Party has tried to make a meal of the fact that there are so many amendments before us, as if the wholesale sales tax never needed changing. Frankly, I would have been surprised if there had not been numerous changes to the ANTS bills. Any practical person—and there are not many of those in the Labor Party—would have known that once the government had managed to get their three dozen plus bills through—which was the essence of their package, the backbone of their legislation—they would then have had the time and opportunity to correct errors and improve what is by any standard a very comprehensive undertaking.</para><para>Not only do I welcome these amendment and implementation bills, but I look forward to further amendment bills. Senator Cook has
 tried to expose that as a weakness. In my view it is a strength—a mature and responsible government will evaluate its legislation on a continuous basis and improve it. I hope they do bring forward further amendments. No complex undertaking of this magnitude will ever be free of the need for improvement, particularly as experience increases the detailed understanding of the ANTS package.</para><para>It may well be true that more than 105 countries all have a VAT or GST system, and it is also true that those countries have to amend and improve their legislation continually. Despite the fact that Australia has examined many of those systems overseas, it nevertheless has to learn its own lessons and come to its own conclusions, so I welcome these amendments and I look forward to further amendments. I think the Labor Party's focusing on the number of amendments is quite frankly pathetic in view of their own history with the wholesale sales tax, the obvious practicalities and the need for further amendment to improve the legislation.</para><para>The Democrats particularly welcome the provisions creating simplified accounting measures for retailers who sell a mixture of taxable and tax free supplies, such as pharmacies and food retailers. These amendments will give the commissioner the ability to make a determination for a retailer on how much of their turnover is taxable and how much is not. This scheme will significantly reduce compliance costs for smaller retailers.</para><para>The Democrats always recognised that zero rating food would mean that grocery stores would face compliance cost increases. The government had estimated the total compliance costs of introducing the ANTS package over the whole economy at $1.9 billion. We estimated that zero rating basic food would add $40 million in compliance costs. The principal accounting body estimated a higher figure of $100 million. Even that highest estimation added a total additional compliance cost of only a little more than two per cent. What did we get in return? We got a substantial $3.6 billion annual reduction in food prices—a massive contribution to the equity of the ANTS package. Labor condemned us for that; their preferred position was to tax
 food. They try to get us all to forget that fact, but several times in the ANTS debate they voted on division to tax food. It is recorded. So to save between $40 million to $100 million in compliance costs, they would rather tax basic foods and put a $3.6 billion impost on the people.</para><para>When Labor say that if they win government they will roll back the GST, what do they mean? Do they mean they will tax basic food? They are on the record as having wanted that. I can just see their next election campaign. It will go something like this, `We hate the GST, but we're going to keep it. Forever.' They will also say, `We love the battlers, but we're going to tax basic food.' That is going to be a really believable election campaign! It is going to be real fun watching you persuade people on that one.</para><para>In Senator Lees's statement to the Press Club in April, we suggested that the government should look at adopting the simplified retail scheme that the UK tax commissioner has in place to reduce compliance costs. We are pleased that they have done so, and that this has now occurred. I might point out that, where a retailer such as a butcher or a greengrocer is exclusively selling GST free goods, their compliance costs will be much lower than if they had taxable sales.</para><para>A major report on compliance costs by Professor Cedric Sandford for the UK VAT authorities showed that traders who are zero rated had compliance costs 35 per cent lower than those of taxable suppliers. That, combined with the improved retail schemes, will go some considerable way to containing the administrative cost of making basic food GST free. These bills also allow for the immediate write-off for GST related expenditure for small and medium enterprises with a turnover of not more than $10 million. This measure, which will cost around $175 million next year, is on top of the $500 million GST start-up and compliance cost assistance already agreed. In my reports and my public statements I have been critical of the $500 million as being too little. Therefore, the Democrats support this added expenditure and are pleased that the government has decided to make it.</para><para>My Senate report in May recommended increasing the pool for compensation by $200 million—so I am about $25 million shy on my figure—and with a priority for upgrading software and hardware. Immediate write-offs are an appropriate way of achieving this. I would note that my Senate report also called for special concession to the not-for-profit sector. Some of these have been achieved, but there is more we continue to lobby for. My colleague Senator Woodley will deal with that issue later in this debate.</para><para>The Democrats will continue to closely monitor compliance costs for small business. We believe that the generous threshold for cash accounting, combined with the access to retail schemes, combined with replacing provisional tax with pay as you go and combined with a simplified tax system included in the business tax package will leave small business with a tax system that will ultimately prove to be very much better than the current one.</para><para>In making those remarks, I should indicate that the Labor Party are in a real bind because the package is an integrated one. The ANTS package integrates with the Ralph package. How do you support part of the package and not the other part? It just does not fit together well. That particular fact has been commented on by senior journalists who regard the inconsistency of the Labor situation as an indication that they are in this for politics and not for policy. All Labor are concerned about is trying to win government, not about what is good policy and appropriate tax policy for this country.</para><para>The government should be commended for its courage in undertaking the difficult task of major tax reform and in particular the difficult task of delivering a much more effective tax system for small business. It is a job that Labor baulked at doing and was not prepared to do. For that, Labor should be condemned. It was not that they did not have the advice as to how to do it. They lacked the political will, the political courage and the political ability to get it done. They are a party that are obsessed with factions and power and not with strong policy and strong attention to really difficult policy issues. I cite, for in
 stance, their abject failure to consider any meaningful changes to negative gearing or any other measure of the sort. They backed off in 1985 and they are still licking their wounds 14 years later.</para><para>Tax reform was and is absolutely essential if our tax system is to deliver the revenue needed to fund future services. Tax reform on this scale guarantees revenue in a manner future governments will be eternally grateful for, Labor included. It is the tax reform they squibbed. And if Labor get into government, I would like to see the day that they consider even for a moment the withdrawal of the GST system. I would like to see that day come. It will not come. Because of that, we know that they are in here for politics not for policy. This is just about trying to win government.</para><para>Let me briefly recap on the task we were faced with—the tax reform task left undone by Labor. The wholesale sales tax system was collecting taxes off a declining tax base. Treasury figures showed that by 2002 the indirect tax system would be collecting $2.8 billion less than it did in 1995. Access Economics forecast that that gap would rise by 2008 to $7 billion or more. Between 1986 and 1993, a similar decline in indirect tax collections led Labor to ramp up the WST rates from 20 and 30 per cent to 22 and 32 per cent—around $3 billion of extra indirect taxes. At least that was marginally better than Labor's approach from 1983 to 1993, which was to fill the gaping holes in revenue by cutting back grants to the states who, in turn, starved the services that battlers used in the states. We date the problems in the states being able to meet the needs of their citizens from that Labor policy at the Commonwealth level. The Labor Party at the Commonwealth level have caused the major problems we have experienced in the states and their finances.</para><para>From 1983 to 1995, states grants fell from 31.4 per cent of federal outlays to just 23.5 per cent, a drop of around $11 billion in funding. Every cracked and broken down school, every hospital bed that has not been put in, every bad road, every poor service provided has its origin in that Labor policy. It is a factor which is not well understood in
 the community, but you should stand condemned for it. The federal Labor government relied more and more on bracket creep and the income tax system to fund surviving services and privatisation to plug spending holes. That policy of starving the states forced you, a socialist party, to sell Commonwealth assets and utilities. Why? It was not because you were attached to it for policy reasons, as the Liberal Party are. Why did you sell them? It was because you could not manage your money and because you did not have any idea about how to work out the tax system. It is an absolutely atrocious record. You sold icons which should still be in public sector hands and which, in our view, should still be retained. You did so because you could not manage the books, you could not run the finances.</para><para>After the tax reforms of 1986, which were courageous and Labor should be complimented for getting some of those under way, Labor did little to combat tax avoidance, allowing trusts, use of corporate structures, salary packaging, negative gearing and other tax loopholes to run rampant. By 2000, bracket creep alone will have added around $8 billion to income tax revenues. Bringing tax rates back to 1993 rates would have required an $8 billion run-down of the surplus.</para><para>That brings us to the GST. The GST is a strong growth tax because, unlike the wholesale sales tax, it picks up the services sector which provides around three-quarters of the growth in the economy. I have never understood those who say it is okay to have an indirect tax on goods—on manufacturing—but not on services. Right at the heart of this is an inability of Labor to understand the basics. If you did not believe in indirect taxes at all, that would be a legitimate policy position. But you do believe in indirect taxes. All indirect taxes are regressive, so the GST is regressive. But so is the WST. The nature of a flat, indirect tax is that it is regressive. Why would you think it is okay to hurt goods and manufacturing with an indirect tax but not to apply the tax on services? At the heart of this is an inconsistency—a lack of tax understanding. Why did you take that approach? It is not
 because you are mugs, not because you are stupid. Labor take that approach because of politics. They think it is better politics to be opposed to the GST. There is very little about policy.</para><para>All of that new GST revenue will go to the states, who Labor starved, allowing the abolition of general purpose grants to the states and giving the states access to a more reliable growth tax. That is why every one of the states, especially the state Labor governments, are delighted with the GST. They have all fallen over themselves to sign up on it. Surely, if a principled Labor government in the states really did not believe in this tax, they would have turned it aside and said, `We refuse to sign.' The Commonwealth government could not have forced them. The Commonwealth government would have been obliged to go a different route. But they did not. Every single one of them said, `Wow! This is just the best policy. Thank goodness you are doing it.' You know it and I know it. It is because the states have to manage the money and the GST is going to be supported by them. If Labor ever get into government, you watch the states put the squeeze on you not to adjust it. You watch what they do. When we come to discuss the high rollers amendment later, I will have a bit of fun with you about the states and the Labor governments on that, too.</para><para>The GST abolishes the estimated $7 billion of embedded indirect taxes on Australian business, which adds around three per cent to the cost of Australian exports and to the cost of Australian goods competing against imports. On the income tax side, there will be $12 billion of tax cuts offset by around $7 billion of base broadening measures. One of those base broadening measures is the $2½ billion of brought forward company tax payments by progressively moving company tax to a pay-as-you-go basis offset by the $1.4 billion largely one-off cost of the abolition of provisional tax.</para><para>Once the base broadening measures are taken into account, people earning more than $100,000 per year on average will, on average, pay more tax than they do now. That is not well understood or well known. Once we
 see all these measures come through, it is our belief that this government will have created a higher real, effective taxation of people earning above $100,000. Eventually, the statistics will show whether our judgment is right or wrong. It is a very interesting outcome. It is a more equitable outcome, in our view, of all these changes. It is probably not one that the coalition will loudly proclaim—or perhaps it will. But that is our view of it.</para><para>At the bottom end of the scale, the amendments won by the Democrats will leave social security beneficiaries considerably better off. This has been confirmed by the independent research by Professor Ann Harding of NATSEM, which was commissioned and published by the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper. Labor senators might remember that NATSEM provided the costing of Labor's tax policy at the last election, so I assume it has some credibility with them.</para><para>NATSEM's modelling of the GST impact found that social security beneficiaries would do very well out of the social security changes negotiated by the Democrats. Age pensioners were particular winners. Labor will also recall that social security beneficiaries were to be denied the benefits of Labor's tax credit because they were only to apply to earned income. I can understand the anger that Labor felt about the Democrats' achievements on the GST. The Democrats won increases for social security beneficiaries that Labor never wanted and which a future Labor government will now have to honour.</para><para>Why did Labor not want them? Because they did not have the tax revenue system which could have paid for it. The coalition has created a revenue stream which allows them to pay for greatly enhanced benefits which formerly could not be paid and which under the Labor plan could never be paid. That is the outcome. If you want to pay people, you have to earn the revenue. That is a very simple, practical outcome.</para><para>I have a list here of the NATSEM modelling of the GST impact. Even on the worst case benefit, the lowest that any category would see as an improvement in a week would be $2.61 and $2.47. The best case is far higher. I have very detailed appendices of
 13 different sorts of calculations done by Professor Harding. They cover all the way from single persons to double income couples. There are massive increases in their real standards. Why? Because it is a total tax system. It guarantees the revenue stream and the mix of tax policies which allow people to be better off. That is why we support it. That is why somebody with my beliefs and philosophy supports it.</para><para>It is important to recap all of that history, the very real and very good case for tax reform. Labor, in seeking to attack this bill, are just carrying on an attack on the GST. They are denying that there was a problem with our present tax system. They are denying the ability of the country to develop sufficient revenue to meet its needs and to improve the living standards of Australians. It is denying that it needed to be fixed. They really are the King Canutes of tax. Years later, there will be cartoons of the King Canutes of tax out there trying to push back reality. Practical people know that what has been done had to be done. I am not saying that it is perfect. I said earlier that I welcome and look forward to many amendments for any inadequacies that are discovered. But, overall, the intent and the concept is right.</para><para>Labor is trying to deny social security beneficiaries a real and significant increase in living standards. They are trying to deny Australian manufacturers the ability to compete on export markets or against importers on a fair playing field. They are trying to deny a decent funding base for the states for the funding of future health, education and welfare services. In short, Labor's bleating in this debate—they will carry on because they do—shows more about its paucity of policy ideas than about the failings of the new tax system. It shows that their own concern is politics, not policy.</para><para>When people discover how Labor have tried to exploit their natural fears of major tax change, they will despise you for it. You take a tremendous political risk in beating up the natural fears that people have. When people discover the reality, when they are actually into the system, they will look unkindly upon
 you for it. You are making people unnecessarily stressed and anxious.</para><para>It was always inevitable that the GST system would be amended and modified as we went. Labor should know that. When it was in government, they would bring forward an average of eight to 10 major tax amending bills each year. Did anyone say they were doing the wrong thing? Maybe they did now and again. I think it is perfectly appropriate to try to improve a system.</para><para>There should be no surprise about the 200 pages, including all these amendments, in these bills on the GST. Indeed, that there are so many amendments shows that the government is listening to concerns and responding to them, despite the pressure on Labor to maximise the potential mischief by there not being amendments. They would, frankly, prefer the GST system to be as harsh and inflexible as possible.</para><para>These bills are littered with lots of new concessions for various categories of taxpayers. GST-free first aid and life saving courses, for example, which were made GST free by the Democrats for not-for-profit providers, will now also be made GST free if provided for for-profit companies as well. GST-free treatment for charities is extended for the supported accommodation community housing sector to cover services provided at up to 75 per cent, rather than 50 per cent, of direct cost or market value.</para><para>The health GST-free definition is expanded to include HIV detection tests and medicines and drugs provided by health professionals other than doctors, provided it is authorised by state law. The treatment of the sale of second-hand goods is dealt with, allowing immediate claims of input tax credits for goods with a value of less than $300 and other concessions. There is a new concession, which I think is a major one, for not-for-profit sub-entities, and which Senator Woodley will expand on later. There is further clarification of the impact of the GST on insurance products reducing compliance costs, particularly in respect of settlements. The amendments also expressly exclude state stamp duties from the calculation of the GST. We hope that the states would replicate that intention.</para><para>Listening to Labor over these last few weeks and months on the GST, they strike me as being like an army shooting off all its ammunition at practice. What is Labor going to do when the election comes around? By then consumers would have settled into the reality of the GST and the new tax package, businesses would have settled into the reality of the GST and the new integrated tax system, and the not-for-profits would have established what the reality of the GST and the new integrated tax system is. Their fear will go and will be replaced by reality. Strong opponents of the GST will remain strong opponents. There are strong opponents of income tax in the system. An ordinary person would have to be a mug to actually enjoy paying tax because it lessens your disposable income. There will always be strong opponents of the GST. But the fear will go because the reality will replace it.</para><para>My father-in-law has a wonderful saying. He says it is the pending tray which gives you the ulcers. It is the expectation of something which you are not sure of and which will come. What Labor has to remember is that of the over 105 countries that have a GST it is passe, it is gone, it is not an issue. In only one country was there significant governmental problems after the introduction of a GST. So Labor hangs all its election hopes on a one per cent chance. Everywhere else it is a perfectly normal part of everyday life. It is part of the tax system. Citizens do not march in the streets, they do not comment on it—from Denmark to New Zealand.</para><para>Senator Cook is widely travelled. Senator Cook, has anybody come up to you and said: `Goodness, we hate this tax system. We wish we didn't have a GST or VAT'? I am sure they do! I am sure that everywhere you go you are stopped all the time and told: `Keep up your principled stand. We know that Labor is doing the right thing. We wish that all of our citizens, billions of people, did not have a GST or VAT'! They do not do so, because they know that it is a sensible indirect tax system which contributes to the revenue which provides them with the services they need. That is what is going to happen. I make those remarks not to try to be smart but
 because I wonder what Labor are going to do when they get to the election. By then it will be in. This fear campaign will have dissipated. It will be replaced by the reality of what it is.</para><para>I now move to some of the very personal, sharp and nasty and, I hope, out of character remarks made by Senator Cook about Democrat senators and the internal party workings of the Democrats and the repetition of some excesses of journalism we have seen about this matter. Strangely enough, Senator Cook has paid us an absolute compliment, as has the Labor Party, throughout these debates and campaigns. The Labor Party is starting to show fear—and I am surprised you would show it, Senator Cook, from my own knowledge of you. They are afraid of the Democrats. How extraordinary. Why would a major party be afraid of a minor party? The reason is as follows.</para><para>When our former leader Cheryl Kernot, a senator at that time, was poached by the Labor Party I advised the party room, where people were assembled after the somewhat startling event, not to be concerned because we were the target, not her. She was a good catch by all means, a high profile figure, a very capable person. But we were the target. Why were we the target? We were the target because the Labor Party is the only party in this country which is still capable of governing on its own. However, if its vote falls to a critical level it cannot govern on its own without a coalition partner. It does not have one and it is not going to get one. Therefore, it has to attack the Democrats as strongly as it attacks the Liberals to keep up its own vote. That is what lies behind its attack upon us. Its attack on us is designed to try to keep the Democrats' vote low.</para><para>What is more, the Labor Party are absolutely up to their necks in internal interference in Democrat affairs. They are the masters of branch stacking—you cannot believe they would leave their branch stacking just to their own party—and there are branch stacking attempts on the Democrats. What is more, it is on the record in court transcripts that the Labor Party have funded our opponents' efforts to disrupt our party. A party of branch
 stackers and bully boys, who at their worst specialise in beating up their opponents—as we know, the latest example was in WA—are not going to flinch from the sort of behaviour that involves attacking the Democrats from whatever strategic basis they regard as right.</para><para>So when I hear you, Senator Cook, exposing all these attacks and trying to foment discontent and unhappiness in the Democrat ranks, I thank you because you have paid me the ultimate compliment. You have paid me the compliment of saying that you are afraid of us. As a political party you are afraid of the Democrats because you think that if we carry on in this way, with strong attention to policy and with a courageous commitment to doing the right thing, your vote will go down. And if your vote goes down, you do not get into government.</para><para>It is just so obvious and transparent. That is the real issue that concerns you. Otherwise, why else would you be funding our opponents? Why else would you be branch stacking the Democrats? Why else would you be trying to put division into the Democrats? You might think you would upset me or get me uptight. There is nothing worse in politics than being ignored and I am glad you are not ignoring me. So thank you very much.</para><para>Having digressed in response to Senator Cook's remarks, I want to conclude by saying that there was a quote in the <inline font-style="italic">BRW</inline> which summarised this tax package fairly well. It said:</para><para>While the demand for goods and services will clearly be affected by price changes, the tax package also contains $12 billion of personal income tax cuts and $6.6 billion of compensation family package payments which will substantially boost household disposable incomes, more than offsetting a one-off rise in consumer prices. The net impact on the economy will be a $5.6 billion fiscal stimulus or one per cent of GDP, which is expected to significantly lift household spending from July 2000.</para><para>That is the message. This integrated tax package—both the Ralph business tax reforms and the ANTS package reforms—provides major personal income tax cuts, major compensation family tax package benefits, a fiscal stimulus to the economy and in turn provides a guaranteed revenue stream for the future
 and proper funding of the states and generally will deliver a far better fiscal taxation and social and environmental income than we would otherwise have enjoyed. That does not mean it is perfect. Of course, it is not perfect. How can it be perfect? It is impossible to design a system which is perfect. We hope that the government will continue to have the courage to listen carefully to people who have problems and to resolve those problems with future amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>11589</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Dealing with the new tax system is an interesting exercise. I remember the fear campaign that was run in the UK many years ago when an indirect tax system was going to be introduced over there. There was much publicity the night before the introduction and everyone raced out to buy their fish and chips because it was the last time they were ever going to be able to afford them. And what happened? Within a matter of days people decided that it was not actually all that bad and that the price impact still allowed them to go and buy fish and chips. The only line that has not been drawn by the Labor Party at the moment is that people will not be able to afford hundreds and thousands, or something like that. It is getting to the absurd stage now and coming from the opposition, just for the sake of opposition, I think is pretty breathtaking.</para></talk.start><para>It is even more breathtaking from the point of view that they will not give a commitment that, if returned to government, they will abolish it, that they will wind it back. If they are that opposed to it, why have they not given such a commitment? Because fundamentally they agree that it is desirable for the country. Their attack now on the Australian Democrats, because the Australian Democrats can see reason and logic as to a new tax system, is also pretty breathtaking. For them to start calling another party hypocritical and everything else is just inappropriate.</para><para>The fact of the matter is that this parliament, by whatever means—and on this occasion it happens to be the Australian Democrats—has seen that there is a need for a very outdated tax system to be revised; and that is precisely what has been done. But no, we
 have an irrelevant opposition who have no policies—and I am not just talking about policies on taxation; I am talking about policies right across the board—and who simply are opposing everything for the sake of opposing. I cannot understand that. With every single solitary Senate inquiry that is undertaken there is a minority report. With every single solitary reference inquiry there is a report from the opposition. There is not one thing that we can find of substance that they will agree with, and with this tax system it is exactly the same.</para><para>It is almost understandable why the Labor Party is disagreeing with the pay as you go element of the tax system as well because there are so few people on that side of the chamber who have ever had to run a business, who have ever had to pay the bills at the end of the day, who have ever had to pay the salaries before they pay themselves, and who have ever had to pay for workers compensation and all of those things before they draw money from that business themselves, let alone comply with a very complex business tax system. Most of us on this side have had to endure that and therefore understand the complexities that have been in place for so long. That is why, taking just one issue, the pay as it goes system to be instituted under the new tax system is desirable.</para><para>As Senator Murray said, if this whole system is so bad, why have even Labor state governments signed onto it? The states know that they have difficulty in raising revenue now and they also know that this new tax system is the only way for them to go. Everyone will recognise that the wholesale sales tax system has been an unfair burden right across the board. That has to be changed. We cannot just keep hold of that system forever. When I return to my comments this afternoon, I want to come to the issue of motor vehicles, because the Labor Party want to retain a much higher tax on motor vehicles instead of a lower indirect tax.

The bill amends the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to remove the deadline of 13 November 1999 for the receipt of applications for restart re-establishment grants under the Farm Family Restart Scheme, FFRS. In future, deadlines will be set by means of an instrument under section 52A of the act. The government has announced that the deadline for applications will be extended by seven months to 30 June 2000. It should be noted that this was in fact the position under the Labor government's original legislation back in 1992 before it was amended by the Howard government in 1997 as part of its Agriculture—Advancing Australia package.</para></talk.start><para>The FFRS is an important scheme as it provides income assistance to very low income farmers for up to 12 months and access to professional financial counselling advice when contemplating future prospects in the industry. It also provides for grants of up to $45,000 to low income farmers upon the sale of the farm when they decide to leave the agricultural sector.</para><para>The need for this extension of the deadline and therefore these amendments to the act has arisen because of a lower take-up rate than expected. When the scheme was announced in December 1997, then Minister Anderson was quite vocal about the scheme and how successful it would be. However, only 240 re-establishment grants have been paid since that time. Unfortunately, the eligibility require
 ments of the scheme mean that it is not accessible to many farmers who are in financial difficulties. Farmers' organisations have stated that the assets test for the scheme is too restrictive and is therefore a disincentive to prospective applicants.</para><para>It is also unfortunate that the government has been too slow in conducting a review of the scheme. We understand that the appointment of a consultant to undertake that review is only now occurring even though the commitment to a review was made in 1998. Given the low take-up which was evident some time ago, the review should have been initiated much earlier. Whilst we have to be critical of the government on these issues, I have mentioned we do not oppose the bill because it will extend the time of the scheme's operation and therefore may assist some farmers who could access the scheme over the next seven months. Also, as I have stated earlier, the amendments reintroduce those parts of Labor's original legislation which provide for the operation of the scheme to be administered under section 52A of the act. As I said earlier, the opposition does not oppose this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>11590</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Bishop for his remarks. The <inline ref="r942">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 1999</inline>  does extend the deadline for applications to allow the support for farming families to continue. The re-establishment grant under this legislation is worth up to $45,000 to farmers who decide to sell their farm and can do so within 12 months of applying for support. Farmers are able to hold assets up to $90,000 and still receive the maximum grant and, as well, I point out that the Commonwealth also provides up to $3,000 for farmers to obtain professional advice on their farm business. If the decision to leave the farm is made, this support can also cover advice on the options for off-farm employment. The cost of extending the deadlines for applications is estimated to be $5.1 million. The government does recognise that it is always a difficult decision to leave the land and professional advice helps farmers identify the best course for them and their families.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Bishop pointed out the number of farmers who have actually taken this grant up, and I would point out that some 283 farmers to the end of October have benefited from re-establishment grants. But it is also important to point out that another 1,000 farmers have used the income support payments available during the program to assist them through a difficult period. So it is not only those farmers who decide to leave the land; it is those farmers who use those income support payments while they decide what they are going to do.</para><para>Farmers are not required to sell their property to receive this payment, and farmers who have received the income support payments are able to apply for the re-establishment grant before their 12-month period expires. So I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11591</page.no><id.no>r847</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>11591</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>11591</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to outline the comments of the opposition in respect of the <inline ref="r847">Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999</inline> . The bill was introduced into the last parliament, lapsed because of the 1998 election and has been reintroduced substantially in the same form as was the case prior to the 1998 election. The bill was referred to the appropriate Senate legislation committee for examination and public hearing. The Senate committee report contains a majority government report and minority reports by both opposition and Australian Democrats senators. As indicated in the House on Tuesday this week, the government wishes to ensure passage of this bill in a relatively speedy fashion and accordingly gave relatively short notice to the opposition.</para></talk.start><para>In the House, amendments were circulated by both the government and the opposition, and I am advised that all amendments were
 agreed and passed without opposition. Accordingly, the bill before the Senate at the moment is one agreed between the opposition and the government and, subject to a few brief remarks, the opposition will not oppose passage of this bill.</para><para>When the bill was introduced into the House it dealt with three discrete areas of policy: firstly, anti-hoarding provisions; secondly, broadcasting by pay TV into regional free-to-air areas; and, thirdly, retransmission by pay TV or subscription TV of free-toair channel broadcasts. The issue in the retransmission debate goes to the underlying rights of copyright holders and what regime, if any, should be put in place to allow payment of appropriate consideration to those copyright holders.</para><para>Currently, the effect of the Broadcasting Services Act and a Federal Court decision is that such retransmission occurs as of right without payment of fee. The debate around this issue concerns whether the market should determine a price and, in the absence of market determination, whether commercial resolution by arbitration is appropriate and, if so, which tribunal should be vested with that authority. Government amendments in the House had the effect of deleting the retransmission provision from the bill. It is my understanding that the House will revisit these issues in the  Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 1999 , which was the subject of a report tabled by the appropriate House committee on Monday this week. Accordingly, that debate can be put off until next year when it can be considered in a broader context.</para><para>Turning now to the anti-hoarding provisions of the bill, these support the current anti-syphoning provisions in the act introduced by the previous Labor government some years ago. The anti-syphoning provisions are simple: they ensure that classic sports events continue to be shown on free-to-air TV and are not sent to or remain in the domain of pay TV. The anti-hoarding provisions in this bill complement the current act by ensuring that a commercial free-to-air operator who has the rights to broadcast live a particular sporting event—and those events are listed under the
 anti-syphoning regime—cannot hoard those rights. This means that you cannot obtain the rights and refuse to transmit a particular event without encountering the provisions of the anti-hoarding regime in this bill.</para><para>If a broadcaster has those rights, the broadcaster is obliged to show the events live. If the broadcaster chooses not to show the events live, the anti-hoarding provisions in the bill come into play. The effect of the anti-hoarding provision in the bill is that, if a commercial TV free-to-air operator has the live to air rights for a particular sporting event or series of events which are in the list of events contained in the anti-syphoning regime and the operator proposes not to show that event live, the free-to-air broadcaster is required to offer that event to the national broadcasters for a nominal fee of $1. If either the ABC or SBS fail to accept the offer, then by default the operator has the right to allow the event to be broadcast by the pay TV industry.</para><para>Amendments circulated by the opposition in the House reflected a minority report of opposition senators that there should be timely consideration of this process. I am advised that the government accepted those amendments in the House and they are now part of the bill under consideration at the moment. The effect of those amendments is that, at least 30 days prior to the commencement of an event or series of events covered by the anti-syphoning and anti-hoarding provisions, a free-to-air commercial broadcaster must make a decision as to whether it proposes to broadcast the event or events live. If the answer is in the negative, then not less than 30 days prior to the event or events it must make the offer to a national broadcaster and the national broadcaster has seven days within which to make a decision as to whether they will transmit the event live. That time mechanism will allow the pay TV industry or the relevant subscription TV provider the opportunity to publicise its intention to broadcast a particular event live. Again, I understand the government had no difficulty with those amendments and accepted the relevant amendments in the House.</para><para>The second area of the bill I wish to discuss is the provision to ensure that regional free-toair markets are not disturbed by retransmission by a subscription TV operator of a metropolitan broadcaster. A pay TV provider or a member of the subscription TV industry may well seek to broadcast, by way of retransmission, free-to-air channels from a metropolitan area into a regional market. The bill proposes restrictions to be placed on that retransmission so as to ensure a metropolitan free-to-air channel rebroadcast or retransmission by a pay TV channel does not disturb the sanctity of the regional television market. The issue is of concern for the fairly obvious reason of capital investment in regional markets and the ability of those regional TV markets to attract adequate advertising revenue to fund their operating costs.</para><para>It also has implications for a range of issues more properly discussed under the heading of regional policy. As we said in the House, the opposition support the notion of the protection of a regional free-to-air TV market in the face of the retransmission of a metropolitan TV market via a subscription TV provider.</para><para>In the House, the government circulated amendments relating to the anti-syphoning provisions of the act. Those amendments were required to address the issue of different time zones across Australia. Put simply, 2 p.m. here is 11 a.m. in Western Australia. This has implications for the broadcasting of live TV events. The government circulated amendments which had the effect of compartmentalising a western and southern time zone which consists of Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Broken Hill.</para><para>A cricket example is appropriate to explain the problems faced by TV broadcasters of live sporting events. A game commences in Sydney at 2 p.m. and finishes at 10 p.m. In Western Australia, the same game commences at 11 a.m. and concludes at 7 p.m. The issue for broadcasters is whether you have real-time live telecasts or delayed time live telecasts. As was said in the House, there are respectable arguments for both options, and consumers and broadcasters alike have different views on this issue. Some people will listen to the football or cricket live on the radio and
 enjoy it and know the results in real time. Others are content to wait and watch the football or cricket in a delayed time broadcast. People in Western Australia and South Australia have had these options for many years and preference for either option is essentially a subjective matter.</para><para>Government amendments, which were accepted by the opposition in the House, effectively confirm current practice that if there is a cricket match commencing in Sydney at 2 p.m. and concluding at 10 p.m. Sydney time then it is shown in Western Australia commencing at 2 p.m. Western Australian time and concluding at 10 p.m. Western Australian time. It is shown as if it were live but with a three-hour time difference, including daylight saving time.</para><para>The situation is somewhat similar in the winter season depending on where an AFL game may be played. If the West Coast Eagles are playing in Melbourne on a Friday night there will be a delayed broadcast to enable fans to get home and watch the game some hours after the actual event. On Saturdays and Sundays when the Eagles or Dockers play away from Perth, there tends to be a real-time broadcast of the actual match.</para><para>The opposition expresses no objections to the course proposed by the government. It seems to suit the programming interests of the free-to-air television industry and also the interests of consumers. As I said earlier, the opposition commented in the House that this was a matter much influenced by subjective considerations and accordingly proposed to the government that a review process of this issue be conducted after two or three years. The government indicated that there is no necessity to confine the review to the western-southern time zone issues and accordingly the bill contains an agreed provision for a general review. The opposition indicates its support for this position.</para><para>In conclusion, I state that the opposition supports the bill as presented with the amendments agreed to in the House. We support the anti-hoarding regime as a complement to the anti-syphoning regime. We support the notion of the protection of a regional free-to-air TV market in the face of the retransmission of a
 metropolitan TV market via a subscription TV provider. We acknowledge the reasons for the effective withdrawal of the retransmission provisions in the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>11593</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Bishop for his contribution and honourable senators from all sides for their support for the provisions contained in the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill and commend the bill to the chamber.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11593</page.no><id.no>r969</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>11593</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>11593</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r969">Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999</inline>  was under discussion in the House on Tuesday evening of this week and was passed in that place in the form we have today in the chamber. When it was originally introduced into the House, it addressed three issues: schedule 1 addressed pay TV content requirements, schedule 2 addressed international obligations, and schedule 3 addressed international broadcasting services and appropriate licensing of same. In the House the opposition supported schedule 1, pay TV content requirements, and schedule 2, international obligations, subject to a second reading amendment, proposed by the shadow minister for the arts, relating to Labor's opposition to the Blue Sky decision and our intention to overturn it if possible whilst indicating that Labor was consenting to schedule 2 because of the priority of getting an Australian content principle in place. It is my understanding that that amendment was defeated in the House. We will move the same amendment in this chamber.</para></talk.start><para>Schedule 3, international broadcasting services, as  introduced into the House, raised serious issues of communication policy and foreign policy. In particular, some of the
 powers proposed to be vested in the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs raise serious issues as to the consequences of transmission of particular product out of Australia. The opposition was of the view that these issues needed mature consideration and not simply urgent passage in the last two or three days of the 1999 sitting period. The government took those comments on board and in the House withdrew schedule 3. The opposition will consider schedule 3 in a new bill in substantive terms in an orderly fashion when it is introduced again next year.</para><para>I will turn now to the two outstanding schedules. Looking at schedule 1, pay TV content requirements, the opposition makes six points. Firstly, the bill will amend the Broadcasting Services Act to make the existing Australian content requirement for pay TV enforceable on the same basis as for free-to-air television in respect of drama. At present, a voluntary system applies. The Australian Broadcasting Authority has reported that pay TV channel providers are failing to achieve the voluntary level of Australian new content. If the bill is passed, each pay TV drama service will be required to spend at least 10 per cent of its annual program expenditure on new eligible drama programs. The Australian based channel providers, as well as licensees, will be required to report annually to the ABA on their expenditure figures with sanctions for failing to provide compliance information.</para><para>Secondly, the scheme is proposed to be operating on a financial year basis, commencing 1 July 2000. Thirdly, the bill allows for a grace period of 12 months for licensees to arrange for a shortfall in expenditure by channel providers to be made up in the following year. Fourthly, the bill recognises the jurisdictional difficulties in obtaining expenditure information from overseas based channels by providing that the measure of program expenditure in respect of an overseas based—that is, pass-through—channel is the full payment by a licensee for the right to screen that channel in Australia.</para><para>Fifthly, the bill accords national treatment to New Zealand programs, consistent with the approach adopted in the Australian content
 standard for free-to-air commercial television. Sixthly, the pay TV industry supports the bill. More importantly, both the Screen Producers Association of Australia and the subscription TV organisation, ASTRA, have requested that Labor support rapid passage of the bill this year to allow implementation of the legislation as soon as possible. Accordingly, the opposition will support schedule 1, pay TV content requirements.</para><para>I turn now to schedule 2, international obligations. This schedule has the effect of dealing in a narrow way with the implications of the High Court decision in the Blue Sky case. The effect of the High Court decision in the Blue Sky case was to say that, as a consequence of an international agreement between Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand content had to be treated as Australian content for the purpose of the ABA local content rules.</para><para>Schedule 2 does the following: firstly, the bill will amend section 160(d) of the Broadcasting Services Act by limiting the international obligations to which the ABA must have regard in exercising its functions to the CER services protocol with New Zealand; secondly, this amendment will ensure that access to the ABA's local content quotas for commercial television by TV programs from other countries is  explicitly confined to New Zealand; and, thirdly, the amendment confines the impact of the High Court's Blue Sky decision to New Zealand, closing off the possibility of flow-ons to other treaties, and maintains the cultural policy objectives of content regulation.</para><para>Labor's position has been to reverse the effect of this decision upon returning to office. Since the Blue Sky decision, it has been the view of the opposition that the appropriate public policy view for Australia was to seek, consistent with international obligations and domestic law, to overturn the Blue Sky decision as far as New Zealand content is concerned.</para><para>The opposition's second reading amendment indicates that, while the opposition supports early passage of BSA Bill (No. 3), it will give enforceable statutory effect to the current voluntary requirement on levels of Australian
 content for subscription TV on drama orientated channels and established through the provisions in schedule 2 of the bill the principle of an Australian content standard. This is the opposition's commitment to the highest possible local content standards for both freeto-air and subscription television.</para><para>The opposition regard this as a matter of urgency. We restate our position that the subscription television industry and the Australian broadcast content industry should agree on similarly enforceable decisions for documentary channels. The provisions of the second reading amendment, which I will formally move later, reflect the strong attachment that the opposition have to the notion that Australian local content production for broadcasting matters is a very important part of our cultural character and cultural diversity.</para><para>In summary, I indicate our support for schedules 1 and 2 in the bill. I move the opposition's second reading amendment:</para><para>At the end of the motion, add "but, whilst supporting the early passage of the bill because it will give statutory effect to requirements for higher levels of Australian content in drama programs, the Senate:</para><para>(a)	 notes that even though the impact of the High Court's decision concerning Australian content in the "Blue Sky" case will be limited to the Australia New Zealand CER agreement, the implications of the decision remain of great concern and demand further action in the interests of the Australian industry; and</para><para>(b)	 calls on the Government to introduce measures to ensure higher levels of Australian content in other program areas, including documentary programs".</para><para>The amendment essentially addresses two issues: firstly, the implications arising from the Blue Sky case; and, secondly, higher levels of Australian content. The Blue Sky issue arose out of negotiations between Australia and New Zealand in the CER agreement. The records show that the discussions at that time focused on areas of material trade—fixed objects and the like, production and the goods—and what services would be excluded. At no time did either negotiating party agree to the proposition that cultural industries would or should be caught up in the CER arrangement. It was an entirely
 unintended consequence not raised in the negotiations, not agreed in the negotiations and not part of any subsequent diplomatic or parliamentary exchange.</para><para>Consequently, there is no reason not to go back to the New Zealand government and settle the issue which is central to both countries. Clearly, it is as much a matter of concern to those involved in the content production industries in New Zealand as it is to content production industries in Australia. The opposition maintains its position of attempting to fix that problem through the parliamentary process and government to government negotiations.</para><para>Why do we have Australian content rules? There are two reasons: firstly, there is an industry development argument; and, secondly, there is a cultural values argument. We have those rules to provide Australians with material which is written, produced, directed and acted by Australians. That material is seen through our TV channels every day of the week. Constant Australian production of TV and film material content allows Australian viewers to have access through TV—the dominant purveyor of culture in Australia—to Australian views, values and attitudes as they emerge and change over time. Australian content production and TV screening is a piece of instant history which reflects the growth, dynamics and change in our society.</para><para>There is nothing wrong, nothing good or nothing bad about New Zealand culture or the culture of the United States, the United Kingdom or any other country in the world. All of those cultures have value and are of interest. We have ready access to many elements of those cultures on a regular basis. But, in the final analysis, New Zealand culture is not the culture of this country. The two countries have not chosen to form one nation. They have not even chosen to federate. The CER is a free trade agreement in goods and services between Australia and New Zealand. It was freely entered into and ratified by the parliaments of both countries and is standing the test of time in terms of its purpose and intent. Interestingly, the CER does not extend to culture, and we should not allow a later decision of the High Court to
 override the intent of parliament without some form of mature consideration of that issue. If the government is content to allow the rationale of the Blue Sky decision to become de facto policy, let it say so. It is not the position of the opposition.</para><para>Paragraph 1 of the amendment simply urges the government to pursue negotiations with the New Zealand government to address this issue. Similarly, paragraph 2 calls on the government to introduce measures to ensure that there are higher levels of Australian content in other program areas, including the documentary program area. In the House, Mr Kerr made the following points. In the years 1995-96 and 1996-97, expenditure on local Australian drama was 7.1 per cent, being 5.2 per cent of total expenditure. The voluntary agreement of 10 per cent simply was not achieved. This legislation now makes the 10 per cent mandatory. This is better, and the opposition supports it on the basis that it is an improvement on the current regime.</para><para>However, the opposition believes that there is still considerable scope for improvement in the future. The opposition urges the extension of the 10 per cent content rule from drama to documentary production, particularly for documentary orientated subscription TV channels. This is an area in which, over time, Australia has developed strengths and a form of comparative advantage. The extension of the 10 per cent local content rule to the production of documentaries would result in ongoing development of local content in the production industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>11596</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators, including Senator Bishop, for their contributions. The <inline ref="r969">Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999</inline>  seeks to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to make the Australian content licence conditions for subscription television broadcasting licensees enforceable; to limit the scope of international agreements that apply to the functions of the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the ABA; and to establish a new broadcasting licence regime
 for international broadcasting services transmitted from Australia.</para></talk.start><para>There has been a little bit of scurrying around the chamber because this is a debate on a non-controversial bill and we were not anticipating this amendment that the Labor Party are moving, although it was moved in the lower house. It just would have helped a little if we had known about it. Also, the Democrats have been caught on the hop, and I do not know what they are going to do. With a non-controversial bill, if we do have an amendment, we usually know whether or not it will be agreed to.</para><para>The government, in response to the amendment, does not resile from its commitment to CER. Amending section 160D clearly confines the impact of the High Court's decision to New Zealand. The government is aware of the production industry's concerns and will be closely monitoring the impact of the decision. Amendment of 160D recognises Australia's special relationship with New Zealand, striking an appropriate balance between our cultural and trade policy objectives. The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 was introduced by the previous Labor government, and the then communications minister, Senator Bob Collins, wrote to the ABA in December 1992 asking that the ABA move quickly to amend its local content standard to include New Zealand programs.</para><para>With regard to documentaries, the minister has indicated that he will be asking the ABA, as a matter of priority, to consider the need to extend the requirement to documentary channels and report back to him within 12 months. This is consistent with the recent report by the Australian Film Commission and the Film Finance Corporation on the state of the film industry. That report recommended that the issue of extending the pay TV requirement to documentary channels be reviewed next year. The government acknowledged the importance of the documentary sector during the ministerial review in 1997, and the government's announcement of a formal review of the requirement was intended to provide an opportunity to consider extending the requirement to documentary channels when the industry had developed. I
 indicate that the government will not be supporting the amendment.

We will not be opposing these bills because, as Simon Crean said when this package was finally announced by the government back in September 1997, `The government has finally accepted Labor's plan.'</para></talk.start><para>You might recall that Labor campaigned for this series of measures over the strenuous resistance of the government. Although we will not be opposing these bills, it should not be thought that Labor do not have some serious reservations about them; we do, and
 I will detail them later. What we have decided, however, is that this is a package which is necessary and for which the TCF industry has had to wait far too long. It is time for the parliament to pass this legislation and give the industry some certainty so that it can get on with business and continue to generate more jobs.</para><para>As I noted before, the legislation before us is to implement the package of measures the government announced in September 1997 in response to the Industry Commission's report into the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. This package included a freeze on tariffs at their 1 July 2000 level until 1 January 2005, at which time tariffs will be generally reduced to five per cent.</para><para>There was also an investment program to encourage TCF companies to become more internationally competitive and to better exploit Australia's natural advantage in raw materials, such as wool and cotton. The government also committed itself to conducting a review of these policy arrangements in 2005 to take account of Australia's APEC commitments and progress on market access.</para><para>It is important to note, however, that there is no provision for this review to take place before the legislated tariff reductions take effect. This is a bizarre bit of policy. We are to have a review, but before the review we will determine the outcome. This seems to be an increasing habit of the government. The government adopted exactly the same process in relation to the automotive package which the Senate dealt with some time ago. We made the same criticism. We sought to amend the bills to ensure a review before the tariff was reduced. But, unfortunately, the government opposed us.</para><para>In our view, it is overwhelmingly logical to have the review before the final tariff decision is made. The reason is that there remain significant questions about market access developments, particularly in our region and with regard to APEC. It is unequivocally in our interests for APEC member economies to meet their commitments with regard to trade liberalisation and market access. The review will help determine whether the environment
 has sufficiently progressed for Australia's TCF industry to respond appropriately.</para><para>I might be wrong here, but the government says that is what the review is about. The review is to look at progress on market access. If that is not related to whether we are going to cut our tariffs, why was it part of the package? The review should occur before the final tariff decision is made. That it does not, is a fundamental flaw in this bill. At least everyone in the TCF industry—the small business, and the workers—now know that the only way they will get a review of the TCF sector, including of market access in our region, before tariffs are further cut, is to support a Labor government at the next election.</para><para>The second element of the bills which we have serious reservations about is their form. The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Bill operates by requiring the minister to formulate a TCF strategic investment scheme. This is a scheme for the making of grants in connection with the design for manufacturing and for the manufacturing in Australia of eligible TCF products. This scheme is a disallowable instrument.</para><para>I believe that this proposition is extraordinary. The scheme will not be set up by legislation. Rather, the legislation will give the minister the power to establish the scheme, subject only to legislated limitations in respect of the size of the funding envelope, the types of the grants and other minor matters. The remainder—such as the size of the envelope for each type of grant, the amount of individual grants, the criteria for receiving grants—is left to the minister's discretion.</para><para>In addition, should there be problems in formulating the scheme, parliament will not be able to amend or finetune it because it will be in the form of a disallowable instrument. As a disallowable instrument, the parliament will have to either accept it completely or reject it completely. Given that the terms of the scheme are fundamental to the $700 million flowing to the industry, it is going to be almost impossible for the parliament to reject the scheme. It would have to be very seriously flawed for a reaction of that sort to
 be appropriate. It would need a very fundamental flaw. We certainly hope that nothing like that emerges.</para><para>Rather, the key issue is: how do we get effective parliamentary scrutiny of a major program worth $700 million over five years? The parliament is being denied the capacity to scrutinise effectively the nature of the scheme because all this legislation does is authorise the minister to establish the scheme. The nature of the scheme will be determined by the minister and emerge as a disallowable instrument. It is so far removed from the normal course of legislation that would introduce a scheme like this that it is virtually impossible to amend this bill because this is only a bill that authorises a scheme. We do not believe this form of legislation is appropriate, and we hope it will not be a precedent for other legislation.</para><para>The final point I would like to make in relation to these bills concerns the timing of their passage through the parliament. I must say that it is extraordinary that the minister finds himself in a position now of trying to rush this legislation through the Senate just before Christmas. I want to remind everyone that this package was first announced back in September 1997, that there was a final commitment and agreement with the industry in July 1998, that the legislation was then introduced into the House in March 1999 and dealt with then. It has been sitting in the Senate ever since—for nine months.</para><para>Against this background, the minister then comes along and says at the final gasp that he needs this legislation passed before Christmas and asks us to facilitate this. We will—but not to excuse the minister's appalling management of this legislation; not to get him off the hook. We want everyone to know what a dud he is. We will facilitate this because the industry tells us that it needs certainty now. It tells us how frustrated it has been with the inaction and stumbling by this minister. We will not contribute to this frustration; we will move on. But there should be no doubt—and the industry knows this only too well by now—as to who is responsible for this long drawn out saga.</para><para>We will not oppose these bills because we want to let the industry get on with it. Moreover, we see this as an important opportunity for industry policy to move on, for trade policy to move on, for us to look at new possibilities and for us to look at issues where public policy can contribute to the industry viability and success in the next century.</para><para>Issues of public sector research and the related issues of private sector research and development, innovation, venture capital, design, enterprise improvement, education and training, infrastructure—including legal infrastructure—export assistance and investment attraction are all matters to which the public policy debate around industry needs to turn. Once we get a satisfactory conclusion to the debate around these bills and we get development of the schemes which these bills authorise, the debate can move to those matters, including the application of those issues to the TCF industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>11599</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not wish to take up much of the chamber's time in relation to the bills, given that the Democrats agree that they are non-controversial, but I do want to make a number of comments. We are supportive of the provision of assistance to the textile, clothing and footwear industries in the context of tariff reductions and in accordance with our WTO commitments. We understand the reason for the government freezing tariff reductions until 2005. We also understand that this package is intended to improve the competitiveness of those industries in the lead-up to the 2005 tariff reduction in precisely the same way as was intended by the motor vehicle industry assistance program which the chamber dealt with only a month ago.</para></talk.start><para>The issue I wish to raise is one of practice rather than one that goes to the substantive merits of the scheme. The bill is framed in such a way as to simply authorise the relevant minister to develop an industry assistance program and implement that program as a regulation. Clearly, that process involves far less parliamentary and, arguably, public scrutiny than if the scheme is in fact embodied in principal rather than subordinate legislation. When the principles of the scheme
 come before this chamber, we will have the choice of disallowing them or not disallowing them. So we either take it or leave it. The Senate will not be able to play an active role by amending the scheme and we may be forced to accept something which is less than optimal for the sake of ensuring that something is in fact put in place. Nevertheless, it is my understanding that, whilst this practice of legislating has precedence in this place, it is not usual and, for my part, I would have thought that it is a practice which is to be strongly discouraged.</para><para>The Australian Democrats are nevertheless supportive of the bill. But we would like to make clear to the government that this form of legislation is substandard and our support on this occasion should not be taken as an indication that we would support future legislation which takes the same form. I think that the Senate has to guard against allowing its role or indeed the role of the parliament as a whole being usurped by legislation which delegates substantial policy decisions to ministers through bills like this one. I have consulted with the council on textile, clothing and footwear and they of course have expressed a degree of anxiousness at ensuring that this bill is passed today.</para><para>As an administrative issue, I would like to ask the minister or perhaps the duty minister whether it is likely that the bill will get back to the House of Representatives today for concurrence with the Senate amendments. The only other comment that I would make is to thank Senator Minchin and his office for the cooperative approach they have taken in managing this piece of legislation. Again, the Australian Democrats say that the bill is non-controversial and, following discussion with the Textile Fashion Industry of Australia, we will be supporting the bill and we will be looking quite closely at the SIP scheme for its adequacy in conjunction with TFIA.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>11599</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r719">Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Bill 1999</inline>  is an important bill, and I thank the honourable senators for their contribution.

The supplementary explanatory memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 8 December 1999. The changes provide for an ability for loans to be made under the scheme if required, that the scheme be formulated within 14 days of royal assent, and that there be a limitation on grants to be made in respect of design activities in Australia for manufacture offshore. The amendments also relate to access to special grants for eligible activities in respect of the year 1999-2000 pre-program year, the exclusion of special miscellaneous grants from the total cap for grants in respect of TCF value adding, and the capping of total grants payable in accordance with the World Trade Organisation Subsidies Agreement, including special provisions for firms in start-up situations.</para></talk.start><para>The amendments also relate to the making of financial compliance requirements under the scheme in line with Australian Corporations Law. They provide for interim payments in arrears as a part payment of a grant. They deal with administrative powers under the scheme to be vested with the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. They are also associated with enabling the scheme to require participation of particular benchmarking management improvement study as a condition of grant eligibility. That means the scheme may require participation of par
 ticular benchmarking management improvement study as a condition of grant eligibility. I commend the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Senate and the amendments.

As we are preparing for the festive season, I think we can all take a little bit of time at this question time to reflect on what is happening in the economy and how it will impact on Australian families. Today many Australians received an
 early Christmas present in that the unemployment rate has fallen quite dramatically. I am very pleased to announce to the Senate chamber that the unemployment rate for November is 6.7 per cent. This is the lowest rate for almost a decade. Let me remind Labor senators that this is a very significant fall from the 8.5 per cent unemployment rate that we inherited when we came into office. Indeed, the level of unemployment rose to a record level of 11.2 per cent when Mr Beazley was a very senior member of the Labor ministry.</para><para>I think that if you were to ask many Australians what a government could really do to assist them, not only at Christmas but in the years ahead, they would say, `Get the economy right.' We have had another confirmation of that today with the very sharp fall in the unemployment rate. Over half a million jobs have been created under the coalition government and this has happened in conjunction with an increase in real wages. It is to the eternal shame of the Labor Party that in quite a number of years real wages actually fell during the 13 years of the Labor government. I think the overall average rise was minuscule.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable senators interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

The new business tax system will be very positive for Australian business and of course very positive for all the Australian community, and that includes those millions of shareholding Australians for whom it will provide a substantial reduction in the capital gains tax rate and a lower tax rate for small business. In the year 2000 Australians will be receiving a very early Christmas present when on 1 July we deliver the largest income tax cuts in Australian history—some $12 billion of tax cuts which will translate into benefits for the average family. Many will benefit in the order of $40 to $50 per week.

 been suggested that the death toll could be somewhere between 500 and 1,000 people. The numbers that might have been dispossessed could be anything up to about 50,000.

I refer in particular to the sum of $1 million that we contributed towards food, clothing and medical supplies. We are also indirectly supporting humanitarian efforts in Ambon through our support of the International Red Cross and the other international agencies that are trying to assist people in Ambon in these difficult circumstances.</para><para>I suppose if we were looking for some hope, the best sign of it is the recent reports that President Wahid is about to visit Ambon in an effort to promote peace between the warring Christians and Muslims. He reportedly has said that it is time for a new attempt to be launched to broker peace. I think we can draw from that that not only are the circumstances being recognised by the leadership within Indonesia—again, notwithstanding the fact that they are focused on so many difficult issues at this time—but also they are prepared to take actions to try to bring about a cessation of the violence and a stabilisation in the hope that people can in fact return to their homes and live peacefully and safely.

 Indonesian authorities to take appropriate action and we continue our support through humanitarian efforts.

They might want to take note of the new unemployment figure: 6.7 per cent. That is the best figure we have had since June 1990, and part of that is an increase in youth employment. Why? Because of our training programs. We are training young Australians, which is meeting the demand for skills—unlike when we came to power, when there was a shortage of skills. We have been addressing that. We have spent $1.6 billion on VET funding in the last financial year.

There are now almost 300,000 more women employed than there were in March 1996 when we came into government. Just think about that: there are more than 300,000 more Australian women employed under the coalition and its policies. The participation rate for working age women reached a record high of 65.8 per cent in September this year.</para></talk.start><para>Today's figures show that the female unemployment rate reached another nine-year low of 6.6 per cent. Under Labor, female unemployment in May 1983 was 10.7 per cent. As Senator Ferris mentioned, just yesterday the government won passage of its equal opportunity for women in the workplace amendments. The new legislation implements our commitment to streamlining paperwork and enabling employers to focus on results for women rather than process, as we had under Labor.</para><para>The government supports the choice of women with young children to participate in work and education by allocating $5.3 billion for child care over the next four years. A low income family with two children in full-time care may receive almost $12,500 in subsidies from the taxpayer for child care. From July 2000, as part of tax reform the new child-care benefit will deliver increased assistance to families and a much simpler system. The $24 million return to work initiative will help parents or carers returning to the work force after taking time out. For the first time couples, upon marriage breakdown, will be able to split their superannuation to best meet the current and the future needs of both parties. That will help to protect the retirement living standards of older women, which were utterly ignored by the previous government.</para><para>The government has committed a total of $50 million to help prevent domestic violence. In the area of domestic violence we are
 focusing on preventing the harm done to children by being the witnesses of domestic violence, on the need for perpetrators to take responsibility to end their violence and, very importantly, on strengthening the grassroots and practical efforts to address indigenous family violence. In 1993 OSW undertook a review chaired by Senator Crowley. It criticised the women's grants program as making a minimal contribution to government policy making.

Beyond a couple of selective quotes from Senator Kemp, with the usual process the government adopts in these things—the lack of transparency, the unwillingness to undergo any level of parliamentary scrutiny—Senator Kemp, when offered the opportunity to table the transcript of the interview that he is so dependent on and on which he bases a very unfair and in fact a contemptible personal attack on Senator Evans, will not front up and table the transcript of the interview. The reason he will not table the transcript of the interview in this instance is that the whole transcript demonstrates the fact that Mr Daley, obviously as a favour to the radio station, has come on board—as no doubt a person who tends to be pretty cooperative would—and agreed to be interviewed by Ms Van Extel on ABC morning radio.</para><para>I would urge that all honourable senators and any interested member of the public to try to acquire the transcript that Senator Kemp is not willing to table. We have a situation where Mr Daley, as a favour, went on the
 radio but could he answer any questions when it came to the detail of the GST and its application to charities. Of course he could not, not because he was unwilling to do so. I do not think he wanted to be unhelpful to Ms Van Extel or her listeners. He simply did not know. He went on board only as a favour to all concerned. Ms Van Extel was virtually forced to terminate the interview. I listened to this interview and was a little embarrassed both for interviewer and for interviewee.</para><para>Why would a government minister come into the chamber in question time and selectively quote a transcript? And why, in that circumstance, would you have a government minister, having selectively quoted a transcript and defended the government's position on the basis of the transcript of that interview, refuse to table the whole transcript? Why? Because the government minister was very embarrassed with what was contained in the full transcript. That is typical of the show that we have from the government in question time.</para><para>We have the humiliation of Senator Newman simply unable to answer any question in terms of her portfolio responsibilities. She does not now even take a question on notice. She tries to duckshove it to another minister.</para><para>Some time ago, I made a prediction in relation to Senator Vanstone being sacked from cabinet. I do not make many predictions in the chamber, but I was right about that. I now make my second prediction, that is, that Senator Newman will go, whether she will be demoted or whether she will see that really it is all too hard. I am sure either she will be demoted or sacked from cabinet, or she will just resign her ministerial responsibility. Time is up for Senator Newman; time is up for Senator Kemp.</para><para>What a humiliating performance from the government to end question time in these sittings of the parliament. All Australians, particularly those who depend on charity, have good reason to be concerned about what we have heard in this place today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>11619</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Vic</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The people of Australia first heard the concept of a goods and services tax more than 10 years ago from someone whom the Labor
 Party no longer mentions in public. They no longer remember him except in the context of Indonesia or a livestock industry. However, he was rolled by his own colleagues who could not understand the importance of an up-to-date taxation system for Australia.</para></talk.start><para>In 1993, the Liberal Party took up this task and introduced a new system of taxation to the Australian electors. But because of the way politics work, the persons who used to support taxation reform turned around and caused enough damage so that the idea was lost in 1993. However, in 1998, the Liberal-National Party coalition, with courage which is unusual in politics—certainly on the other side of politics—brought the matter back in front of the Australian people and, having thought about this matter over six years, the people of Australia gave the coalition parties the mandate in the 1998 election to bring in a new taxation system for Australia.</para><para>After the election, the legislation was passed by the Senate after considerable debate and with the support of the Australian Democrats who, although they are not in the habit of recognising majority mandates, on this occasion recognised the benefit of a new taxation system to Australia and had the legislation passed.</para><para>This occurred last June. Why is it that, after nearly six months, the GST is back on the agenda again as far as the opposition is concerned? For the last two weeks at question time we have heard nothing from Labor Party senators except on GST and on the very minor point of GST and charity. This is a very strange occurrence; most people would not understand it. Perhaps the reason is not all that strange. I refer senators to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on Wednesday with the heading `Surfer Beazley on wave of optimism'. The opening statement says:</para><para>The Opposition Leader, Mr Beazley, yesterday painted a picture of Labor riding to office on a policy surfboard creating the GST wave.</para><para>That explains why suddenly, instead of, as an opposition party should, presenting alternative policies to what the government has come up with, the Labor Party are simply just nitpicking on minor points, particularly on points which cause concerns for the most vulnerable
 in our communities, the people who provide charity to the less fortunate. Instead of presenting a viable alternative to Australia, all they want to do is simply create enough wave to enable them to surf through the next election. This is not going to work, of course, because they are going to get dumped by the wave.</para><para>The reality is, looking at opposition senators over the last two weeks during question time, that they were clearly embarrassed by this approach. They are clearly confused by this situation. The Australian public is getting used to the sight of the opposition leader standing in front of the public, with his considerable bulk, oozing with all the sincerity that he can summons. Opposition senators are not as good at this. We can see they are embarrassed by this because they are trying to create a wave, as it were, in a policy vacuum. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>11620</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also wish to speak to the motion that the Senate take note of the answers given in question time today because I think this is a very important issue.

But I challenged him yesterday to table the document he was quoting from. He refused to do that because he was selectively quoting from an interview with a Salvation Army officer on the local ABC radio news station. Like many senators, I heard the interview that morning with that gentleman. As Senator Faulkner quite correctly pointed out, Mr Daley indicated that he had gone on the show to help out the producer of the show and that, while he himself was not directly involved in discussions about the GST, he was happy to represent the Salvation Army position.</para><para>What transpired during that interview was that that gentleman said the Salvation Army were happy to tick off on the government's propositions, as Senator Kemp I think correctly quoted. But he did not then go on and explain that Mr Daley was unable to answer any questions about the detail, any questions about how the GST might impact on the Salvation Army's operations, or that he was really quite flustered when asked to respond to specific issues—the sorts of issues that we have been raising in the parliament this week, the sorts of issues that the charities raised with the Senate community affairs committee when we inquired into the GST, the sorts of issues that go to the charities' capacity to deliver services to the hungry, to the needy, to the poor in our community. He was not able to assist in answering how they would be impacted upon by the government's proposed changes.</para><para>Quite frankly, it was not surprising, because no-one can. The Assistant Treasurer in this place cannot help, the Treasurer cannot help, and we understand that the Democrats and the government are still locked in negotiations trying to do some deal at the last minute to respond to the growing public pressure and the real concern that the ability of the charities and the not-for-profit sector to service the poor, the hungry and the needy in our society will be severely reduced by having the GST imposed on them.</para><para>What I do want to do is put on the record what the Salvation Army have said about the GST.

I am happy to table the document so we get a full reporting of the Salvation Army's position and so that it is not misused for political purposes by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp.</para><para>What is clear is that, like most charities in Australia, the Salvation Army are not at all happy about having the GST imposed upon them. More importantly, they know that it will reduce their ability to provide services to the poor and needy in our community. That is the key issue. Including them in the GST net, the compliance costs and other costs associated mean they will deliver less services. That is the public policy issue we ought to be dealing with. That is what the government has to answer. Services to the poor, the needy and the hungry in our community will be reduced as a result of including charities in the GST net. There is no defence against that accusation because that is a fact. They will deliver less services as a result of having to comply with the GST. All of them are reluctant to be caught in that net.

This whole interview is complimentary to the goods and services tax, the way it is going to be implemented and the fine tunning, and has never been disguised or hidden in any way, shape or form. In fact, there is going to be a consultative group within the ATO, comprised of representatives from the charitable sector, to assist with any GST concerns relating to administration or compliance. The Labor opposition does not want to recognise that. They continually and habitually ignore it.

 he said they were quite pleased with the negotiations that had started. He said:</para></talk.start></continue><para>It's like this.

She attempts to play the man, not the ball. Senator Evans simply asked for a document to be tabled that would lay the truth on the table. Until now the government has refused to table that document. Now it is there and we will examine it in due course. The core point in the entire debate as it affects the relevant organisation has been put out already. What do the Salvation Army say in respect of the GST? On 7 December, AAP reports them as saying:</para></talk.start><para>It made it clear, however—</para><para>that is, the Salvation Army—</para><para>it was not happy at being caught up in the tax net.

The Salvation Army did not want to be in it. They signed up and they now regret it. The document that Senator Knowles has tabled will in due course confirm that very clear point.</para><para>During the entire GST debate the opposition made a number of comments concerning the Howard-Lees GST and its effect on charities. We said and still say it was an inequitable, inefficient new tax which is bad for the economy. We said it would unfairly impact on low income earners, single income families, welfare recipients and pension recipients. We said it would impact on the entire community from birth right through until death. We repeatedly asserted—and there was mountains of evidence—administrative inconvenience, a host of anomalies and huge compliance problems for small business.</para><para>The government and the Australian Democrats tried to avoid criticism of their joint GST package by saying charities and charitable services were to be excluded from the GST, and that charities and welfare organisations, which provide much needed services to the Australian community, were to be exempt from the vicious 10 per cent tax. We now know, as we have demonstrated all this week, that that proposition is patently untrue. The charities and the charitable sector were told by the government that they would be looked after and that they would be exempt from the GST—that has proved to be incorrect. It is now exposed for what it always was—simple deceit.</para><para>To make matters worse, all this week the government has sought to cover up its own deceit by denying reality. On Tuesday, for example, the Prime Minister denied the whole impact of the Howard-Lees GST on charities. He denied how it was going to work in practice. Mr Howard made three grievous errors. Those errors do not go to issues of technical detail, but issues of substantive
 policy. Mr Howard denied, firstly, the application of the GST to the commercial operations of charities; secondly, that business sponsorships on charities would not attract the GST; and, thirdly, he claimed that if the activity of a charity was under a certain level it would not be caught up in the GST net. On each of these three counts Mr Howard was wrong in his understanding of the application of the GST to charities.</para><para>What are the facts? The facts are as was put out in a press release under the name of the Hon. Simon Crean, MP, on 7 December. He said, in response to the Prime Minister's claims:</para><para>First: `In relation, Mr Speaker, to any commercial activities, then so far as the charity is concerned, there is no application [of the GST]'</para><para>That is wrong. The Treasurer boasted yesterday about how the GST was going to apply to all commercial activities of charities.</para><para>Second: The Prime Minister suggested that business sponsorship of charities would not attract the GST.</para><para>Wrong. They will attract the GST.</para><para>Third: In a further . . . error, he claimed, `. . . if the activity is under a certain level, then they are not caught in the GST net.'</para><para>Wrong again. All of the inputs of these charities, such as their rent, electricity, telephone, transport and accounting, attract the GST, and they will not be able to claim it back.

</para><para>This last year has been one of major challenges and change, particularly in the Asia Pacific region. Australia has been at the forefront of responding to those challenges. We have promoted our national interests, in a way which has strengthened our standing in the region and the world. It has also been a year of great achievements, with the aid program playing a practical and positive role in Australia's contribution to the stability and development of our region.</para><para>Australian support, including through the aid program, has helped our neighbours emerge from the economic crisis and set out on the path to recovery and sustainable growth.</para><para>We have helped Indonesia begin its transition to democracy, with substantial assistance for that country's first democratic elections in four decades.</para><para>Australia has been instrumental in the East Timorese being able to choose their own future—and is now playing a strong part in helping them realise that future.</para><para>Papua New Guinea—our largest aid partner—has a new Government, which is committed to economic reform. Australia is providing solid backing to its reform efforts. Our aid program in Bougainville continues to underpin the peace process on the province.</para><para>We have continued to help the island nations of the South Pacific pursue their economic and social reform agendas.</para><para>Australia responded quickly and effectively to help the Solomon Islands government deal with the impact of the Guadalcanal/Malaita tensions, including through emergency humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance.</para><para>The Government has ensured that the aid program is well-placed to play its part.</para><para>We have provided additional funds to the program for East Timor. In September, the Treasurer and I announced an additional contribution of $35 million over three years to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, to help lower the debt burden of the world's poorest nations. We have assisted East Timorese and Kosovar evacuees in Australia. These commitments will increase official development assistance this financial year to over $1.6 billion. Thus at this stage, our ODA/GNP ratio looks set to increase from the previously estimated 0.25 per cent to 0.28 per cent.</para><para>These increases are substantial. But volume is not the only—or even the most important—measure of the Government's achievement in the development field. More important are the quality and impact of development. This has been a long-standing concern of mine. And the Government has lifted aid quality, as demonstrated by the recent review of Australia's aid program by the Development
 Assistance Committee of the OECD. This peer review by other donor countries concluded with a press release on 7 December in these terms:</para><para>"<inline font-style="italic">Australia's development cooperation programme has gone through an impressive process of restructuring and renewal since the last peer review in May 1996Continuing reforms and adaptations to aid policies and management have improved the quality and impact of the programme..A strengthened approach to programme planning, implementation, and evaluation are an integral part of (the) focus on quality. These reforms put Australia in the vanguard of DAC members' aid management practices".</inline></para><para>So it is a very positive report card on Australia's aid program from our peers.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Governance</inline></para><para>The different challenges over the last year have had their own individual natures and circumstances. But in reviewing the year, we see that a common thread is "governance".</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>Governance covers many powerful concepts, including good government, capacity building, transparency and accountability, human rights, and the equitable rule of law. It is about what makes a good society—where citizens and groups voice their interests, mediate their differences and exercise their rights, both in the private sector and in the public domain.</para><para>Societies in which decisions by Government can be questioned and contested are ones in which good decisions are more likely to be made. The process through which governments are forced to pause, consider alternatives, and then defend their decisions promotes better outcomes.</para><para>This Government has recognised the critical role of governance in achieving good development outcomes. In my 1997 annual report, <inline font-style="italic">Better Aid for a Better Future</inline> , I made governance a specific focus for the aid program. Since then, governance has grown to 15 per cent of aid expenditure, or over $220 million in 1998-99. The program targets four main areas to advance good governance: economic and financial management; law and justice; public sector management; and the development of civil society.</para><para>The importance of governance has been thrown into even sharper relief this year as we look more closely at some of the key developments, starting with the East Asia financial crisis.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The East Asia crisis</inline></para><para>There are many explanations for the crisis. One explanation which is relevant to all the affected countries is governance—quality of prudential supervision of banks; transparency and accountability of economic decision making, and so on. Governance is also the key to the region's recovery
 and its sustainable future. For these reasons, Australia has sought to strengthen governance capacities within the region.</para><para>In last year's statement I referred to the major $50 million package of economic governance assistance for crisis-affected economies. Implementation of the initiative is well underway, with over $40 million of activities now completed or in progress.</para><para>To support APEC's response to the crisis, Australia commissioned a study on the impacts of the crisis on children and social safety nets. To address some of the issues highlighted in the study, the Prime Minister announced at the APEC leaders meeting in Auckland a three-year, $5 million <inline font-style="italic">Social Protection Facility for East Asia</inline> .</para><para>Governance was also a major theme of the major international meeting on aid responses to the Asia Crisis which I convened in Sydney in March this year. The meeting went a long way in shoring up greater international coordination and reinforcing political commitment to address the economic and social impacts of the crisis. Delegates emphasised in particular the importance of strengthening governance frameworks to promote a quick and sustainable recovery.</para><para>The meeting also endorsed my proposal to establish the Asia Recovery Information Centre. This internet-based information exchange centre is now based at the Asian Development Bank in Manila. It will enhance coordination between donors and regional governments to promote sustained recovery.</para><para>Fortunately, the past 12 months have seen the economies of East Asia reviving. The five crisis countries—Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Korea—are now expected to have average growth rates of almost 3 per cent in 1999 and 4 per cent in 2000. While this is good news, there is no cause for complacency. The situation still remains fragile. There is a risk that the strengthening recovery could reduce the urgency of reform. A continuing emphasis on governance issues is vital.</para><para>This point was reinforced by His Excellency Anand Panyarachun, former Thai Prime Minister, when he was in Australia last month as a guest of the Centre for Democratic Institutions, which I established 18 months ago. Mr Anand noted Thailand's achievements over the past decade and emphasised the importance of democratic, open, and accountable government in working towards his country's goals.</para><para>Within East Asia, mention should be made of <inline font-weight="bold">Indonesia</inline> , which in many ways suffered most from the crisis. As I have indicated, our aid program has been helping Indonesia's transition to democracy and its emerging economic recovery. We provided $14.3 million to support the Indonesian elections. We commenced a $70 million, three-year package
 of capacity building in economic and financial management. We have provided humanitarian assistance to ensure people have food and medicine and to keep children in schools. We look forward to supporting the efforts of the new Indonesian government to achieve a more prosperous and democratic nation.</para><para>Our leadership role in <inline font-weight="bold">East Timor </inline> speaks for itself. We provided over $20 million to the United Nations Consultation Process on Autonomy. Since the ballot, Australian leadership of INTERFET has helped restore security. Australia has also played a critical role in the international humanitarian response, providing basic shelter, food, and water to the people of East Timor.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>The challenge of building a new nation is great, including to develop an open, accountable and efficient government and administration, as well as a strong civil society.  It will require a major and coordinated effort from the international community. Australia will play a significant role in sharing the burden. Assistance to the East Timorese people, will total at least $75 million this financial year, including the additional $60 million for the aid program I announced on 22 November.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Papua New Guinea</inline></para><para>Turning to another close neighbour, the election of the Morauta Government in Papua New Guinea has provided a new impetus for economic policy reform and improved governance.</para><para>Australia's aid program is providing support for this reform impetus. On 1 September, I announced that the final payment of budget support to Papua New Guinea, worth some $30 million, would be brought forward. We have provided further technical assistance to the key economic agencies in the PNG Government.</para><para>In October, the Prime Minister and PNG's Prime Minister, Sir Mekere Morauta, signed a new treaty on development cooperation. The treaty will build on the governance results already being achieved through the aid program. It provides for the establishment of an "Incentive Fund", which will reward excellence and promote contestability among Papua New Guinean Government agencies and community and private organisations. It will support reform efforts that local communities want, which have real impact, and which will last.</para><para>During the Prime Minister's visit to PNG, he committed $120 million to help retire Papua New Guinea debt and implement structural adjustment programs. While this loan is not aid, it is another demonstration of Australian support for PNG's reform agenda, and in particular PNG's re-engagement with the IMF and World Bank.</para><para>Australia also continues to support the Bougainville peace process through a program of reconstruction and rehabilitation and logistical support for the
 continuing peace negotiations. Technical support has also been provided to the Bougainville provincial authorities to strengthen their planning processes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">South Pacific</inline></para><para>As well as PNG, other South Pacific countries remain a strong focus for the aid program. Improving governance is one of the keys to helping the island nations achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance. An important tool in recognising and rewarding those Pacific Island countries showing demonstrated commitment to essential economic and public sector management reforms is the Policy and Management Reform initiative. This initiative has been steadily increasing over the last 4 years to its current level of over $14 million; and has funded such diverse projects as a new computerised customs system and a regional media-training project.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Community involvement</inline></para><para>Before concluding my statement to Parliament today, I want to acknowledge the Australian community's involvement in tackling the challenges facing developing countries in our region. I have been struck by the generosity of the Australian people and their belief in a fair go for all.  Community involvement in the aid program has been further extended through the Australian <inline font-weight="bold">Youth Ambassadors</inline>  for Development program. The program, now in its second year, has placed 140<inline font-weight="bold"></inline> young Australians in the region.</para><para>The Government has also moved to recognise and strengthen the important relationship between the Government and <inline font-weight="bold">non government organisations</inline>  in Australia's overseas aid program. A few months ago I issued a policy statement, which provides the framework for a productive working relationship between the government and NGOs.</para><para>Another initiative involving the community is <inline font-weight="bold">Destroy A Minefield</inline> , which I launched in November. This initiative will assist minefields clearance in Cambodia. Every two dollars raised in the community will be matched by one dollar from the Government.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>With a year of achievement behind us for Australia in general, and the aid program in particular, we look ahead to building on that success. We can maximise the impact of our aid efforts in reducing poverty and achieving sustainable development if we continue to do three things.</para><para>First, we need to remain focused on those areas where we have the real capacity to assist. Governance is one of those areas.</para><para>Second, we need to be alert and responsive to the rapidly changing environment, particularly in our region. No one accurately predicted all the tumultu
 ous events that occurred in the last few years. The only safe prediction for the future is that the unexpected is likely to happen—and we need to be able to respond quickly.</para><para>Finally, what really matters is that things actually change for the better. I want to see us play our part in partnership with our neighbours, to help them reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. That is the test. The way we do that is to continue to make our aid program professional, driven by quality, and focused on real impact.</para><para>That way we will make a difference.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>11626</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><para>I am pleased to have this opportunity to respond to the Foreign Minister's annual statement on Australia's overseas aid program. There is, I have to say, an increasing element of casual routine to these end of year statements. Nevertheless, it is very worth while today to reaffirm Labor's bipartisan support for Australia's overseas aid program.</para><para>This has been, as the minister observes, a big year for foreign aid. I think everyone would agree with that as a statement. I would like to make a few points about our international development assistance, especially the implications of our large and growing effort in East Timor. On 22 November the minister announced that Australia would contribute an additional $A60 million this year to assist East Timor's humanitarian and reconstruction needs. Together with the $14 million previously committed to East Timor, this is the largest ever contribution to an international humanitarian crisis by Australia. This commitment has Labor's wholehearted support.</para><para>My colleague the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Brereton, visited East Timor as a member of the Australian parliamentary group observing the 30 August ballot, and again more recently in the company of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Cunningham. He said on his return that the scale of the destruction he witnessed was quite overwhelming. The task of reconstruction is enormous. What was a very poor society burdened by decades of oppression and exploitation was razed from
 one end to the other by the pro-Indonesian militia and their TNI backers. It was a systematic and highly organised campaign of vengeance and destruction. In the history of decolonisation this century, it is difficult to find a comparable case where a new nation was forced to start so near absolute zero. We still do not know how many people died. Around 140,000 East Timorese are still in squalid refugee camps in West Timor, where militia intimidation is still rife and the risks of disease, including cholera, are growing by the day.</para><para>In East Timor, where the wet season has begun, more than 70 per cent of homes need to be rebuilt. Schools, shops, public services and health centres—all need to be rebuilt or repaired. Roads and other basic infrastructure are in an appalling state of disrepair. On top of this, the key institutions of an independent nation need to be established: a public service, political and judicial institutions and effective health and education services. Usually a new state would at least inherit working institutions of some sort from the former colonial regime, but that is not the case in East Timor. I do not think anyone can underestimate the challenges ahead for the UNTAET and for East Timor's leaders. They will need all the help they can get. All this amounts to an enormous task, and the demand on our aid budget will be an enduring one. No-one should say that they have any doubt about that. The international community—the European Union, the United States, Japan and many other countries—have responded generously, but a large measure of responsibility will undoubtedly rest with Australia. We must be in this for the long haul.</para><para>Here can be found an anomaly. As honourable senators will recall, the Prime Minister announced the Defence (East Timor) Levy, the so-called Timor tax, on 23 November. When he did so, he foreshadowed an estimated $3.683 billion of additional expenditure over the period 1999-2000 to 2002-03. The overwhelming majority of this expenditure—$3.562 billion or 96.7 per cent of the total—relates to the Australian Defence Force: $1.355 billion for the ADF deployment in East Timor; $529 million on capital equip
 ment; $1,547 million for force expansion, being the raising of two additional battalion groups; and $131 million for the income tax exemption for pay and allowances of ADF personnel on eligible duty outside Australia. All these commitments extend over the current financial period and out to the financial year 2002-03.</para><para>By comparison, the $60 million of humanitarian and reconstruction aid for East Timor in the current financial year amounts to a very modest 1.62 per cent of the additional expenditure outlined in the Prime Minister's statement. Indeed, the commitments announced by the Prime Minister put our overall foreign aid effort into an interesting perspective. The point I wish to draw to senators' attention, however, is the absence of any forward commitment on aid for East Timor. Unlike the commitments to the Australian Defence Force deployment and force expansion, this is a one-off, one year only additional allocation. Obviously, the government considers itself unable to make a forward commitment on aid. But the reality of a very large and ongoing demand on our aid program is clear. It raises interesting questions for next year's aid budget.</para><para>Examination of the statistical annexe of this year's development assistance budgetary summary gives the sorry tale of the government's stewardship of our foreign aid. In the last budget of the former Labor government—1995-96—Australia's official development assistance in constant 1998-99 prices was $1.635 billion or 0.32 per cent of GNP. In the first Howard government budget this was slashed by 9.4 per cent to $1.481 billion and the ratio fell to what was then a historic low of 0.28 per cent of GNP. In the following year there was a further cut of 1.9 per cent and the ratio again fell to 0.27 per cent of GNP. In 1998-99, the aid budget amounted to $1.478 billion, a slight increase of 1.7 per cent but a further fall in the ODA to GNP ratio of 0.26 per cent. This year's budget involved an aid vote of $1.5 billion, an increase of $22 billion over 1998-99. In effect, while it maintained the status quo, the ODA to GNP ratio was projected to fall to a new low of 0.25 cent.</para><para>Since the budget, of course, Australia's East Timor commitments and an additional $35 million over three years for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative have pushed our foreign aid to slightly more than $1.6 billion. The minister anticipates that our ODA to GNP ratio will increase from the previously projected 0.25 per cent to 0.28 per cent. But what happens next year?</para><para>Australia will unquestionably be obliged to continue a very significant amount of assistance to East Timor. We must do that but, as the minister's statement rightly makes clear, Australia's aid program is much more than simply East Timor. We have very large and important commitments in Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific and East Asia. We also have smaller but still important programs in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East. And we are likely to face other significant demands on our resources—not only in our immediate region but also further afield.</para><para>The challenge for the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be how the aid budget will accommodate new, large and ongoing demands. There will certainly be a strong temptation on the part of the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Administration to accommodate at least part of these demands through cuts from elsewhere in our aid budget from programs in Africa and South Asia, the two regions where the greatest numbers of the world's poorest people are to be found. The Foreign Minister has given no forward commitments on aid to East Timor. Equally significantly, he has given no guarantee that further aid to East Timor or elsewhere in our region will not be at the expense of other established programs further afield.</para><para>The minister observed in his statement that volume is not the only—or necessarily the most important—measure of foreign aid; the quality and impact of development assistance are what counts. No-one would disagree with this but it is equally true that resources, the actual volumes of aid, are critical. It is ridiculous to suggest otherwise. The government continues to pay lip service to the United Nations 0.7 per cent of overseas development aid to the GNP ratio target. But lip service is all that it is. As the 1996 Simons report made
 clear, such a commitment has very little, if any, credibility unless a realistic framework is set for Australia to work towards the ultimate goal. We await next year's aid budget with keen interest.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>11628</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Routine of Business</title><page.no>11628</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>)—by leave—proposed:</para><para>That the question for the adjournment of the Senate today shall not be proposed till after a motion for the adjournment is moved by a minister.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>11628</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition supports the motion on the understanding that the meaning of that motion is consistent with the letter that has been distributed by the Manager of Government Business, which in effect will have us debating the ANTS package, a bill regarding the NCA and then adjourning, as I understand the circumstances.

Despite a very credible campaign which attracted much interest, he was not successful.</para><para>The new Director-General, Mr Matsuura of Japan has already outlined in some detail the strategy he proposes to follow in revitalizing UNESCO and refurbishing its image. His thoughtful and determined approach has attracted widespread support amongst members.</para><para>Australia will give Mr Matsuura its full support in his endeavours and we look forward to working with him, including through our membership of the Executive Board.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Pacific Island Involvement in UNESCO</inline></para><para>Australia is a member of the Pacific sub-group of the Asia-Pacific region within UNESCO. During the Conference we worked very closely with the Pacific Island Delegations and were deeply appreciative of the strong support that they gave to our Executive Board candidature.</para><para>The importance attached by Pacific Island countries to UNESCO and to its programs is reflected in the growth in membership—from 6 Pacific members in early 1989 to 16 members after Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia joined during this General Conference.</para><para>One of our priorities in the period ahead will be to develop further the excellent relations with these countries and to build on the support that we are able to offer them in UNESCO.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Australia's Election to the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee </inline></para><para>During the General Conference there was a meeting of the States party to the World Heritage Convention followed by a meeting of the World Heritage Committee, of which Australia is a member. At the meeting we were successful in being elected to the Bureau of the Committee, as the vice-chair for the Asia-Pacific region.</para><para>This outcome gave us the opportunity to pursue our objective of hosting the Committee meeting in the year 2000 in Cairns and serving as Chair of the Committee. As Senator Hill announced over the
 weekend, Australia's invitation to host this meeting was accepted on the third of December at the 1999 session of the Committee held in Marrakech, Morocco. It was clear during the extraordinary session of the Committee, as it has been at other meetings, that the effort that Australia puts into protecting its natural and cultural heritage is widely regarded as being at the forefront of world practice.</para><para>The Committee meeting in Cairns will also give us the opportunity to place a special emphasis not only on Australia's world heritage properties, but on the importance of extending the reach of the Convention into the Pacific region.</para><para>As Senator Hill said on the weekend, "Cairns is a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef and Queensland's Wet Tropics, providing us with an excellent opportunity to showcase Australia's exemplary standards in World Heritage management".</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Youth</inline></para><para>The UNESCO General Conference was also notable for the particular emphasis it gave to youth participation. UNESCO, through its Associated Schools Project, and in cooperation with the French Government, hosted the World Parliament of Children, marking the 10th anniversary of the entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Australia was represented at this important occasion by students Caitlin Goss from Queensland and Ryan Hall from Victoria. The Parliament produced a Youth Manifesto which was formally presented to the General Conference. It will also be tabled at the Millennium session of the UN General Assembly in New York.</para><para>The Associated Schools project I have just mentioned forms a valuable global network of schools which places particular emphasis on education and exchanges in the field of heritage, sports and drugs. I had a productive discussion with the Secretariat official responsible for the project and look forward to its wider implementation in Australia.</para><para>The General Conference itself also had a Youth Forum at which Australia played a particularly prominent role. Not only did Professor Wiltshire as co-Chair of UNESCO's Youth Council, address the Forum, Australia was elected to the Youth Forum's Drafting Committee, and the two Australian delegates, Mia Handshin and Cameron Forbes, played a leading role in the debate on UNESCO's youth strategies and its youth agenda into the 21st century. The Australian delegates worked in close cooperation with their colleagues from the Asia Pacific region.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Bilateral Meetings</inline></para><para>I took the opportunity of the Conference to meet bilaterally with a number of colleagues including Mr Claude Allegre, French Minister for National Education, Research and Technology. My discus
 sions with Mr Allegre included the recent signing of an MOU by Mr Allegre and Dr Kemp on Education Collaboration and Mutual Recognition of Qualifications, which provides a good platform for ongoing dialogue on education cooperation.</para><para>I also met with Mrs Margarethe Vestager, Danish Minister of Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs, with whom I discussed increasing the utilisation of information technology in teaching, reforms in adult education and improving the quality of education through enhanced teacher skills. I also met with Mr Kadel Asmal, Minister of Education of the Republic of South Africa.</para><para>These exchanges were useful and provided valuable opportunities to explain Australian Education policies and to learn from the experience of others.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Conclusion</inline></para><para>Mr Speaker, let me conclude by paying tribute to the work done in supporting the involvement of the Australian Government in UNESCO by the Australian National Commission. The Commission has amongst its members some of the most eminent Australians in their field who contribute to the work of the Commission in their own time and often at their own expense. The effectiveness of the Australian National Commission is widely recognised by other National Commissions, many of which have sought to follow the Australian model.</para><para>Australia's participation in UNESCO enhances our national standing through showcasing Australia's expertise in such areas of human endeavour as bioethics, oceanography, hydrology, indigenous culture and education. It brings direct benefits to Australia in terms of consultancies and trade in services that flow from the contacts that are made during the various meetings. But most importantly our active and effective participation can contribute to needs of countries, particularly those less well off than Australia, through the improvement of basic education standards, the promotion of bioethics and the protection of heritage and human rights.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>11631</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>11631</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Community Affairs References Committee</title><page.no>11631</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>11631</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>11631</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the government's response to the report of the Community Affairs References

In its examination of key child care issues, the report supports many of the Government's important child care reforms.</para><para>There have been significant developments in the area of child care funding since the Committee commenced its Inquiry. The proposed merging of the two existing child care payments into a single, simpler and more generous Child Care Benefit, as announced in the Government's Tax Reform Package, will address many of the Committee's major concerns.</para><para>The Child Care Benefit (CCB) to be introduced in July 2000 provides for significant increases in assistance for many families, particularly low income families, and greatly simplifies arrangements for claiming assistance. As part of the overall CCB package the Government has also announced the introduction of a multiple child rate across all service types (excluding occasional child care), and a 10 per cent loading for part-time care in long day care centres. The 10 per cent loading will be particularly beneficial to those families who pay a higher fee for part-time usage.</para><para>The Department of Family and Community Services is also addressing the Committee's concerns regarding data that is available on child care. The Australian Bureau of Statistics was commissioned to review the data needs of the Children's Services Program and the most effective methods for collecting the data. A Commonwealth/State Working Group has been established to produce a minimum data set for Children's Services across all jurisdictions, and ensure deficiencies in current data are overcome and that consistent, timely data are available for all users. In addition, a Census of Child Care Services, covering all service types, was conducted in May 1999. Preliminary data is currently available for internal Departmental analysis. It is expected that publicly available data will be provided in February 2000.
</para><para>This response addresses each of the recommendations made by the Committee and comments on both the minority report submitted by Government members of the Committee and the dissenting report submitted by the Australian Democrats.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee recommends that the Department of Family and Community Services, in conjunction with the other major collectors of data on children's services, adopt a more coordinated approach to data collection to ensure that overlap and deficiencies in the current data collection are overcome.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">AND</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee recommends that the Department of Family and Community Services expedite the processing of results from future surveys and census collections so that up-to-date information is available for policy development and planning purposes.</inline></para><para>The need to adopt a more coordinated approach to the collection of data in the area of community services is widely recognised. In October 1997, the Standing Committee of Community Services and Income Security Administrators (SCCSISA) proposed the improvement of community services data as a high priority, and commissioned the National Community Services Information Management Group (NCSIMG) to carry out this task.</para><para>The work of the NCSIMG covers a broad spectrum of community services including child care, aged care, disability services, family support services, child welfare, and emergency relief and crisis services. The NCSIMG is focusing on the development of consistent national community services information so that there is improved access to quality information for the community, governments, service providers, consumers of services and non-government organisations. The NCSIMG is expected to report in late 1999.</para><para>To focus on the data needs in the area of child care, a sub-committee, the NCSIMG Children's Services Data Working Group, has been established. The NCSIMG Children's Services Data Working Group constitutes representatives from Commonwealth and State/Territory governments and agencies involved in the collection and use of child care data. Membership includes the Department of Family and Community Services, State Government Departments, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. A key role of the NCSIMG Children's Services Data Working Group is to produce a National Minimum Data Set for Children's Services to ensure overlap and deficiencies in current data collections are overcome, and consistent, timely data are available for all users.
</para><para>In addition, the Department of Family and Community Services commissioned the Australian Bureau of Statistics to review the data needs of the Children's Services Program. The ABS reported in December 1998 and there are now several mechanisms in place to address the concerns outlined in Recommendation 1:</para><para>-	 The Census of Child Care Services is being conducted in 1999 and on a biennial basis in the following years. The Census of Child Care Services is the major data collection mechanism for the Program and has been conducted regularly since 1986. The Census provides accurate information on services, children and staff. Information provided by the Census is used extensively for policy analysis, planning and administration of the Children's Services Program. Each time the Census is conducted, users of child care data are consulted for their data needs and the forms are tested extensively to ensure accurate results are obtained.</para><para>National Office will continue to work with the State Offices in the Department of Family and Community Services to determine a core set of data items to be collected for future Planning Advisory Committee (PAC) meetings. This will ensure national comparability in core data collected.</para><para>-	 The feasibility of introducing a Data Warehouse Model will be investigated in 1999. Such a model would overcome problems of overlap or deficiency in current data collections through providing an output-oriented, one-stop, `statistical data shop' for the Commonwealth Children's Services Program.</para><para>The latest Census of Child Care Services was conducted in May 1999 to allow access to selected preliminary data for internal Departmental analysis by July/August, and comprehensive data for the 2000-01 Budget cycle.</para><para>Strategies are in place to reduce the processing time for Census results, including the use of an electronic form, which will enable services to directly download data from their computer systems. Other possibilities of expediting the processing and release of Census results are currently being examined and assessed by the Department.</para><para>The introduction of the new Child Care Benefit in July 2000 will necessitate the development of a new computer system. This provides a welcome opportunity to address the limitations in currently available administrative data and system design features.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation</inline><inline font-weight="bold">3:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee recommends that the Government support the `mixed economy' model, whereby both community-based and private-for-profit services play a valuable role in the provi

However, the Government is satisfied that the level of assistance provided to help community based services adjust to the funding change has been sufficient and does not believe further assistance for this purpose is warranted. Account also needs to be taken of the Government's objective of providing a level playing field for both the community and private sectors.</para><para>Since the election of the Coalition Government in 1996, the changes to child care funding have removed inequities which existed between the two service types with the view of establishing a more competitive mixed economy model.</para><para>In relation to the Commonwealth's largest child care funding program, Childcare Assistance, both community based and private-for-profit centres now have the same conditions applying to their accessing of these funds on behalf of families using their services.</para><para>Significant assistance has been made available to assist community based services to adjust to the funding change and to help ensure their ongoing viability. The 1996 Budget provided $8.3m over two years for centres to obtain financial and management advice. Services were also eligible to apply for funding to undertake minor capital upgrading which would assist them to develop more efficient operating arrangements.</para><para>Ninety three percent of services (1022 of approximately 1100 centres) took up the offer to obtain financial and management advice at a total cost of  $3.6m and a total of $3.4m was provided for minor capital and equipment.</para><para>The Commonwealth also funds capital upgrade grant programs. Ongoing programs for established
 community based services include the Minor Capital Upgrading Program at $1.5m per year and the Capital Replacement and Upgrade Program at $1.9m per year for centres 15 years old or older.</para><para>A range of one off grants is available to all new, Commonwealth funded, community based long day care centres:</para><para>-	 set up grants, currently paid at $35 per approved place, assist with expenses such as phones and insurance;</para><para>-	 establishment grants are paid six weeks prior to the centre opening for the employment of a director (for a maximum of six weeks salary); and</para><para>-	 equipment grants are available for the one-off purchase of toys and is paid as a component of the per place capital grant for long day care centres.</para><para>The Government also funds a range of support mechanisms to services such as Field Staff Resources Pool workers, in-service training and support from the Resource and Advisory Agencies to ensure support is targeted at services' needs:</para><para>-	 the Field Staff Resources Pool (FSRP) funds are used to employ fieldworkers on a short term basis to assist with the establishment of new child care places and community based or non-profit services;</para><para>-	 in-service training funds cover the support offered to staff and management committees of Commonwealth funded children's services by means of workshops, seminars, train-the-trainer programs, on-the-job training and through State based conferences; and</para><para>-	 the Resource and Advisory Agencies are funded to provide support, advice and in-service training to workers and managers in children's services. Their objective is to support and improve the management and quality of care of these services.</para><para>The Government recognises that the community sector has a particularly important role to play in the provision of child care in rural and remote areas where mainstream services, including private sector participation, are not sustainable.</para><para>In rural and remote areas, access to mainstream child care services is supported through a range of measures:</para><para>-	 $6.8m per year in Disadvantaged Areas Subsidy (DAS) for long day care community centres in areas where no alternative centre-based care is available;</para><para>-	 $4.4m per year in DAS for rural/remote and isolated urban fringe Outside School Hours Care services; and
</para><para>-	 $12m per year provided for multifunctional children's services which deliver a mix of centre-based and family day care, occasional care and outside school hours care. Of these, 14 services provide access for the general community, and 28 cater specifically for indigenous children.</para><para>In addition, 30 mobile services deliver child care in the form of playgroups and occasional care in remote areas. They also provide toy libraries and broader information and support for parents.</para><para>The development and establishment of new services in such areas involves community development activities to ensure that services meet the particular needs of specific communities and that they are viable in the longer term. This work is currently being supported by Departmental staff and options for improving its scope and effectiveness are being considered.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that the review of the centres' charging practices referred to the Child Care Advisory Council be conducted as a matter of priority.</inline></para><para>The Council reported to the Minister for Family and Community Services on 30 April 1999.</para><para>In its review the Council considered a number of alternative approaches to the payment of Childcare Assistance and assessed the impact of these options using a computer model it had commissioned.</para><para>The Council has advised the Minister that there would be risks to service viability if changes were made to funding and charging practices at this time. The Council proposes to revisit the funding and charging issue when it can take account of its examination of the regulatory environment and the new Child Care Benefit and payment arrangements.</para><para>Government reforms appear to be having the effect of reducing the gap between hours of care paid by families and care actually used by families.

All services that engaged an adviser were provided with a written report that outlined areas for improvements in business practices.</para><para>Individual support visits continue to be offered to all services to assist with setting up of administrative procedures and to answer questions about the new Childcare Assistance arrangements. Feedback indicates that services are very positive about the assistance received.</para><para>Most elements of support concluded on 30 June 1999. However, the OSHC Helpline, personal visits (individual assistance), and one-off funding for services facing closures have been extended until 31 December 1999.</para><para>From 1 July 1999, private operators can take over sponsorship of existing Commonwealth funded (stand alone) OSHC services.</para><para>As mentioned in response to Recommendation 4, the Government also funds a range of support mechanisms to services such as Field Staff Resources Pool workers, in-service training and
 support from the Resource and Advisory Agencies to ensure support is targeted at services' needs.</para><para>The Department regularly reviews these programs to ensure service needs are being met. Such reviews are also informed by pilots in various States and Territories trialling different forms of administrative support services.</para><para>Providing transport to and from a service is primarily the responsibility of the family. There is no funding allocated to services solely for transport. However, under the Restructuring Assistance—Minor Capital Upgrading initiative (up to $7,000 on a competitive basis), services could submit a joint application with other services in order to pool funds to purchase more expensive items such as minibuses. Some services (individually) received grants for a contribution towards buses.</para><para>The cost of hiring school premises varies significantly between and within each State and Territory. Some services are currently charged little or no fee, some may contribute to the school fund for electricity etc. while other services are required to contribute more fully for the use of the premises.</para><para>Most State/Territory Departments of Education have devolved school funding issues to the local level e.g. school councils or Principals and each outside school hours care service/sponsor needs to negotiate with the school council/principal to determine the rate/fee for the use of the building.</para><para>A multiple child rate is currently in place, with families with multiple children in one type of service, receiving the higher multiple child Childcare Assistance rate. This system treats long day care (ie. centres and family day care) and outside school hours care as different service types. The Government is aware that both families and services view this arrangement as unsatisfactory and a multiple child rate across all sectors has been included in A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 on</para><para>31 March 1999. The introduction of the multiple child rate will coincide with the introduction of the new Child Care Benefit in July 2000.</para><para>It should be noted, however, that as a result of the recent reforms to school age care, 93,000 families (as at May 1999) have registered with Centrelink for Childcare Assistance.

In particular, flexible care arrangements allow FDC services to meet a wide range of families' needs including long day care, part-time care, occasional care, emergency care, and care outside standard hours. FDC is also well suited to provide baby places, and is a basis for the development of flexible service models in high need rural and remote areas where mainstream services are not sustainable.</para><para>Operational subsidies have continued for Family Day Care, and assist with the cost of running co-ordination units which perform a range of functions essential in efficient the operations of the current model of FDC. Around $60m annually is available for FDC operational subsidies.</para><para>The Government is committed to a policy framework which would enable FDC services to continue in their current role. A two stage process is underway to work closely with service providers and families to develop and implement quality measures for Family Day Care.</para><para>Stage 1 of the Project to develop and implement a quality improvement and accreditation system for Family Day Care has been completed. Two project teams including family day care experts and the Department of Family and Community Services have prepared proposals for a FDC quality assurance implementation model and quality measures.</para><para>These reports are being considered as part of Stage 2. The Department has engaged independent consultants to review the proposals and to undertake a cost-effectiveness study of various quality assurance implementation models.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 9: </inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee recommends that urgent action be taken to better target child care assistance to low income families, particularly those with more than one child, by the introduction of a `top up' or `supplement' to the current rate of Childcare Assistance.</inline></para><para>This recommendation has been addressed as part of the Government's Tax Reform package which, with the introduction of the Child Care Benefit (CCB), is expected to provide an increase of up to $7.50 per week for a low income family paying average fees for one child in full time centre based care. Additional weekly benefits will be available where two or more children are in care.</para><para>Affordability is influenced by a range of factors including the fees that child care services set. These fees are not controlled by Government and over recent years have increased at a rate much higher
 than economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index and Average Weekly Earnings. It is a welcome fact, however, that the rate of fee increases for centres has halved under this Government (4% per annum) compared with the average increase between 1991 and 1996 (8.5% per annum).</para><para>In making decisions about child care funding, the Government must weigh up the formal child care needs of families with the broader demand for Government spending on the range of services provided for people at the various stages in their life cycle. The Child Care Program demonstrates the Government's significant ongoing commitment to assisting families to access high quality care within a framework of efficient processes, effective targeting and overall fiscal responsibility.</para><para>From 1 July 2000, it is anticipated that families with one child in full-time care, who are eligible for the maximum rate of Child Care Benefit, will receive $120 per week ($2.40 per hour) in Government assistance. The exact amount of assistance payable at that time will depend on a number of factors such as indexation between now and the implementation date of 1 July 2000. Maximum assistance will be available for families with incomes under $28,200 a year, tapering down to a minimum rate of assistance when income reaches $81,000 a year for families with one child in care.</para><para>The CCB will also continue to provide additional rates of assistance for families with more than one child in care, that is, a family with two or more children in care will receive a higher per child rate of Government assistance than a family with only one child in care.</para><para>The CCB will further address child care affordability by providing a 10 per cent loaded rate of assistance to families utilising centre based part-time care. The loaded rate is in recognition of the higher fee many families using part-time centre based care have to pay.</para><para>These new arrangements provide generous assistance for low-income families using formal child care. For example, a low-income family with two children in formal care would receive a government subsidy of up to $251 per week, or over $13,000 per year.</para><para>To accompany the introduction of the CCB the Government has also announced a range of changes to the personal income tax system and family payments. This integrated package of reforms will provide significantly more assistance to families in recognition of the costs incurred by families, substantially improve work incentives for low and middle income families and greatly simplify the complex array of assistance currently provided to families.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 10:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee also recommends that the Department of Family and Community Services
 conduct research to establish criteria to judge affordability levels for families accessing child care as a matter of priority.</inline></para><para>This recommendation is noted. As noted under Recommendation 9, the Government provides generous assistance to families using formal care.</para><para>For low income families (for example a sole parent earning around $30,000 per year) with two children in full time care, Government assistance covers around 75%</para><para>of the average fee in centres ($12,400 in annual assistance), and around 80% of the average fee in Family Day Care ($11,500 in annual assistance).</para><para>-	 for a middle income family (earning around $45,000 per year) Government assistance would be around 60% of the average fee in centres ($10,000 in annual assistance) and 65% in Family Day Care ($9,000 in annual assistance).</para><para>Regular research is undertaken to enable the Government to monitor the affordability of child care for families.

Initiatives announced in the Tax Package, including the new Child Care Benefit and improved and simplified benefits for families, will provide an integrated approach to assisting families who are socially or economically disadvantaged. This builds on the current system of Childcare Assistance which targets maximum benefits to low income families.</para><para>Issues relating to disadvantaged families are complex, and go beyond child care and child care funding mechanisms (for example, the Committee refers to crime prevention, family support and child protection). The Government recognises these complexities. Indeed, the establishment of the new Department of Family and Community Services is evidence of the Government's commitment to the comprehensive examination of issues facing families, disadvantaged families in particular.</para><para>Funding available through the Children's Services Program such as Disadvantaged Areas Subsidies (which focus on rural and remote areas) and special recurrent grants for Aboriginal services aim to support the supply of child care services in areas where no alternatives exist, to ensure that families continue to have access to appropriate child care.</para><para>Extension of similar support to urban disadvantaged areas is not considered to be warranted at this stage as there is no evidence that there is a correlation between under-supply of child care services and such areas. Furthermore, families often use child care in locations other than where they live (for example, close to where they work, study, or in transport corridors).</para><para>Child care planning processes have been significantly strengthened under the National Planning System for Child Care. Planning Advisory Committees in each State and Territory continue to meet regularly to assess local needs and assist Government in determining where to allocate new child care places. The future priority of the National Planning System will be to ensure that new places are only targeted to areas with an identified need and that growth is contained in areas of over supply.</para><para>The Department of Family and Community Services has analysed and will continue to monitor closures in areas of social disadvantage. Recent analysis refutes the claim that service closures have had a disproportionate impact on disadvantaged areas.

In particular I was
 referring to the cost of motor vehicles and how the Labor Party would wish to have motor vehicles stay at a higher cost than they will be under the new tax system. During their 13 years of government, the Labor Party consistently increased tax on motor vehicles. We now have it at a level of 22 per cent.</para></talk.start><para>But it is not just the tax on the motor vehicle itself when one goes to buy it: there are also the taxes embedded in the construction and manufacture incurred by all of the companies involved in putting that motor vehicle together. Under the new tax system, those taxes will all be removed and there will be a 10 per cent goods and services tax at the end. That is the only tax—at the end. At the moment there is 22 per cent at the end and there are all of the other embedded taxes all the way through the system.</para><para>The Labor Party will say that there is a buyers strike at the moment in terms of motor vehicles. Some people might be a little reluctant to buy a motor vehicle at the moment, but let us look at the facts. Total motor vehicle sales in the month of November are only half a per cent below the record sales levels achieved in November 1998, but they are nine per cent higher than in November 1997, which was the previous record year. Locally manufactured passenger vehicles are selling well. Total sales for Commodore, Falcon, Camry and Magna for the first 11 months of 1999 are only three per cent below their 1998 record levels and are 13.8 per cent higher than in 1997. The same applies to truck sales and so on.</para><para>But we go on to all of these examples that the Labor Party keep on giving, trying to frighten people about the impact of the new tax system. There is no evidence to support the scare campaign. Anyone would think we were coming up to an election in the next six months the way this scare campaign is now getting so out of hand. As I think Senator Murray said prior to the adjournment of this debate, once the next election comes by, this whole system will be in place and people will understand how it works. Everyone who is grizzling about it, particularly the opposition, is afraid of change, and they want to make sure that people are frightened as a conse
 quence. Anyone would think that a country had never gone through a change of tax system before. Not so! People will know that the new tax system will be less complicated.</para><para>I want to refer particularly to one of the bills that we are talking about today, which is  A New Tax System (Pay As You Go) Bill 1999 . As I said before, there are so few on the other side who have ever run a business, who have ever had to file tax returns for the business, who have ever had to pay the bills, that they do not know the difference between what is currently the practice and what will be the practice after the pay as you go system is instituted. I want to say quite frankly that when I was in business one of the greatest imposts in running a business was having to deal with five levels of wholesale sales tax and, most importantly, having that wholesale sales tax sitting on the warehouse shelf prior to selling the goods to the customers.</para><para>Under this system, you collect the goods and services tax and remit it, but meanwhile you have the tax sitting in your bank account, not the government's bank account. That provides cash flow benefits. But the opposition cannot understand it. They cannot comprehend that it provides a cash flow benefit, whereby companies can use the tax money that they are collecting in their bank account. The use of that is a very important factor to a lot of small businesses. But the objective of the policy is to make sure that a modernised income tax assessment system is implemented.</para><para>There are many things that I would like to say about this, but I know that we are now under time constraints, that this bill and one other bill have to be dealt with before we rise tonight. But I do want to make reference to a couple of other things which are not insignificant, and one is the claim by the opposition that there are going to be complex returns. I have said for years, ever since the 1993 campaign, that if any of the people who claim that this is a complex return actually ran a business, they would understand how complex the system is today. In comparison, you have one A4 sheet to fill out and return with money you have had sitting in your own bank
 account—give me the one A4 sheet any day. That is the important part about it.</para><para>Of course, the Labor opposition will talk about discouraging tourism and everything else. Is there anyone in the opposition who will not travel to a country because it has a consumption tax? What absolute and utter nonsense! Yet somehow they think that people coming into our country as tourists should not pay and contribute to our taxes. It is absolutely ridiculous to think that we can pay it in other countries but people visiting us cannot. I remember a few years ago I went to New Zealand. Of course, the first thing that I did was get into a taxi to go into the city. I said to the taxi driver, `What do you think of the goods and services tax?' She turned to me and she said, `The what?' I said, `The goods and services tax.' She could not believe that I was actually asking the question. She said, `That's been here for ages.' I said, `Yeah, but how did it affect your business?' And she said, `My husband and I run the cabs. The way it affected our business is that we were able to buy another cab because we had tax benefits that we didn't previously have under the old system.'</para><para>So the ogre that is painted about other countries having a broad-based consumption tax is sheer and utter nonsense. We have heard in the last few days about Christmas vouchers and all of these things, that next year Christmas will be more expensive. Let us face it: this is the last year that mums, dads and grandparents will have to pay 22 per cent tax on toys. Next year, they pay 10 per cent. To say that gift vouchers and things like that—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Calvert interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>—That is quite right, Senator Calvert—all of those things that children like. To say that gift vouchers for services are going to be taxed is also complete and utter nonsense. Last year I gave gift vouchers to relatives for various services, and most of those services will be well under $50,000. They will not even be in the net, and it will not cost a brass razoo more next year from this year.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—Why didn't you buy them a present?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>—I won't tell you what the service was! I will leave that to your imagination. The envelope was nicely wrapped! I have got to tell you that the service would not be one cent more expensive next Christmas from last Christmas. It is nonsense about vouchers and toys and everything else being more expensive—they will not be. We have never shied away from the fact that some things will be more expensive; other things will be much less expensive. Let us face it: the common denominator that the Labor Party conveniently forget all the time is that that is precisely why compensation is being paid to everyone. Whether they are in the tax system or out of the tax system, they will have more money left in their pockets to be able to spend to compensate them for anything that might be higher in cost.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>11641</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The bills we are debating today concern the goods and services tax. Of course, we all remember that the goods and services tax, introduced by the Liberal-National Party, was the tax we were never, ever going to have. Who can forget the famous words of the Prime Minister that `never ever'—and he repeated it a number of times—would this country have a goods and services tax. Of course, the goods and services tax is the tax that taxes just about everything.</para></talk.start><para>As most people would be aware, the goods and services tax package passed the Senate some months ago. Those who are avidly listening to the broadcast might wonder why we are debating the issue yet again. The reason we are debating six bills concerned with the goods and services tax is that we are considering—here in the Senate, at this time of year and on our last day of sitting—more than 1,000 amendments to the goods and services tax legislation that we have already passed.</para><para>The amendments that we are considering in the Senate amend just about every aspect of the goods and services tax. This is from the Liberal-National Party coalition—supported by the Australian Democrats—who claimed that this was to simplify Australia's tax system. We passed the goods and services tax bills, and here we are, a few months later,
 putting forward hundreds of amendments to that package. Of course, there is one amendment that is missing in the package we are considering, and that is an amendment to remove the exemption from the goods and services tax from casino high rollers. The package we are considering reflects the policy of the Liberal-National parties. Regrettably, the GST bills were agreed to and passed this Senate through a deal with the Australian Democrats.</para><para>There have been a number of claims made about the goods and services tax. I do not wish to roll out all of the claims made by the Liberal-National parties, but a number of them include claims that it will create jobs, that it will tax the cash economy, that it will improve employment, that it will improve savings by taxing consumption, that it will remove a tax from exporters, and that the GST will simplify the tax system. That last claim is about the most fantastic claim of them all.</para><para>Time does not allow me to go into many of the claims made by the Liberal-National parties, but the issue I want to touch on today is this issue of simplification of the tax system and the related difficulties the GST will cause business. As I said earlier, the very fact that we are already considering more than 1,000 amendments to the goods and services tax package that was passed a few months ago is an indication that the GST is a far from simple tax. When considering the amendments, we need to understand that the GST is a tax at each level of production, distribution and sale of goods or services. A GST is levied on the value added at that level. The seller is liable for the whole GST to that point, less the tax already paid by the previous sellers. For this reason, its collection is particularly onerous.</para><para>To collect the GST is bureaucratic. It involves a great deal of paperwork. In particular, this places a significant burden on small business. Small business is one of the big losers with a GST because, as is well known, the GST will replace the wholesale sales tax.

There will be well over 1.4 million new tax collection points as a result of the GST, and these will overwhelmingly be small business. Small business will have to pay the administrative costs associated with the collection of the GST. Of course, you do have to subtract from that the paltry $200 payment that the Liberal-National parties will be paying to small businesses to assist in its collection.</para></talk.start><para>We have already seen commentary from informed quarters about the cost of the GST to small business. Recently an article by Tom Allard, who is an economics correspondent, examined the Australian Taxation Office's requirements for the collection of GST information. He spoke to a number of tax people and the comment was that, for small business in particular, many of whom do not have computerised business systems, the collection of the GST:</para><para>". . . will be like doing your annual tax return every month or every quarter," said Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu tax partner, Mr John Cohen. "If you have all the information on hand, it will take an hour or two. If you have to go chasing it up, that will mean you are looking at a day or longer."</para><para>A day or longer for small business to collect the GST!</para><para>Apparently the instruction document from the tax office amounts to some 130 pages.</para><para>A 130-page instruction booklet! This is from an informed correspondent.</para><para>There has been a survey of small business. The average cost to a small business to prepare for the GST will be $3,500. That is the average cost. That is a significant amount of money for small business operators. Obviously the paltry $200 that this government is offering to small business goes nowhere near meeting that average cost of $3,500 for small business.</para><para>I want to touch on a point that Senator Knowles raised in her contribution. She made the point about having been a small business operator and small business having to pay a variety of taxes. She pointed out quite rightly that small business has to pay payroll tax, superannuation guarantee contributions, workers compensation taxes and a range of other charges. She was quite right. But what has happened with the introduction of the GST? The GST is not replacing payroll tax. Remember the argument we used to get from this government that payroll tax should be abolished? Well, businesses are still going to be paying payroll tax and the significant other taxes that they have to pay. But, in addition to those taxes that Senator Knowles referred to, they are going to have to pay a GST—a whacking great new tax on top of the taxes they already pay. What is even worse, as I have already outlined, is that the paperwork involved in a GST is much more significant than the paperwork for the other taxes that they currently have to collect and/or pay.</para><para>It seems to me that it is very hard to argue that the goods and services tax is leading to a simplification of the current tax system. We are dealing with hundreds of new amendments. It is going to make life a lot tougher for most businesses. For large businesses it
 will not be so bad. They have computerised stock systems where they can calculate their sales very easily. But small business operators, many of whom do not have computerised systems, will have to either purchase them or struggle on collecting the tax and carrying out the calculations without computer hardware and software. So it is not too bad for big business, but it is really going to hurt small business.</para><para>The GST has been referred to by the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, as the new tax for a new century. He has contended that it is going to streamline Australia's tax system. But I draw the Senate's attention to some interesting figures that were calculated by my colleague Mr Emerson—a member in the other place—at the point in time when we had 756 amendments to the goods and services tax legislation. Mr Emerson calculated that the GST acts previously weighed 4.2 kilograms but that, with the addition of 756 amendments, the GST tax acts now weigh 4.4 kilograms. And we have to add roughly another 200 grams on top of that, given the other 300 or 400-odd amendments we have received since Mr Emerson kindly carried out his last calculations. Also, the sheer volume of new tax legislation that we are considering does not include the regulations that will need to be made and we are yet to see.</para><para>The government has consistently—and falsely—argued that this is all simplification. The fact of the matter is that, in terms of size and weight, the Income Tax Act has not got any smaller or simpler. The GST is a big new tax, adding more pages to the tax act. You could stack all of Australia's tax acts next to me and they would go over my head.

In the last few weeks the Senate not only has been bombarded with hundreds of amendments to the goods and services tax legislation but also has had a number of controversies involving the introduction of the goods and services tax. I have touched on one area already—the cost to small business—but we have also had controversy over the taxation of club membership, the taxation of charities and the issue of a tax on a tax. The GST will apply to a range of state services and those states supply state taxes; so we will have a tax on a tax.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With respect to charities, the debate has been raging in considerable detail and very fiercely over the last few weeks, and it is here that I want to make some criticism of the Australian Democrats. Suffice it to say, of course, we would not have a GST without the Prime Minister Mr Howard going back on his `never ever' commitment. But the other partner in this `tax adventure'—as the Prime Minister once referred to it as—is the Australian Democrats. Without the Australian Democrats, this country would not have a GST. What I find a little disturbing—aside from the fact that the Democrats supported the GST package—are two significant issues that have arisen in respect of the GST. We debated one earlier this week, and that was the diesel fuel rebate issue. The Australian Democrats signed an agreement with the government that said that the diesel fuel rebate for the forest industry would be reduced. The government walked away from that agreement, and the Democrats did not stand them up. The Democrats did not say to the government, `You signed up to the deal; you keep it.'</para><para>As Senator McGauran wanders around the chamber, he is reminding me that this highlighted a failure of the National Party. They allowed the coalition to sign up to an agreement that reduced the diesel fuel rebate to the forest industry workers in this country. That was clearly to the disadvantage of people who work in forest industries in rural and regional
 areas. But that is all I am going to say about the National Party because, frankly, their input into taxation—in fact, into most areas of policy—is so minor we really do not need to spend a great deal of time on them.</para><para>I return to the Australian Democrats. I have mentioned the diesel fuel rebate issue. But we have heard a lot from the Australian Democrats in the last few months about charities and the dreadful impact of the GST on charities. I am glad Senator Woodley is in the chamber today because, quite clearly, there are major problems for charities with the goods and services tax. There are major problems with the cost of collection and the definition of the services and sales offered by charities. This will obviously impose additional paperwork and additional cost and affect the service delivery of charities. What annoys me about the position of the Australian Democrats is that we have had a number of public comments in recent weeks from the Australian Democrats, saying that this is bad news for charities, that the GST and its application requires change and that it should not be hurting charities.</para><para>I ask the Senate: why did the Democrats sign up to the deal they did with the government on the GST? Why did they sign up to the deal? It was not as though the problems that charities were going to experience with a goods and services tax were not well known. We had pages and pages—hours of evidence—from charities before the Senate committees on the adverse impact of the GST. The Democrats were there, but did they listen? Did they stand this government up when they carried out their negotiations in respect to the GST package? No. And yet after they have carried out their deal with the government, here we have the Democrats complaining and trying to unravel the problems they themselves already knew about. That is one aspect of this issue that makes me particularly angry. It is hypocritical. I do not use that word often in political debate. I think it is overused. But the Democrats heard the evidence, they knew the problems for charities, they did the deal with the government on the GST and then, afterwards, they make public statements about the need to change
 the arrangements for GST on charities. I call that hypocrisy.</para><para>I want to conclude my contribution by briefly referring to the issue of a tax on a tax. As I have said, the claim from this governement has been that there is going to be a simplification of the tax system. We are dealing with over 1,000 amendments to the GST legislation here today, a few months after the GST was first passed. There are the problems for small business: small businesses will be the new tax collectors, over a million of them; and they will do the extra paperwork. The tax acts are getting longer, not shorter. They are weighing more every day with each new amendment. It is getting more and more complex and yet we were expected to believe that this was the new, simple tax system for the new century.</para><para>I must say one word about Botswana. The Treasurer is fond of quoting Botswana. Botswana has a wholesale sales tax. It is one of the few countries that does have a wholesale sales tax. I point out to the Senate that Botswana has an enviable economic record. In terms of economic growth, it is usually the leader in Africa. So the allegation that the wholesale sales tax retards growth is just nonsense.</para><para>There is the issue of a tax on a tax, as well. That issue has not been resolved yet. State governments can impose various state taxes on a variety of services, particularly in the financial services area, and we are going to have the GST on top of those taxes—a tax on a tax. We were told that this was not going to happen, that we would have a simplification of the system and that we would not have taxes on taxes. But this is happening in a significant number of areas and has not yet been resolved.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>11645</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I, too, want to address the legislation which is before us. I will concentrate mainly on the GST and charities so that the chamber can be informed in this debate. I think that proper information is sadly lacking in this debate most of the time.</para></talk.start><para>We have heard all sorts of comments over the last few days about the impact of the GST on charities and also comments about the
 Charities Consultative Committee. Currently, charities enjoy sales tax exemption, at least in most cases. However, there are two deficiencies within the current system. Firstly, sales tax applies only to goods, not to services, yet many services are utilising goods on which tax was paid. The input tax credits available under the GST will apply to all goods and services and thereby the reform will be a benefit. Secondly, the sales tax exemption certificate captures only the sales tax immediately payable on the good. Yet research shows that up to 50 per cent of sales tax falls on goods used by businesses to create other goods and services. The sales tax exemption will not touch these embedded taxes. By contrast, the GST and its input tax credits will pick up embedded indirect taxes.</para><para>The GST does increase compliance costs for charities, and we have kept the pressure on the tax office to minimise that impost. Already the tax office has made considerable progress, as is outlined in the report of the Charities Consultative Committee, in terms of favourable rulings, direct financial assistance, updating the ATO web site and manuals, a three-stage training and education program and site visits by the ATO. The GST start-up office has allocated around $40 million in its direct assistance and $25 million through organisation delivered assistance to the charitable sector to assist with other start-up costs. When the free training, free manuals, site visits, web site updates and direct financial assistance are taken into account, the compliance costs faced by charities look considerably less than some of the more alarmist organisations have been claiming.</para><para>Australia is not the first country to have a VAT and to be grappling with the problem of how charities should interact with the indirect tax system. Virtually all OECD countries and governments have exempted charities. That means that charities do not collect VAT on their services but cannot collect input tax credits on their purchases either. This has the advantage of significantly reducing compliance costs for charities in terms of not lodging returns. However, it increases their costs in terms of purchasing goods without input tax credits. Only the UK and Canada have
 offered zero rating for charities and, in both countries, only on a limited range of activities. Most fundraising activities, for example, are VAT exempt rather than zero rated.</para><para>The approach proposed by the Australian government, to give them credit, has the widest reach of zero rating of any OECD country. In Canada and the UK, input taxing applies to a much wider range of revenue raising options than the Australian proposals, including membership fees, fundraising events, sponsorships and so forth. The government's original proposals would have left any major fundraising activities taxed. What was agreed between the Prime Minister and Senator Lees in June this year was that a Charities Consultative Committee would be set up and, by December this year, would provide some guidance to charities on what was in and what was out.</para><para>The committee finalised its work on 24 November. It has done a huge job of gathering the issues and concerns raised by charities and seeking to respond to them. The committee has been extremely open with its processes, publishing on the tax office web site the questions and answers that it has developed. I pay public tribute to the chair, deputy tax commissioner Rick Matthews and his tax office team for their enormous amount of work and their preparedness to listen and learn. The committee has been very much a two-way process, with the tax office learning about charities and charities learning from the tax office about the GST.</para><para>I also pay tribute to the other members of the committee nominated by the charities and churches. They are Peter Davidson of ACOSS, Father Brian Lucas of the Catholic Church, Paul Bird of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, John Hodge of the Salvation Army, Patrick McLure of Mission Australia, John Landau and Janet Kahler of ACROD, Marion Reilly of the Community Housing Federation, and Chris Thorpe of St John's Ambulance. I particularly acknowledge the work of Associate Professor Miles McGreggor-Lowndes of the Program on Non-profit Corporations at the Queensland University of Technology. He was nominated to the committee as an independent expert by the Democrats. Professor
 McGreggor-Lowndes has made a huge contribution to improving the two-way flow of information between the tax office and the charitable sector. I think his contribution has already been immense and will continue to be so.</para><para>The tax office has been extremely accommodating of the charities within the confines of the legislation as it stands. The rulings which have come through the process have sought as much as possible to keep charities out of the GST net in addressing over 300 questions raised by the charities. Most of them were resolved in this process. I hope that a lot of the disinformation being peddled around the charitable sector, often by people who should know better, will be put to bed when the charities receive the full briefing from the tax office next year. I appeal to the Labor Party not to use and manipulate the well-intentioned honorary officials of the charities for their own political purpose.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—Don't you do it!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—We should all be working for the best possible deal for charities rather than scoring political points.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—That's what you're doing.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—Then again, I do not expect much from Labor.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—You sold out the Australian charities in the community.

If the RSPCA could not attract Labor's sympathy in government, what hope have charities for honest and fair dealings from Labor now? But I digress.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As a direct result of the information fed to the tax office through the committee, I am pleased that the government has comprehensively responded to all the issues raised by the consultative committee. The major conces
 sion is in relation to non-profit sub-entities, allowing non-profit entities greater structural flexibility with regard to GST registration. Many charitable organisations have numerous divisions, branches or committees that do not meet the definition of an entity in the GST act. The amendments will allow certain non-profit entities to treat separately identifiable units of their organisations as though they were separate entities for GST purposes. To be considered a non-profit sub-entity, the branch must maintain an independent system of accounting, be separately identifiable by activity or location from other parts of the entity and be referred to in the entity's records as a sub-entity for tax purposes.</para><para>Sub-entities will not be required to register for the GST if they have taxable income of $100,000 or less once the amendment agreed between the Democrats and the government is made to this bill today. This is a much more generous  treatment than the $100,000 threshold for not-for-profit entities as a whole. It allows an entity to be divided several times to utilise several $100,000 thresholds. The sub-entity provisions will allow many volunteer organisations with low overheads but fairly extensive fundraising to move right outside the GST net. Within a church organisation, for example, such as St Vincent de Paul, they will allow each individual branch or chapter to be separately registered, dramatically reducing the impost of the GST on that organisation.</para><para>It should be remembered that the $100,000 threshold is not a total turnover for an organisation. Rather, it is the net after subtracting all GST-free and GST-exempt supplies. That includes sales of second-hand goods; any raffles or bingo; any goods sold for less than 75 per cent of their direct cost; the provision of housing; any goods that fall within the health, education and aged care or child-care exclusions; and the income of a school tuckshop. It is a very significant concession, which the Democrats are pleased to support. It also has the widest zero rating of charitable activities of any OECD country and a very generous exemption option that goes beyond those of Canada and the UK.</para><para>As a result of the final report of the Charities Consultative Committee, a number of other significant issues were raised. I have spent the last three days discussing with the Treasurer the government's response. The government has agreed to soften the test for determining what supplies by a charity are non-commercial and therefore GST free. The committee identified major problems with the market value test proposed by the government, making the other test, referring to the total cost of providing the service, more important.</para><para>The law as it stands says that a good is non-commercial if it is sold for less than 50 per cent of its total cost. As a result of discussions today with the Democrats, the government will be moving to increase this benchmark to 75 per cent. That means, for example, that if a charity has a membership fee of $75 a year and it costs $100 per year per member to service those members, the whole membership will be GST free. This is a major concession that will leave most of the core activities of a charity GST free. In addition to that, the Treasurer will seek a more generous ruling from the tax office to ensure that journals and newsletters not commercially sold are GST free.</para><para>Charities will also be able to claim input tax credits for reimbursing the cost of volunteers. The 30 per cent of charities with non-standard accounting periods will still remit GST quarterly rather than monthly, reducing compliance costs. Government grants to charities will be increased by a full 10 per cent for the GST without any discount for unproven cost savings. Financial supplies within charitable or church groups, for example loans to schools, will be GST free. The tax office will provide a lenient approach to dealing with not-for-profit entities in the first year, with a dedicated section within the tax office for the not-for-profit sector.</para><para>The Charities Consultative Committee will continue in existence to oversee the implementation of the GST across the sector and to deal with any further issues raised by charities. The government will further discuss with the Democrats a two stage inquiry into the tax treatment of charities in the new year, com
 mencing with a review of the legal definition of `charities' by the Australian Law Reform Commission. That issue has yet to be finalised.</para><para>I wish to commend the government on its preparedness to deal with the issues raised by the Charities Consultative Committee in such a constructive and comprehensive manner. When we set up the committee in June, it was with the intention of sorting out the real, rather than the imagined, problems charities are having with the GST. The committee has been a huge success in terms of getting favourable rulings out of the tax office, favourable policy changes out of the government, and a better understanding of the entire system among charities. Charities will now be able to structure their affairs in the way that best suits them, either taking advantage of the generous zero rating or the generous GST exemption balancing lower compliance costs against the collection of input tax credits.</para><para>The government has, to its credit, responded well to the problems identified by the committee. Continuing the good work of the committee is essential to the smooth implementation of the GST with the lowest possible impact on the charitable sector. The Democrats will be supporting the amendments to be moved by the government to these bills later today. We will also continue to support the work of the Charities Consultative Committee and monitor the impact of the GST on charities and will raise any new problem areas with the government as needed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>11648</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This legislation has been around the parliament for a number of years.

That has been recognised by the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, ACOSS, the peak bodies and many other service providers. That is why they support the general principle of the GST.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have to recognise, as most of these people have recognised, that if we are going to support the underprivileged, the people who require special services, we must have a new way of taxing in Australia.

If we do not take this big step into the future, then we will certainly not be able to provide the benefits that are required to sustain the underprivileged. That is what this debate is all about.

I think the wholesale sales tax was brought in to fund some programs just before the last war. It has been sustained and kept here and from time to time increased. It
 certainly does not meet the needs of the present day.

If they are any good, we can give them a run.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>11649</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—Thank you, Senator Boswell, for some very positive remarks. Senator Boswell drew attention—he
 is not the first person in this chamber to draw attention to this fact—to the total lack of policies from the Labor Party on the issue of tax reform. It is astonishing that the Labor Party could have travelled this distance and have no known or discernible policy on tax reform.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to respond to a number of the other issues which have been raised during the second reading debate. The truth of the matter is that the opposition have barely touched on the content of this legislation but rather have used the second reading debate as a time for a bit of a rant on the new tax reforms that we have put into place. They have taken the opportunity to further scaremonger and spread inaccuracies. It really has been a very poor performance by the opposition. I do not know what anyone can do to assist an opposition that has adopted a no policy position. The fact of the matter is that they have comprehensively failed to talk about the substance of the legislation. They have even failed to mention the alternatives. They have brought the Second XI into the chamber, unfortunately. They show so much interest in this legislation that we have to put up with the inane comments of Senator Schacht and his colleagues.</para><para>The Labor Party continue to strongly support, as we understand, the wholesale sales tax which taxes goods at 12, 22, 32, 37, 41 and 45 per cent. It is a cascading tax which is embedded in the price of most goods we buy. Labor senators failed to mention that the GST will remove between $7 and $8 billion a year from business costs because it is not a tax on business like the wholesale sales tax. As my colleague Senator Boswell put so well, they mentioned nothing of the substance of their own policies, nor did they mention their generally appalling record, noticeably increasing the wholesale sales tax after the 1993 budget, after running an election campaign which said that taxes would not have to rise. Of course, then they removed the l-a-w law tax cuts.</para><para>The Labor opposition are also complaining about the fact that the government is consulting on the new tax system and amending it to address legitimate concerns. Frankly, we are
 a consultative government; we work with people and we are happy to listen to people. We certainly learnt the lesson which the Keating Labor government never learnt; that is, you have to get out and talk to people and listen to people.</para><para>The Labor opposition have constantly complained about this legislation but they show no interest in it. All they can do is send Senator Schacht. I do not even know whether Senator Schacht is in the B team. He is more likely to be in the C team in the Labor opposition—so I hear from his colleagues.</para><para>As government members have mentioned, the government has been involved in an extensive consultation process. It has involved a broad cross-section of industry and community sector representatives, the states, the territories, the tax office and the Commonwealth departments. Through this process, we have assessed the finetuning required to ensure that the GST is implemented in the most effective way. These bills include amendments that the government considers necessary to provide a smooth transition to the new tax system, and I will briefly remind the Senate of the main points. As announced by the Treasurer, we are extending the cash basis for accounting for the GST by doubling the existing cash accounting threshold to $1 million. The government will also provide special rules for retailers, with a mixture of taxable and GST-free supplies, so that the commissioner will be able to determine alternative, simpler methods of calculating GST liability for retailers selling such goods. Both of these measures are very good news for small business.</para><para> The government has also listened to the constructive suggestions of the ATO's charities consultative group and is extending the definition of `non-commercial suppliers of residential accommodation by charities'. The market value and cost of supply tests will be extended for the non-commercial suppliers of residential accommodation by charities from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. The government has also listened to the view that the ACCC's price exploitation powers do not cover situations where prices are unfairly increased prior to 1 July 2000. To put the issue beyond any
 doubt, this bill will amend the Trade Practices Act 1975 to ensure that the ACCC's  powers enable it to take immediate action in respect of any unreasonable price rises before 1 July 2000, in addition to its post-1 July 2000 powers.</para><para> The government also proposes a number of amendments relating to the application of GST and state deregulated insurance schemes; in particular, amendments to simplify the application of GST to workers compensation and compulsory third-party insurance. The bills also propose an amendment removing the value of any state stamp duty from the calculation of GST on insurance premiums. The bill contains amendments to make sure that the domestic telecommunications industry is not put at a competitive disadvantage to foreign competitors because of the GST. The Treasurer announced on 19 August that there would be an immediate income tax deduction for small and medium sized businesses for expenditure incurred in acquiring or upgrading plant or software to prepare for the GST, and we will be moving amendments to that effect.</para><para>The treatment of general insurance has also been simplified by these bills. Included in this package of bills is the new pay as you go system, which will be more commonly known as the PAYG. PAYG will be a single, comprehensive, modern collection system that will replace outdated income tax collection systems. PAYG will take advantage of the opportunities provided by the GST and the business activity statement. The new system will reduce compliance costs by removing uncertainty and reducing the amount of paperwork and the number of payment dates.</para><para> Full details of the measures in the bills are contained in the respective explanatory memorandums. As honourable senators will be aware, the  A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill 1999  was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for consideration. The committee's report highlighted concerns raised by organisations that a provision in the endorsement of deductible gift recipient measures in the same way prevents the use of funds for fundraising expenses and administration costs. This is
 simply not the case. The measure is intended to formalise the existing requirement that deductible gifts be used only for the purposes covered by the law in order that the original gifts attract tax deductions.</para><para>As clearly set out in the explanatory memorandum, at paragraph 6.16, the principal purpose of a fund includes purposes incidental to the fund. This includes certain ancillary costs such as cross-subsidisation of administration and fundraising activities. It is stating the obvious that there is no fund without fundraising activities. I am advised that the Commissioner of Taxation is preparing a public ruling to this effect. The ruling will be issued for comment soon after the legislation has been passed. I commend these bills to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bills read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that consideration of these bills in committee of the whole be made an order of the day for a later hour.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>11651</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title><page.no>11651</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Referral</title><page.no>11651</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>11651</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand that earlier today consideration of Senator Bartlett's notice of motion was adjourned to a later hour. In the meantime the opposition and, I understand, the other parties in the Senate have had an opportunity to consider their positions on this proposed reference to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee.</para></talk.start><para> Ordinarily we would have some concern given that the notice of motion was introduced only yesterday and it is being debated on the very next day without the opportunity for the Senate committee to consider the proposed terms of reference. But, equally, we understand that, given that today is the last sitting day for this session and the need to determine this matter expeditiously, it is appropriate that we try to finalise it today.</para><para> The opposition have considered the proposed reference and indicate that we are prepared to support the reference, provided the terms are amended to exclude the specific references in paragraphs (a) and (b) in the notice of motion. To that effect, I have circulated an amendment, which is on sheet 1687. I move:</para><para>Omit all words after "7 March 2000".</para><para>For the record, if our amendment were to be carried the motion would read:</para><para>That the provisions of the Northern Prawn Fishery Amendment Management Plan 1999 (No NPF 02) made under the <inline font-style="italic">Fisheries Management Act 1991</inline>  and tabled in the Senate on 24 November 1999, be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 7 March 2000.</para><para>The original notice of motion, as moved by Senator Bartlett, went on to make particular reference to:</para><para>(a) the impact of the plan on the environmental sustainability of the Northern Prawn Fishery and overall fishing effort; and</para><para>(b) the likely impact on the viability of existing prawn trawler operators and whether the plan will favour larger commercial operators.</para><para>Our amendment would remove those particular references. The purpose of our amendment is that, in considering what particular matters the committee should look at when it examines this instrument, it is clear that the various parties likely to appear before the committee would wish to raise a number of issues not necessarily limited to the matters contained in Senator Bartlett's notice of motion. Further, the terminology is not necessarily such that we agree with all aspects of the way in which those particular references have been put forward.</para><para>I understand also that the government was considering some alternative wording. We ourselves were looking at alternative wording, but in the end the most appropriate course is to do as we invariably do with references of legislation or instruments such as a regulation to a Senate legislation committee and that is to refer the bill or the instrument for inquiry and report. The committee is quite competent to understand and determine what the key issues will be, arising from the written evidence and the evidence put to the committee
 at public inquiry. On that basis, it is appropriate to refer the matter as I have outlined.</para><para>We do acknowledge that some aspects of the particular issues that Senator Bartlett's motion drew attention to are important, such as sustainability for both the environment and the industry. The impact upon the stakeholders in the industry is also an important aspect. Whether the processes that have been undertaken to date—and the decision of AFMA to introduce new controls—have been properly followed is an issue the committee would most likely look at. There has been an examination of the AFMA decision by his honour, Justice Toohey, and clearly that is a matter that the committee would have some regard to and need to look at. The impact upon particular regional centres in Australia would also be something that would be raised. Rather than try to spell all that out in detailed terms of reference, we think it is appropriate to amend the notice of motion. The committee will give its full consideration to all issues raised by those appearing before it and report once it has concluded the processes of the inquiry. I seek the Senate's support for this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>11652</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to indicate on behalf of the government that we are prepared to accept the amendment which Senator Forshaw has moved.

It is an issue of some debate in parts of the country, including my own state of Queensland, both from those that are concerned about certain aspects of the plan and those that are strongly supportive of it. I welcome the support of all parties in the chamber for the opportunity for the Senate to actually examine the issue in sufficient detail in an area such as this where we are given the legislative authority to be able to consider and disallow or otherwise plans such as this. We have that authority, and when the community raises concerns it is appropriate for us to give consideration through the processes of the Senate. With an issue such as this, it is much more appropriately done through a committee inquiry, which allows consideration of the issues which is hopefully less political and heated than debates in the chamber can be. I think it will be useful from that point of view of ensuring that community concerns are considered and heard.</para></talk.start><para>From the Democrats' point of view, I think it is worth emphasising that we have not got a position of having decided to support any disallowance at all. Our focus will be particularly on ensuring the environmental sustainability of the fishery. Some argue very strongly that this new amended plan enhances the sustainability of the fishery. That will be an issue that we will be looking at closely in relation to the inquiry. But I do think it is important that there is an opportunity for community voices to be heard in relation to the issue. It therefore puts a requirement on
 those who have a concern about the plan as amended to put forward their concerns and their views in detail and have them tested by a Senate committee giving proper consideration to all aspects of the matter. So it is simply a mechanism to ensure that the views of all sides on this particular issue, which has been an ongoing one, are able to be given consideration in as clear a way as possible.</para><para>Again, I emphasise that, from the Democrats' perspective, we have no finalised view about the adequacy or otherwise of the plan, and that is indeed the purpose of enabling the Senate as a whole to have an examination of it through the Senate committee process. I welcome the support of all parties for going down this procedural path and ensuring that there is that opportunity for community views to be heard. I hope that as part of that process the final stage in relation to the development of this plan, which is consideration of it by a house of parliament if it chooses, would address the issue in a more complete sense.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Sherry)</name></talker><para>—The question is that the amendment put forward by Senator Forshaw be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>11653</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I register my support for the motion.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—The question now is that the motion, as amended, be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>11653</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>11653</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>11653</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—On behalf of Senator Greig and pursuant to standing order 78, I give notice that, at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting, Senator Greig will withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in the name of Senator Greig for 14 sitting days after today for the disallowance of the Northern Prawn Fishery Amendment Management Plan 1999 (No.

I will get this on the record because it does underscore quite importantly why we adopt the position we do. The press release continues:</para><para>Melbourne based Pitcher Partners, which deals mostly with businesses turning over between $1 million and $20 million a year, said the increase in insolvencies could begin early in the new year and peak in the second half of 2000. `There will be a general uncertainty arising from the unknown consumer reaction to the introduction of a GST,' the firm's managing partner, Tim Jonas, said in a statement. `It is possible that consumers will withdraw their spending temporarily or change their spending habits by, for example, spending available cash on new cars because of predicted savings.'</para><para>The new pay as you go tax system to be announced on July 1 2000 would also cause problems for companies that had not planned ahead for a duplication of payments caused when the old and new systems overlap. Mr Jonas said he thought businesses in the overheated building and construction industry `where a number of small businesses have grown into big businesses with big commitments' would be hardest hit. `As these
 operators take advantage of the buoyant times, many are failing to keep an eye on management and costing issues,' he said. `When the bubble bursts, the combination of cashflow problems and the demands of the PAYG system could tip many businesses over the edge,' Mr Jonas said.</para><para>It is worth emphasising that last comment:</para><para>`When the bubble bursts, the combination of cashflow problems and the demands of the PAYG system could tip many businesses over the edge,' Mr Jonas said.</para><para>As I said, we are not going to oppose this legislation but we have some anxieties about it. The expression of view by Mr Jonas, from a responsible firm expert in dealing with business accounting particularly for businesses with turnovers between $1 million and $20 million a year—that is, typically small business—is not an idle voice in this debate. He is a person in a position of expertise and authority when it comes to the needs of small business and we want to register concern about the legislation and our anxiety about it.</para><para>At this stage we will be committed to keeping a watching brief.

That brief is coming down and as soon as it comes into my hands I will provide you with the answers. I had the remarks that you made to the Senate analysed by my advisers. You fooled me, Senator: I thought you were going to ask me a question on it in question time. I was ready to respond to you at 2 o'clock today, but the folder has now gone up.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Temporary Chairman, I can now assist Senator West. Senator West was concerned about a variety of questions, but one of the principal ones was: will farmers have to distinguish between GST-free sales of wheat to the Australian Wheat Board? The short answer is no. In detail, all sales of wheat by farmers to the Australian Wheat Board will be taxable. It is only sales made by the AWB to overseas buyers that will be GST free. Sales by the farmer to the AWB are not export sales, even though the AWB will export some of the wheat. The Wheat Board is the exporter, not the farmer.</para><para>The Wheat Board will be entitled to claim input tax credits for the GST included in the amount paid to farmers. Farmers will be able to claim input tax credits for all their business inputs, regardless of whether their sales of wheat were taxable or GST free. If the Wheat Board loans money to farmers, there will be no GST payable by the farmer in respect of the loan payment. When payment for wheat is made by the Wheat Board, that is the time that the farmer who operates on a cash basis will account for the GST.</para><para>With regard to the farmers operating on an accruals basis, the Australian Taxation Office is working with the industry to determine a time at which the GST liability will arise. Just to round off your comments, sales of wheat
 that were delivered prior to 1 July 2000 but where payment is received after 1 July 2000 will not be subject to the GST. That probably covers the questions that you raised.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>11656</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That answers a lot of the questions that I raised.

I tried to make the distinction in the same manner that the minister has now made. By an inclination of his head, he nodded in the affirmative to confirm the explanation.

If the farmers were direct exporters, they would be zero rated for their exports. But the exporter is the Wheat Board. This arrangement is what the farmers want. This arrangement is well known to the National Farmers Federation, and it is an arrangement which they want. Farmers want the cash flow which comes from this sale. The farmers sell the wheat to the Wheat Board, the Wheat Board pays the GST and the farmers get the cash flow benefit. This is actually what they want.

I notice the figure of $65 million extra to the charitable sector has been mooted by the government, and I will be looking to a breakdown of that figure so that this committee can understand what exactly is meant by that. I say to the Democrats here and now: this is the opportunity to do the right thing by the non-government sector, including charities, sporting groups, environmental organisations, indigenous groups and
 social welfare groups not strictly classified as charities—people representing the dispossessed, the poor, the disadvantaged and those value systems that are not to the fore in this age of materialism.</para><para>The opportunity is here. We are on the last evening of the sittings for 1999. It would be a breakthrough for the Democrats to get back to their original bailiwick and their original constituency and to take this opportunity. This amendment I put forward is not just an amendment; it is a challenge to the Democrats to do the right thing by their constituency. I noted that at least one poll during the week found that 35 per cent of Democrat voters approved of the GST. What a situation we are in here this evening where the opportunity to get back to that constituency, at least as far as community groups are concerned, is now before the Democrats.

I think advisers are vanishing out of the chamber on either side.</para></talk.start></continue><para> While that is under way, I have before me a draft form for a business activity statement that is being issued, as I understand it, by the Australian Taxation Office as part of the advice to small business on what type of compliance requirements will come to them as a result of the GST being imposed. It is a two-page form and, in itself, appears as simple as any government form ever does—which is to say that it is exceedingly complicated. It appears that the questions are almost banal but, unless you know the technical meaning of some of the questions, the questions are loaded. However, I draw the attention of the chamber to this draft business activity statement form that business would be required to comply with, which has been issued by the Australian Taxation Office. The purpose of my doing so is that what accompanies this form is this document, which goes to 136 pages. This document is the draft business activity statement instructions and this is the form you have to fill out, but there are 136 pages that you ought to be familiar with, to know about, in order to be able to fill out the form.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—Everybody is going to love it!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—Exactly! I will take that interjection. I think irony is in use here: everyone is actually going to hate it. I think you were being an ironist, if I may say, Senator Brown, in your interjection. My mind is taken back to 1996. One of the platforms that the Howard government ran on in that election was that they would cut red tape and compliance costs for small business. We do know that, as a result of that pledge, some effort was made. But the end result was that, irrespective of what the government claimed, small business organisations representing the users—that is, the small business organisations speaking for their members—compl
 ained. They conducted surveys and then brought down results that showed that the actual burden of red tape would increase significantly under the government.</para></talk.start></continue><para> Here we have what looks to be, as I have described it, a fairly simple form, but you have to become au fait with an encyclopaedia of instructions in order to comply with it. Not only does that kill the election promise stone dead but that was dead anyway; it seems to be an excessive amount of extra work that small business needs to undertake as part of meeting the compliance requirements of this tax. The relevant question to bear in mind here is the nature of small business. The scarcest resource in a small business is time. Most small businesspeople are, characteristically, overpressed and complete the formal compliance with tax and other requirements by state and local government, as well as the Commonwealth government, after the close of normal business hours in what is regarded as their spare time. They do it at night or they get up early in the morning or take time out of family activities in order to comply. The biggest complaint by small business is that overheads are killing them and the filling in of forms is turning them into clerks delegated to do work for the government rather than small business entrepreneurs turning their attention to their core business activity and spending the time and energy that they need to to promote their businesses.</para><para>We know there is a high bankruptcy rate among small business, that there is a high failure rate and that people who start out idealistically as entrepreneurs quickly come face to face with the harsh reality of a competitive, cutthroat business climate. In those circumstances, one has to be sympathetic to their needs in order to give them the elbow room to go about their core business activity. Minister, this is my question: is it necessary to have 136 pages of business activity statement instructions in order to fill out a two-page form? Isn't there some better way in which the Australian Taxation Office can provide an outreach service so small businesses are not turned into clerks for the government, perpetually filling out forms and unable to give their attention to their core business?
 If the tax office has not been provided with sufficient funds to do so, will you ensure that it is provided with sufficient funds and that the sham of an easy compliance tax—the so-called friendly tax, the so-called simple tax—is removed as a burden on the back of many of the productive assets in this nation, that is, the small business sector?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>11667</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are always delighted when you stand up and support small business because you would have to say that for 13 years the Labor Party went missing in action supporting small business.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—What did you do to small business with superannuation?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—Superannuation is booming.

This is quite an important amendment. We have moved it before and it has been rejected in this chamber before. It was, I thought, cynically defeated by the Australian Democrats. Senator Woodley almost laughingly rejected this amendment in the committee stage the last time we debated GST bills by simply labelling it a Labor stunt. If this is the Democrats' idea of a Labor stunt, they are sorely misguided. They do not appreciate the anger and annoyance that Australians have about trying to understand this dog's breakfast of a tax. The Democrats are not prepared to provide the necessary transparency for consumers to know how much tax they are paying. The amendment, if carried—I commend it to the chamber—will provide that the tax is shown on the docket that announces the price of the good or the service.</para></talk.start><para>I want to spend a moment persuading the chamber why this amendment should be adopted. The first and fundamental point is the right of ordinary Australians and the right of consumers to know what the price of the good or service is. At the moment we have a dog's breakfast: some things are in and some things are out. In the government's original bill, education and health were excluded. Now many more things are excluded. Knowing
 where the borderline is between what is in and what is out is always a question of uncertainty. I gave in my speech on the second reading the example of bottled mineral water—if it comes in a bottle it is exempted but if it comes in a cask it is not. You cannot expect consumers in Australia to wander around the supermarket with a trolley on Saturday morning, kids in tow, knowing all the complexity and shopping according to a perfect understanding of what is in and what is out of this tax. The first argument in merit as to why this provision should be agreed to is that it would enable people to know what is in and what is out. It would prevent shonky operators from pretending that things that are out are in and arguing that those price rises are due to the tax. That is the advantage of transparency—that it is the right of consumers to know.</para><para>The first part of this argument goes to helping consumers appreciate and understand what is in and what is out. That is a very confusing issue in this dog's breakfast of a tax. We will have then exposed a safeguard against shonky operators pretending that they can just jack up prices willy-nilly, arguing that it is a consequence of the tax when it is not. My only conception of why people would oppose it on this ground is that they want to protect the shonky operators, that they want to deny the public's right to know or that they are happy for the confusion that this generates to reign and are not prepared to take reasonable steps to put an end to it.</para><para>The second point I want to make is the right of taxpayers to know the amount of goods and services tax that they are paying. All of us who receive our wages and salaries with a wages and salaries slip are used to seeing what the gross amount of wage or salary is, what the level of tax deducted from that gross amount is and what the net level of income is. There is a requirement on those employers deducting instalments of taxation for wage and salaries earners to tell them by giving them each time they are paid a slip setting out what the tax level is.</para><para>That enables a wage or salary earner to see whether they are being taxed properly and, if they are not, to raise the matter, and not wait
 until the end of the year, when they file a tax return, to have to then pay a tax bill because they were undertaxed during the year and they are suddenly hit out of the blue with a big demand from the tax office to pay within 30 days a sum that they did not anticipate. Or, even worse, there could be a situation where more than the required tax has been paid, that is to say, more of the money they were entitled to receive was taken away from them by the tax office and the government has had the use of it for most of the year, not the wage earner, and has used funds belonging to the wage earner and is not paying those funds back with interest that ought to have been provided or with any appreciation of the inconvenience that has been created to the wage earner.</para><para>That is the situation that applies with respect to wages and salaries. Why can't we have the same degree of transparency when it comes to prices? I have to say that I can anticipate what the government is going to say. In the normal sneering and dismissive way that we have come to see as an institution from the Assistant Treasurer, we are going to be asked, `What about the wholesale sales tax?' The point is that this is a tax on the end product of the good or the service. It is a retail tax, and it is a tax that can be shown simply. An embedded tax is much harder to calculate and more difficult to illustrate in the same way. This is not in that category. Therefore, consumers of goods and services should be able to at least be given those particular figures.</para><para>We know that in the transitional phase of the introduction of a GST there are going to be unauthorised price hikes. A shopper that can compare the price of the good or service before the GST with the price after the GST is a shopper able to be discriminating and to spot the rorts and report them to the ACCC. We know the ACCC are underfunded. We know of their inability to provide against the wholesale exploitation that will be undertaken by unscrupulous price setters—cloaked by the transition phase of the introduction of the GST—whose activities will not be able to be detected because there are insufficient inspectors to do so.</para><para>We know that they have emphatically declined the opportunity to take the route in which they themselves run any sort of effective and comprehensive wholesale spot checking arrangement to ensure that what is occurring out there in consumer land conforms with the law. We know that the petty amount of funding the government has given the ACCC will be spent on a so-called education campaign, that is to say, `It is up to you to declare if you are offending'—a very unlikely situation. Why would someone who wants to use the confusion over the transition of the tax system suddenly be struck with an uncharacteristic degree of honesty and fess up to the ACCC that they are shonks?</para><para>We know the ACCC's modus operandi—considering the funds given to it by the government and the limitation on its ability to detect fraud, non-compliance and artificial price rigging—is to conduct an education campaign. I would like to believe that all Australians were honest. I know from my own experience that there are some shonks in our society. The ACCC is not equipped in these circumstances to deal with it.</para><para>I come back to the final argument that I want to put here, and I am glad that Senator Woodley is now in the chamber. The last time I put this argument to him he responded by saying, `This is just a Labor stunt.' Well, I can say this: tell the mounting number of confused Australian consumers out there that they are not entitled to know what the tax is. If the Democrat slogan for political life is `keep the bastards honest', why aren't the Democrats keeping the government honest by ensuring that there is consumer power, that individual consumers are empowered by knowing how much tax they are paying? Why is it that suddenly the `bastards' in this case—and I use that in parenthesis because it is a Democrat phrase—are not being kept honest?</para><para>The answer is that the Democrats are part of this plot—the Democrats have done this deal. It is a dirty deal. It is a deal that imposes a flat indirect tax on Australians that cannot be compensated for over the long term and which will make poor Australians worse off. The Democrats want to conceal the extent to which this occurs by voting down an
 amendment which would provide true and open transparency.</para><para>That is the reason, and that might be said to be a harsh judgment. If it is, I will be the first to remove the accusation and apologise. What will cause me to do that will be the Democrats exercising what they told the Australian people—keeping the bastards honest—and doing so on this occasion by voting for the amendment. If they do carry out what their slogan suggests that they exist to do, then I will say, `Look, I got you wrong, fellas—I am sorry about that. I apologise for it.'

But not once at any stage did they indicate that they were supporting your position or that they were prepared to argue against a GST that was not transparent. Where is the $4 million advertising campaign from those flunkeys now to say this hidden tax, the GST, is outrageous? The government made great play about all these hidden taxes and then the moment you get a chance to shine a torch onto the GST, what do you do? You run for cover and you vote it down.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Where are the Democrats—one of my favourite parties—on the question of transparency? They are demonstrating their bona fides on issues like transparency at the moment. A resolution has gone to the Democrats executive, a resolution that they tried to knock off and that they tried to say they did not want to have debated. They were going to rule it out on a whole variety of spurious grounds. Then someone pointed out to them the rules of their own organisation. They could not deny the motion to do with a poll of their membership on the GST package. Why are they hiding that?</para><para>We have seen the ballot for the leadership and that is fair enough. You had no choice; you had to do that. You tried to knock it out the first time, it did not work. The second time you had to have it. But the Democrats executive have said, `We are open and trans
 parent. We will hold a vote on the GST package. We couldn't do it last financial year. We couldn't do it before 30 June because time did not permit.' We are almost six months down the track and the Democrats executive have yet to circulate their motion about whether their membership supports the GST package. I guess six months is a long time to organise a petition. But no, they are in the middle of holding one at the moment.</para><para>It cannot be that hard to get a bit of transparency from the Democrats. If they were genuine about transparency—given that they are always saying that they are about, as Senator Cook so articulately put it, keeping the bastards honest—they would be doing two things: they would be putting this package to their membership and they would not be hiding from their membership. That is what they would be doing. They would be in this chamber supporting the transparency of the GST provisions.</para><para>The fact that the government wants to hide from the Australian public the GST impact on individual price dockets is no surprise. Those on the opposite side can run but cannot hide on this one, to borrow someone else's phrase, because the Australian public are more than awake to what is going on. They are awake to the GST. They are awake to the fact that clubs are charging for it already, that insurance companies are charging for it already and that prices are not going down like you claimed.</para><para>They know that car prices are not going down. We have had more reports in today's papers saying that car prices are not going down. They know that air fares have gone up when you told them that they had gone down. They already know—you cannot hide from this. Voting this amendment down, as you are indicating you are going to do, is not going to save you. It did not save Jeff Kennett. It did not save the Liberals. It did not save the Gippsland seat.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator McGauran interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—You laugh, Senator McGauran, but I would not be laughing if I was named McGauran and I mentioned Gippsland.

Wayne Goss once said that they were waiting for Paul Keating with baseball bats, sitting on their verandahs, and it would not matter how long it took. Jeff Kennett just found that and the coalition just found that. You are going to find that, because this brazen attempt to cover up the impact of the GST has already caught up with you at a federal level. You may say that they are just state results, but what happened in Holt?</para><para>A voter turned up in Holt and the bunting on the fence said `Vote against the Democrat GST'. What happened to the votes in Holt? You may say that it is a safe Labor seat, but the referendum was on the same day. The referendum itself could only poll 49 per cent. The Labor candidate polled 65 per cent. The coalition did not want to face the music on the GST. They did not turn up for the ballot. They did not say, `Let us have a bit of a referendum on the coalition.' No, they ran for cover. They did not even want to field a candidate. They did not want to have to face up to the first electoral test of the real impact of the GST.</para><para>You may ask: what happened to the Democrat vote? In similar circumstances when the coalition have chosen not to stand a candidate in an election, the Democrat vote has been between 20 and 25 per cent. You may say that that still does not sound like much, but this is in a safe Labor seat where you would not necessarily get a lot more for the coalition. So a reasonable and fair benchmark of the GST and the issues around the GST to do with transparency was the Holt by-election. What did the Holt by-election show? A six per cent primary swing to Labor and seven per cent two-party preferred. What did the Democrats get? What was the outcome for the Democrats in the Holt by-election? Was it 25 per cent? Was it 20 per cent? Was it 16 per cent? Was it 15 per cent? No, it was lower.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Tell us.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—I will tell you, Senator McGauran.

I wish to take a few moments to address the chamber on why the Senate should adopt these amendments. The first point is that the Australian Bureau of Statistics—interestingly, today, 9 December—published a series entitled <inline font-style="italic">Casinos</inline> . The accompanying news release said that the figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that the Australian casino industry recorded an operating profit before tax of $93 million during 1998-99. If we go to the actual document released by the ABS—<inline font-style="italic">Casinos</inline> , reference 8683.0—and to the summary of findings, under sources of income it is readily established what Senator Rod Kemp could never give as an answer to Kerry O'Brien—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">MACDONALD</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Senator Kerry O'Brien, please!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—Kerry O'Brien being the television commentator—in what is now the most infamous television interview that I think Senator Kemp has ever had the displeas
 ure to be associated with. Members of the Senate may recall that it was during the debate in the Senate on the GST. Kerry O'Brien, the television moderator, kept coming back to Senator Kemp and asking him the value of the high-roller rebate that the government was proposing to give. Now we have the statistics from no better source than the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In the summary of findings—under `Sources of income', where the figures are broken down—it is clear that the benefit of the high-roller rebate, according to the ABS, is $29 million. That is the benefit that this government wants to hand, with the compliance and connivance of the Australian Democrats, back to the casinos for the advantage of the high rollers.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Before we get too far into this debate, let us remind ourselves that a high roller, according to <inline font-style="italic">Casinos</inline>, is one of those gamblers in the big room who, on the turn of a dice, bets half a million dollars a throw. That is a high roller. There is competition between the casinos to attract international high rollers to gamble in Australian casinos.</para><para>In its original bill, the government did not provide that there would be any GST holiday for the high rollers. But, in its amendment that it introduced as we debated the original bill, it did provide a rebate for the high rollers, and that is the amendment that the Democrats supported, with the notable and noble exceptions of Senator Bartlett and Senator Stott Despoja. Now there is an opportunity for the two new senators from the Australian Democrats who have joined us in the Senate since that vote was conducted to establish their political careers from the ground up as not being intimidated by the casino bosses of this country and as being able to vote along with Senator Bartlett and Senator Stott Despoja and to stand with the Labor Party and say that high rollers should not be given a free run in this country, that they are the wealthy elites that should pay tax like the rest of us and that they should not be given this special advantage that the government is determined that they should get. And they should not be given it, especially given that, despite all that has been said—and there
 is more to come, I am sure—about what the Democrats have allegedly negotiated for charities as an exemption, charities will still have to pay the GST. The charities will still be in the GST net but the high rollers will be out of the net and they will not have to pay.</para><para>This is an important amendment because it is an amendment that addresses morality. It says, `Let the wealthy pay their tax and let'—as my future amendments will do—`the people in charities be given a chance to minister in the voluntary way that they do to the needs of recipients of charitable services in Australia. Let them do their job properly, but don't let the wealthy off.' This is an important amendment with regard to that, because it will not let the wealthy off.</para><para>What are we actually talking about here in real terms? The practice of Australian casinos is that, if you gamble in the high-rollers room and you lose, the Australian casinos, in order to keep your custom as a high-roller gambler, rebate up to 50 per cent of your losses—that is, at the end of the day when you clean your chips off the table, if you have suffered losses, they give you 50 per cent of your losses back so you do not lose too heavily—and, if you make a win, you do not have to pay that back to the casino. Casinos compete among themselves as to how much discount they give to their high rollers on their losses in order to attract the high-roller trade.</para><para>Does the working class person down at the pokies who has a substantial loss get a rebate? No, they do not. Do the mums and dads playing the keno wheel get a rebate? No, they do not. Do the ordinary Australians playing blackjack who have substantial losses get a rebate? No, they do not. But, if you are gambling half a million dollars a throw and you are a high roller, you do get a rebate if you lose your dough. We think that that ought not to be allowed as a practice in which there is no GST paid. As a consequence, our amendment will ensure that, if casinos want to conduct this practice for whatever commercial reasons, they still pay the full amount of GST on the losses. It would, in my submission to the Senate, be immoral if that was allowed not to be the case.</para><para>So there is an amendment before the chamber which addresses morality, and there is an opportunity for the Democrats—who have constantly said that their purpose in life is to keep the bastards honest—to keep the casinos and high rollers honest. I remind them that, according to the ABS today, the profit made by casinos in Australia last year was $93 million. There is obviously a desire by casinos to maximise their profit, but they ought to pay their full level of tax.</para><para>I want to come to a very serious part of this debate. The arguments I have canvassed are not new in this chamber—I have canvassed them before and my colleagues Senator Sherry and Senator Conroy have canvassed them powerfully as well. The argument now is whether or not the Democrats did or did not vote for the high-roller amendment when it was last before the chamber. The opportunity that is presented to the chamber now is to clear this up once and for all. What is certainly clear from the record is that Senator Bartlett and Senator Stott Despoja voted against the high-roller amendment, and I commend them for it. I hope they do so again, and I hope the two new Democrat senators join them. But what is disputed in this chamber—although, if one goes to the record, there is no dispute because the record is quite clear—is what in fact the Democrats did.</para><para>We knew when we voted for this last time that the government needed only one or two votes to win. But what happened was that four or five of the Democrats took what Senator Robert Ray accurately dubbed the `chicken walk': they went through that door at the end of the chamber and did not vote. They have turned around and said, `You can't blame us for the high-roller amendment; we never voted for it.' But by—as a conscious act—deliberately absenting themselves from the chamber, they guaranteed it was carried. They were able to say to the government, `We helped get your amendment through. We've honoured our side of this dirty deal for a GST.' They were able to have it both ways.</para><para>Well, we have come to a moment of truth: they cannot have it both ways now. This is a moment when they have to actually vote according to their conscience and, given that
 this is a moral amendment, there can be only one outcome: they should vote for the amendment and against the government's bill. I challenge the Australian Democrats to do that—not to take the chicken walk; to stand up and make the vote on this issue. We know that the previous decision created all sorts of shock waves in the Democrats camp. We know that it led to a challenge to the Leader of the Australian Democrats and to infighting within their ranks. I do not want to canvass all those issues at any length, other than to say that what is clear here is that the rank and file members of the Australian Democrats are unhappy with their leadership. I have been in situations in my own political party where that has occurred in the past, and one knows that, at the end of the day—no matter how deep the distress being acutely felt by idealistic and well-meaning members of the party who think that their politicians in the Senate will abide by the inspirational goals of the party—smart party officers can sometimes win the vote despite the dissent.</para><para>Here is a chance for the Australian Democrats to unite their own party, to overcome the dissent, to give the aspirational, idealistic members a reason to believe that they are led properly and morally by their elected representatives. Here is a chance for them to unite the party. The way they should do so is by voting for this amendment. I challenge them to do it. The alternative for the Democrats is to deepen the rift and widen the dissent and create even greater bitterness internally within their own party.</para><para>I am not going to make a fatuous speech about the role of the Democrats in Australian politics because I am not given to that sort of speech making. But they do have a role here and one would hope that they have the confidence of the people who vote for them. This is a chamber elected by proportional representation where minority parties and groups can be elected. It would be a sad thing if there was a complete disjunction between the behaviour of minority party representatives and the reasons why individuals in our community vote in that way.</para><para>I understand, although we do not have a clock, that I am just about out of time. So let
 me say once again that the moment of truth has arrived. There is no doubt where the Labor Party stand on high rollers or on casinos that give them rebates. We think they should be taxed according to the GST if other Australians are to be taxed according to the GST. Our preference is for no GST. We have lost that battle; there is a GST. Do not let the high rollers out of the net. That is where the Labor Party stand. I am sure other parties in this chamber will speak for themselves. But we know from the past record that is not where the coalition stand. They think their high-roller mates should be let off. We know from the past record that the minority parties and the Independents here voted with us. So the question comes to the door of the Democrats. It is a moral amendment. I hope they act that way.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>11676</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to follow up on a number of comments and support the amendment that Senator Cook has moved.

According to ABS figures today, the casinos' profit margins have dropped to only $365 million this year. This is a struggling group. The Crown Casino is a struggling small family business.

That is the high-roller component. Unfortunately, that is only the high rollers.</para><para>Their profits are massively benefiting from this amendment that you want to pass today. It is beyond me how some of the Democrats who have expressed concerns about charities, about the impact on the poor, about the impact on the weak in our society, can stomach looking in their mirrors at night. I am sorry that Senator Woodley appears to be leaving the chamber because he was one of the people for whom I held hope. I hoped he would see through this government, through this amendment.

 be no Democrat in the building who does not know what this vote is going to be about. There will be no ability to say, `I didn't realise.'

Otherwise I would have been there. We have heard a lot from two Labor speakers, two Labor frontbenchers, on taxation issues. Probably one line that is worth noting as correct was Senator Cook's—that the arguments he has put forward tonight are not new. That is the nub of the whole issue. We have heard nothing new tonight, nothing we have not already heard before. All we have had is the Labor Party re-running their arguments, re-running their stance and re-running their posturing from when the debate was first had back in June. That is fair enough, I suppose, in some senses.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Conroy highlighted my position on this issue and the broader GST, which was very nice of him. It saves me having to do it myself. My position is well-known publicly, and I am happy to have it on the record both in this chamber and in the broader community. But that debate has been had, and that vote has been had. The proper role I see for the Democrats, including me, in relation to the taxation issues is not just revisiting debates and votes from five months ago on this issue or any other issue; it is dealing with the reality of what we have now, and looking forward. The reality is that we are going to have a GST from 1 July next year. Different people have different views about whether or not they would prefer that to happen, but it is going to happen. The best role that all of us can play, I would suggest, is not to continue to just recycle the arguments from back in June but to look at ensuring that the changes that are made operate as effectively as pos
 sible. That is what the Democrats have been doing, including me.</para><para>Senator Conroy talked about the role of charities and quite rightly pointed to the strong and positive role my colleague Senator Woodley has played, along with all of us, in ensuring that any potential negative impacts on charities are removed or minimised. That probably in itself demonstrates that the suggestion that the GST is some unmentionable in the Democrats' party room is absurd. We have obviously been talking considerably about the GST in the context of ensuring that it does not impact negatively on charities. The end product of that is some of the positive measures, which Senator Conroy kindly drew attention to, that we have announced today.</para><para>As he would see if he noted those measures, that is not the end of the matter. We have ensured an ongoing role for the consultative committee. All of us within the Democrats will continue to play a constructive role in ensuring that we continue to monitor the implementation of the GST both up until it comes into operation and once it comes into operation. That is a constructive policy based role we are playing. I would suggest to all senators that it would be beneficial to them. It is clear that Labor is going to focus its whole election efforts around attacking the GST and highlighting community discontent about the GST. That is fine as a political strategy and you can keep doing that but it would be helpful, I suggest, if you also put forward constructive policy ideas of your own.</para><para>Senator Conroy was happy to quote newspaper articles containing media speculation. Let me quote a newspaper article of my own, which is not just speculation about what might be happening but which is based on straightforward facts. Let us look at the role the Democrats have played and continue to play, as we have demonstrated today in bringing forward more constructive changes and in putting forward ideas to make further changes—and not only after we have made an agreement. We continue to pressure the government and succeed in getting changes out of the government for further improvements. Contrast that to what the Labor Party
 has done on business tax. They made an agreement which had no improvements in it at all. They did not make a deal; they capitulated, they rolled over. They accepted it lock, stock and barrel, with no improvements. And that is the end of the story.</para><para>Contrast that to what the Democrats have done in terms of agreements reached back in May and June. We are continuing to work, continuing to put forward ideas, continuing to highlight the problems and continuing to get results. It is worth quoting from an article by Margot Kingston in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 27 September—not some idle speculation about internal party stuff but a factual assessment of Labor's position on tax issues:</para><para>. . . Labor agreed to capital gains taxes which overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, dramatically disadvantage small business compared with big business and big shareholders and give retrospective tax cuts to those already holding assets. This agreement was an acknowledgment that Labor has officially vacated the battleground of public policy debate.</para><para>If we are looking at a shame file, right at the top of that file is the Labor Party's position on business tax. Senator Conroy said we can read all about what happens in the Labor Party party room in the media all the time. I have seen some reports about some people in the Labor caucus who stood up and argued against business tax. I have not seen Senator Conroy's name mentioned as a strong defender speaking out against this nasty deal that is going to give a big windfall to the high rollers and the wealthy against those who are not. Maybe they did not quite get that story. I am sure Senator Conroy was at the front of the queue complaining loudly and standing up for the battlers, and the journalists did not get that piece of information. They only picked up Mark Latham and a few others. Given the media has missed out on that fact, you might like to put that on the record so we can be clear that you stood up for the battlers on that occasion and just did not quite have the numbers.</para><para>This is a bigger indictment in terms of outcomes and inability of the Labor Party as a whole to use political leverage to change proposed legislation for the better of the
 battlers and for the benefit of that justice they are going on about so much. I would suggest that, rather than vacating the battleground of public policy debate, they actually put forward some ideas and try to generate some improvements to legislation, whether it is tax or anything else. Just recently, in respect of not just business tax but the government's approach to refugees, we saw Labor Party speakers stand up in the chamber and say, `This measure of the government's is a bad measure. It's not going to work. It's stupid, but we're going to support it so that the government can wear the consequences of its failure. We're not going to fall into the government's so-called trap and oppose something that we know is not going to work.'</para><para>Speaking personally, I wish you had taken that approach on the GST, although it would have been worse for the people of Australia because, going by your record on negotiating with business tax, you would have agreed to it lock, stock and barrel. We would have got the whole damn thing and it would have been a hell of a lot worse than the package that we have with all the many improvements that the Democrats brought in and continue to make.</para><para>It is important to re-emphasise that we have an important role as legislators. Sometimes we forget and are just throwing political rocks around the place and point scoring. As legislators considering legislation, we try to ensure improvements, bringing forward positive changes and putting forward ideas. It seems that Labor's basic approach is now to support government legislation or else. They come to agreements on the spot without negotiating any changes whatsoever or else they just rerun arguments that have already been heard in this chamber, putting forward amendments and basically rerunning the entire speech. That may be useful from a political point scoring point of view, but in actually ensuring positive moves forward and concrete improvements, I am afraid it does not produce any positive benefit at all.</para><para>I encourage the ALP to look a bit more broadly. It is clear that they will focus at this stage—they have no other ideas of their
 own—on playing on and highlighting community concerns and fears about the GST.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—You voted against it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—I have put my position on the record. I did vote in relation to it but I have accepted the fact that I lost on that one. That is a bit of a shame, but we all lose things occasionally and the fact is that it is going to happen and that is a reality. Not just the ALP but more particularly the Australian public would benefit from everyone accepting that that is a reality, that that is going to happen, rather than just sitting and wailing about it and going on about doom and gloom and the sky falling in. We should be putting forward positive changes and working constructively in any areas where improvements can be made. There is no doubt that issues will continue to come to light where improvements can be made. But you are not going to go to the next election with a policy of removing the GST. Everybody knows that. That is not feasible. We have it and we are stuck with it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I suggest that the best way forward is to propose ideas of how to improve it rather than simply revisiting old arguments, old debates and old votes that have already been put forward. Matters should be resolved in this chamber for better or for worse. I suggest that is the role that the Democrats are playing. Not surprisingly, it is an unfortunate aspect of Australian politics that people like to highlight differences of opinion as though disagreeing on things is somehow an appalling thing rather than an indication of a variety of viewpoints and a diversity and richness of opinion.</para><para>The fact is that the Democrats are working together as one in a forward looking way on this issue. We are working together as one in looking for areas that need improvement, looking to keep pressing for positive changes. We have achieved some more of those today, which is part of what this debate tonight is about. That is a far more constructive approach to take. That is the approach that I am taking in relation to this issue. Simply just revisiting arguments that have already been put and resolved in this place months ago is not a constructive way to go.</para><para>I encourage the Labor Party, while they are relaxing over their Christmas break, to reconsider their approach on this issue. This might be your final fling on this. This might be the last time we get to hear all this stuff trotted out. Sadly, I fear not. They will recycle these debates over and over again. But I would encourage you, at least while you are recycling the point scoring, to put some useful, forward looking constructive stuff in there as well. The other stuff is entertaining, but it is nice occasionally to cogitate on something of substance. Maybe you could make it your New Year's resolution when you are thinking out those things. In the meantime, for the benefit of the Australian public as well as for people in this chamber, it would be more helpful to focus on accepting reality and looking forward rather than simply rehashing some point scoring arguments from the past.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>11682</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the amendment.

I will take up Senator Bartlett's and the Democrats' challenge. I would like to add a different perspective to the argument about casino high rollers, and it is from the perspective of having worked in a casino for some four years—Rest Point Casino from 1976 to 1979. Rest Point was Australia's first casino. We now have nine or 10 casinos; there has been a significant expansion in casinos. I worked as a night cashier and auditor at Rest Point. I had significant contact with people who came to gamble at Rest Point—particularly high rollers. In my capacity as a cashier I often watched the high rollers. You became fairly well aware of who was a high roller and who was not. I would watch the high rollers come in from the airport in their chauffeur driven cars and go up to Rest Point. They would go to the best rooms in the hotel—usually complementary. It was not just the room, of course; other services—food, liquor—were complementary.</para></talk.start><para>Often the high rollers would deposit their money in the safety deposit boxes of the casino and quite often I had the job of secur
 ing their cash and valuables in the safety deposit boxes. Many thousands of dollars would be put into the envelopes along with their other valuables—jewels, et cetera. When we talk about casino high rollers, we are not talking about the poor of society; we are talking about the very wealthy elite, not just from Australia but from overseas as well. I have had some first-hand experience of high rollers. They have plenty of money; they are looked after very well by casinos. I understand why they are looked after very well because the objective is to take their money off them. If high rollers are silly enough to gamble for long enough they will lose money.</para><para>What I cannot understand is why high rollers should not pay their fair share of taxes. That is what Labor is proposing. High rollers should pay along with everyone else in the community. That is what Labor is proposing. We have had a huge expansion of gambling in Australia—I think too much gambling, despite my work background in casinos. We have had too much expansion of gambling in Australia over the last couple of decades. The number of casinos has grown from one—Australia's first at Rest Point—to nine or 10. We have also had a significant expansion in other outlets for gambling. Labor's approach here is not to tax the lower middle income earner—who, unfortunately, is at times caught up in the cycle of gambling—but to have a real go at these high rollers. It is perfectly ethical and I really cannot understand why the Australian Democrats are running from this amendment.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">MURRAY</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—We haven't had a chance to speak, yet.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Just sit down, Nick.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—I was going to be kind to the Australian Democrats, but I am going to have my say.

The government broke the agreement at the time, and I believe the Australian Democrats are perfectly entitled on this particular issue to inject a bit more fairness into the Australian tax system, particularly in relation to the goods and services tax, and vote for the high roller amendment. It is one of many we are considering in this debate tonight.</para><para>The fact that high rollers have to pay another $20 to $30 million in tax should not cause anyone any loss of sleep. I say to the Australian Democrats: think about the issue. We have another opportunity. It is not too late; the tax does not come into effect until 1 July 2000. We have many other amendments and issues in dealing with the GST. We are revisiting many of the issues involved with the GST, so it is perfectly legitimate for us to recycle this amendment. It will inject a little more fairness into the GST—not a great deal, but at least another $20 or $30 million worth of fairness from people from this country and overseas who can afford to pay a little more GST into government coffers. That small amount of revenue in the budget context will
 be very useful in  contributing to health and education in this country.</para><para>It is a perfectly reasonable amendment and it is perfectly reasonable to revisit it before the GST comes in. I urge the Australian Democrats—and I am not being particularly personal with the Australian Democrats—to support this amendment. It is very reasonable in the context of the negotiations that occurred and the agreement that was reached with the government. The government broke the agreement in one area. You have made some points about charities and apparently that has been accommodated in some way. It is perfectly reasonable for the Australian Democrats to accommodate the Labor Party and the Greens—I do not know how Senator Harradine is going to vote on this amendment—and to take this opportunity to inject this one last little bit of fairness into the GST.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>11685</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are in the unfortunate position where senators are wandering in with full stomachs, having had their dinner. Those of us who are here carrying through the debate—Senator Kemp, Senator Conroy, Senator Cook, me and maybe other senators—are hoping that we get a dinner break at some stage.</para></talk.start><para>It is time to wrap up the Australian Democrats' position on this Labor amendment. I think we have been subject to a fairly broad ranging attack of a different tone, depending on the senator, on the Australian Democrats and, in particular, not only on this amendment but on our characteristics as a party generally. I must say I find it rich and offensive to be lectured on morality by the Labor Party. I also find it extraordinary to be lectured about our capacity as negotiators by the Labor Party. In fact, this week is a typical summary of the Labor Party's abilities. I have referred to them before as the Collins class party—noisy and ineffective. What happened this week was that they beat up on all the charities, they made a tremendous fuss and noise—and they got absolutely nothing out of it. The people were bored, the media were bored, there was very little public reaction. Whilst that was going on we quietly beavered away with the charitable groups, with the
 senior people in the charitable community, and we got plenty. That is typical of how it goes.</para><para>We also had the spectacle of having newspaper articles quoted at us. Listen to what senior journalists say about the Labor Party. Anyone can find quotes from newspapers. Kenneth Davidson referred to the ALP leadership. This is what he had to say:</para><para>Once more the ALP leadership has yoked its future to spiv capitalism . . . </para><para>That is not very nice. Then we have Mr Alan Ramsey, who is a very senior journalist. Unlike Senator Conroy, who was trying to make political points, he is a person who appraises the political scene. I noted Senator Conroy used the word `appeasement' about us. Here is Alan Ramsey referring to Simon Crean as `the great appeaser'. In terms of their principles, he says this:</para><para>It was no deal at all—</para><para>talking about the business tax deal—</para><para>just a shameless sell-out of ALP principle, something Labor has been good at in the `90s.</para><para>You have got form, you have got history. Here is another one about the Labor Party—and they are renowned as a party who get their snouts in the trough of whatever is going on, whatever enriches their lives appropriately. Here is a slogan they have come up with: `Less tucker, more ticker'. Less time in the trough. Let's have a bit more ticker from you. What else does Alan Ramsey say? He refers to the Hon. Simon Crean, saying:</para><para>Crean was a ridiculously cheap buy.</para><para>He says:</para><para>Beazley hasn't had a fresh idea since taking over from Keating almost four years ago . . . </para><para>He refers to Mark Latham's remarks as:</para><para>. . . as much a monstering of his own party's political cowardice.</para><para>You can throw words at us about our political courage and so on, but these are senior people appraising the performance of the Labor Party over many years. It is about time you paid more attention to morality and policy content, had more courage in trying to do the right thing by Australia and paid less attention to getting your snouts in the trough—more ticker
 and less tucker is the summary. That is a selection of newspaper quotes I can pick on.</para><para>Then there was the question of the Democrats' political life and how they run their party. I do not think any other party has democracy throughout its system as we do. For instance, the good Labor senators selected here are, I think, each selected by a small group of people. The Labor Party generally is a gerrymandered organisation. You do not have one value, one vote. Union delegates have a far higher vote weighting. If it was an electoral system for the country as a whole it would be a disgrace. It is characterised by branch stacking. It is characterised by factionalised bullyboy tactics. Typical in Western Australia, one of the MPs got his jaw broken recently by one of the bullies who are sanctioned by a weak leadership. Members of the Senate are referred to as `head kickers' and `thugs' because of their behaviour. It is a party with corrupt internal politics. Senator Conroy is a man with a winning smile, but I am telling you that the perception of Labor is that it has an ugly style. You cannot attack the morality of others when you have form as you do.</para><para>That is enough about the interplay that has gone on on the political side. Let us get back to the amendment itself. The high-roller amendment is really not well understood, and the existing policy is not well understood. The GST is applied on the margin, the difference between gross receipts and gross costs. So I thought to myself, `Let me just test the proposition that you are putting up.' So, shocking person that I am, I thought I would write to the states and territories. I thought, `They are the people who benefit from the GST; let's see if they support the Labor Party's position.' So, on 30 November—and, as today is 9 December, they have had plenty of time—I faxed every Premier and every Chief Minister of the states and territories. Do they support your position? Do the Labor Premiers support your position, Senators Cook and Conroy?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—Do you want me to answer that, Mr Chairman?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—I hope you do, in due course.

Frankly, I am in the position where I agree with the government's policy and with the way in which it is outlined, but I thought I would test it with the very people who are the beneficiaries, which includes the Labor Premiers. Well, they did not reply. What does this turn out to mean? It means that once again this is about politics and not about policy. You have not worked it through. It is on dodgy morality and dodgy politics and it is just not properly worked through. And you won't even get your Labor colleagues in the states to support you on this. It is hopeless. And I bet you that none of them comes to the party. So, for those reasons, we will not support you.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>11686</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I listened to this debate with great interest both in the chamber and when I went out for little while some time ago. I was interested in the debate which went on—particularly the beating of chests by the Labor Party on behalf of the poor of Australia and with how much they hate the high rollers. I was very interested because I know from my own experience over a number of years that, when there has been an opportunity for the Labor Party to do something about gambling and casinos, they have been one of the first to build more casinos and collect more revenue in Labor states from gambling.</para></talk.start><para>As a matter of fact, a few years ago in Queensland when they were in government, the Goss Labor Party decided, when we already had too many casinos in Queensland, that we needed another one. Where did they build it? They built it in the Treasury Building in  Brisbane—heritage listed, one of the grandest buildings from the last century, but which they did not mind desecrating and
 turning into a casino. Not only that, but a bit of dubious tinkering went on in Brisbane with the sale of shares. When it was discovered that it might not be possible to award the licence that they wanted to award to Jupiter's—who already had a casino on the Gold Coast—because Daikyo had been fingered at that time and clearly would not be a suitable member of the Jupiter's Casino consortium to grant another licence to, would you believe that the Labor Party all of a sudden pulled out of the negotiations and allowed a few weeks in which Daikyo could divest itself of the shares! So it was then quite safe to award the licence to the Jupiter's Casino consortium. Very interesting, the way in which the Labor Party goes about making sure that gambling, which is such a terrible blight on this community, should not be limited but in fact should have the opportunity to increase.</para><para> It is very interesting to see where the casino was built. It was built using two buildings. One was the Treasury Building, and the other one was across a little park, Queen's Park. I forget the name of the other building, but it was also a very old government building. It is interesting because of the history in which I was involved in relation to that park. In 1978, under the Bjelke-Petersen regime, a group of Christians were arrested for singing hymns in Queen's Park. However, when the Labor Party wanted to build a casino on the same site, it did not matter that Christians had been arrested there, or whatever: they brought in the bulldozers and ripped the park apart.</para><para>Then, of course, there is the Melbourne casino. It is interesting that we look like having an inquiry into the Melbourne casino, now that Labor is in power in Victoria. I predict that some obvious corruption under the Kennett regime will be shown up. The Senate tried to have an inquiry into the Melbourne casino, and that was set up just a couple of years ago with a Democrat and some Labor and Liberal members. The inquiry began, and we asked Victorian public servants to appear, and Mr Kennett said no. What happened? Labor and the Liberal party
 rolled over and said, `Oh well, if Mr Kennett says no, we'll close the inquiry down.'</para><para>The challenge to Labor, if they really feel strongly about this whole issue of gambling, is to reconstitute the Victorian casino inquiry in the Senate. It probably will help their state colleagues, and certainly the Democrats would support it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>11687</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We will not be supporting this amendment.

The government have, over successive opportunities on tax, preached loudly—and we will no doubt hear it again tonight—that they are very tough on tax avoidance. If you are, do this. Stop talking about it and let us judge you by your actions. Do this and help stamp out tax avoidance and also protect the revenue.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government has an obligation to protect the revenue of this nation and one of the first principles of tax law is fairness or, as it is expressed, equity. If some people who are on higher incomes have more discretionary
 income left over such that they can engage high priced lawyers and accountants to find slippery holes in the tax act, they have an advantage over ordinary wage and salary earners who spend every red cent to keep their families afloat. It means that if you have extra discretionary income and you get the slippery lawyers and the smart accountants, you can avoid tax.</para><para>Tax avoidance is a recreational opportunity for the wealthy in this country. If you believe in fairness, you are tough on avoidance in order to ensure that ordinary wage and salary earners, who have all of their tax taken out of their pay packet every week, are treated fairly and equally like everyone else, and there is not this case where respect for tax law is abolished because everyone knows it is open slather for those who can buy their way through the maze of legislation. To the government, I say: a fundamental principle of tax law is equity and fairness. Be tough on tax avoidance; amend the provision this way.</para><para>Let me say a few words to the Australian Democrats.

A supply by a charitable institution, a trustee of a charitable fund or a gift deductible entity is currently GST free if it is provided for consideration that is less than 50 per cent of the consideration that the supplier provided to acquire the thing supplied, if I may give a technical explanation. After consultation with charitable organisations, it has been decided to increase the threshold to 75 per cent, which will allow more supplies by charities to be GST free. This amendment amends subparagraph 38-50(2)(b)(ii) of the GST act to change the non-commercial threshold from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. The chamber will be aware that the Treasurer made a very extensive and important statement today, and copies of the Treasurer's press release and associated papers have been distributed to the chamber.</para><para>The next amendment relates to the issue of funerals. The government is proposing to
 amend the GST transition act to make agreements for prepaid funerals entered into prior to 1 December 1999 and paid in full prior to 1 December 1999 to be GST free. If the funeral agreement was entered into prior to 1 December 1999 but was not paid in full before 1 December 1999, the recipient is effectively given until 1 July 2005, or an earlier review date if one exists, to pay for it, and it will be a GST-free supply. Any consideration paid before 1 July 2005 or an earlier review date, if one applies to the agreement, is taken to be for a supply which is GST free.</para><para>The amendment will also ensure that section 11 estimates of the GST transition act 1999 will not apply to prepaid funerals. Section 11 allows the Commissioner of Taxation to determine methods to work out the extent to which a right could reasonably expected to be used after 1 July 2000 where it is not clear. This would entail an assessment of the likely time of the death of the purchaser of the prepaid funeral and will no longer be required.</para><para> We have had extensive consultations with the funeral industry, which have been very productive. They are pleased with the amendments which have been moved by the government. We have received a letter from the Australian Funeral Directors Association which, in summary, reads:</para><para>On behalf of all members of the Australian Funeral Directors Association and the Australian Cemeteries and Crematoria Association, please accept our thanks for your recent undertakings to amend legislation relating to the transitional period provisions for the GST and the funeral industry.

I use those words to indicate that we are not wildly
 enthusiastic about supporting them, but we will not oppose them because, puny as they might be, they do represent some improvement to the current situation. It is not our desire to see charities in any way made victims of the GST. The truth about what we have just heard is that there has been a public outcry in this nation from charities about the impact of the GST on their operations and the fact that they are now hamstrung with a tax. This means that the laudable voluntary sacrifices of many people who work for an idealistic purpose for Australian charities to deliver a service to Australians in need are now being taxed, and there is less time for the volunteers to spend doing their core functions of helping those in need because they have to fill out forms and be a branch of the tax office. It means that more time is spent by charities on being a branch of the tax office, which erodes their income, meaning that there are less funds available to serve the purpose for which they were established. The outcry has been widespread and unanimous.</para></talk.start><para>That has spooked the Australian Democrats. There has been a meeting in private between the Democrats and the government and, at well past the eleventh hour, we now have imposed on us a series of amendments which have not been through the proper channels of parliamentary scrutiny and on which we are forced, at the eleventh hour, to make a decision. We will not oppose them because, on our reading of them, we think they alleviate some of the problems a little, and we will not stand in the way of that alleviation.</para><para>The fundamental problem remains. You can start compromising—salami slicing a bit here and a bit there, adding a bit where it is painful and a bit more in some other corner—but you won't solve the problem that way. The problem is that charities in Australia will have to pay a GST. You can change some of the rules to make it a bit softer, but charities in Australia will still have to pay a GST. A GST takes from their core functions, ties up volunteers and turns charities into branches of the tax office. It means that funds that they want to use for charitable purposes have to go into administration in order to meet the needs of complying with the tax administration
 requirements. That is the fundamental problem.</para><para>Let me take one quick step back in time. Remember, this government told us when the GST came down, `No-one will be worse off.' Remember those words? The Senate inquiry found that people would be worse off, and the government changed its language. It said, `No group will be worse off.' Even that is wrong: groups will be worse off. There has been an underestimation of the amount of inflation that will be induced in this economy by the imposition of a GST. The Reserve Bank of Australia disagrees with the government about what the impact in the first year will be. Next year, as a result of the GST, we are looking at an inflation rate in this country of between five and seven per cent.</para><para>But what did the government tell Australians? It said at the election that it would be 1.9 per cent. It forgot to tell everyone that that is in the second year. The knock-on effects of a five to seven per cent inflation rate are going to have further impacts in pushing up the inflation figure as well, and it is going to erode the value of money over time. So `no group is worse off' is also a furphy.</para><para>Then, of course, we had the impact on revenue of the deal the government did with the Democrats. We were told that the value of that deal was $1.8 billion. That is the value of the buy-off. What happened just last month? The Prime Minister rocked into the House of Representatives and said, `We have to have a Timor tax to pay for our presence in Timor. That will cost $1.3 billion.' If you look at the revenue impact, the $1.3 billion that the Timor tax will raise is to pay for the Democrats deal on the GST, which cost $1.8 billion. It could be called the Lees rather than the Timor tax levy.</para><para>Then we were told that education was free, that it was exempted from the GST. It is a pity about school uniforms; you have to pay a GST on them. It is a pity about books; there will be a GST there. It is a pity about shoes for schoolkids; there is a GST there. It is a pity about sporting equipment and other things; there is a GST there.

We were told all of these things, and then we were told about charities. We were told charities were going to be looked after. Let us go and see what this package contains.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The starting point in doing that is a quote from Senator Murray, the Democrats spokesman on tax, who has now been superseded, it seems, by Senator Woodley, who is the Democrats spokesman on charities and tax. Senator Woodley, I have to say, with the greatest respect to you: you ought to have left the task with Senator Murray; he would have done it better.

</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Virtually? What does that mean, Senator Cook?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—It does not mean that they have actually solved the problem; it means that some are free and some are not. There is nothing we can do here in the time available to us, since we are being ambushed at this late hour on the last day of sitting before Christmas, and you have to carry it before you leave because you cannot get out until you do. We have not been able to conduct the proper scrutiny to see what `virtually all' means. It is a value word. Which people are left out, and which groups are the ones who `virtually' did get in? Who suffers? In the first dot point we have a few weasel words; there is no clear undertaking. What sort of deal was this? They did not solve the problem; they virtually solved the problem.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the second point, they talk about `most fundraising activities'. Again, not all fundraising activities have been solved; only most, according to the overblown phraseology of the Australian Democrats' press release. I will come to how overblown it is in a minute. Again, who has missed out? What are the most common activities, and who suffers? In that dot point again, they use the words `as a separate sub-entity'. That is to say, they are now organising the books of charities to create the charity and separate sub-entities of the charity, at the government's suggestion, to avoid the tax. That is all right for charities. I applaud it if charities can avoid the tax; that is good. But what we have here is a precedent in which the government is showing charities how to avoid tax. What about the rest of the tax avoiding community out there? Do you think they will not follow suit? Of course they will.</para><para>The ALP position is no tax. If you have no tax, no GST, you do not have to avoid it, do you, because you do not have to pay it. The third dot point is where it gets awfully tricky for the Australian Democrats. Let me bracket together the third dot point of this press release and the eighth dot point. It is worth while reading them. The third dot point says:</para><para>.	 the Treasurer will seek a more generous ruling from the Tax office . . .
</para><para>The eighth dot point says:</para><para>.	 the Tax office will be instructed to provide a lenient approach . . . </para><para>I do not know, Senator Woodley, whether you know anything about tax law in this country, but no-one can tell the tax office what to do. Certainly the Treasurer cannot. He cannot require them to provide a more lenient ruling. He cannot tell the tax office, as your press release says he will, `I instruct you to do this.' The tax office is an independent statutory authority, and so it should be. If governments could tell tax collectors who to collect from and who not to collect from, the system would be corrupt. It has got to be like the judiciary—beyond the power of governments to influence the administration of the act. The administrators of the tax act ought to be like that figure that stands on top of the courts, the woman with the blindfold, scales in one hand and a sword in the other. It has got to be fair and fearless.</para><para>The Treasurer cannot tell the tax office what to do, nor should he. But your press release, Senator Woodley, says a big victory the Australian Democrats have achieved is that the Treasurer will tell them. I have got some news for anyone who might believe your press release: he cannot and he will not. If he tries, they will say, `No, you can't.' The press release reads:</para><para>The Tax Office will be instructed to provide a lenient approach . . .</para><para>Instructed to provide? Maybe you want to pull the wool over the eyes of some people who are gullible Democrat voters. He cannot do that. Maybe you want to boast that you have achieved a breakthrough. You have not. What you are doing here is dressing up a defeat to appear as if it is a victory and claiming it as a right. It is absolutely untrue.</para><para>Let me go through some of the other points. There is a claim about input tax credits on volunteers. What does this mean? It means more book work for charities and less attention to their core standards. Quarterly, not monthly. Good. I am pleased about that. And so it goes.</para><para>Finally, the following statement by the Australian Democrats—it is in heavy type so that you cannot miss it—takes the cake:</para><para>The Government to further discuss with the Democrats a two-stage inquiry into tax treatment of charities next year . . .</para><para>The unfortunate thing about Senator Woodley's press release is that I actually read the Treasurer's press release. That is not what he says. You say this is what you have got an agreement on. You use the words: `to further discuss'. You have not got a deal, you have only got an agreement to talk about a deal. You have written about a two-stage inquiry into the tax treatment of charities. The Treasurer does not say that. He talks about the definition of charities. So there is no deal here to even talk about an inquiry into charities per se and all of their needs; it is, according to the Treasurer, just into the definition of what constitutes a charity. Again, boastfulness and overzealousness are leading to misrepresentation and a pretence of winning when you are losing. That is the deal that has been struck tonight, and that is the deal that I think will be found wanting.</para><para>Nothing announced today in the coalition-Democrat deal on charities changes the fact that all charities are to become tax collectors for the Howard government. Their fundraising activities will still be hit by the GST. If they restructure to stay below the $100,000 threshold, they will be slugged by the GST on all the goods and services they buy. If they enter the system above the $100,000 threshold, they will be entitled to GST input tax credits but the GST will apply to all of their commercial operations, and they will give to the government millions of dollars of revenue from the GST each year. In addition, they will still suffer the massive compliance costs that every single charity in this country fears will come at the expense of services to the disadvantaged.</para><para>Today was the government's chance to get this issue right and exempt all activities of charities completely from the GST net. They failed. Instead, in a decision reminiscent of the nursing homes fiasco, they decided to tinker at the margins. Where they should have exempted all of the activities of charities from the GST net, they instead left the GST applying to activities like chocolate drives, lamington drives, operation teddy bear, charity fetes, charity dinners and concerts. Where they
 should have exempted government grants to charities from the GST net, the GST will still apply to all community grants, including grants to disability, homelessness and emergency relief organisations. Where they should have removed the $100,000 threshold entirely, they have not. The catch 22 for charities still remains: those who are above the $100,000 must pay the GST and those who are below must absorb the cost of the GST on all of their inputs.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Crowley)</name></talker><para>—Order!

The minister has just confirmed that. When I say, `Does this mean $565 million is now going into compliance and start-up for small business and the community sector?' the minister says, `No. It is still $500 million.'

What the bill seeks to do, as I understand it, is to make sure some uncertainty about the basis upon which investigative powers exercised by the National Crime Authority have been supported is clarified. One of the remarkable
 features of this bill is that it is retrospective to 1984. That creates problems and that has been dealt with in the usual efficient way by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I think the minister would agree with that.</para></talk.start><para>I am told that there have been discussions on this and in these matters you must trust. The minister who brings forth the bill assures the Senate that this bill does not affect adversely any person in the past. In other words, this is not a bill that catches a person up in a criminal investigation who was not previously caught up or does not cure a matter that would otherwise legitimately be open to that person.</para><para>The National Crime Authority is the creature of statute. It has wide powers to combat crime. The powers have been given by the parliament. The parliament decides what those powers should be and the parliament has to be very responsible in what it does. Powers in areas of criminal investigation should be strictly interpreted. There has been recent experience where they have been strictly interpreted by one court but other courts have, in my view, allowed them to be interpreted more broadly than they should. It is important and essential that the powers of this body be confined; that retrospectivity not be used unless it can be used safely; and that this chamber, together with the parliament as a whole, keeps its creature within the restraints that are necessary to allow it to investigate crime, which is ongoing, while at the same time protecting our civil life.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>11698</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Democrats have some serious concerns about the process through which this bill has arisen and what we see as the inadequacy of the minister to satisfy the core question that lies at the heart of the <inline ref="r962">National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 1999</inline> . We are also very uncomfortable with the fact that it is being rushed through both houses of parliament on the very last sitting day of this session on what is the very last session for the year.</para></talk.start><para>The question we ask is: why? Why is the government rushing through the bill at this time? Indeed, I have asked that question and the response has been curious. The govern
 ment alleges that, because of a hypothetical proposition put to an inquiry by the Queensland police, this bill is necessary. Again I ask: why? Senators with longer experience than I have in this place will know that the government does not list bills that are merely to deal with hypotheticals. Actually I would have thought the government never engaged in this sort of exercise without strong reason.</para><para>But the only reason that has been offered to the Australian Democrats is that there is a hypothetical problem with the National Crime Authority Act. This is all very curious. Bad legislation is most often legislation that is created in haste without the proper mechanism for scrutiny, and my fear is that in this instance bad legislation may be the result. Only a proper inquiry can reveal that, but it is an inquiry that will not occur for this bill. The Democrats have strong reservations about that.</para><para>The purpose of the bill is largely intended to bring about what is perceived to be the original intention of the legislation. Our key point of contention, as I have outlined, is the comprehensive retrospectivity of the bill. If applied, the retrospective imposition of this bill will go back to 1984, a 15-year period. I think it is quite extraordinary that there should be such strong and anxious agitation from the government that this retrospective action must be taken urgently on what amounts to a totally hypothetical case. In this regard the bill is highly precipitous, and to the best of my knowledge there has not been any research into the actions and prosecutions of the NCA for the last 15 years in order to see if any citizen or corporation may be adversely affected by the extraordinarily retrospective nature of this proposition.</para><para>I sincerely hope that the real reason for this legislation is not revealed in the coming months. There is a legitimate suspicion on the part of the Democrats, because in my six months time spent in the Senate, I have never been lobbied so strongly by the government or its operatives as I have been in this case. At its heart, the essence of this bill is really about the rights of citizens and their ability to comply with the law. This bill relates directly to criminal law, and I submit that criminal
 law ought not be dealt with in this rushed and haphazard way. It deserves greater scrutiny and greater attention to the detail of the rights, as well as the obligations, of citizens whom this bill may affect.</para><para>This bill is being presented on the hypothetical notion that the current operations might—and I stress `might'—be challenged by someone who has been wrongly convicted under previous actions of the NCA. It is worth noting that within the concluding comments of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee on this legislation, the committee stated:</para><para>. . . there is no explanation of why the operation of the amendments needs to be backdated to 1984. The Explanatory Memorandum merely comments that the amendments `clarify the nature of the State and Commonwealth legislative framework that supports the National Crime Authority'. While ambiguities in section 55A of the Principal Act may be corrected by the amendments, those amendments also expand the scope of the NCA's powers. They do so both prospectively and retrospectively.</para><para>This retrospective operation appears to have the potential to validate NCA activities as far back as 1984 which were undertaken under a State mandate that had no equivalent provision in the NCA's own legislation—as required by the Principal Act. A question arises about the number and nature of such NCA activities.</para><para>In reference to these concerns, the committee asked the minister to provide greater detail on the effect of the bill, particularly as it relates to the effect of the proposed changes, why the changes are necessary and why the changes are needed retrospectively. In answer to the third and perhaps most pressing question, the minister responded with just four lines:</para><para>Without retrospective operation, NCA actions since 1984 authorised under state law could be challenged. This would jeopardise a range of matters where the evidence was obtained by reliance on state powers such as the confiscation of drugs and the prosecution and subsequent conviction of persons involved in organised crime.</para><para>In other words, people may have been wrongly convicted because the NCA had acted outside its powers. I make the point that anybody at any time can challenge the validity of legislation. Ultimately, all legislation stands or falls on the say-so of the courts. There is nothing new in this regard. I still fail to see the need for the rush on this amend
 ment bill. Are we really to believe that the nation stands to become overrun with drug barons and corporate fraudsters who might be released in their dozens at a moment's notice? There is no evidence that this will happen, and my inquiries reveal that there are no cases before the NCA or the minister to that effect. On the face of it, it could reasonably be argued that these amendments may not be necessary. They seek to clarify and reinforce the status quo rather than alter and/or expand it.</para><para>I am unaware of any court case that may have prompted the alleged pressing need to refine these powers, and I note that nothing in the NCA Act prevents the conferral of powers, functions or duties on the NCA or the Federal Court by law of a state. As the High Court determined in February 1998 in Gould v. Brown:</para><para>Many statutes have been enacted providing for federal office holders to receive additional powers and functions as conferred by the laws of another legislature within the federation. Such legislation is permissible.</para><para>I understand that the government and opposition have agreed on a position to support this bill, with proposed amendments from the opposition. On that basis, this bill will pass the chamber tonight. It is the very real hope of the Democrats that the passage of this bill does not come back to haunt the parliament in future. We defer to the minister, Senator Vanstone, who to date has indicated to the Democrats that this bill is not in response to any real-life case of litigation against the NCA that may be on the horizon. We must take those assurances on face value.</para><para>Given the joint support for this bill, the Democrats are not proposing to bring it to a division but take this opportunity to record our strong reservations about it, particularly with the wholesale retrospective nature of it. We are not opposed to retrospective legislation per se, but as a party we have historically argued that retrospective legislation is best dealt with on a case by case basis and in accordance with clear need. This legislation is wholesale, not case by case, and is not founded on any clear need. Our serious concerns with it remain unchanged.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>11700</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As all honourable senators know, time tonight is at a premium, and for that reason I will keep my remarks very short. I want to thank Senator Cooney and Senator Greig for contributing to the debate. I am conscious of the unusual circumstances that surround this bill and the difficult issues that it asks us to address. It is a credit to those who are supporting the bill that they have been prepared to make what some might see as a difficult decision but one that is necessary.</para></talk.start><para>The government proposed these amendments to confirm what had been understood by the Commonwealth and the states since the inception of the authority to be the meaning of section 55A of the National Crime Authority Act 1984. The shadow minister for justice and customs, Duncan Kerr, expressed concerns to me about making sure that the ability of states to confer powers on the NCA was strictly circumscribed. The government did not and still does not share that concern to the same extent, given the excellent working history between the Commonwealth and the states on matters relating to the NCA scheme. The Commonwealth and the states legislating together to achieve a national result is a very good example of federalism at work. However, there is nothing offensive in the opposition amendments, so we can easily live with them. We certainly did not want to do anything beyond what the amendments circumscribe the National Crime Authority to, and we have therefore agreed to it.</para><para>The amendments made by the bill confirm the ability of the states to confer powers, duties and functions on the National Crime Authority and that conferral of powers by the states may extend to the investigation of any relevant criminal activity, provided that there is Commonwealth legislation conferring powers of the same kind. I would like to thank the opposition for a very constructive and cooperative approach in dealing with the bill. I would assume they would always have that, but of course I also assume they had it because the NCA is their brainchild—it is legislation of Labor's that in fact is being clarified in this respect. Nonetheless, it is not
 often enough that we see a cooperative approach in this place, and I am pleased to see it.</para><para>During the storm of political confrontation that is around, generally it is easy not to notice these occasions; therefore I think it is important to note them. I would also like to note the involvement of the Chair of the National Crime Authority, Mr Gary Crooke QC. Mr Crooke, with my agreement, made himself available to discuss with both the opposition and the Democrats the problem of section 55A. I think his willingness to provide briefing of that kind was appreciated by all. It certainly was appreciated by the government.</para><para>We acknowledge that the bill presents an awkward problem—it is an awkward problem. Someone has come up with an interpretation that no-one thought had been the case, and everyone had been operating under what they believed at the time to be the appropriate interpretation. The passage of the bill is essential to ensure that a safety net is placed under the very important work of the National Crime Authority. I believe that the bill will ensure in a very fair manner that the work of the authority is protected.</para><para>I would like to note the work of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and trust that the responses that I have made have given adequate comfort to those who are supporting the bill. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Regulations and Ordinances Committee play a very valuable role in ensuring that in any legislation people's rights are not inadvertently trodden on in the desire to seek another policy goal.</para><para>I would like to say to Senator Greig that Senator Cooney, I, Senator Crowley and others who have served on those committees would probably all say that their first question of officials, or anyone who can answer it, when any government says there has been an interpretation problem—or sometimes it is described as a technical error or whatever—is, `Is there a case on foot that you are seeking to remedy?' because that has often been the case that the committees will not have been informed of that.</para><para>You have been correctly advised, Senator Greig, and to the best of my knowledge there is no case on foot. I think it is proper to deal with this legislation when there is not. I would have more concerns if the legislation were being rushed in to deal with one particular matter; in fact, it is being dealt with promptly to ensure that it is dealt with outside the colour of any particular case being on foot. I think, where it is possible, that is how it should be done. I am comforted that I know of no case that this affects, rather than being alarmed by it. I think possibly you were suggesting that there is no need for it because there is no case on foot. I am very pleased that I do not know of one on foot because it means we are dealing with it in proper and calm circumstances.</para><para>I do not regard the circumstances as being hurried simply because we are at the end of the year. The only point is that if we leave it any longer, we stand a risk of just such a situation eventuating before we come to deal with the bill. I conclude by again thanking senators for their contribution.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>11701</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>11701</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Chairman, I think Senator Cooney might have an amendment he wishes to move.

I also wish to thank the Parliamentary Library, Hansard and everybody who makes it all work. There are really only a couple of handfuls of senators and members, but the total staff within the building is quite significant, and without all of them participating and being absolutely committed to what happens we would not be able to fulfil our roles as senators and members.

They performed a sterling service to all Australians and, as is so often the case, they were very well supported by our staff. In this case, Mr Jody Fassina and Mr Chris Fry took a very prominent role in supporting Labor senators on that committee. There were 24 full-day hearings on that committee over a period of three months, a report which laid bare the problems surrounding the goods and services tax, as senators would recall, and even in the Senate tonight we are still dealing with those problems that were identified by senators on that particular committee. It was a massive exercise, well supported, as you would recall, Madam Acting Deputy President Crowley, by the Department of the Senate, the committee secretaries and staff, Hansard and those who assisted us with travel arrangements, as the caravan toured around the nation.</para><para>I wanted to mention the role of the other references committees in relation to the GST inquiry.

The environment references committee was engaged in this task as well. This was a very big job. It was a job well done by all those senators who were involved.

Let me first express the debt of personal gratitude I have to my deputy, Senator Peter Cook, who has had so many onerous responsibilities this year and has undertaken them and fulfilled them with such great effect. I thank him very much for it, as do my colleagues. I want to thank the manager, Senator Kim Carr, for all his efforts, the whip, Senator O'Brien, and his very able assistants, Senator Denman and Senator Quirke, as the office holders in the Senate on behalf of the opposition, who fulfil their role so effectively.</para><para>At this time, we remember, as Senator Hill has mentioned, the many people in the building who support all of us, regardless of what side of the parliament we sit on. They include those in the Senate department, such as the Clerk and his deputy and others. Of course, we particularly acknowledge the role of Dr Rosemary Laing, who has special responsibilities as far as non-government senators are concerned. We thank her for her assistance. To all in the Department of the Senate, we thank you so much. At the moment, we have the Clerk and the Deputy Clerk at the table, so I can say that directly to them. This goes to office services, Hansard, the attendants in the building, the people responsible for security, the cleaners and those in the Table Office. So many people in this building are so important to us all.</para><para>I thank Madam President and Madam Deputy President for their efforts over the year. We always remember the work of the Parliamentary Library, Hansard and the Sound and Vision Office and the sterling efforts of Comcar. To all those people, who are too numerous to mention, as far as the opposition goes—I know that I speak for every senator in the chamber—we genuinely appreciate all that they do. It is a pity that we only really have this one opportunity in the year to thank
 them for all they do in supporting all senators in this place.</para><para>I want to particularly mention two members of the Senate staff who have gone on to bigger and brighter careers. The first is Tim Holding, who was a long-term staff member for Senator Ray and a very well known face around this building for a long time. He is now the member for Springvale in the new Bracks government in Victoria. I also want to mention two staff members of Senator Jacinta Collins. Mr Anthony Byrne has played an important role in this building. He had a stunningly successful by-election victory in the seat of Holt. Ms Jenny Lindell, also a member of Senator Collins's staff, has been elected to the seat of Carrum. I would like to acknowledge and thank those two staff members for their contributions, particularly on this occasion.</para><para>As I always do, I thank my own staff at this time, including Lenka, Vikki, David, Antony and Colin, who work here in Parliament House, and Jenny and Helen in my electorate office. I also thank Christine Cannon and Tess Shannon, who have been doing part-time research duties. A long-term member of my staff, Renee Gamble, well known around the building, has left to go overseas. I wish her well for the future and look forward to celebrating her marriage on the weekend.</para><para>I need to note the tower of strength that is George Thompson, the leader of the staff on this side of the building.

Broadly, prescribed private funds will have to operate in the same way as public ancillary funds but will not have to seek and receive funds from the public. The purpose of the amendments is to preclude a fund that provides funds to political parties from being a prescribed private fund. Item 6 of schedule 5 of the bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 such that a fund can only be a prescribed fund if it is established solely for the purpose of providing money to a fund or institution that is listed under subdivision 30B of the act. If a fund is established to provide funds to any non-listed institutions, it cannot be a prescribed private fund. Political parties are not listed in subdivision 30. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary. Accordingly, the government does not accept these amendments.</para><para>I made it clear on behalf of the government in our consideration, particularly of amendments Nos 8, 11 to 13 and 17, that the government are serious about developing a policy that will encourage the donation of property for conservation values. We heard the Minister for the Environment and Heritage make that commitment in this place in the last day or so. We believe that such a policy needs to be developed in an integrated fashion. We believe that tax deductibility and tax breaks, tax advantages, for that activity is a sensible path to take but that it needs to be considered in a broad and detailed context, with the benefit of good quality research into the options, the pros and cons, and the costs and benefits.</para><para>I do not think anyone in this place, particularly people like Senator Brown, who has dedicated most of his life to conservation and the environment, would like to see the resources of the Commonwealth not aimed at enhancing conservation outcomes to achieve the very best bang for the buck, to use a colloquialism and a cliche. The government are determined to do that. We are not afraid of investing money in the environment. Senator Brown and others may not approve of the way we go about that. He may not enjoy the fact that we had to sell Telstra to invest billions back into the environment. But I am sure that we would all agree around the chamber that investment in the environment should be done on a value basis. If a government were to squander taxpayers' money on environmental investments, it would put that sort of public investment into ill repute and would not encourage the public backing of that sort of investment. So we need to proceed cautiously.</para><para>I do not mean to delay unnecessarily that sort of decision. We are not talking about that. Senator Hill has made it clear that it is a high priority of his and of the cabinet's to develop an integrated policy package in this regard. I know very well that these measures will be under the close scrutiny of all of us who take seriously environmental benefits, environmental reform and improving Australia's natural heritage in this place. I
 count myself amongst those.

The amendments that the Democrats and Greens put forward, which were supported by the Labor Party, would have meant that people who, out of the goodness of their heart, donate land—and wildlife—which is of high conservation value to the nation in perpetuity would get the same tax breaks as people who donate cultural items such as paintings. No good reason has been advanced here as to why, if you give a painting to a national collection, you get a better tax break than if you give a living part of Australia's heritage.</para></talk.start><para>I note the government says that it is going to do its sums and that there will be a package to cover such things as being able to extend the tax deduction over five years for land donations, the same as with art works, in the coming year. I note also that the same argument applies to the refusal by the government to accept a tax break for those people who put covenants on their land. They may be at a disadvantage because that could, for example, lower the price of land.</para><para>The government is now on record as having to work hard on those measures and to follow up this bill with substantial improvements. Once again, I say that the aim of this bill—which is to give tax breaks to people who do the right thing by the land and turn it over to be part of the nation's heritage—is laudable. It is high time we caught up on giving people who do the right thing by the environment the breaks, instead of those people who do the wrong thing by the environment. The net sum this year has been a massive injection of funds into the hands of people who pollute, who degrade the environment, who destroy forests and who are doing the wrong thing by the nation's environment—that is, under the same minister who brings this legislation forward. It is disappointing that the government has not been able to accept the improvements on this legislation that the Senate made earlier today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>11710</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Senate should not be surprised that the government has decided not to support the Senate's amendments in relation to a charitable trust like the Greenfields Foundation.

There is no alternative but for the parliament and the Australian people to come to the conclusion that the government intends to use these philanthropy provisions in this bill as a device to accept donations or gifts from either private individuals or corporations and not only to cover up those gifts or donations in failing to disclose them but to allow those gifts and donations to be tax deductible. They should not be tax deductible in that circumstance if you have an operation, a front, like the Greenfields Foundation which masquerades as a charitable trust but in fact is nothing other than a shonky funding arm of the Liberal Party that now has been found by the Australian Electoral Commission to be an associated entity of the Liberal Party under the terms of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</para><para>The government want to have these Liberal Party entities able to receive donations that are tax deductible. They want to have a process in place that is nothing other than a transparent rort. As far as the opposition are concerned, and I certainly hope as far as the Senate is concerned, we are not going to accept this. Why won't the government accept these Greenfields amendments if they do not want to use this device in the shonky interests of the Liberal Party? Why won't they accept one of the proposals that have been placed before this committee by the opposition? You have to ask yourself that question, Madam Chairman. The reason is that the Liberal Party have absolutely every intention of using this shonky deal, this rort, to receive donations, to allow those donations to be tax deductible and to have the Greenfields Foundation—which is a self-declared charitable trust—be able to use
 this device. I do not think the Senate should cop it. I do not think the Australian people should cop it, and I will tell you what: the opposition will never cop it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>11711</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government have requested the Senate to reconsider basically two blocks of amendments, one of which contains the amendment that relates to, in broad terms, the Greenfields Foundation and related matters and tax deductibility for donations to such foundations. The other is the Democrat amendments which broaden tax deductibility for people donating land or putting conservation covenants over their land. These are both important issues, and I will speak to both of them as briefly as I can while still giving them sufficient substance to explain our position on them. I am sure the opposition think they are important issues, although they spoke only about the Greenfields amendment and did not actually express any commitment to the environment as part of their comments on the amendments before us. But I am sure that is implicit in everything they believe in, and I hope their concern for improving our taxation treatment and providing incentives for people who want to improve land conservation is as strong as their concern as to whether or not the Liberals might be getting some extra donations through a dubious source.</para></talk.start><para> On behalf of the Democrats, I will speak particularly to the amendments related to conservation measures. I acknowledge Senator Campbell's and Senator Hill's comments about what the government are considering doing next year in relation to developing a comprehensive package of measures to provide improved taxation incentives for environmentally responsible behaviour or other activities that would lead to improved environmental protection. We would not want to give the impression that we do not believe they are genuine in relation to that, and we appreciate the commitments they have given on the record.</para><para>In his comments on the motion he put forward, Senator Campbell said that issues such as these need good quality research and that we need to put them forward as part of
 an integrated policy package. I am quite pleased that the government like the idea of developing an integrated and broader policy package to bring forward more measures to provide taxation incentives for people to protect the environment. Nonetheless, the amendment put forward by the Democrats previously and accepted by the Senate is a self-contained proposal. It does not affect the operation of the taxation act or put the rest of it out of kilter or anything like that. It is a clearly defined proposal—self-contained and quite workable. No argument has been put forward that it is not workable in a legislative sense so I do not see why such a positive measure should be removed while we wait for the promise of an integrated policy package somewhere down the track.</para><para> I know that the government have enormous resources, much more than the Democrats have, and could bring a lot of extra assistance to bear in relation to some of the research on this. Nonetheless, I would not want to let the comment pass about the need for good quality research without putting on the record that, given the limited resources that we have—certainly we could do with more resources to assist us in our research—the research that the Democrats receive through our staff and through people who assist us, including people in the environment movement who assist us in researching amendments such as this, is of the highest quality. Given the time of year and the valedictory nature of the speeches already made and those that will come after, it is probably appropriate to put on the record that the research the Democrats receive from our staff and from those in the community more broadly who assist us is of the highest quality. Some good quality research has gone into this amendment. I am sure the parliamentary secretary was not trying to imply that it had not or that shoddy research had led to this amendment, because it was good quality research. It is a good quality amendment that will produce good quality outcomes for the environment.</para><para>While the offer put forward by Senator Hill is appreciated and, as I say, is recognised as genuine, nonetheless, the Democrats believe that the amendment we have put forward and
 which has been agreed to by the Senate is of good quality and will produce clear-cut outcomes. The fact that the government are willing to consider producing even more good quality amendments or proposals of their own is good stuff. But I do not see why we should sacrifice this one in waiting for other proposals to be put forward. So the Democrats at this stage are keen to insist on the amendment that we put forward and that was agreed to by the Senate in relation to environmental measures, particularly improving the taxation incentives for land conservation.</para><para>The government's reasons for not supporting the amendment include such things as its cost as well as its effectiveness. There is no doubt that this will be effective. If the government can come forward with other proposals that are even more effective, then we will be at the front of the queue supporting them. In the context of the costs, work has been done that gives some indication of the costs. As with any of these measures, it is hard to give a precise cost because it is hard to know what take-up there is. As I said in my contribution when this bill came up the first time, people may think any forgone revenue—it may be $2 million as CSIRO suggests, or maybe it is $4 million—due to a measure such as this is worth while because it is such a good measure; they may even be prepared to forgo greater revenue.</para><para>In a sense I hope there will be a larger forgone revenue in the short term because that would mean a greater saving for the taxpayer in the long term in terms of having to repair environmental damage. In a sense the cost, while important, is a misnomer because whatever cost there is to forgone revenue now would be repaid many times over. Indeed, the greater the forgone cost, the greater the benefit in the long term. Nonetheless, if the chamber chooses to insist on this amendment, the government would have plenty of time to provide costings and extra assessment of this measure. We would be happy as a party to look at that when they bring those extra resources they have to bear on this issue and this measure.</para><para>There has been no suggestion put forward from any side in relation to this proposal that
 it is not workable or that it will not produce a positive conservation outcome or indeed that it will even produce a negative financial outcome. I do not think it is something worth backing away from at this stage. I hope the chamber agrees with that.</para><para>The bill as a whole does contain some other positive measures, including environmental measures. I acknowledge those and congratulate the government on them. I find it difficult to understand why the government would be willing to sacrifice proceeding with all those positive measures simply because of this small measure, but that is a decision for them to make and justify.</para><para>The Democrats also considered seriously the Greenfields amendment, and it is appropriate for us to address it in our comments. As I indicated previously when this amendment was moved by the opposition, the Democrats support for it is in no way meant to suggest that we believe it is the government's intent to try to use this bill to assist in the generation of slush funds or the provision of extra incentives for people to donate to front organisations that may then fund the Liberal Party. I am not particularly interested in allocating intent to the government about that. Nonetheless, it is best for public confidence in the political system. The government would be insane to ever try to prescribe the Greenfields Foundation as a prescribed private fund, but any other fund could be set up in the future that may be there to assist any political party—except the Democrats, of course, who do not get into that sort of thing. The broader principle at stake is one that is worth taking seriously, from a policy point of view as well as from the point of view of public perception.</para><para>The government have given a reasonable explanation of their rationale for not accepting this amendment, which ends with the statement that the amendment is unnecessary from their point of view. It may be unnecessary from their point of view, but it does not create a problem and they have not put anything forward to say that this amendment stuffs anything up—it does not ruin the tax act or make it harder to do anything. If it is unnecessary and just makes the tax act a
 couple of extra paragraphs longer, that is not something that is insurmountable for the government. It may be unnecessary from the government's point of view, but they have not put forward any reasons why it is a problem. Until they do, I see no reason for the Democrats to change their position.</para><para>Senator Faulkner put forward to Senator Kemp a number of other options to address this. As I said before, I cannot imagine the government would ever want to prescribe the Greenfields Foundation as a prescribed private fund. Ascribing, hypothetically, bad intent to the government just briefly, they might want to set up some other fund to do dubious things, but they would never do it with the Greenfields Foundation. I do not know why the government could not give the commitment to issue a direction in writing, through the Treasurer, as is contained within the bill, that the foundation would not be a prescribed private fund and thus resolve the whole problem. If the amendment is that much of a difficulty then they could go down that path. I realise that, politically, you do not want to give any hint that there is anything dodgy about the Greenfields Foundation—you would not want to give credence to that—but if this amendment is that much of a problem for you, then I suggest you reconsider going down that path. You are never going to do it anyway, so you may as well solve the whole problem and issue the declaration in writing as you are empowered to do under the provisions in the original bill. But that is just a suggestion to the government as a way out of the particular amendment.</para><para>At the same time, we do still have the other amendments there in relation to improving environmental landcare, and I am sure the opposition are equally committed to those as they are to the issues of the Greenfields Foundation amendment, despite their not commenting on them at this stage.

 they are definitely worth insisting on. We do not believe they will cost a significant amount.

We would encourage the government to have an extra think about that in the intervening period when they get to reconsider the legislation, assuming that the Senate agrees to insist on those amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>11713</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Briefly, the position I find myself in is trading between the Greenfields argument and the argument for the tax deductibility of land donations.

In fact, he invited me to make some comments in relation to those amendments which cover environmental gifts. The amendments extend the government's proposals for increased tax concessions for philanthropy to environmental philanthropy. The amendments propose to create a new kind of philanthropy where land-holders donate land of conservation value to approved environmental bodies, or, if they enter into environmental covenants over land that they continue to own, the land-holders will be able to claim as a tax deduction the economic loss that they incur. This will be a significant incentive for land-holders, many of whom will be farmers, to conserve remnant ecosystems. At the moment these land-holders generally face the
 economic incentive to clear the land of its natural habitat and put the land into production either from cropping or from grazing.</para></talk.start><para>This proposal before us has had the support of the Senate. As I understand, it has the support of the entire environmental movement. It has the support of the CSIRO. Frankly, I think that Senator Hill probably actually supports it as well. Senator Hill came to the Senate to oppose the amendments but did indicate at the time that he agreed with the principles. I think that he probably supports the proposals but has decided on some sort of cynical political trick to try and announce them himself next year and then perhaps claim them as the government's own initiatives. That would be the way we would expect Senator Hill to do business.</para><para>In relation to the question of environmental gifts, this bill is bringing in a new regime of taxation for philanthropy, and it is for that reason that the opposition takes the view that this bill is the appropriate place for the Senate and the parliament to deal with measures dealing with environmental philanthropy.

Hardly a week or a question time has gone by without us having to deal, in one form or another, with tax—initially with the ANTS package

I want to specially mention here that our thoughts are with Senator Boswell, in what will be for him and his family a very difficult Christmas.

He was only 21 years old when he hanged himself in a police cell in Wee Waa 18 years ago. The lawyer from the Aboriginal Legal Service who had represented Mr Murray around that time described him as a vibrant young man, full of life, defiant and purposeful and someone who was
 not suicidal or defeated by life itself. Only a few days ago another branch of the Murray family, this time from Walgett, lost their son who, coincidentally, was also called Eddie—Eddie Russell. He was 25 and found in a cell in Long Bay Gaol in Sydney with a television cord around his neck.</para><para>Both of these deaths should never have occurred, but they are just two stories behind the statistics. They are two families whose lives have been devastated by the sorrow and the sheer waste of Aboriginal deaths in custody. The recent case of Eddie Russell breached what I regard as a phenomenal number of the recommendations of the royal commission. As we go into the celebration of the season, I think we should also remember those who have lost people, particularly those in recent times.</para><para>Eddie Russell's death sums up the pitiful state of affairs of Aboriginal incarceration in Australia, and it shows that, after so much money having been spent and so much energy being expended in conducting a thorough, unprecedented national inquiry, we really have not progressed much at all. The fact that Eddie Russell was in that cell is an indictment itself.</para><para>We have had a royal commission which produced 300-odd recommendations and the core theme of that was about keeping Aboriginal people out of custody. Despite the money that was spent, a recent report from the Australian Institute of Criminology found that since 1989 when the royal commission started there had been 99 Aboriginal deaths in custody. Since that time there have been another 147 Aboriginal deaths in custody. The alarming thing about that figure is that indigenous people might represent only two per cent of the Australian population but they constitute more than 15 per cent of all of those who have died in custody. Something must be wrong, when we look at those statistics. If death does not discriminate, then our justice system must.</para><para>I think it is appropriate on this occasion, without dampening the high spirits, to remind the Senate that Aboriginal people across Australia were greatly heartened by the fact that the federal government of the day did
 call a royal commission in 1987. We all thought that finally there would be answers, finally there would be solutions and strategies put in place that would stop Aboriginal people from dying in custody in such extraordinary numbers. Finally, we thought, there would be some accountability. But time has shown that our expectations were perhaps too high. Aboriginal deaths in custody have in fact escalated, reaching a peak in 1995 of an additional 17. It is not surprising that in recent years the number of indigenous youth incarcerated has increased by some 55 per cent. These increases in indigenous adult and juvenile justice imprisonment have outstripped any increase amongst non-indigenous people.</para><para>It is fair to ask on this occasion the questions that Aboriginal people are now asking about why and why and why. Where has all the money gone, what has it achieved, and why are people still dying in custody? Government words have not translated into actions. It is hardly surprising, though, when you consider that there is no longer any requirement by the Commonwealth government for state and territory governments to report on what steps they have taken to implement the recommendations of the royal commission. It is now simply at the discretion of state and territory governments to choose whether or not they report on the steps they have taken to implement those recommendations, and many choose not to. The only organisations monitoring are those like the Australian Institute of Criminology and the various community based organisations and support networks that are there for the families in their hour of need.</para><para>My plea to the chamber is best summed up in the words of Ray Jackson, of one of these groups in Sydney. Mr Ray Jackson said, of the royal commission's final report, that this is a living, breathing report and it cannot be allowed to die. We as senators of the Australian parliament have a responsibility to all Australians, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, to truly give effect to all of the recommendations of the royal commission. It perhaps is too late to save the life of Eddie Russell, but it is not too late for real outcomes to be delivered to Aboriginal people and outcomes
 that will deliver living people to their families. If we as senators are to fulfil our responsibilities to indigenous Australians, then we have to grapple with all of the factors that have contributed to these groups being in this position.</para><para>I remind the Senate of one of the recommendations of the commission. I think it is particularly relevant and could become a means of reviving cross-party support for the implementation of the more than 300 recommendations. That recommendation relates to the objective of reconciliation. In the overview, Commissioner Johnston, back in 1991, spoke about reconciliation. He said that the process of reconciliation demands a very strong commitment to the elimination of Aboriginal social, economic and cultural disadvantage, which is the basic reason for the disproportionate number of Aboriginal men and women in custody.</para><para>There needs to be an effective response to the ongoing and growing numbers of Aboriginal deaths in custody. I would say to senators that there is a new need to commit to the following. There needs to be a return to the full cross-party support for the implementation of the recommendations. We need to renew our commitment to report annually on what steps are being taken by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. Federal, state and territory governments need to honour their commitment that was made during the 1997 Ministerial Summit on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and we as senators need to reaffirm our commitment to eliminating indigenous disadvantage with the recognition that this will only be achieved through empowerment, self-determination and reconciliation.</para><para>In closing, I think it is apt to remember the people who tonight and over the Christmas period will be locked away in jails. To them and to everyone here I want to send my wishes and respect and we wish them a merry
  Christmas as well. I wish that to everyone here on this occasion.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</title><page.no>11720</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>11720</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been here for 24 years or so.

</para><para>(b) The rationale for the change in methodology was to more accurately measure exposure of individual animals, thus countering the principal criticism by the international radiation research literature of the earlier study. Mobile phone fields are highly directional, with different spatial orientation affecting the amount of energy absorbed. As a result, in the previous study it was not possible to determine the specific exposure levels (the specific absorption rate—SAR) of individual animals. The changed method in this study improves the precision of SAR measurement. The increased number of mice will improve the statistical power of the study.</para><para>(c) Yes. Motorola donated the special exposure tubes to restrain the animals during exposure, ensuring a fixed spatial orientation to the field so the dosimetry is well defined.

The highly specialised equipment, designed and manufactured by Motorola to obtain as close to "real life" simulation as possible, would not have otherwise been available.</para><para>Independent monitoring of the exposure systems and specific absorption rates (SAR) was undertaken by Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) during installation and commissioning, and continues on an ongoing quarterly basis.
