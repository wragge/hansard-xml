I am surprised that someone who has been trying to chase the seat of Holt for some years would not at least pass through Dunkley from time to time and see a few signposts up. Obviously you did not need any assistance from the local member. Certainly, there was no shortage of people offering their comments on their pet projects—and that is not confined to our side of the chamber. I suspect that most of you were asleep at the wheel and did not bother. That was the real problem. You were scurrying around taking instructions from the ACTU when you should have been out in the community looking at what sorts of projects there were that might have deserved support. That would have been a lot more productive.</para></talk.start><para>I certainly do recall paying a visit down there and I remember that it struck me at the time that it completely vindicated the objective decision we had made on the merits of 
 the project. That is always very important. I think that was one of a number of the projects that would withstand close scrutiny—in fact, all of the projects would. That is critically important if the Labor Party wants to continue to rabbit on about this issue. I have to say it must have been a bit gloomy this morning when the old tactics committee got together and said, `What have we got to show for yesterday?' There were five questions on the subject, and all they got was a bit of a run in the <inline font-style="italic">Aus</inline> which confirmed the proposition that I put yesterday, and that was that you do not slavishly follow the advice of bureaucrats.</para><para>Let us get back to the main game here. If the Labor Party are critical of these projects, do they object to the restoration of the Great Synagogue Tower in the Sydney seat of Sydney? Do they object to the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">Polly Woodside</inline> and Federation Tapestry in the seat of Melbourne? Do they object to the restoration of the Naval Stores and the Commissariat Museum in a Brisbane marginal seat? Do they object to the National Wool Museum in Corio, or the development of the Tuggeranong Homestead in Canberra? One could go on. The fact is that Senator Faulkner put his very big foot in this some days ago when he claimed that there were 16 shonky projects. All I can suggest to you is that when you get together for the post mortem afterwards you start to do a bit of serious homework, you go through these projects and try and make some judgments—you might even get Senator Collins to visit a couple more of them. She might even find out who the local members are, and then you can start to make a judgment about whether these projects were worth while. When you do that, I think you will find that they all stack up very well indeed.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7589</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

Of course, it sounds as though nothing has been learnt from that fiasco. The fact that Mr Billson might have been critical of the project really did not come into our considerations. I am interested that the experts in bottom fishing on the other side somehow think that because we exercise independent judgment we are rejecting advice. This is just a canard that has been peddled by the likes of Senator Faulkner for weeks on end. This must be about the fifth occasion that he has tried to get this issue off the ground. It has gone nowhere for the simple reason that everyone who has studied it understands that there is a discretion there. What the bureaucrats actually said was, `If you want to take the cut-off point that we insert arbitrarily, you only need to look at 114.' We actually did our homework and looked at the lot. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>7590</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>7590</page.no><name role="metadata">The PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Order!

We only have to go back to the early 1990s when that extraordinary deal was made to phase out the analog service without any replacement in prospect, and then, to compound the felony, to sign up to legal agreements which would have exposed the Commonwealth to hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. The idea of simply doing a deal without having any idea of what might follow was probably the height of short-sighted stupidity, and demonstrates without doubt that the Labor Party was not interested in letting the technologies sort themselves out or in trying to develop a long-term policy approach.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Bourne interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—Do not get excited—you will get a cheap phone in the very near future because I am about to confirm that today Telstra has announced the new pricing structure and services for the CDMA network.

I am not here to spruik, but that does sound, on the face of it, like a pretty good deal.

Telstra analog customers will be able to connect to CDMA with no connection fee. I do not need to remind the Senate of the inherent superiority of digital services, but certainly CDMA and GSM will offer services such as advanced message bank, call forwarding, calling number display and call waiting, and, when we get to the third generation, even Senator Lundy will be able to work out which button to press to be able to access the Internet. You will have your own flat panel screen that will fold out and you will be able to play to your heart's content.</para><para>While you are taking time off to claim for your RSI disability, can I entreat the Labor Party to simply reconsider the Luddite position they adopted at the last election. Remember Senator Schacht? This is his great claim to fame, apart from being the almost endorsed candidate for Makin—and we wish him well in that regard. Makin will be a very tough call, but if anyone from Labor can do it, Senator Schacht can. But his lasting contribution to ensuring the Labor Party lost the last election was to bag the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. There was about $150 million left in it, but they said they would freeze it. That came on top of being opposed to the Natural Heritage Trust Fund a few years back, and when the Telstra bill came up in the chamber only a matter of a few months ago they were at it again. It was tragic. Senator Boswell had a field day going all around Queensland—he even went outside his home state—pointing out the fact that we had a whole series of initiatives to benefit regional and rural Australia and the Labor Party opposed every one of them. That is the tragedy: they have no interest at all in attending to the needs of regional and rural Australia. Today also happens to be the day on which the final four per cent will get their digital data connections—very good news for rural Australia.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program</title><page.no>7591</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7591</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston.

Certainly, I can recall the announcement of a number of very good projects at a time when I think there was a particular interest in those projects. As Senator Conroy well knows, the guidelines in relation to the caretaker convention make it perfectly plain that, as long as the decisions are taken before the election is called, there is no particular significance attached to making those announcements at a time that might be most suitable to all concerned. All I can say to Senator Conroy is this: you ought to take a visit out there—and apologise to Mr Baressi when you do—drive past his electorate office so you get it fixed in your mind, then go on to the particular project area and ask them what they think of it.

If that is right, that is very good news indeed, because that is the first time that anyone on your side of the chamber has actually been prepared to come out and endorse one of these projects. Why can't you look at some more of these projects and come to similar conclusions? Senator Conroy presumably has some trace of cultural heritage in him. He goes to Victoria Park from time to time; he must know what it means. All he has got to do is go little bit further.

It may have something to do with some legal obligations that, perhaps, it is better for me not to comment upon in the Senate. Senator Woodley, I am aware that you are chairing a Senate inquiry into the BAe146 and the problems with the cabin air.

All of these projects were selected prior to the calling of the election and were then announced at a time of our choosing. That is what we did. There is a suggestion that somehow you should not announce things during a campaign. Let us remember the sorts of things that Labor did in 1996. It was not just $715,000; Senator Faulkner put out another press release promising to provide up to $25 million to the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. He then went on to announce that the Bureau of Environmental Economics would receive $2.8 million of new funding over four years. That was on 27 February. How long before the election was that?</para></talk.start><para>He announced $1.13 million, allocated over four years, to fund a major Labor government commitment to lead international efforts in the conservation of the albatross. There it is: it is on the record. You cannot have it both ways. If there were some projects that were ticked off before an election that were good news and that the voters might be interested in, you cannot say that somehow we should not announce them. Clearly that was not the approach Labor took three years ago. They chose to announce projects which, on the face of it, all seemed to be good news projects, so I cannot understand why they would be objecting to us announcing some good news projects. After all, those people who suffered for 13 years were looking for a bit of relief. They knew that they had a bunch of philistines running the show for all that length of time, and they were very interested in knowing whether there was going to be something in the area of cultural and heritage announcements. That is why we made the announcements we did—because we thought it was important that they be aware of them and they could take them into account if they chose. I very much doubt that these would have been 
 huge vote swingers but, nonetheless, they were projects of importance, they were projects of significance and they were projects that deserved to be funded.</para><para>I think Senator Faulkner said there were 39 projects that went to Liberal seats. The fact is that 38 of the projects, or 64 per cent, were located in the 62 per cent of electorates held by the coalition, and 18 projects, or 30 per cent, were in the 33 per cent of seats held by Labor. Three projects, or five per cent, were in the five per cent of seats held by Independents, and one project went across multiple electorates. I would have thought that was a scrupulously fair allocation. It reflected the proportion of seats as held by the parties prior to the last election.</para><para>But that is a matter of interest to the political aficionados. It is really not the bottom line at all. The bottom line is whether these projects deserved to be supported, and that is where we have had this deadly silence from the Labor Party. They have not been prepared to single out one project. Go and ask Dick Adams in Lyons whether he objects to the Woolmers Heritage and Cultural Estate project on the Clarendon Homestead. Did Duncan Kerr object to the historic female factory site in Denison? There are a whole swag of these. They are all very good projects.

If Senator Cook would wish to reflect upon history, he will recognise in fact that the timing of the election was during the normal cycle when announcements are made under the Natural Heritage Trust. At this time of the year I am addressing the bids for Natural Heritage Trust grants, and in the next few months we will be making those announcements. This is one year on from the last election. So, yes, it was within the cycle, it was at the appropriate time, and this government was very pleased with those announcements under the Natural Heritage Trust.</para><para>I might say on that subject that, with regard to Bush Care alone—the revegetation of Australia—this year I expect to approve some 1,700 individual projects across Australia. This is a tremendous commitment by ordinary Australians through such organisations as Landcare to restore the health of the Australian environment. We are proud as a government that we set up the Natural Heritage Trust—$1.5 billion being reinvested in the environment of Australia—and we are proud of the fact that community groups are prepared, with the funding support of government, to lead on it and put in their own 
 labour and their own efforts to help make a difference.</para><para>The Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program was somewhat similar. That was a $70.4 million project—part of the total $1 billion Federation Fund project—aimed to support communities in their support of historic and cultural assets with grants of up to about $5 million. We are pleased that, out of the 740 applications that we received, we were able to support 60 of those projects across Australia. We would have liked to have been able to support more, but there is not one single project that was not deserving of the funding it received. Interestingly, this Labor opposition has not been able to designate one single project that was not deserving of that support.</para><para>Yes, this government will use funding from time to time to support community projects, and it will do it properly. I invite Senator Cook to go through the 1,700 approvals that I will make this year in relation to Bush Care. I will invite him to see if he can find one that has been wrongly applied. We exercise this task with care, but we accept the responsibilities of ministers. That means that we do not always accept the officials' advice. We always take the officials' advice into account, but we make the decisions in accordance with the responsibilities we have, and we are proud of that.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7599</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I remind the minister that I am questioning him about unethical behaviour by the government at election time. Don't these announcements of over half a billion dollars constitute conclusive evidence not only that the government ignored the caretaker convention which states that `it is desirable, if the decisions concern significant initiatives, that they be announced in advance of the caretaker period in order to avoid controversy' but also that many of the projects announced were obviously and deliberately held back for announcement during the election campaign itself? With regard to your explanation about the appropriate time for announcement, does that mean that you have scant regard for your obligations under the caretaker conventions at 
 election time? The difference between now and last year was that we were having an election, Minister.

If, in 13 years of government, Labor had done more to support the natural, cultural and historical heritage of Australia, all Australians would be better off.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regional Forest Agreement: North-East Victoria</title><page.no>7600</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7600</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Vic</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage.

The North-East Regional Forest Agreement which has been signed by the Prime Minister and Premier Kennett is an excellent demonstration of this government's ability to produce excellent conservation outcomes while protecting jobs. The RFA, which covers an area of some 2.3 million hectares in north-eastern Victoria, will provide 20 years of security for the timber industry and, more importantly, 20 years of security for those 500 people who depend on that industry for their jobs.</para></talk.start><para>This government recognises the important role that the timber industry plays in regional 
 Australia. In the north-east region, milling operations in towns like Mount Beauty, Mansfield, Myrtleford, Whitfield, Corryong and Benalla all play an essential role within the economic and social fabric of these communities. The RFA will maintain timber supplies at current levels and, with increased investment and value adding that will flow from the security of the agreement, both the Commonwealth and Victoria are confident that it will in fact help increase employment in the industry.</para><para>Through the Forest Industry Structural Adjustment Program and other arrangements that are being negotiated, we believe that this should also enable the mill in Mount Beauty to be secure. From an environmental perspective, the outcome in the north-east is outstanding—174,000 hectares will be added to the reserve system, which is an increase over the status quo of 42 per cent. The agreement will mean that just under 50 per cent of all public land within the region is preserved within the reserve system.</para><para>The agreement has, as far as practicable, achieved our national targets on public land. Of particular interest to many will be our decision to protect the Upper Wongungarra catchment, which will be added to the Alpine National Park. This is an area with high quality old-growth forest. Importantly, it will provide a protected habitat for the endangered spotted tree frog. The RFA also provides enhanced protection for other rare and threatened species. For example, the agreement establishes a 17,500 hectare special management zone to protect the habitat of the long-footed potoroo. Additions to the reserve system will also provide protected habitat for the powerful and sooty owls, the yellow bellied glider and the gang-gang cockatoo.</para><para>This is the third RFA signed in Victoria and the fifth nationally. As a result of those five RFAs, over 800,000 hectares has been added to the reserve system since the Howard government was elected in 1996—an outstanding result for Australian forests. Over the coming months we will be concluding RFAs for another six regions. By any measure, this government has stayed true to the intent of the National Forest Policy Statement negoti 
 ated by the former Keating government—an initiative which we have been happy to acknowledge and to implement. The only thing missing in the equation is legislation which will further increase the security provided to those working in the timber industry, and that legislation is before the Senate at the moment. The issue now is whether the Labor Party is finally prepared to come on board and support what this government is doing in providing security for jobs and better environmental outcomes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7601</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Vic</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

They elevated 16 projects which ranked below the 15-point threshold to ensure that they had a range of potential announcements across marginal electorates and electorates which were vulnerable to One Nation. When members of the Liberal campaign committee, including Senator Alston and Senator Hill, detected slides in the coalition polling during the campaign, they would roll out a heritage announcement to give the local candidate a big hit in the media—a media bang with the 
 taxpayers' buck; all contrary to our caretaker conventions.</para><para>But now we have two tables which starkly demonstrate and illustrate the fix that went in by the ministers. The first chart, this predominantly blue chart—blue for coalition seats—shows that 33 of the 39 grants were rolled out in the election campaign in an attempt to save coalition members from electoral oblivion. There are One Nation vulnerable seats here like Herbert, Maranoa, Wide Bay and, later on, Leichhardt. All seats which might have had a state One Nation member of parliament within their boundaries, or one directly adjacent, and were under threat got prompt attention. Senator Hill in particular, it seems, really fixed his attention on Bass to save his ministerial colleague Warwick Smith. Bass got three grants: one on 8 September and two on 16 December last year.</para><para>There are government marginals here like Leichhardt, Lilley, Macquarie, Deakin, Gilmore and Adelaide—all receiving special attention during the election campaign. How many Labor seats received a grant? I invite you to look at the red on the same table—Canberra and Fraser. Those particular grants were announced by Senator Reid because the polling showed that her Senate seat was under threat; it was being eroded by the Democrats. On that basis, you could say that 35 of the 39 announcements were made to see coalition members save their skins in the election. Senator Reid announced two Federation and Cultural Heritage Program projects in the ACT worth $1.15 million. She also announced $10.5 million worth of other federation grants—the National Centre for Christianity, plus the Federation Centre. And she helped turn the sod with John Howard for the National Museum. Senator Reid was very busy with heritage issues during the last election campaign.</para><para>After the election, in a global press release, Senator Hill and Senator Alston announced the leftovers. That is illustrated on a separate chart—again, Labor in red, coalition seats in blue and Independents in yellow. I invite you to look at the difference. In blue are the grants announced in the coalition seats in the election campaign, and in this chart are the 
 grants announced after the campaign. This chart is top-heavy with Labor electorates. That is the difference. There are two in the seat of Sydney; there is one in Prospect; there is one in Reid; there are two in Perth. There is a joint project in Batman, Jagajaga and Scullin, which are three adjoining Labor seats. All in all, out of the 28 grants announced after the election, 14 were in Labor seats and three in Independent seats. The problem is that Senator Alston and Senator Hill have been caught out here.

A total of 741 applications were received and the projects were evaluated by a task force made up of officers from DOCA and the department of the environment. The annoying part this afternoon concerning the announcement during the caretaker government period led me to glance at the media release put out by Senator Faulkner on 22 February 1996 during his dying days as minister for the environment. Interestingly, he talked about $1.3 million going towards the preservation of an albatross and the fact that albatrosses are a symbol of hope. There is an albatross hanging around the neck of Senator Faulkner. It is a dead albatross. It is called pork-barrelling and the Ros Kelly memorial whiteboard and long will it stay there. We know where the pork barrelling started. As I have said, Senator Faulkner and his colleagues have a master's degree in this subject.</para><para>Our projects, the federation projects, were evaluated against six very important criteria, the significance, the lasting nature, the appropriateness of them for the Centenary of Federation, the benefits to the broad community and partnerships and funding. I am very pleased to say that in my own state of South Australia some particularly commendable projects received funding. Among them are the Ayers House museum development and the Port Lincoln Civic Hall. Interestingly enough also, the Commonwealth railway museum received funding. I find that quite amusing. During their period in government the Labor Party managed to turn the entire Commonwealth railway system into a museum, so it is interesting that they should be grizzling about funding to adequately and appropriately conserve what is left of it. The 
 Mawson collection, commemorating the incredibly brave expedition of Sir Douglas Mawson, also received funding. In South Australia $6.5 million worth of funding was allocated. I am very pleased to say that all of those communities were very happy with the allocation. How interesting it is that no-one on the opposition side has criticised one single project. There is nothing in there that they are prepared to criticise.</para><para>The facts about this issue are that the task force appointed gave a project score of four for each of the six criteria, leading to a score out of a total of 24. Ministers made their decisions using both sets of advice available to them, together with their own allocation, and projects were then selected for eligibility. It is a joke to sit in here during question time today and hear questions coming from the other side related to pork-barrelling and rorting of community grants when the searching and the trawling that went on through the Natural Heritage Trust and the trawling that is going on today have not turned up a single thing. Yet still they go on. I suppose the only thing we on this side of the chamber can do is take heart that there are no questions on the economy, because the economy is in very good shape. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>7605</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Then Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, let the cat out of the bag on election night, when he told ABC television:</para></talk.start><para>Specific project announcements were always held back for announcement during the election campaign.</para><para>Never mind that that is grossly improper under the caretaker provisions that bind a government during an election campaign. Those provisions are there to make sure that governments do not use the public purse to buy their way into office. What did Tim Fischer say? He said:</para><para>Specific project announcements were . . . held back for announcement during the election campaign.</para><para>Tim Fischer is guilty on two fronts. The first is that he was being too honest. He was not supposed to blow John Howard's cover by doing that. He let the cat out of the bag. The 
 second is that he is guilty of understatement. The total value of the projects announced during the election campaign was $557 million—over half a billion dollars that this government announced during the election campaign in order to buy their way back into elected office because they had the GST as an albatross around their neck. Let us be honest about this. That is what that was all about.</para><para>I am not saying that many of the projects that were announced are not worthy; obviously many are. But the timing of the government's announcement is unethical and is in conflict with the caretaker provisions. That is shonky, it has to be said, and the taxpayers in Australia do not expect their taxpayers' dollars to be purloined by a government to slip itself into office by announcing projects at an electorally sensitive time in order to buy votes. No taxpayer thinks that is a proper use of their dollar.</para><para>Let me give you a few examples, Madam Deputy President, of what I mean about the timing here. There was—no doubt a worthy project—$2 million for the Maroondah heritage estate in the city of Maroondah in Victoria. It was timed to help Mr Phillip Barresi, who holds the marginal seat of Deakin, where there was a margin of 2.5 per cent—very marginal in a GST election. Remember when I recite these dates that the election was on 3 October. When did Senator Alston announce the grant for the $2 million for the heritage estate in Mr Barresi's electorate? On 23 September, within the caretaker period, 10 days out from the election. That is when he announced it. Is that funny timing? Why did he have to announce it then, given that he announced all the losing bids after the election? Couldn't he have announced it then? Of course, in a marginal seat of 2.5 per cent it is to do with trying to influence the voters to vote for the coalition, overcome the GST.</para><para>It goes further. What did the city of Maroondah expect when it came to when this announcement would be made? They understood the announcement would be made in November. They got a hell of a shock when it was made before the election—on 23 September, 10 days before the election—because they were led to believe they were 
 going to be told the outcome of their project application in November. Was this propitious timing or not? Let us see what then happened. Mr Phillip Barresi, who is the sitting member—with a 2.5 per cent margin, remember—got a supplement into the <inline font-style="italic">Maroondah Post</inline>, the local throwaway in his electorate, on 29 September, just a few days before the election itself. Fair enough, but, in order to have prepared the elaborate piece of publication and inserted it into the throwaway going into each home in that electorate, he must have known beforehand that this announcement was coming. If he did not, it was the slickest piece of publicity that anyone has ever seen. It strains credulity to believe that there was no foreknowledge in this case.</para><para>That is one example. There is another example, the Frankston community arts centre—again, no doubt, a worthy project in its own right. This relates to Mr Bruce Billson, the coalition marginal member for that seat. Mr Billson is sitting on a 3.4 per cent margin. Mr Billson is so well thought of by this government that they flew him to Adelaide to assist in the selection of the Natural Heritage Trust selections. He sat at the back of the room in order to aid the government—no doubt with his deep knowledge of marginal electorates. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>7606</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was a valiant effort, Senator Cook.

Where are the opposition's questions to the government asking it to explain its success in giving us a continuing low inflation rate, the lowest and continuing lowest for 10 years? Where are the opposition's questions asking the government to explain its success in having the strongest economy in the area and possibly the strongest in the world?</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have not had any questions from the Labor Party on those important issues—which every day Australians are interested in, because they mean jobs to them, income to them and a strong standard of living.</para><para>Where are the opposition's questions to the government asking it to explain its success in delivering business confidence? Not one question. Not one question from the opposition about any issue of significance to the Australian people today. The Australian electorate has judged the Labor Party and judged them harshly, and they will continue to judge the Labor Party harshly while they continue to raise issues which are of no importance to the electorate at large. They are trying to stir up trouble. They are trying to raise issues when in fact projects under this Natural Heritage Trust are benefiting the people that they are trying to disparage.</para><para>In each of those areas, there is not one of the projects allocated to any of these areas that they have said is not a worthy project. And yet the opposition come into this chamber and day after day ask questions of total insignificance when there are all the important issues going on in our country today. There are all the successes that this government has had in giving us the strongest economy in the region, in putting people to work. This is something that the Labor Party when they were in government could not do—a party that delivered us 10 or 11 per cent unemployment rates, 17 or 18 per cent interest rates, and inflation rates much higher than we have today. That is all the Labor Party could 
 deliver us when they were in government: not one good bit of news for Australia at any time. They come in here harping and carping about projects that have been allocated to electorates. And in each of those cases they have not once said that the projects that were delivered were not worthy.</para><para>The ministers responsible had a responsibility to make sure that the money that was allocated to projects was actually allocated to those projects which were most worth while. It is very difficult to allocate projects to Labor Party electorates when they do not hold any. Prior to the last election, the Labor Party held very few seats. Of course there were a number of marginal Liberal seats, because this government won so many seats at the 1996 election that there were bound to be a lot more areas covered by Liberal or National Party held seats.</para><para>Talking about the area of Australia and the area where many of these natural heritage projects took place, instead of Senator Faulkner showing us a bar graph of seats that are held by Labor and Liberal, perhaps he could have showed us a graph of the area of Australia that was held by government seats. You would find that there are so many areas and so many applications from all of those seats that it was likely that there were always going to be projects allocated in some of those areas that are outside the metropolitan area.</para><para>I do not know when the Labor Party are going to come to their senses and start to question this government to try to find some information about those things that are happening and things that have been done by this government that are so successful. For heaven's sake, I hope they come to the stage where they start asking questions about why this government is so successful and running the strongest economy in this region. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>7607</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We only had to go to the words of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, himself to understand just what a hole this government has dug itself into on this matter. I know the minister was biting his tongue 
 about the words he uttered when he said that we were digging up a `dead cat that's 12 months old'. He recognised that this is a dead cat that stinks to high heaven. He recognised it in words from his own mouth.</para></talk.start><para>You realise that Senator Alston was the Liberal Party campaign director in Victoria. He was well attuned to which were the marginal seats in Victoria, which were the seats that needed propping up. You really have to shake your head when you hear comments such as he made in the answer he made to the second question that he was asked today by the opposition, in relation to grants in Mr Barresi's seat of Deakin. He said, `We were making these announcements at a time suitable for all concerned.' It certainly was suitable for Mr Barresi of Deakin. They were announced so that he could have a newsletter out in his electorate six days after the grant was announced, and he could have a how-to-vote card distributed in his electorate nine days after the grant was announced, mentioning the grants in both of those publications. Anyone who knows how long it takes to have things printed in an election campaign knows that you would be stretching credulity to think that Mr Barresi had not factored that into his campaign. Indeed, he had the advantage of having the Liberal Party campaign director as one of the people signing off on the very grant.</para><para>The material that Senator Alston had in his hand showed that the overwhelming majority of grants were actually announced in the campaign. And remember there were a number of decisions made before the campaign commenced—only just, but before the campaign commenced, but they were selectively announced. Only those which were deemed to be of advantage to the Liberal Party in their campaign were announced. Certainly no-one was told that they had missed out. We would not want anyone told that they had missed out and being disappointed that the government had not favoured them! The government was trying to wring whatever credibility it could out of the process from those people. And we have the statement that the announcements were made at a time `suitable for all concerned'. Certainly it was suitable for the 
 member for Deakin and the member for Dunkley.</para><para>There was reference in one of Senator Alston's answers to Ros Kelly. He made an analogy with Ros Kelly and said that it sounds as though nothing has been learnt from that. I will tell the minister what we have learnt from it. If Ros Kelly had to go, then there is no doubt that in this case both Minister Alston and Minister Hill have to go as well. We realise why these ministers are stonewalling, why they refuse to come clean, why they refuse to provide the information that is being asked for, and why they refuse to answer questions which would elicit that information: they know that the more the facts on this matter come out, the deeper the mire they are going to get into on this. Everyone who has listened to question time over the last couple of days would have noticed that there is a deliberate evasion of answering the questions that have been put on this matter, because to answer them will put these ministers even deeper in the mire.</para><para>This is part of a pattern in which the Deputy Prime Minister said on election night that $557 million in grants were announced during the campaign; they were announced strategically for campaign purposes and in breach of the caretaker convention. When the Deputy Prime Minister says that, there is no answer from Senator Hill, no answer from Senator Alston; they simply refuse to answer the questions and go on with their diatribes against the opposition.</para><para>Senator Hill answered a question in relation to the RFA. I want to draw an analogy from that answer, because on the eve  of the announcement of the Victorian election there was an announcement relating to a Victorian Regional Forest Agreement. He referred in that answer to the protection of the spotted tree frog and the yellow-bellied glider. That is appropriate, because that is about on par with the nature of the improper announcements that were made to save Mr Billson and Mr Barresi. Their benefits were only part of that $557 million in grants announced during the campaign. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>7608</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition's pathetic at 
 tempt to wring something politically damaging to the government out of the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects and, more specifically, something against Senators Alston and Hill reflects really nothing more than the parlous policy position that Labor is in. By my adding, I think it has taken up about a dozen questions over the last sitting week without landing a blow, but the opposition persists. It is difficult to see how the opposition can keep it up in the face of such flagging momentum.</para></talk.start><para>I have listened very carefully to the various questions over these days and to the answers, and what appears to be the substance of the allegation—I think there are probably three—is first of all that there was political bias in the distribution of the grants. That simply cannot be sustained on any basis. It is simply wrong because, of the 60 successful projects, we know that 38, or 64 per cent, were located in the 62 per cent of electorates held by the coalition; 18, or 30 per cent, were in the 33 per cent of seats held by Labor; and three, or five per cent, were in the five per cent of seats held by the Independents. One project went across multiple electorates. That, on any view, must be a fair distribution. So it simply cannot be sustained—at least that part of the allegation—that there was any political bias in the distribution of the grants.</para><para>The next allegation seems to be that the grants were in breach of the Australian National Audit Office—the ANAO—guidelines. That cannot be sustained either if you have a look at the facts, as, firstly, it has been made perfectly clear that there was not at any time a recommended list of projects. Certainly, advice was received, and that has been explained in ad nauseam detail by the two ministers who have answered questions in the Senate. It simply shows a failure on the part of the opposition to understand what the responsibility of ministers is when looking at these grants and making these assessments. Quite clearly, ministers have a clear obligation to bring their own independent and objective minds to bear on the advice that they receive in assessing any project—and indeed they would be in breach and it would be dereliction of their duty if they did not 
 bring their own minds to bear on the projects. You certainly do not need to follow bureaucratic advice to the letter; what you need to do is to take it into account.</para><para>The third complaint, which also cannot be sustained, suggests that projects announced during the 1998 election campaign were in breach of the caretaker convention. Indeed, that seems to have been the gravamen or the substance of the question time matters today. What happened was that all of the projects were selected prior to the election and some were announced during the election. That was not really anything out of the ordinary, because the Labor government did that too, which I will get to in a moment if I have a chance. So it is hard to see how the opposition can keep a straight face when making this allegation. If you actually go to some of the examples of grants that were made during the caretaker period by Labor you can see that they seem to have turned it into an art form, with grants of some $25 million announced by Senator Faulkner on 15 February 1996 for the Paralympic Games. On another occasion $715,000 was announced for the River Murray Corridor of green projects, and so on. It simply cannot be a sustainable objection that any of these grants were made or announced during the caretaker period. It is simply an unwarranted attack and it is time to move on from this. It has not worked. You have not succeeded in establishing any breach of convention or indeed any impropriety. It is simply time to end the bottom drawer paranoia.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>7609</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>7609</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I seek leave to make an explanation under section 191 regarding remarks I made in a speech in the chamber yesterday.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—I thank the chamber.

It is perfectly possible—it has happened, and will happen again—that the cabinet, being very powerful in the Commons, may inflict minor 
 measures on the nation which the nation did not like, but which it did not understand enough to forbid. If, therefore, a tribunal of revision can be found in which the executive, though powerful, is less powerful, the government will be the better; the retarding chamber will impede minor instances of parliamentary tyranny'</para><para>This warning is as relevant to Australia in 1999, as it was to England in 1861.</para><para>As stated in Odgers' Australian Senate Practice, if a bad government possesses all powers, then all powers may be abused, but a strong Senate in a bicameral system acts as a safety mechanism against despotism, corruption, or ineptitude.</para><para>In order to offer the high level of representation and protection envisioned by the founders of the Constitution, it was necessary to constitute and elect each house by a separate distinctive process.</para><para>The Senate is elected by proportional representation, unlike the House of Representatives, in order to best reflect the diversity of electoral opinion in Australian.</para><para>The states are also guaranteed equal representation in the Senate, and this provides a crucial balance to the numerical advantage enjoyed by the more populous states in the House of Representatives.</para><para>Due to the rigid two-party system and compulsory preferential system in Australia, virtually all votes in the House of Representatives ultimately go to either the Labor party or the Coalition, and just 14 independents have managed to win seats in the House of Representatives since 1946.</para><para>This has resulted in the two-party domination and hegemony of parliamentary debate and economic and social policy in Australia, and the imposition on an unwilling electorate of all sorts of objectionable policies ranging from multiculturalism to National Competition Policy.</para><para>This is an unacceptable situation for the 20% of voters who voted for someone other than Labor or the Coalition in the House of Representatives in the 1998 federal election.</para><para>For these voters who have been effectively disenfranchised by the two party system, the Senate offers the only relief, where it is possible for independent candidates and small political parties to regularly get elected.</para><para>The operation of the Senate in fulfilling its constitutional role of countervailing government power and operating as a house of review has been the source of constant complaint from governments for many years, regardless whether Labor or the Coalition has been in power.</para><para>That the Senate fulfils its constitutional role very effectively is irrelevant to government politicians, who view it as a threat and maintain that the Senate `destabilises the political system'. 
</para><para>Yet when in opposition, these same politicians take full advantage of the operation of the Senate to further their own political goals.</para><para>The fact that the House of Representatives is dissatisfied with the powers and the conduct of the Senate at times is evidence in itself of the necessity of the Senate.</para><para>The easiest way for the government to obtain a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives is simply to get more votes buy enacting legislation that is more acceptable to the Australian people.</para><para>Methods to hamstring the Senate include replacing proportional representation with preferential voting, changing the number of senators representing each state, or imposing electoral thresholds.</para><para>In 1988, the Australian people wisely rejected a referendum to alter parliamentary terms so that all senators were elected at the same time. This would have increased the chance of one party or the other winning a senate majority.</para><para>This bill will preserve the current operation of the Senate by entrenching proportional representation as the method of electing the Senate.</para><para>As this is a constitutional amendment bill, it must be passed by an absolute majority in both houses of parliament.</para><para>It must then be put to the Australian people by referendum according to section 128 of the Constitution.</para><para>Item 1 of Schedule 1 of the bill will repeal the first paragraph of section 7 of the Constitution and substitute:</para><para>`The Senate shall be composed of Senators for each state, directly chosen by the people of the state, voting as one electorate, using a method of proportional representation that shall be uniform for all the states'.</para><para>Item 2 of Schedule 1 will repeal second paragraph of section 7, which will remove the ability of the Commonwealth to allow the Queensland Government to divide the state into divisions for the election of senators.</para><para>Items 3 and 4 of Schedule 1 add to end of section 122 of the Constitution: `subject to this section' and `A senator to represent such territory shall be directly chosen by the people of the territory voting as one electorate, using a method of proportional representation that shall be uniform for all such territories.'</para><para>The effect of items 3 and 4 is to ensure that a senator for any territory acquired by the Commonwealth will be elected in accordance with section 7 of the Constitution.</para><para>These changes, coupled with the requirement under section 24 of the constitution to maintain twice the 
 number of House of Representative seats as Senators, will make it very difficult for a government to change the Senate status quo which has served us so well.</para><para>History has shown that as political power concentrates into fewer hands, accountability decreases, while bad policy and the potential for corruption increases.</para><para>John Stuart Mill said in his book, `Representative Government':</para><para>`The consideration which tells most, in my judgment, in favour of two Chambers (and this I do regard as of some moment) is the evil effect produced upon the mind of any holder of power, whether an individual or an assembly, by the consciousness of having only themselves to consult.

He wants to present himself as a Jekyll but in fact he has, through Mr Tuckey, presented the Hyde face, the dark and antisocial face of the debate in this country.

The vexatious forest industry is destroying much of the natural heritage of this country against the wishes of 80 per cent of Australians, not least the Western Australians, Tasmanians, Victorians and New South Wales people who are directly involved so far in this RFA process. The Prime Minister should have been in the business and in the process of getting this industry relocated, with jobs safe in the plantation basis which is available. But since the regional forest agreements came in, the jobs have been shed from the industry, as we knew the woodchip industry would have it. In Tasmania 480 jobs have been shed since the regional forest agreement came in. Where has been the minister's condemnation of the woodchip industry for shedding those jobs? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>7616</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Despite some of the interjections from those opposite, I am not trying to waste time on this issue.

There is a secondary issue involved here that I am uncertain of—and that is only through failing memory as an ageing apparatchik that is nearer the door to leaving the chamber forever—and that is the efficacy of moving in this chamber a censure motion of someone in another chamber. I have a dim memory that the coalition here has done that in the past, but I cannot remember. Senator Brown may have looked up the precedents on this and may be able to assist me, because he will have a right to respond if this debate is not fully occupied. I do not know that it is a great system if we can censure someone in another chamber who is not here to defend themselves. On the other hand, Senator Brown's party is not represented in the House of Representatives, so I understand why it may have to be taken up here.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But I do have a difficulty. I do not recall the Labor Party, and I stand ready to be corrected, in my time in this chamber moving a censure motion against someone in another chamber. I have said before that I think censure motions are pretty much devalued in this chamber through overuse. The last one carried here was when Senator Hill was censured, and it was the flimsiest one I have ever seen in terms of a substantive case against a minister. We all voted out of form on that but, you know, it was not the toughest case ever run against a minister.</para><para>In conclusion, I also put on record my regrets that I have never had a censure motion even put against me, let alone carried, in this chamber. I do not know whether Senator Brown would consider attaching my name to 
 Mr Tuckey's, just to help me out here. You can imagine the tragic circumstances when you front up to the preselection panel and the first questions is: Senator Ray, why have you never been censured in the Senate? Shamefully, you have to admit that you are so well-behaved and have such propriety that in fact you have never ever managed to provoke a censure motion against you.</para><para>Whether censure motions should ever be regarded seriously, given their rather tawdry history in this chamber, I do not know, but I have to respect the fact that Senator Brown may take them very seriously and may have a strong case to put. We do not want to waste too much time today but we would like to give him the opportunity to put those views, because I think he feels very strongly on them. But I do put Senator Brown on notice that this is a sort of one-off support on a censure motion, that we would like them to be taken seriously and not moved week by week. I am not saying that Senator Brown would do so, but it is a rather serious step.</para><para>If Senator Brown is given the opportunity to respond, I would ask him—or any coalition senators—to indicate to me whether there has been a precedence for this chamber moving a motion against a minister in another chamber. I have a feeling, just in the back of my memory, that there might have been, and maybe we will get that checked.

I want to respond to Senator Ray, firstly, and say that I understand there have been similar censure motions before but, of course, it is logical that the Senate must be in a position to be able to censure an aberrant minister in the House of Representatives, where the government has the numbers to prevent any censure being put forward if the circumstances arise. That is part of the fundamental independence of the two houses.</para><para>Let me assure Senator Ray that I do not raise this matter lightly or frivolously. It is a very serious matter and, as a conservationist, I find it particularly serious that this minister has not fulfilled at all his portfolio responsibilities for conservation, let alone conservation of forests. In fact, in every move, every statement and every action he has made since that appointment by the Prime Minister, he has vilified conservationists. He has added to the unpopular moves to put the Australian forests in line for further destruction and he has also, I believe, deceived the very people 
 he purports to support—that is, the workers in the industry.</para><para>And there I come back to my final submission in the earlier debate. Since the regional forest agreement, which was touted to make safe the jobs of those in the industry, was signed in Tasmania, 480 jobs have been lost in the industry. Since woodchipping arrived in Australia in 1969, which has seen 20,000 jobs lost out of the industry, the whole process has been not only kept up in the wake of the regional forest agreements but accelerated. Mr Tuckey has done nothing about that. In fact, he supports regional forest agreement legislation which does nothing at all to protect or compensate workers in their jobs or workers who lose their jobs. In fact, what he has helped to bring before this parliament is a bill containing a massive compensation clause for the real victors in this process—that is, the giant woodchip companies. Under section 7 of that legislation, with this minister's support, they would be given multimillion dollar compensation from the taxpayers of Australia, through the federal government, if in some future case they are denied access to the wild forests of Australia because the public demanded and sought federal action to protect those forests.</para><para>I predict that that is going to happen. The regional forest agreement that Wilson Tuckey, the minister, has become the chief advocate for is a prescription for broadscale destruction of forests from Western Australia through to Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales and extending into south-east Queensland. But the Australian people are not going to stand for it. The opinion polls repeatedly show that the vast majority of Australians out there—be they Liberal, National Party, One Nation, Green, Democrat or Labor supporters—are opposed to the continued destruction of our wild forests.</para><para>I ask all senators to look at those figures, because that is the feeling we should be representing. Minister Tuckey had the opportunity to usher in a win-win situation where those forests would be protected. This parliament has the power and the ability to give transitional funding to the enormous plantation base which can supply all of Australia's 
 forest needs and which, with downstream processing, could have created, and should be creating, thousands of jobs. Instead of that, he has gone for the failed past prescription of keeping the big woodchip corporations in the jarrah and karri forests, in the world heritage value forests of Tasmania and in the rainforests.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, you should see the massive pile of rainforest woodchips now on the Burnie wharf. For a quick profit, these ancient ecosystems are ready to be transported to the Japanese pulp and paper mills in the coming months. That is beside the enormous pile of eucalyptus woodchips on the same wharf. It is an override of an earlier move by Burnie City Council not to expand that wharf. Now they are going for a third pile of woodchips in this age of regional forest agreements—a la Minister Wilson Tuckey—which not only does not lead to a wind-down of this destruction but leads to wholesale slaughter and puts the forests at the behest of those sitting in the boardrooms of a few big woodchip corporations.</para><para>With them go the jobs. Woodchipping is not a job creator; it is a job destroyer. I feel sorry for the Forest Protection Society, which sides with the woodchip corporations and with Minister Wilson Tuckey in this process. I understand that, in recent times, of those 480 jobs lost in Tasmania 40 were out of the industry that transports the logs to the ports of Tasmania and to the woodchip mills. More than 30 of those were cardholders for the Forest Protection Society. What do they get from this society—this front for the woodchip corporations—for their adherence to it, for turning up at protest meetings and for their vilification of conservationists?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—What do your people get?

It is not in their interest to underwrite anybody, least of all the workers. They know that their profit line is enhanced by getting rid of the workers, and that is why I am disgusted with the behaviour of this minister. He is not a conservationist—he has never purported to be one; the Prime Minister knows he is not—and he is in favour of destruction of the forests. As minister for forestry, he purports to be a supporter of jobs in the industry, and so does Prime Minister Howard, but everywhere that they sign these regional forest agreements the job slaughter goes on.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Ha!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Senator Abetz laughs at that, but it is no laughing matter for those people in Tasmania who have gone to the wall and who have been fooled, deceived and let down by this disgusting regional forest agreement process now overseen by this failed minister.

I do not know whether these logger vigilantes were there on the acceptance podium with him just a couple of weeks ago. This is a symbol of violence from this minister, who should stand for peace and creativity in the forests. He is a man who talked about war in the forests in Western Australia when he should have been talking about peace. He is a man who said that costs should be reclaimed from the arrested conservationists who had been behaving in an allegedly illegal way, but he has not called for a cost restitution from the thugs, some of whom I daresay he has rubbed shoulders with when they went into the bush—the peaceful bush—on the weekend to beat up and intimi 
 date citizens simply because they had a different point of view and had the guts to be out there in the forest peacefully defending it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is the behaviour that leads to a police state. That is the behaviour that pulls the rug from under democratic norms. That is the behaviour of violence. That is the behaviour of failure, not of success. This minister deserves censuring. He has not got an apologetic bone in his body. Maybe that is part of politics, but we should be able to expect sense from him. We should be able to expect a move for a win-win situation, and we should be able to expect him to carry out the responsibilities of his portfolios.</para><para>Minister Tuckey says he speaks frequently with the Prime Minister. I would like to know how much Prime Minister John Howard has goaded him into the destructive attitude he has taken in an already volatile situation in Western Australia, let alone around the rest of the country. It is time for the Prime Minister, if he is dinkum in wanting that portfolio to stand for both forestry and conservation, to put an end to this failed ministry—this destructive and inflammatory ministry. It is time for the Prime Minister to carpet Wilson Tuckey and tell him he is sacked.</para><para>The least he could do is bring him in and tell him he is responsible for the division that is boiling in Western Australia because the majority of people right across the political spectrum are having their aspirations for the future of forest heritage in that state denied them by the political process. What a remarkable situation it is when the Court government itself responds to that public feeling and Wilson Tuckey then fights that government's democratic response. What an extraordinary situation that is.</para><para>The Prime Minister, of course, is involved right up to his neck in Wilson Tuckey's actions. He appointed this man knowing his record and knowing that he is no fixer. He is a destroyer not only of forests but also of the public wish to reach a win-win situation, which is available. A minister who fails as comprehensively as that deserves to be censured. I do not move this motion lightly. I do not take it frivolously. This is a serious situation in our country which should never 
 have occurred. Certainly the events of last weekend would not have occurred, I believe, if Minister Tuckey had been acting according to the demands of the very pivotal ministry he has on this vexed issue. He deserves censure. I believe he deserves dismissal. The Prime Minister should be the one acting here, not the Senate.</para><para>I believe the Senate has a very heavy responsibility here. I hear what Senator Ray says. We cannot bring forward motions like this frivolously or because we have a bee in our bonnet or because we happen to take a different point of view. It is a serious matter. We have a seriously failed minister here and I am fearful about him staying in that portfolio. I am fearful that what happened last weekend could get worse. I am fearful that this minister, instead of pouring oil on the troubled waters, is simply going to put another match to the whole situation. It is not good enough. It is time to call him in.

Indeed, what we heard today from Senator Brown is, I would have thought, a most inflammatory speech. Why doesn't the honourable senator take his own medicine and try to calm the situation down a bit? He is not interested in doing that because he somehow thinks that his political lifeblood is associated with inflaming environmental issues in trying to desperately grasp for votes. Indeed, in recent times, the Greens have seen political demise in his home state of Tasmania. As a result of his former leadership of the Greens, they now have one Green in the Tasmanian parliament and in this parliament there is, of course, now only Senator Brown left.</para></talk.start><para>The mover of the motion has in fact gained for himself a reputation for divisiveness, inciting violence and damage to persons and property unparalleled in recent times. The mover of this motion is the one and same person who presided over a demonstration in 
 my and his home state of Tasmania when the regional forest agreement was signed and where $6,000 worth of damage was done to the car in which the Prime Minister was travelling and clothing and uniforms were wrecked. Did Senator Brown come into this chamber rubbing his hands and being concerned about that sort of violence and that sort of inflammatory behaviour? No, because he was at the heart of it. Because he was at the heart of it, it is somehow okay despite the damage to a vehicle and property. Of course, we all recall the shameful behaviour at a demonstration in Tasmania—in which Senator Brown took part—where the Prime Minister's wife was jostled.</para><para>I would have thought that sort of behaviour would be abhorrent to any decent thinking Australian. Indeed, it is therefore quite duplicitous for somebody with such a record to come into this chamber feigning his concern about somebody inflaming a situation when he himself has been involved in conduct a lot worse—being at the forefront of damage to people's property and being at the forefront when the Prime Minister's wife was jostled. The credibility of the mover of this motion is zilch—nil. There is no credibility whatsoever.</para><para>Now, with breathtaking audacity, he moves this censure motion, asserting falsely that the popular Minister for Forestry and Conservation inflamed the conflict in Western Australia over the sensible regional forest agreement in that state. Let me stress at the outset that we on this side have complete confidence in our Minister for Forestry and Conservation, the Hon. Wilson Tuckey MP. I invite the Democrat and Independent senators to consider the deficient state of the evidence put before this Senate by Senator Brown and to reject the motion. In considering the paucity of the evidence, they might consider the overwhelming evidence on the other side of the debate—as so articulately put in a Department of Conservation and Land Management information bulletin dated 23 August 1999, signed off by Neil Burrows. It says:</para><para>If, like me, you thought that anti-logging protesters were gentle, passive people who were trying to save the forests, then you're wrong. There is an extreme element in the "green" movement, which is violent, aggressive, and which is lashing out at 
 a society they do not want to be part of. They will use any controversial issue, including the forest debate, to vent their anger at society.</para><para>Late on Friday afternoon last week, I was working in my office at CALM when a group of about 25 banner waving, chanting protesters burst through a door to my office which opens to the outside of the building, but is not the public access to the building. I asked them to leave my office and tried to block them from moving into the main building. I was overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers. Then I was set upon by one of the group who attacked me with fists flailing. I attempted to fend off the blows but was struck on the side of the head and in the throat.</para><para>Did Wilson Tuckey occasion this? Did he inflame this? Or was it the greens and people like Senator Brown who inflamed this sort of violent behaviour?</para><para>If the Democrats and Independents in this place want to be in the game of censoring people, they ought to seriously consider—if that is what they believe—the alleged faults on both sides, because it would be disingenuous, indeed dishonest, of the Senate to seek to lay blame on only one side when the people who are undoubtedly the supporters of the green movement behave in such an outrageous way. The bulletin continues:</para><para>The group shouted abuse and questions at me and howled me down whenever I tried to respond.</para><para>He went on to say:</para><para>My grandfather and my great uncles did not put their lives on the line in two world wars for a society that resolves internal issues by mob violence.</para><para>I invite Independent senators and Democrats senators to consider the credibility of voting on this motion without taking into account that this sort of conflict within the community usually involves two sides. Are we really saying that the honourable minister is responsible for the greens' physical attack on an innocent public servant going about his job? Of course he is not. Who is responsible? Undoubtedly elements within the green movement which orchestrated that event—that violent event where fists were thrown and somebody was punched on the side of the head and in the throat—are responsible.</para><para>So I say to the Democrats and Independent senators in particular: your own credibility within the community will be enhanced if you 
 have got the courage to say, on this occasion in particular, that you could not vote for this motion on the basis of the paucity of the evidence and the clear physical violence perpetrated by others on the other side of this debate. I suggest to you, and Senator Ray I think hinted at it in relation to previous censure motions in this place: if you keep moving censure motions willy-nilly against a minister on trumped up charges, you will have a complete demeaning of the currency of censure motions in this place; indeed, they will be laughed at.</para><para>It is for the Democrats and the Independents to consider whether or not they want to be part and parcel of this demeaning process of censure motions within this place or whether they will take a stand. Indeed, I would invite them to even potentially abstain, on the basis that I fully understand that they do draw on a green constituency and, on the odd occasion, they think it may be somehow politically beneficial to them to be seen to vote for a censure of the minister. But I say to them in all seriousness: your long-term prospects will not be served by engaging in this grubby little exercise.</para><para>I would have thought that, especially amongst Democrats voters, a simple explanation—Senator Brown moved this motion—would be sufficient justification for saying that was the reason you did not vote for it. I notice Senator Greig with a smile on his face, and I am sure that his West Australian colleague, Senator Murray, would appreciate that, because Senator Murray has spoken very eloquently on this stunt.</para><para>Senator Brown addressed this issue with all the emotion and passion with which he addressed the issue of whether or not we ought to be forced to wear jackets in this chamber. We are sick and tired of hearing the same sort of emotional claptrap from a senator for whom every issue becomes a major issue.</para><para>In inviting the Democrats and Independents to consider their stance, I suggest to the Australian Labor Party senators—in particular Tasmanian Labor Party senators—that they think very carefully about supporting a motion, sponsored by Senator Brown, which, if 
 you do not read the words of the motion but rather listen to the speech, is a condemnation of the regional forest agreement within his own home state of Tasmania, which the state Labor Party fully supports. Indeed, the Labor Party in Tasmania fully supports our federal legislation.</para><para>The Labor Party members of this federal parliament who come from Tasmania are really stuck between a rock and a hard place. They know what the people of Tasmania want. The people of Tasmania want the regional forest agreement process because it is good for jobs, it is good for the environment, and it provides some job stability. The regional forest agreement in my home state, which Senator Brown has sought to condemn, put another 400,000 hectares into reserves, which means that 40 per cent of the land mass of Tasmania is in reserves. Tell me any other state—indeed, any other nation in the world—that has a similar figure. There is not one that can be alluded to or referred to, even with Senator Brown still in the chamber.</para><para>It is the most comprehensive anywhere in the world. Yet Senator Brown and the extreme Greens demand more and more to be locked up. Every time you lock up another hectare it means a loss of jobs. What the federal government has done with the regional forest agreements right around this country is to balance up jobs and conservation on a scientific and reasonable basis to ensure that both can live together in harmony. I wonder sometimes whether or not the Greens believe that human beings are part of nature. Part of the wonderful natural process, for example, is that from time to time beavers chop down trees and dam rivers. When beavers do it, it is wonderful because they are part of nature; if human beings were to do it, it would be rampant environmental disaster. I can just hear Senator Brown saying, `It will be the last living tree on earth that we cut down'—and all the other rhetoric.</para><para>What are we as humans actually allowed to do in this world in relation to natural resources? If Senator Brown had his way, would he allow one tree to be chopped down, one mine to be opened, one river to be dammed? The answer is no to each of those 
 questions. He has opposed in this place, and previously in the Tasmanian parliament, every single development which might create jobs. Indeed, he talks about woodchipping in my home state of Tasmania. I simply say to Senator Brown and to those who may have listened to his rather inept contribution: why would anybody want to sell timber for woodchips when they can command a higher price by selling it for saw log? It makes no economic sense. Even if they are purely motivated by greed and nothing else, surely greed itself would determine that you would sell that timber for saw log rather than woodchip. Why would you sell a log for woodchips and get, say, $10 instead of $100 for saw logs? There is no explanation and, of course, that is what blows Senator Brown right out of the water. When you consider the mantra that Senator Brown comes out with, it does not bear any analysis whatsoever.</para><para>The loss of jobs in my home state of Tasmania can be put down to a number of activities by the Greens. The loss of power station developments, the loss of Wesley Vale and the ongoing campaigns to stop good, sound forestry practices are all part and parcel of the Greens' activities which result every day in the loss of jobs. Then when the federal and state governments come together to put an agreement into place for job security, Senator Brown is out there seeking to condemn it. I remember a recent debate in this chamber when Senator Brown—or one of his Greens (WA) colleagues—was seeking to congratulate Holland or the Netherlands for no longer sourcing certain timbers out of the jarrah forests of Western Australia, allegedly because that country was concerned about our environmental record. That was pretty good, emotive stuff and pretty hard to argue against, until you do a bit of research.</para><para>Where was the Netherlands then sourcing their timber needs from? Ghana, from Africa. I ask you: does anyone in this chamber honestly believe that in a Third World African country such as Ghana they have a forest practices code anything equivalent to what we have in this country? Absolutely not. So the loss of that contract to Western Australia meant the rape of forests in Africa where 
 there is no forest code. Isn't it the Greens who tell us to `think globally, act locally'? What Senator Brown did on that occasion, along with the Greens, was to think locally and say, `Look after my few trees, but let them rape the forests in Africa.'</para><para>In denying the Wesley Vale pulp mill in my home state of Tasmania, he guaranteed the longevity of a polluting mill in Japan, pouring out worse pollution than any mill that would have been sited at Wesley Vale and ensuring that we would not value add our timber within this country. So he comes to this debate with a record of opposition to absolutely anything and everything that would be of assistance to this country in seeking to reverse—and this is an interesting figure—the annual $2 billion deficit in wood and paper products.</para><para>Most Australians do not realise that Australia imports $2 billion worth more of timber and paper products than it exports. Where do you think all the extra wood and paper products come from? They come from the South-East Asian forests, from the African forests and from the South American forests—from countries which have absolutely no forest codes in place. Where is the environmental sense in trying to close down our industries when we know full well the source of the much needed timber and paper is going to come from those poorer Third World countries whose environments are being absolutely ravaged and destroyed?</para><para>Indeed, Senator Brown and the Greens could do something sensible for this country and promote timber and paper products sourced from our forests on the basis that we have world-class forest codes in place, second to none in the world, and that we are concerned about replanting and regenerating our forests. The minister, Wilson Tuckey, knows that as Minister for Forestry and Conservation, if he did not look after the forests—the conservation and the replanting—there would be no forestry industry left within this country. So the minister is very mindful of that.</para><para>I come back to the motion before us. It is an unsustainable assertion that Mr Tuckey allegedly inflamed the situation over the Western Australian Regional Forest Agree 
 ment. I would be interested to hear the views of others in this debate as to what condemnation we ought to be referring to in relation to the Greens that attacked this one lonely, peace-loving public servant. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>7624</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The last few words by Senator Abetz demonstrate just how shallow his argument has been this afternoon in trying to defend the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Mr Wilson Tuckey.

There is no way that the actions of Mr Tuckey, since he assumed the role of minister, can be defended. We are, once again, having an emotional debate in this chamber on the forestry issue. It is a pity we are not devoting the time of the Senate to debating the <inline ref="r646">Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998</inline> . The government has had this major piece of legislation on the table since last year and on the Senate's <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>  since the beginning of this year. Minister Tuckey was appointed to have carriage of this primary piece of legislation. He was to get it through this parliament to enable the regional forest agreement process to be completed by its due date—that is, the end of this year. This is the piece of legislation that Minister Tuckey has allowed to sit and languish in the parliament. We are now getting towards the end of August and are yet to consider the bill at the committee stage.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is the bill that this government and this minister said was so important that it had to be debated and passed by the Senate within the first week of parliamentary sittings in February this year. It is an absolute disgrace—and clearly a dereliction of duty by Minister Tuckey—that we are now at the end of August and have yet to even get to the committee stage of considering this important piece of legislation. The reason for this is that Minister Tuckey is incompetent. That is not just the view of the Labor Party and it is not just the view of Senator Brown, whose views 
 on the forestry debate, I have to say, we have not agreed with that often. Certainly, one thing that all of the players—and, increasingly, industry representatives—have agreed is that Mr Tuckey is incompetent.</para><para>Let us have a look at his record. He was put in charge specifically to look after forestry and conservation issues, which had previously been under the charge of Minister Anderson. He was hand-picked by the Prime Minister and had the primary task of getting the RFA legislation through the parliament and having agreements reached in the nine RFA areas by the end of this year. When he took over the ministry, three RFAs had already been negotiated. Up until two months ago, there were still only three RFAs negotiated. The minister had been in his ministerial position for at least eight months with one task and one task only—to finalise RFAs around this country—and he had not done so. He then announced, in a big fanfare, that an agreement had finally been negotiated in Western Australia. This was something we had been waiting for for months. Within two weeks, the Western Australian government—his own coalition colleagues—walked away from that RFA at a million miles an hour. Mr Tuckey's first RFA in Western Australia since he became minister was thrown out within two weeks. What was Mr Wilson Tuckey's response? He was somewhere in Helsinki at the time. He was quoted as saying on the <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program:</para><para>I got preliminary advice from other sources and, in fact, I have spent three hours on the phone. I got up at 3 o'clock in the morning in Helsinki to talk to people at the appropriate time here. As I told them, if you proceed with this—I quoted some words from <inline font-style="italic">Phantom of the Opera</inline> —`There will be war between us', and that is where I stand on it.</para><para>Those were Wilson Tuckey's words in respect of his attitude to his own coalition colleagues in the Western Australian government over the Western Australian RFA. He said, `There will be war between us!'	 We all know that Mr Tuckey is prone to colourful language and is prone to bluff and bluster. In fact, he is not just prone to it; he knows no other way of expressing his views. Throughout his tenure as minister, he has constantly used inflammatory language and made speeches in which he has attacked various groups involved in the 
 forestry debate and abused them for holding their particular points of view.</para><para>It is one thing for Senator Abetz to stand here and try to apportion blame to other groups. I have to say that in this debate there have been inflammatory views expressed time and time again from all sides of the debate, because views are passionately held. We saw no greater evidence of that than back in 1995, with the blockade of this parliament. It was to try to bring about some balance and some commonsense into the debate that the Labor government pursued the development of the national forest policy statement and subsequently the RFA. But it is totally wrong for a minister charged with the responsibility of bringing about rational agreements in this industry to resort to the sort of language that he has used, of declaring war upon state governments.</para><para>That was not the only time he did it. I attended a conference earlier this year, the `Outlook 99' conference of ABARE here in Canberra. Minister Tuckey was one of the speakers and I was in the audience that day. He stood up and he stated to the audience there—an audience no doubt mainly of industry representatives, so he would have felt that he was at home talking to them—that in his view the 60 per cent figure for the protection of old-growth native forests in the JANIS criteria was never a minimum, but was only a target. What that meant was that he was not committed to the criteria that had been developed for even the protection of the minimum level of old-growth native forests throughout Australia, let alone pursuing those other objectives which are about, over time, moving to a plantation based industry and looking further into reducing our reliance upon old-growth native forests and other native forests to sustain the timber industry. He was not interested in a balanced view. His view was that 60 per cent was just a figure that, whilst it may have been in the national forest policy statement and in the agreed criteria, as far as he was concerned was irrelevant. The clear message was that he was not about to worry too much about protecting all that much native old-growth forest at all.</para><para>Minister Tuckey is losing support, quite clearly, amongst his own coalition colleagues throughout the country, as evidenced by the reaction from the Western Australian government. He is also losing support on the ground within the timber industry. His continual attacks on the New South Wales government over its record on conservation are the height of hypocrisy. The New South Wales Labor government has done more to protect and develop the national parks and the national forest estate of this country than any other government.</para><para>Wilson Tuckey's approach has been that, because it is a Labor government, he will play politics: he will deny funding under the programs for structural adjustment and other funding available to people in the timber industry. He has attacked timber industry representatives on the north coast because they dared to sit down and negotiate agreements with the New South Wales Labor government. He condemned the New South Wales government even though his own coalition colleagues in the upper house in New South Wales supported the very legislation put through by the New South Wales Labor government.</para><para>The problem we have with Mr Tuckey is that he is a loose cannon. He is exploding all over the place, attacking his coalition colleagues in Western Australia, attacking industry representatives, attacking the conservation groups. We obviously expect that he will attack us from time to time. It appears that there is no-one safe from Minister Tuckey's outrage and inflammatory approach to this issue. Of course, it is on the record that he was there the other day, clearly geeing up people in Western Australia to raise the temperature of the debate over there.</para><para>One has to ask why the Prime Minister persists with this minister. As I said, we are now near the end of August and we have not even got to the start of debating this legislation in the committee stage. It is important legislation. We have something like three or four months left in which to see the remaining four—probably five if you include the Western Australian RFA—still to be finalised and negotiated by the end of this year. On this 
 minister's current track record, it will be four or five years before he ever gets around to doing it, not four or five months. We all know that, if those RFAs are not negotiated and in place by the end of this year, real problems will eventuate. This is because of the fact that the permission for export licences is removed in non-RFA areas at the end of this year. Mr Tuckey's job is to get those RFAs negotiated, and to get them negotiated in keeping with the principles of the national forest policy statement.</para><para>I understand that we are not able to debate the legislation that is on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>—we may get to it some time later today or this week—but I cannot help but remark that we have put up quite a large number of amendments which will improve that legislation. We are hopeful that this Senate will see its way clear to passing those amendments that will improve the legislation, that will see a better outcome with respect to RFAs, that will enable the situations that have developed in Western Australia to be avoided by having some degree of Commonwealth scrutiny over the agreements.</para><para>But what has Minister Tuckey's announcement been? And, indeed, I put the Prime Minister in this particular category. What has his response been to the possibility that those amendments might be carried by the Senate? He said that he will withdraw the legislation. He will just withdraw it. He will walk away. He will take his chainsaw and go home.

All parties in the political spectrum recognise that this is not an easy situation to resolve, and that there are strongly held views on the pro-conservation side and on the industry side. But Minister Tuckey's approach is that, if he does not get his way, then he will tear up the entire script and walk away. What sort of an attitude is that from a minister charged with trying to bring about stability, resource 
 security and preservation of conservation values into the next millennium in the forest industry and in the forests of this country?</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is incompatible with the responsibilities of a minister of the federal government to be going around the country inciting people, declaring war upon state governments, making outrageous allegations about anybody who disagrees with him and tearing up the national forest policy statement.

You will remember that Mr Beazley addressed a number of representatives from the union movement here. What happened at the end of that? They attacked this building. They tore a shop to pieces and they seriously injured a policewoman. I find that extraordinary when you compare the behaviour in that particular instance with what is happening now.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If we want to talk about war, let us get the actual facts of the case right. I put on the public record right here now that it was Donna Selby, Messrs Glauser and Robertson's mate from the WA conservation movement, who clearly stated at the signing of the RFA, while being ejected by the police, that the signing meant war in the forests. This was repeated on the TV news that evening on a number of occasions. That is where the original quote in terms of war came from.</para><para>We have heard from Senator Abetz, with regard to the letter from the CALM manager, on violence by the greenies. That spells out quite clearly what the situation was there and that the law should be applied to everyone equally. I make this particular point in dealing with this motion before us because I recall an event of some years ago. I am sure people on the other side of this chamber, particularly the Labor Party, would remember this. A particular stalwart of theirs called Jack Marks, with others, had fishing shacks between Lancelin and Dongara on the west coast north of Perth. 
 What happened? The authorities sent in the bulldozers and removed those fishing shacks.</para><para>We have had in much of our forests interference with legal operations for a significant period of time. We have heard from Minister Edwardes in the Western Australian government that she is trying to negotiate her way through this and we have heard from others. We have had direct defiance, with individuals lying in front of bulldozers and mucking around with the process. In my view, they have been breaking the law. Yet there was no mention of that in the contribution from Senator Brown. Nor was there any mention of that in the contribution from Senator Forshaw. If it is good enough for the people who had their fishing shacks on the west coast to be treated in that manner and to have them removed and have to comply with the authorities, then it is good enough for the people who occupy the forests and interfere with the legitimate processes there.</para><para>I go now to the substance of what I have termed—and these are my words—`the best of the <inline font-style="italic">West</inline>'.

We heard from Senator Forshaw, who spent a lot of time not dealing with the motion but talking about how many RFAs Mr Tuckey had put together.

But you appear now to have walked away from them, because the Western Australian RFA that was signed by Premier Court and Mr Howard is the one that most closely resembles the policy positions in them. If I have time in this debate, I will go to some of those points.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I now turn to a further enlightening issue in this motion and whether it is Mr Tuckey who is doing the inflaming. I will give you the answer that was given by Premier Court when he was asked this question. He said:</para><para>"No I don't, and I want to just put something on record there—</para><para>and this was after there was full-scale disagreement between Minister Tuckey—the federal government—and the Western Australian government—</para><para>because we've had one side of this argument in relation to these protests.

Once again, the Premier of Western Australia—in this dispute 
 with the federal government about the signing of that agreement—has gone on the public record and put to bed the claims in this motion. I want to appeal to senators to remember that censure motions should not come before this place lightly. If they are going to be debated, we should make the decision on the facts before us—not on somebody's preconceived position on what they would like the RFA to be. I respect your position on RFAs, Senator Brown, and it is quite different from mine. I believe the two can work together. But you are so wrong to move this motion in this form, because it misses the mark and it misses the point.</para><para>Quite a deal has been said about Mr Burrows. I do not condone either situation. I think it is very sad that both of them have happened. But we have to have a balanced view when we are dealing with these issues. We cannot take the violent aspects of one side and walk away from the other side.</para><para>We hear a lot about community support, political support and so on, but I want to acknowledge that there is at least one person who has made his position absolutely clear—and I know there are others in Western Australia who have walked right away from Dr Gallop on this matter.

This is a newspaper quote regarding Mr Nevill:</para><para>He accused the ALP leadership of chasing new voters by ignoring its traditional constituency and, in the case of the forests issue, rejecting working people.</para><para>That is a very important statement, because it reflects on the forest side of Minister Tuckey's responsibilities and the fact that, having had an RFA put in place, these people were entitled to expect some certainty about what happened. Those people are not traditional Liberal Party supporters. In fact, I had the beautiful experience—and they were virtually all AWU and CFMEU members—of being cheered at a rally that I spoke at, because we were standing up for the timber workers, something that the Labor Party in Western Australia seem to have forgotten.

In fact, the reverse is the situation. It has not been Minister Tuckey who has been inciting violence in this matter. He took a very opposite position, as I have spelt out very clearly. In terms of the incitement, I find it deplorable that some of our wealthiest people in Perth in Western Australia went down there and incited people to feel very angry about how they have been treated and about how they have had their jobs just swept under the carpet after an agreement was put in place and signed off. Dr Keith Woollard came out and said, `At the end of the day I don't really care about those particular facts.'</para><para>In summing up, there is no evidence of inflammatory statements in any of the tape 
 recordings of Minister Wilson Tuckey; there is no evidence produced in any of the newspapers—none whatsoever. You can look at the transcript of the Peter Kennedy interview done after the rally at Parliament House where he spoke. You can look at the ABC interview with Eion Cameron. You can work through all these things and no case has been put. Nor has a case been argued. There is criticism of the RFA process as it existed, and we have heard that before. There has been criticism because the RFA legislation before us has not gone through, but that is nothing to do with the resolution before us.</para><para>I once again appeal to the Democrats and the other people here on this matter: censure motions should not be taken lightly. They should not even be on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> unless you can back them up with evidence and facts. If this motion is carried, it will demean the quality, the meaning and the impact of a censure motion, because the people listening and the people out there will know darn well that it has been put here on false pretences and false grounds and that it has no substance which would allow it to be carried with credibility.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>7629</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking to this censure motion I reiterate that this is not to be taken as my first speech. I will be as brief and as to the point as I can. This is not a forum for further debate on the forests issue; it is specifically a debate on the behaviour of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation outlined in the motion before us. The Democrats support this motion because we believe that censure of this minister is richly deserved. Senator Crane asks that the Democrats, in particular, do not take this lightly. I say: we do not. We do not take any decision lightly, particularly given our position in the current chamber.</para></talk.start><para>What is at the core of this motion is the behaviour of the minister—not the issues surrounding him—and most particularly how it relates to Western Australia. The regional forest agreement is no doubt a very contentious and highly emotive issue, but it is precisely because of that that the minister must be reasonable, sensitive and diplomatic. If only that were possible from this minister.</para><para>I recall that, some years ago, after the tragedy of Port Arthur, the federal government moved to introduce gun control. That too was a contentious and difficult issue for some people. In part, it resulted in a rally of many hundreds of people in my home city which, for reasons that I do not understand, degenerated into a forum for homophobia as speaker after speaker claimed that gun control was some kind of strange conspiracy orchestrated by the gay community. People outside and inside this rally held banners and posters which read `Register poofters, not guns'. The guest speaker at that rally was Mr Tuckey, who echoed the sentiments of all those at this meeting and argued for the principle that gun owners should not be registered whereas gay men should be. As a gay man and an advocate for my community, I know personally the chilling effect that has on people and on communities. I have seen first hand how irrational, intolerant statements from public figures affect people in the wider community.</para><para>If the recent statements by Minister Tuckey had been made by an ordinary citizen, perhaps they would not have mattered so much. If a citizen had expressed the view that the greenies or the loggers were wrong, fine; that is public debate. But when a minister makes the specific claim, `Those people down there don't respect the law; why should anyone else?' referring to the conflict between the loggers and the forest preservationists, then it stands to reason that there is a cause and effect between that intolerant statement and the violence that resulted only days afterwards.</para><para>This motion is not specifically a referendum as such or a motion specifically asking us to decide whether or not the minister is right or wrong in his arguments. What is in question is his behaviour. The Democrats argue, and I argue, that, whatever Minister Tuckey may think, it is what he says that is most important, and what is needed right now in this emotive and divisive debate is a sense of leadership, tolerance and respect, none of which this minister has shown. For that reason we support the motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>05:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>7630</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too would like to take the opportunity to speak on this censure motion.

Of course, he is known to his friends and foes alike as `Iron Bar' Tuckey because he has got such a long history of confrontation and antagonism, a long history of inflaming sensitive situations for his own perceived political ends.

He has a deserved reputation in his own electorate, in the Liberal Party and in Australian politics for his approach to the political and parliamentary process.</para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, knows Mr Tuckey very well and is well aware of this sort of approach.

There is just no subtlety about Mr Tuckey. There is no delicate touch about Mr Tuckey. There is no deftness in dealing with difficult and sensitive issues from Mr Tuckey. He is the bluntest of political instruments imaginable.</para><para>On the forest issue he has been a loose cannon. He has been absolutely out of control. I would say, let's face it, he is bonkers; he is absolutely bonkers. When Mr Howard decides to bring Mr Tuckey into this sensitive portfolio, is it a stroke of political genius on Mr Howard's part to bring in Mr Tuckey to one of the most sensitive and important portfolios in the government, that of forestry and conservation? What he has done in this portfolio from day one is to act consistently in bad faith. The regional forest agreements in Victoria and Tasmania, while I do not think anyone from any side of the argument would consider them to be perfect, at least have been implemented with as little pain, including as little pain to the government, as possible. But that was, of course, before we 
 had Mr Tuckey enter the field. That was the tactical genius in bringing Mr Tuckey into this area of ministerial responsibility. That meant that the next RFA in line, the one in Mr Tuckey's own backyard in Western Australia, he immediately turned into a political bushfire, which is still burning out of control thanks to Mr Tuckey. What do you expect, I suppose, if you bring someone like Mr Tuckey into something so delicate and serious as negotiations around regional forest agreements? It is the approach that Mr Tuckey has always adopted—that is, a bull in a china shop.</para><para>I think many would agree that the inflaming and inciting of timber workers who find themselves in a difficult situation in relation to the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement is simply unconscionable. I think that ought to be placed on record. I have got no idea what was in the Prime Minister's mind when he brought Mr Tuckey back from overseas to fix a bushfire that was really already out of control. It was an argument that the Prime Minister had ignited himself in an exchange of insults with the Premier of Western Australia, the Liberal Party's Mr Richard Court. You would think the Prime Minister must have known what would be the inevitable result of bringing someone like Tuckey back to get him involved. I would say that the responsibility for the mess that we have lies equally with Mr Howard and Mr Tuckey. You cannot leave Mr Howard off the hook in this. I remember reading this in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper on 29 July 1999:</para><para>Forestry Minister Wilson Tuckey has vowed to lock up $15 million in Federal money earmarked to help the timber industry in retaliation for the Western Australian Government's about-face on the Regional Forest Agreement.</para><para>The next day in the same newspaper we read that Mr Howard had moved to tone down Mr Tuckey's fighting words, claiming that Mr Tuckey would not withdraw the money to punish Western Australia, but he left open the possibility of change to the financial arrangement as a result of the new deal. So you had the Prime Minister trying to dig Mr Tuckey out of a hole on that one.</para><para>We have mentioned in the Senate before the fact that one of the matriarchs of the Liberal 
 Party, Dame Rachel Cleland, bagged the appointment of Wilson Tuckey. She said:</para><para>Howard appointed Wilson Tuckey with the specific duty of doing the best he can for the industry against all the people who want to keep the forests. "You can't respect a man who does that, and that's Howard, whom I once did respect. I think that he is governing an Australia that no longer exists. He is governing in his own mind an Australia that existed 30 years ago."</para><para>This was said by Dame Rachel back on 30 April this year, when this was all starting to warm up in Western Australia. You now have the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party in meltdown.</para><para>I am surprised that Senator Crane wanted to get into the censure motion debate today. After all, he has a preselection to try to protect over there. Perhaps he has no hope of winning it anyway and he thinks he cannot make any more enemies than he already has. I commend Senator Crane for his courage in getting involved in the debate, because he basically said that the whole of the state division of the Liberal Party was completely wrong in their approach to this important issue.</para><para>But Mr Tuckey is always taking on members of the Liberal Party and his coalition colleagues. He took on John Anderson. He claimed that the RFA issue was heating up because Mr Anderson was too busy in a big portfolio to give forestry his full attention and to stop greens hijacking the debate, so he had added the responsibility to Mr Tuckey. Mr Tuckey bagged Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. I read in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper:</para><para>Tuckey says he and Robert Hill are now like two lawyers presenting both sides of the case to John Howard as the judge who decides the final form of the agreements. Sources say that as recently as this month Howard declared in Cabinet that the bottom line in the forests debate was regional jobs.</para><para>Senator Hill got his office to come out and say that they were `bemused' by the idea that Mr Tuckey was needed to keep the process on track, pointing out that the earlier RFAs in Victoria and Tasmania were relatively uncontroversial, unlike those in Western Australia and New South Wales after Mr Tuckey had been appointed. Then we read that he had 
 clashed heatedly on a couple of occasions with Ms Tehan, the state conservation minister in Victoria, over the accuracy of her department's calculations on the sustainable yield of timber available for public native forests.</para><para>But they all pale into insignificance compared with the absolute bucketing that Mr Tuckey has deservedly got from his coalition colleagues. You notice that, with the exception of Senator Crane, all the other Liberals from Western Australia are completely silent. That is significant. They are silent on the issue, with the exception of poor old Senator Crane—no-one has told him that Richard Court and the other mob over there have got the numbers. But apart from Senator Crane, no-one in the Western Australian Liberal Party stands ready, willing or able to come out and support Mr Tuckey, because he is indefensible.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Crane interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—I do not know if you read today's <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>  editorial on this issue. I did. This is obviously a very dominant issue in the political environment in Western Australia. The editorial said:</para></talk.start></continue><para>Indeed, reports of balaclava-wearing thugs wielding weapons, of a photographer's arm being seized and an attack on a conservationists' centre with an incendiary device send a shudder down the spines of most Australians.</para><para>I am sure that is right, although they do not send a shudder through Senator Crane and Mr Tuckey. It said:</para><para>State Environment Minister Cheryl Edwardes believes Federal Forestry and Conservation Minister Wilson Tuckey's comments have inflamed the situation—and she is partially right.</para><para>Mr Tuckey is not noted for adopting a conciliatory approach to problems and many people fail to understand why Prime Minister John Howard appointed him to such a sensitive portfolio.</para><para>That is true—the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>  newspaper has that one absolutely right. It went on:</para><para>His continual attacks on Richard Court, Geoff Gallop, Hendy Cowan, Cheryl Edwardes—indeed, anybody who does not see the forestry issue his way—has made him plenty of enemies and done his cause little good.</para><para>It is not sufficient for Mr Tuckey to deny that he incited violence. Government ministers have a 
 duty—and none more so than during such emotionally charged situations—to choose carefully words for public consumption. We expect them to lead by example and to ameliorate society's trouble spots, not exacerbate them.</para><para>Mr Tuckey, however, prefers to employ words like anarchy, disaster and war when talking about the problems.</para><para>That says it all, that is what this is all about and that is why we have a censure motion in the Senate today about this particular minister.</para><para>Earlier this afternoon, my colleague Senator Ray raised, first of all, the important question about the appropriateness or otherwise of this matter going through without debate. There is no question that you can devalue a censure motion to the extent of it just being carried or defeated on the voices. If you are going to present a censure motion, you have to state your case. Debate is required on a motion of such significance and I think that was accepted by Senator Brown, the mover of the motion.</para><para>But, of course, the other issue my colleague Senator Ray raised was the question of whether the Senate should get into the business of moving censure motions on members of the executive in the House of Representatives. That is an important issue. Of course, you only have to go back to the record to see what the approach of the coalition itself has been on that important issue. On 25 May 1989, we had Senator Newman move and carry a censure motion on the then Minister for Defence and Senator Richardson. On 5 November 1992, we had Senator Hill move and have carried a rather extraordinary censure motion on the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating. It had the Senate censuring Mr Keating for degrading the office of Prime Minister and the institution of parliament in his contemptuous abuse of the Senate. Well, if we are talking about contemptuous abuse, we ought to have a look at Mr Tuckey and all the targets he identifies. But that was carried, and you had the usual suspects such as Senator Campbell, Senator Crane and others rocking up to vote for that.</para><para>A censure motion was moved by Senator Campbell on 10 May 1994, censuring Mr McMullan and Mr Walker for the non-production of documents. Again, the speakers in this 
 debate, Senator Abetz, Senator Crane and the now Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Campbell, voted on that and happily agreed to that. And we had a censure motion on the then minister for transport, Mr Brereton, in which, again, the same suspects rolled up and happily supported it. So it has become the practice of the chamber.</para><para>It is true to say that censure motions in this place have been devalued. There is no doubt about this. We had the extraordinary circumstance earlier when Senator Bolkus, a member of the opposition executive, was censured by this chamber at the same time that the government was arguing that we had so many pressing matters before the chamber in terms of the legislative program. So the government, of course, has devalued the censure motion. But, as far as the opposition are concerned, we do try to approach these questions on their merit and, if a censure motion is worthy of passage, we will vote for it, regardless of whether it has been moved by a non-Labor, non-government, senator or not. I thought we had a very poor case mounted in the censure motion on Senator Hill but the opposition was able to fire up the case, which was not adequately argued by the Australian Democrats on that occasion, and, on balance, we decided to support that censure motion.</para><para>But the motion before us today is whether the Senate should censure the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Mr Tuckey, for inflaming rather than mitigating the conflict over Western Australia's regional forest agreements. We will just look at the record here: I am afraid that Mr Tuckey has been confrontationist. He has been inflammatory. He has done everything he can to promote conflict and confrontation on an important issue that requires sensitive handling from any minister who has responsibility for it.</para><para>We all know the forest debate is one of the most difficult to handle; it is one of the most difficult public policy issues that we have in this country. It was ever thus. But it is never helped by people coming in, like Mr Tuckey has—a loose cannon; someone who is completely out of control in the way he approaches his ministerial responsibility. He just does not have the touch for it. He does not have 
 the capacity. He is either unwilling or unable to put in the effort to this important task that he has responsibility for, in the way it should be put in, to ensure that these difficult issues are handled in the best interests of all Australians.</para><para>It is not too hard, in many senses, to incite people in this debate, and I will be the first to acknowledge that timber workers particularly are facing difficult challenges and difficult situations. That is true in Western Australia, as it is in some other places, and this constant balance between conservation interests and industry interests is something that governments of all political persuasions have struggled with. On this occasion, Mr Tuckey has failed miserably. His performance has been disgraceful. As I say, I think he is bonkers, and we support the censure motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>7633</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—The passage of this debate has convinced me that I have made the right move in bringing forward a motion to censure this failed minister. Not only has the minister failed on the basis of the half of his portfolio which is conservation, and not even members on his side of this chamber moved to defend that contention; he is a failure as minister for conservation. But when it comes to his role in the other half of his portfolio, that of minister for forestry, there has been no good argument brought forward in this chamber to show that he has been able to discharge his duties there with effect. In fact, he has worsened the situation for the industry itself, not least for those who are working in the industry and who feel, very properly, concerned about their jobs. What we have heard is that, since the passage of RFAs—and this has not been contended anywhere in this debate—before, after and during this minister's tenure, the number of jobs lost in the industry has mounted into the hundreds. The minister has been ineffective in being able to stop that haemorrhage, despite the promise that he brought to his portfolio of ensuring the jobs of the people in the industry.</para></talk.start><para>So great is that failure that he has before this parliament a bill on regional forest agreements which offers massive compensation to city based woodchip corporations if 
 they are unable, because of federal intervention, to cut forests in the future. But the bill has not one word of support or succour for workers in the industry in terms of guaranteeing their jobs, their livelihoods and their future—nothing at all under this minister.</para><para>In particular, it is the purport of this argument that, rather than helping the debate, this minister has inflamed it and made it worse for everyone. That purport has been endorsed not just by this side of the parliament through cogent argument, but by the failure of those on the other side to defend the minister. Not one minister on the other side got up to defend Minister Tuckey on this issue. Two members got up to defend him, but they failed in their contribution to this debate to tackle—let alone to defend—the central purport, which is that Mr Tuckey has inflamed and worsened this issue for everybody involved in the debate, in particular in his home state of Western Australia.</para><para>I cannot help but conclude from that that there is a covert wish by members on the other side that this motion—which they have to, of course, oppose—will in fact succeed,  that this will give some leverage and open up the way for the removal of this minister from a ministry which he has so failed that it has led to uproar within his own party in Western Australia. He is at loggerheads as much with the Court government in Western Australia and the ministers involved in this important public debate as he is with conservationists. The majority of people in that state, as in other states, want the forest defended while the governments involved move to the win-win situation of relocating this industry to the plantation base in Australia. This base is ready and waiting, if properly exploited, to provide all the wood needs of this country and, with downstream processing, stop the haemorrhage of jobs—to turn it around so we see an increase in jobs and stability in the job figures in this country. The minister has failed.</para><para>I add finally that you can gain from the tenor of debate we have just heard that there are concerns on all sides of this parliament that the recent events which involved violence and threat to citizens in this country might not 
 have occurred had the inflammatory contribution of this minister not preceded them. If we do not speak up about his performance, we will ipso facto be responsible for even worse that might occur further down the line. Our job is to not allow that to happen. The removal of this minister would go a long way towards taking the heat out of the debate and returning more light. We cannot remove the minister, but we can censure him. If the Prime Minister, who appointed him some time ago, has good political sense and takes into account the good sense of the people, he will allow this censure motion—if it succeeds, as I believe it will—to help him make the important decision of removing this minister from office.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

This annual $10,000 "free area" 
 is anomalous, in that it is greater than the maximum single pension rate—some $9,400 per annum. The result is that under the current rules an income support recipient can give away more than that person is entitled to receive by way of assistance. Needless to say, this loophole has become a favourite tool for many financial planners who exploit it to increase the income support entitlement of their customers.</para><para>This bill will close this loophole by reducing the annual "free area" to $5,000, with effect from 1 July 1999. However, provision is made in the bill to ensure that any income support paid on the basis of the existing disposal rules before the Royal Assent to the bill, is protected from being recovered from the income support recipient insofar as these amendments are concerned.</para><para>At the same time, the bill will take the opportunity to change the basis of the concession from "pension year" to the more widely understood "financial year".</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</para><para>The purpose of the amendments to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994 (PBR Act) is to: provide temporary relief for applications made ineligible when the PBR Act was introduced; improve public accessibility of information; clarify aspects of prior sale and the payment of fees; and to correct minor transcription errors.</para><para>The amendments are of a minor technical nature and are aimed at improving the efficient operation of the PBR scheme. They have wide industry support and have been endorsed by the Plant Breeders Rights Advisory Committee.</para><para>The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 has, as its main purpose, measures that allow cost effective and efficient levy and charge collection techniques. It provides a single act to deal with all levy and charge collection. It allows for uniformity of collection methods and permits a consistency of approach to procedural matters.</para><para>Many of the amendments clarify and update customs used in rural industries; such as the use of settlement agents and solicitors in arranging property sales incorporating the sale of live-stock.</para><para>Anomalies have been highlighted as to who is legally the proprietor or operator of a processing establishment, particularly an abattoir. A person who holds a licence under State or Territories' law will, for levy collection purposes, be deemed to be the proprietor. If a licence is not mandatory, the 
 proprietor is to be the person carrying on the business of operating the processing establishment.</para><para>The powers for authorised persons are being upgraded to bring them into line with those used by inspectors under the Export Control Act 1982. For example, new offences for non-cooperation or obstructing an authorised person in performing those duties are to be included.</para><para>The remaining amendments merely expand and clarify existing provisions.</para><para>The purpose of amendments to the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Act 1992 is to change the name of the National Landcare Advisory Committee established under the act to the Australian Landcare Council.</para><para>In July 1997 the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon John Anderson MP announced that the National Landcare Advisory Committee was to be called the Australian Landcare Council. The amendment has support of those involved with the Australian Landcare Council and the new name has been in use since the announcement of the intended change.</para><para>The Schedule in the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991, which provides for the establishment of a Grains Industry Council, is to be repealed. The need for a forum to advise the Government on the strategic direction of the grains industry is no longer relevant following privatisation of the Australian Wheat Board and on-going reforms to State grain marketing arrangements.</para><para>The purpose of the amendments to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 are to change the role, functions and name of the advisory body currently known as the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council.</para><para>The Rural Adjustment Act 1992 provides for the Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) and the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council (RASAC). As the RAS effectively ceased to operate as at 30 June 1998, being replaced by the Government's <inline font-style="italic">Agriculture—Advancing Australia</inline>  package, the title and functions of RASAC have been reconsidered.</para><para>The amendments propose that the new advisory council will be providing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry with advice on the following matters:</para><para>.	 rural adjustment generally;</para><para>.	 regional issues, particularly matters regarding entering into agreements with States relating to rural adjustment;</para><para>.	 matters relating to declarations of exceptional circumstances;</para><para>.	 training issues, and in particular the Farm Business Improvement Program; and 
</para><para>.	 any other matter that the Minister requests advice or information about.</para><para>The amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 expand and clarify a number of definitions under the act as well as performing a few housekeeping functions to ensure the provisions of the act are consistent.</para><para>Key changes are to the definitions of "examinable document" and "wine premises", and to Section 39W, which sets out the records required to be kept. These amendments are designed to ensure that all relevant details of a wine's transformation from grape to retail sale are duly recorded and that all documents and records relevant to the claims made on wine labels can be inspected. These changes do not seek to add extra regulation on wine businesses but simply to reinforce the requirements already set out in the act.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Quirk</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>7638</page.no><id.no>r646</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>7638</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 23 August, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Minchin</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><para>upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline>  moved by way of amendment:</para><para>Omit all words after "That", substitute "further consideration of the bill be an order of the day for the first sitting day after the first day on which all regional forest agreements have been completed between the Commonwealth and Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia".</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>7638</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I continue from where I left off yesterday and remind the Senate that this is not to be taken as my first speech. The Democrats will be presenting a set of amendments to the RFA legislation. For the reasons I have outlined, the Australian Democrats would like to see this legislation thrown out of this house and never seen again. As this is very unlikely, our amendments to this legislation are to make the RFA areas consistent with national competition policies, to make the agreements available for public comment, to include sunset clauses, to pick up our obligations under international environment law, to make the legislation subordinate to 
 national environment legislation and export controls, and to oppose unlimited compensation.</para></talk.start><para>We will also be presenting a number of amendments to the ALP amendments. I was quite astonished to read the ALP amendments. The ALP knows that, if the logging industry were forced to compete in an economically efficient manner and pay a fair market price for the resources it so greedily devours, it would have to get out of Australian native forests forever. The ALP must choose between the competing demands of old-growth loggers and the environment. It cannot have it both ways. Either you calculate the value of the forest in cubic tonnes or you look at its inherent value as a living treasure.</para><para>On close reading, the ALP's amendments barely acknowledge the concept of forest protection. We have a Wood and Paper Industry Council proposal because the ALP believes that forests are a free resource put there solely to feed woodchip mills. The native forest logging industry is one which should be wound down as soon as possible. Why the ALP wants to wrap the native forest woodchipping industry in cotton wool, protecting it from the real world, is beyond me. The economic and environmental arguments for not proceeding with the RFAs are irrefutable. The government and the ALP claim regularly that their policies are not about using industry policy to pick winners or, in this case, losers. But they are contradicting this mantra by continuing to subsidise an industry in decline, protecting it from real market forces and genuine competition.</para><para>We look forward to the support of all parties for our initiatives towards recognising the importance of the environment in the RFA legislation. It is unfortunate, but this legislation will not solve the forest issue. It will not make it simply go away, as the ALP and the coalition would like. They do not like the unrest in their parties nor the unedifying brawls on the front of newspapers. They do not like caucus and party room unrest nor fights between unions and business, and state and federal counterparts. They see forests as a bleeding sore that can simply be fixed with a bandaid solution that will last for 20 years.</para><para>The south-west of Western Australia is becoming the front line of the forest war. The first victim in this battle has been constructive dialogue, and now lives are being put at risk. The government must accept responsibility for this and for negotiating a poor and unfair agreement that is diametrically opposed to community wishes to preserve old-growth forest and halt the logging of native forests. The community is wise to this issue and will not give up. The sector will decline, and old-growth habitat will disappear. The community will get angrier, and politicians will be held to account. Come election time, we will see undignified seat scrambling and the odd new national park created. This will be followed by more outrage from the unions, and the cycle will repeat itself. The RFA will come back to parliament over and over again. This is why it is important that the major parties stop pretending it will go away and actually move to start protecting our remaining old-growth forests now.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>7639</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I speak near the end of this debate and, in doing so, will address some issues that are of importance not just to the parliament but also to the broader public. As we come to the end of this debate, we need to take into account the importance of this issue across the nation. This is one of the most controversial, heated and divisive issues that Australia has confronted over the last decade. It is a debate which, with few exceptions, traverses the nation; it is a debate that has continued for years; it is a debate that divides not only communities or states but also families. One only has to look at the situation in Western Australia to acknowledge that the impact of this debate has divided people in their communities and in their families. Senator Greig was right in saying that it is a debate which shows no signs of abating. I am one of those who believe that this debate will continue beyond the next federal election. It is a debate that will influence the outcome of many seats at the next federal election. It is a debate that is driven in such a way that it will not abate just because we pass this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>The process itself, if this legislation is passed, will be under constant scrutiny by the 
 public, and the process itself will have to be a lot better than the one in Western Australia before the public accepts it. If there is one thing that this parliament should take into account in respect of Western Australia, it is that where governments go through token processes, where governments pay lip-service to concerns for protection of old-growth forests and habitats, then, though the process may be quick and dirty, the outcome will not satisfy the public, and the public have a way of ensuring that their voice is taken into account. What I am saying is that, if this legislation does pass the parliament, then, no matter in what form it passes the parliament, governments in Australia will be held by the public to their obligations, and their obligations basically are to take into account real and meaningful processes, not tokenistic and lip-service processes as we have seen in Western Australia.</para><para>There is genuine concern for the preservation of old-growth forests and habitats, and there should be. There is genuine concern about the preservation of jobs. But what we have to take into account as a national parliament is that we should not be driven by one side of the debate or the other; we should take the opportunity to take a holistic approach to this issue. If we were to do that, I think we would very quickly come to the conclusion, as loggers are finding across the country, that there is no long-term security—no medium-term security for many of them—in relying on the logging of old-growth forests and the destruction of old-growth habitats.</para><para>The best way to have a sustainable industry is to extend and expand the plantation timber resource. As I say, when you look at the experience over the past five or six years, despite promises, despite commitments, those who have relied on the viability of an industry dependent on old-growth forests quite often find themselves out of employment. It is an unfortunate part of the change that is going on in their communities, but also it is a reflection of the short-sightedness of those who are driven by an obsession to log old-growth forests and not to take a longer-term or medium-term view of not just plantation forests but also alternative industries and 
 regional development plans for some of the areas we are talking about.</para><para>This debate has gone off the rails in the last few months, not just because of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Wilson Tuckey, but also because of a bodgie process in Western Australia. What we have had is an irrational debate over recent weeks rather than a rational debate. We have had abuse from a federal minister rather than a democratic acknowledgment of people's rights to have different points of view. We have a process which, in a sense, is quite indefensible—but one which the federal minister for resources, Wilson Tuckey, tries to defend. As I say, this is an issue that will keep coming back to this Senate—if not by way of legislation, then by way of controversy, by way of public concern, by way of public opposition, as Richard Court found in WA.</para><para>We are also coming to this debate in a somewhat new legal environment. We are coming into this debate after the passage of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill. That has changed the ground rules to some extent—to a big extent. We have heard Democrat speaker after Democrat speaker talk about how their amendments are intended to overcome the effects of the EPBC legislation. Let us put it on the record that that legislation passed this Senate—and could only have passed this Senate—with the support of the Australian Democrats. There were not the numbers on the floor of the chamber for that legislation to have passed before 1 July. It was the Democrats who signed the death warrant for so much of the old-growth timber that they are now expressing concern about.</para><para>The biodiversity bill has had an impact. It has had a negative impact on the protection of old-growth forests. It is a bit rich for the Australian Democrats to come in here, having passed the bill, having sold out on some of their long expressed concerns, and attempt once again to play catch up—to play catch up in terms of wanting to protect the old-growth forest but also to play catch up in political terms. What Senator Brown has been saying about them and what I have been saying about them in respect of their approach to the 
 EPBC legislation is right. They entered into a quick and dirty deal which did not sufficiently protect the environment, and this is one area where the environment was not protected.</para><para>If you look at advice that is available to the parliament from the Parliamentary Library, you will find, in a paper that we had prepared by the library on 26 July, that the views are pretty clear. The paper says:</para><para>Irrespective of the provisions of individual RFAs and irrespective of the RFA Bill, once the EPBC Act comes into force, the Commonwealth's scope for involvement in forestry issues will be reduced, in particular—</para><para>not solely and exclusively but in particular—</para><para>where an RFA is in place. Division 4 of Part 4 of the Act contains wide exemptions for forestry operations permitted by regional forest agreements and for regions subject to the process of developing and negotiating a regional forest agreement.</para><para>That is the clear legal position. Basically, in passing that legislation, in going through a process of consultation with a government—private, secret negotiation with Senator Hill—what the Democrats did not do was protect what they are now seeking to protect. We remember they came into this place and said, `Look, we have got this amendment and we agreed with the government that this would be fought separately from the deal we have had on the legislation,' knowing full well that that amendment could not have been passed in this place in that debate because the numbers were not there to pass it. They lost their opportunity to protect what they now seek to protect—to protect what they then in a subsequent amendment sought to protect in this debate. The consequence of allowing that bill through, of missing that opportunity, is what I have just read out from the library advice. The library advice also says:</para><para>Section 524(3) of the EPBC Act will have the effect that the decision to grant a woodchip export licence will not trigger the Act's operation. The subsection provides that a decision by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency to grant a governmental authorisation under certain Acts, including the <inline font-style="italic">Export Control Act 1982</inline> , is not an action for the purposes of triggering the EPBC Act.</para><para>The advice goes on to say:</para><para>Under the EPBC Act, it is not possible to invoke world heritage powers to protect RFA areas from forestry operations where the areas possess world heritage values (and therefore might otherwise trigger the Act's operation) but where the property is not actually <inline font-style="italic">listed</inline>  as World Heritage.</para><para>The advice, extensive as it is, also says:</para><para>The limited number of `national environmental significance' triggers in the EPBC, the wide RFA exemption within that Act, coupled with the removal of the <inline font-style="italic">Export Control Act </inline> as a trigger, as well as the effect of regulations made under the Export Control Act mean that, irrespective of the provisions of individual RFAs, the Commonwealth's scope for involvement in forestry issues is likely to be reduced, especially in RFA regions.</para><para>Not in RFA agreements but in RFA regions. That is the horse they let bolt when we discussed the EPBC legislation a little while ago. Now they are coming into this place again with an amendment, which they are challenging all of us to support, to basically fix up what they mucked up.</para><para>One would have a degree of sympathy with the Democrats, in that they were enormously naive when they last negotiated with the government. But it is a bit rich to muck something up and then come here and say, `Oh well, you'll prove your credentials, whether you support our amendment or not.' The fact is that the amendment that they are to move in this debate to exclude the operation of division 4 of part 4 of the EPBC Act only half undoes what they did with the EPBC legislation. Let us be under no delusion about this. They will not fix up what they rendered asunder with their vote and their negotiations with the government on the previous legislation. They will come in here and say, `This is important. We have got to remove division 4 of part 4 of the EPBC legislation and then everything will be okay in terms of the forests.'</para><para>But the advice that I have just received from the library runs contrary to that. That advice, dated 24 August, says:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Effect of repeal of Division 4 of Part 4 of the EPBC Act</inline></para><para>If Division 4 of Part 4 of the EPBC Act is repealed effective before July 1999 when the EPBC Act and the Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Act 1999 (ERCP Act) commence, the effect of this will be to expand the Commonwealth's 
 potential scope for involvement in the approval of forestry operations as compared to the scope for involvement under the EPBC Act as it currently stands. Nevertheless, its scope for involvement will remain considerably less than under the current regime where the granting of woodchip export licences under the <inline font-style="italic">Export Control Act 1982</inline>  can trigger Commonwealth involvement. This is due to section 524(3) of the EPBC Act, under which government authorisation under the <inline font-style="italic">Export Control Act 1982</inline>  is not an action for the purposes of triggering the EPBC Act. This substantially lessens the Commonwealth's statutory powers in relation to forestry operations, regardless of the Democrat amendments.</para><para>This is clear legal advice from the parliamentary Information and Research Service that their amendments proposed now will not return the situation to what it was before the EPBC legislation that they entered into and passed with the government in the last session of parliament. They cannot undo what they did then. That just proves the point that we have been making all along. That was a hasty, ill-conceived, secret deal, the victim of which was protection of the environment. The advice goes on to say:</para><para>The repealing of Division 4 of Part 4 would however ensure that other triggers in the EPBC Act could be invoked if relevant. It would also leave in question the status of forestry operations in regions in which an RFA is currently being negotiated (see section 40 of EPBC Act). This would add to the doubt surrounding the RFA process (as certain provisions of RFAs, as mentioned above, are of questionable status).</para><para>So there is certainty that you will not go as far as where we were before the EPBC legislation. There is also some uncertainty as to other areas that the Democrats are trying to repeal. So with certainty you can say that they mucked up badly last time. With certainty you can say that, no matter what their amendments do this time, you will not go back to the situation that prevailed before the EPBC legislation.</para><para>That is only in respect to division 4 of part 4 of the act. There are other provisions in that legislation which by amendment this time the Democrats are not seeking to return to the prior situation. That EPBC legislation, as we said at the time, had loophole after loophole, escape clause after escape clause, trigger after trigger to ensure that the Commonwealth 
 could absolve itself of responsibility in national environmental protection—and not just national but regional as well. This advice goes on to say:</para><para>Alternative means of exempting RFA forestry operations under the EPBC Act—</para><para>and it lists ministerial discretion, ministerial exemption, ministerial declarations and bilateral agreements. All these areas would be available to the federal government under this legislation, regardless of whatever happens to this legislation even if the Democrat amendments are passed. All these areas would be available for the federal minister to ensure that the levels of protection that were available pre-EPBC legislation will not prevail into the future.</para><para>The Democrats are not seeking to amend those parts. They have signed up to them in the deal with the government. They signed up to provisions about which, for instance in respect of bilateral agreements, the advice says:</para><para>The Commonwealth could enter into bilateral agreements that delegated the approval powers in relation to forestry operations to the State with which it made the relevant RFA agreement (see section 29).</para><para>That is a power which will stay with the Commonwealth minister regardless of what happens, because the Democrats are not moving amendments to repeal that. And they are not moving amendments to repeal that because they actually signed up to that. That was part of their integral arrangement with the government. In respect of ministerial declarations, the advice says:</para><para>In theory, the Environment Minister could make a declaration under section 33 that forestry operations in RFA regions did not require approval.</para><para>Another escape clause. In respect of ministerial exemption, the advice says:</para><para>The Environment Minister could exercise his/her power under section 158 of the Act to provide an exemption for a controlled action if of the view that the action is in the national interest. Such an exemption cannot be reviewed by Parliament.</para><para>In respect of ministerial decision, the advice says:</para><para>Under section 75 of the Act, the Environment Minister could decide that a particular forestry operation was not a controlled action. 
</para><para>That is a ministerial decision. The advice says:</para><para>If Division 4 of Part 4 were to be repealed, there would be various mechanisms available for exempting regional forest agreement forestry operations from the EPBC Act even if they had a significant impact on a matter or matters of national environmental significance listed in Part 3 of the Act. These possibilities, combined with the removal of the Export Control Act as a trigger, mean that Commonwealth involvement in forestry issues could be minimised regardless of the existence or repeal of Division 4 of Part 4 of the EPBC.</para><para>That is where we are in respect of this legislation now. I say to the Democrats that the two bits of legal advice from the library make it very clear that they did not know what they were doing then or else they are trying to mislead us now. The end result of their amendments getting up now would still be, as the advice says, not only a diminution of Commonwealth responsibility but enormous opportunities for the Commonwealth to even absolve itself of those opportunities and that responsibility as well. So your amendments are catch-up in terms of politics but not catch-up in terms of law. They fail in that respect.</para><para>As I said earlier, we are coming to the end of this part of the process. Our amendments are obviously geared towards trying to ensure continued public scrutiny of the process. The government has claimed and screamed loudly that to allow the parliament to have some ongoing interest in this area will lead to uncertainty and to some sort of anarchy in terms of these agreements, but let us remember what we are doing. Through this legislation we are giving industry, in particular, a 20-year period of certainty and security. If we apply the letter of the law, as the WA government is doing, we do so in a way that does not guarantee sufficient scrutiny at the start of, nor sufficient scrutiny through, the process. The public of Western Australia have told their government that they are not prepared to sit idly by and allow the government to enter into an arrangement with industry, the direct consequence of which has been the destruction of much important and cherished old-growth forest and timber.</para><para>So what we are trying to do on the Labor Party side is to have a capacity for ongoing 
 scrutiny and to move a number of amendments to try to tie this legislation to the objectives that the previous government set in developing its regional forest agreements legislation. We had as our agreed principles the objective of ensuring sustainability of forests and forest practices. In moving those amendments we make it very clear again that, though the government says to Labor, `This is your bill,' this is the name of our bill but this is not our bill. This is a bill that has changed enormously since 1992, Senator Crane—who is sitting there with his ears pricked at that. This is a bill that may have the same title as the 1992 legislation but differs so often in terms of objectives, demands and processes from the 1992 legislation. It is for that reason that we deem it appropriate to move amendments, in a number of areas that have already been detailed by Senator Forshaw, to ensure not just a process but a defensible one. In closing, I say again that we should take particular heed of the voice of Western Australians who have had an opportunity to scrutinise their processes in that state. Unless this parliament puts up a process that is defensible, the debate will continue and the debate will be as divisive as it has been.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>7643</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking to the <inline ref="r646">Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998</inline>  before us, I would like to deal with some of the issues that were raised in the Senate legislation committee inquiry into this legislation. In that inquiry, in the two days of hearings we had in Melbourne, we probably heard every conceivable point of view in the forest debate that it was possible to put. Some of it was very constructive, and we had the extremes from both sides of the debate putting their views. While there were two dissenting reports—one from the Labor Party representatives on that committee and one from the Democrats—I think the fundamental principles we set down in the majority report really set the scene to move ahead on this. The unfortunate thing is that we did not get to the legislation earlier. I heard some comments earlier about why we had not brought on this legislation. But the filibustering that went on in this place on the tax debate back in May and June—and before 
 that—meant that there were time constraints caused by the wasting of time, and the government was unable to get to a lot of legislation that it would like to have got to.</para></talk.start><para>We did make a number of recommendations on this legislation. The first recommendation was that the legislation be passed unamended by the Senate. There is one particular issue that I wish to deal with on the amendments that have been proposed by the Labor Party, and that is the parliamentary disallowance of the agreements. I think we need to look at this from both a pragmatic and a constitutional point of view. In terms of the management of the land and the forests, there is no question that the constitutional rights of the states must stand up. If this amendment is passed, I have no doubt that, whichever state is overridden by this Senate, regardless of who is in government, the issue will very quickly go before the High Court and there will be a long drawn-out battle, with very clear right on the side of the states. It is totally impractical to proceed down that line and it would defeat the purpose of the national forest policy statement.</para><para>I was rather surprised to hear from Senator Bolkus—and I presume he was referring to the national forest policy statement—that it had changed dramatically since 1992. I am not aware of any changes whatsoever that have occurred. In fact, the principles of the national forest policy statement, which I will come to if I have time, stand as strongly today as they stood at the time they were put together. I point out that there would be constitutional problems if this Senate were given the power to override agreements that were signed by the states. There are other areas where the Senate can have that power, because the responsibility has been put in the hands of the Commonwealth, but in this instance it is not. So that amendment is flawed before it even gets off the ground. People who vote on this legislation should take careful note of that fact.</para><para>Another issue that was raised right across the board—there was no particular champion of the cause—was the consistent criticism that people did not know what was in RFAs; there was not enough public information. The 
 Senate committee, therefore, recommended that, for their first five years, an annual report on the RFAs be tabled in the parliament, which will allow total scrutiny of any upgrading changes that are made during that time. One of the furphies the committee was able to put to bed was that changes cannot be made to an RFA. Albeit difficult in some instances, changes can be made, according to the circumstances.</para><para>The committee recommends the government establish the wood and paper industry council. This came directly from the submission of the union representatives. Minister Tuckey has agreed that a wood and paper industry council should be established, but we on this side of the chamber do not agree that it is necessary to spell out all the fine detail of the membership and structure of that committee. We would sooner have a flexible approach to this and a committee which is structured to deal with the principles required in this area but which can have the flexibility to change membership and direction and to do things that are in the best interests of the timber industry. The amendments put before us ignore the fact that rigidly setting something in concrete in legislation such as this effectively removes any flexibility that such an industry council may have. It is not necessary for it to be put into legislation.</para><para>The next issue I wish to raise, which relates partly to something I have already spoken about, is the access to RFAs. In this particular case we are dealing with the actual RFA itself, not the ongoing review on a yearly basis over five years, but we believe that, once it is signed by the Prime Minister and the respective state premier or their nominee, the RFA should be tabled in the Commonwealth parliament. That is to allow for the total transparency that the majority on the committee believes is necessary to get rid of some of the claims made about RFAs which are not true. While it is a fact that, even under the current situation, people can get access to it, we believe that we should make that totally visible. I make that point.</para><para>One of the most important resolutions relates to employment, the status of plantation development, the status of the forests in 
 various places and the changes that may occur. For example, major fires or floods occur from time to time that do alter balances. The Australian Bureau of Statistics should run annual questionnaires to establish over a period of time what is actually occurring in the forests, whether they be on private land or on public land. During the hearings we heard from one source—I will not mention any names—that should have been reliable in telling us the situation with regard to plantation forests, that said Australia could switch very easily to the utilisation of plantation forests and rely much less on the natural forest. Equally we heard from other witnesses, who are equally qualified, that it would be some years—probably 15 to 20 years—before the plantations could fill the gap that would exist if you were to reduce on a large scale the access to the natural or regrowth forests.</para><para>We even heard from other scientists and individuals, and I have also had private correspondence on this, that there would always be a demand or a necessity for the utilisation of a percentage of natural forests because of the requirements from the timber industry of Australians as a people. It should be noted that—and not many people in this debate acknowledge this—on average every man, woman and child in Australia uses three tonnes of forest products every year. That has to come from somewhere, or you are going to have to change your habits very dramatically. There are many personal items as well as paper and furniture that are produced from the forest through that particular process.</para><para>I make this point: against the fact that we import close to $2 billion worth of timber products into this country per year, we need to share our responsibilities as a nation in terms of what we extract and harvest from our forests. It is a renewable resource, and I doubt whether anybody, except the true scientists, when they go into a forest that has been regrowing for 40, 50 or 100 years, is able to tell the difference, anyhow. At the end of the day, a tree is a living thing, as we are, and it has a life span to maturity then it starts to go backwards for a period of time and then it dies. Much of the emotion in the debate is ill-founded and not based on fact.</para><para>Another point I want to make here is that it has been claimed and argued that harvesting the forests in Western Australia has contributed to the salinity problems which exist in that state. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is not one skerrick of evidence anywhere that, where forest harvesting occurs, there has been any land go saline or any increase in the level of salinity in the water in streams, rivers or soaks. In fact, the dead opposite occurs when there is a major forest operation in an area. Young growing trees utilise significantly more water than medium- and old-growth trees and they reduce the watertable which in turn reduces the salinity take-up. Nonetheless, when you get into the heavy rainfall areas where the major forestry areas are, it is not a problem and there is no evidence indicating one skerrick of salinity.</para><para>The other point that I would make comes to the argument about the animals, birds et cetera. There is not one piece of evidence of any loss of any animals in the Western Australian forests from forest harvesting. The areas where there is a problem are areas where there has been clearing and the natural habitat has been destroyed in one way or another because it has not been fenced out. I can speak from experience on this issue in relation to the blue-green parrot, which is supposedly living only in Fitzgerald Park. There was a certain amount of land in Fitzgerald Park which was pulled back from being opened up for agriculture because of the concern about this particular parrot. We now find that we have blue-green parrots living in the tree lines which are planted across the properties, our property included. So, if you fence out the particular habitats, the protection of our flora and fauna can be accommodated and can be combined with a proper commercial farming operation. Then you find the benefits that flow to the economics of the farm operation because of the protection, the lowering of salinity and a whole range of things.</para><para>There are a lot of myths surrounding this particular debate, but I will return to the survey by the Bureau of Statistics which I was talking about. We asked to have included in it questions on assessment of natural forest 
 areas; plantation forest areas, public and private; the tourism industry; the service industries; and other industries operating within each RFA region. Nobody was able to give us anything like an accurate clue, for example, on how many jobs were generated from tourism as against the jobs generated from forestry operations. Worse than that, they could not give us a clue on the interlinkage between the jobs which were created there. We thought that was information which was very important and which we should in fact collect.</para><para>I want to make a couple of quick observations in the time I have left in regard to the national forest policy statement and touch on the things that are included there and are required to be dealt with when developing an RFA. Of course, the fundamental purpose of this legislation is to give resource security to the people who work in forest industries. We often hear the woodchip companies cited in the capital cities, but there is a lot more to the timber industry than that. There are the contractors who own the trucks, the tractors and the various equipment that moves them around. It impacts on them and on all the employees right through the process if the Commonwealth reneges on its responsibilities.</para><para>We have the issues of conservation, wood products and industry development, integrated and coordinated decision making and management, private native forests, plantations, water supply and catchment management, tourism and other economic and social opportunities, employment, work force education and training, public awareness, education and involvement, research and development and international responsibilities. I cannot emphasise the last issue too much. Whenever we walk away from our responsibilities in supplying some of that three tonnes I talked about, it means that we send a ship to one of the countries up north and, because they do not have the rules and disciplines that we have in this country, we become part of the process of raping the forests of Indonesia, Malaysia and our other northern neighbours. Of course, they have enormous economic pressures on them at their particular stage of development.</para><para>In winding up my remarks, I say that what this legislation will do is give that resource security that is needed. Once that 20-year RFA is put in place, it will remove the double jeopardy from having combined Commonwealth and state acts operating together, and that is very important. People should have to operate under only one set of laws, not two sets of laws. I believe that if these other issues I have raised are picked up in the proper manner and if these amendments are not proceeded with, because they will put us back into the double jeopardy situation in many areas, then this legislation will make a major contribution to the development of the timber industry in this country, and not only will we see the use of the existing forests in an ecologically sustainable way but also we will see a further development of plantations and the contribution they can make to reducing that enormous timber deficit that we have at this time.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 6.51 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>7646</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>7646</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Australian Communications Authority—Telecommunications Interception Review—Review of the longer term cost-effectiveness of telecommunications interception arrangements under section 332R of the <inline font-style="italic">Telecommunications Act</inline><inline font-style="italic">1997</inline> , June 1999.</para><para>Judge Advocate General—Report for 1998.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>7646</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Civil Aviation Act—Civil Aviation Regulations—Civil Aviation Orders—Amendment of section 82, dated 12 August 1999.</para><para>Parliamentary Entitlements Act—Parliamentary Entitlements Regulations—Advice of decisions under paragraph 18(a).</para><para>Remuneration Tribunal Act—Determinations Nos 11 and 12 of 1999.</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>7647</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Robertson, Mr Geoffrey QC: Consultancy</title><page.no>7647</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 996)</subtitle><id.no>996</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7647</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 20 May 1999:</para></talk.start><para>Has Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC been engaged as a consultant by the Minister or the department since March 1996; if so:</para><para>(1) (a) What was the nature of the work Mr Robertson undertook; (b) when was he engaged; (c) when was the work completed; (d) what was the nature of the work; and (e) what was the cost of the consultancy.</para><para>(2) Was the contract the subject of a tender process; if not, why not.</para><para>(3) Did the final cost vary from the contracted price; if so: (a) what was the magnitude of the cost variation; and (b) what was the cause of the variation.</para><para>(4) Have other consultants been engaged to undertake work associated with the Robertson consultancy; if so: (a) who were these consultants; (b) when were they engaged; (c) when was the work completed; (d) what was the nature of the work undertaken by them; and (e) what was the cost of each consultancy.</para><para>(5) Did the final cost vary from the contracted price for any of the above consultancies; if so: (a) what was the magnitude of the cost variation; and (b) what was the cause of the variation.</para><para>(6) Was each contract the subject of a tender process; if not, why not.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>7647</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) (a) Whilst not employed as a consultant, Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC is currently engaged by the Department as a contractor to provide the following services:</para><para>Preparation and the development of a Hypotheticals program with input to the video production aspects, including the development of a storyline consistent with the key messages and objectives of the Departmental Workplace Ethics Awareness Program.
