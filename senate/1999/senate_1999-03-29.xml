Marlene arrived in Australia from Canada in 1976 and started her first job in Australia with what was then known as Telecom in the same year. Her job with Telecom required her to work as a telephone operator in the Old Parliament House and she continued after the move to this building in 1988—with all that was involved with doing that.</para></talk.start><para>In 1991, Marlene was appointed switchboard supervisor for Parliament House and she has held this position ever since. She is leaving Parliament House to work in Telstra's teleservice office in Canberra. Even those who cannot think what Marlene looks like would know her voice if they rang the switchboard. They will have been well served by her over many years. She has certainly been highly regarded by occupants of the building, particularly senators who rely heavily on the telephone and the assistance provided by the operators in the building.</para><para>It is true to say that the success and excellent level of customer service provided by all of the switchboard staff is largely a result of Marlene's dedication to her job, her attention to detail, her outstanding supervisory skills and, generally, her commitment to the good operation of the parliament.</para><para>I am sure I speak on behalf of all senators when I say thank you to Marlene for 26 years of service to the parliament. Service to the parliament, hopefully, comes from senators and members, but there are a lot more people also involved in providing service so the place can operate smoothly. To Marlene we say: thank you for what you have done and best wishes in your new position.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3353</page.no><id.no>r743</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>3353</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 25 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>3353</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>"but the Senate affirms the resolution passed by the Constitutional Convention in February 1998, which called on the Government to convene a further Constitutional Convention preceded by extensive community consultation if the November 1999 referendum is successful, in the following terms:</para><para>(1)	 That this Convention resolves that, if a republican system of government should be introduced by a referendum, at a date being not less than three years or more than five years thereafter the Commonwealth Government should convene a further Constitutional Convention.</para><para>(2)	 That two-thirds of such Convention should be directly elected by the people.</para><para>(3)	 That the agenda of such Convention would be to:</para><para>	 (i)	 review the operation and effectiveness of any republican system of government introduced by a constitutional referendum;</para><para>	 (ii)	 address any other matter related to the operation of our system of government under republican arrangements, including:</para><para>		 (a)	 the role of the three tiers of government;</para><para>		 (b)	 the rights and responsibilities of citizenship;</para><para>		 (c)	 whether the Commonwealth should have an environment power;</para><para>		 (d)	 the system of governance and proportional representation;</para><para>		 (e)	 whether the mechanism for constitutional change should be altered;</para><para>		 (f)	 constitutional aspects of indigenous reconciliation;</para><para>		 (g)	 equal representation of women and men in parliament; and</para><para>		 (h)	 ways to better involve people in the political process.</para><para>(4)	 That the Convention be preceded by an extensive and properly resourced community consultation process, to commence within 
 twelve months of the passage of a referendum to establish a republic in which ideas and responses on the above matters would be actively sought by the Government and Parliament.".</para><para>When the Senate last considered the Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill, I was, as I mentioned at the time, getting up a head of steam over this issue. It is sad in a way that, again, the debate on the bill is being tucked in just before lunchtime. The outcome might be that the average person in Australia, who we know shares an interest in the future and the Constitution, will not know that this legislation is being debated. On Thursday it was tucked in just before lunchtime and again on Monday it has been tucked in just before lunchtime. This means that people in the wider community are not hearing what we are saying on this very important issue.</para><para>When the debate was interrupted last week, I was talking about part of the contribution by Ms Christine Milne during the Constitutional Convention, Christine being one of the selected representatives during that debate. She was the selected representative for the Australian Greens in Tasmania. Christine supported the motion put forward by the Reverend Tim Costello which was very widely supported in the Constitutional Convention. That amendment was to provide a wider debate. I said I would get back to that amendment. It was that the convention resolve that, if a republican system of government should be introduced by referendum at a date being not less than three years or more than five years thereafter, the Commonwealth government should convene a further Constitutional Convention.</para><para>The amendment looked at the effectiveness of a republican system, addressed matters in relation to the system of government and stated that it be preceded—this, to me, was one of the most important issues—by an extensive and properly resourced community consultation process to commence within 12 months of the passage of a referendum to establish a republic in which ideas and responses on the above matters  should be actively sought by the government and parliament. </para><para>I would like to see, in the process of passing this bill—and it is clear that there is support in the chamber for its passing—the chamber honouring that decision that was widely supported in the Constitutional Convention. Should the referendum prove that the Australian public are prepared at this stage to support the model that has been presented to them, I would like them to have a knowledge of the other elements, flawed though they might be, that came up through the Constitutional Convention. In this case I would like the decision made by the convention to look at the further process to be honoured.</para><para>This means that even though many of us were very disappointed at the way the Constitutional Convention was set up, somehow we should not allow the government to simply pick and choose what they think they would use out of the Constitutional Convention and not take it more widely to the people at this stage, which I think would be the appropriate thing to do before we went to a referendum. But that is by the by: it seems I have been overruled on this issue. However, if what we are having is `the model', without further refinement, debate and without consultation going to the community, the very least we need to do is to honour the further process that was set up and widely supported within the Constitutional Convention that, within five years, we start a process that makes sure the community has an involvement and that we start to consider the other elements of the Constitution.</para><para>If there is no support in the wider community to make sure that our Constitution matches our aspirations, then this will not go any further. If the community says, `We are totally happy with the Constitution that was put together more than 100 years ago, absolutely thrilled, and, although it is flawed, we'll just go along with it and maybe put a few bandaids on it,' then there is nothing that we need to worry about. But if we have a positive referendum, I am sure the wider community is expecting that there will be further discussions and that government funds—that is, taxpayers' money, their money—will be used to allow them to participate in this process. However well designed a 
 Constitutional Convention is—and the last Constitutional Convention was not well designed—it must have the benefit of information from the wider community. In my opinion, it is the wrong thing to do to go to the community with the final question and say, `Take it or leave it.'</para><para>There is something more that I should say about this second reading amendment. During the Constitutional Convention there was a further amendment moved by a Mr Elliott which looked at including the roles of the three tiers of government; the rights and responsibilities of citizenship; whether the Commonwealth should have an environment power, the system of governance and proportional representation; whether the mechanism for constitutional change should be altered; constitutional aspects of indigenous reconciliation; equal representation of women and men in parliament; and ways to better involve people in the political process. That was added by Mr Elliott and seconded by Cath Moore, who was the only elected Green representative to the Constitutional Convention. I will quote from Cath Moore's contribution at that stage. She was asked whether she wished to second the motion and she said:</para><para>Yes. I am one of those people who were elected to this Convention on a broad platform, and I welcome this amendment. This is not an exhaustive list; it is merely the beginning of some suggestions that we are putting to a group or a series of groups to take out into the community for community consultation. That is what we are on about, and that is what I hope people will support today.</para><para>To the people who are afraid of constitutional reform, I say: please be part of the process because, if you believe in the Constitution as it is, it is up to you to get into the community and argue to keep it as it is. But there are others of us who want to see it broadened so that it encompasses some of the things that we have highlighted during this Convention as being important in a move towards a democratic nation, whether or not that nation be a republic.</para><para>Those words were supported. The motion by Reverend Costello gained support, with the amendment by Mr Elliott. There is a concern that somehow or other with this whole move—which was strongly supported and, as I have mentioned before, the majority of candidates for the Constitutional Convention 
 were people on a maximalist platform—there is some honouring of the desire within the community of Australia to talk about the other issues in our model for democracy.</para><para>If the government is really interested in the outcomes of the Constitutional Convention which they set up, one would think they would honour that proposal. I do not know what their feelings are on that issue. I am grateful that the indications from the Labor Party are that they are prepared to support this, as are the Australian Democrats. At this stage, I am obviously unaware what Senator Harradine's position will be on this, but it is absolutely important. If we hear a negative response from the government on this issue, then you would have to wonder about whether or not this process is simply one to make a sideshow of the preamble, throw something to the community which is, in many respects, considered to be an unsatisfactory model and then say, `This is your only chance. This is all you get.' I obviously believe the process should be much better but if people believed there was a chance to further discuss the issues of a republic, then we may have some semblance of credibility in relation to the government on this issue.</para><para>If the government is saying, `We are going to put this referendum to you, take it or leave it, and by the way, the other elements of further community consultation are not part of the package,' then we would have to say, `This is a farce.' I guess that might achieve the government's aim in talking people into not supporting the first model because it is quite clear that those people who believe that a change to a republic—any change, any model—will eventually lead to the positive aspects of constitutional reform may discover that this first step might not be the one to take. It might be very attractive to the government not to leave people with that feeling that there will be further community consultation—some community consultation, not further—and that people will have a chance to put their views.</para><para>We have all sorts of inquiries in this place. What would be wrong—shock, horror!—with asking people to put in submissions about the Constitution? I know it would be a big pro 
 cess, but constitutional change is a big process. It does need to be properly funded. It does need to take time. That is not an overnight proposal; it is up to five years. I would be very interested to see what the government would say in not supporting that proposal. By the way, that vote in the Constitutional Convention supporting the motion by Reverend Costello plus the amendment was 102 in favour, 16 against and 32 abstentions. I do not think anyone could claim that this was not a very clear vote of support.</para><para>There is general concern about the commitment of the government to the process of moving towards a republic. I have mentioned the desire for people to talk about broader constitutional reform. But I believe we also need to cover the possibility of the referendum vote not being successful because of the bad process, because it has been put as a take it or leave it matter and because it is a compromise of a compromise. I know there are many people who believe this is not the right process. Because of the potential for that vote on an unsatisfactory model to be lost, I believe the people of Australia need to have a chance to be able to say in the not too distant future, `Okay, not this model but let's look further.'</para><para>I will also put by way of a third reading amendment a proposal that there should be a threshold question in a plebiscite on the issue of whether Australians wish to move towards a republic at the time of the next federal election. You choose those kinds of times to save the taxpayer money. I do not know of many people who do not want that threshold issue to be debated. Ideally, for many people, that issue should have been considered first.</para><para>I have looked at ways of trying to include that proposal in the  Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 , but it is very difficult within the wording of the bill. Perhaps the government wrote it like that—who knows. However, if the current model—the compromise of the compromise of the compromise—is not considered by people in Australia to be good enough, the process is not considered to be good enough and needs further work or a number of people either do not like it or feel it needs further work, there must be a way, if 
 the government was honest, of being able to work out whether or not in general the community wished to move in that direction.</para><para>I now turn to the opposition, who have indicated to me that they will not support this proposal. I will be really interested to find out from the Labor Party why this is the case because, quite frankly, I know there are many people who would otherwise vote Labor who think there should be this threshold question. I know it was Labor's preference that the question be asked first. But, given that that is not the case, I see no reason why, if this model does not get support within the Australian community, we cannot commit to the proposition that we will look further and at least ask in a plebiscite whether or not the community of Australia wants to move in that direction. And then whoever is in government would be able to take the necessary steps to make sure that a proper process takes place. I have run out of time but I really think these are key issues. The Labor Party has to think carefully about their position and who they are representing on this issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>3356</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to debate the <inline ref="r743">Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999</inline>  on behalf of the Australian Democrats as their spokesperson on republic issues. I begin by indicating our support for the amendments that have been mooted by Senator Margetts on behalf of the Greens (WA). The Democrats have long argued both in the lead-up to the Constitutional Convention and in recent days with the preamble being released by the Prime Minister that there is a need for great deal of community involvement and consultation in the process of constitutional reform.</para></talk.start><para>I am very pleased to hear Mr Elliott's name mentioned in this place. Mr Mike Elliott MLC is the Leader of the Australian Democrats in my home state of South Australia. It is not surprising to me to hear that he was responsible for that amendment to the motion at the Constitutional Convention, looking at a broader area of debate and reform discussion as we move to, hopefully, the next Constitu 
 tional Convention—something that the Democrats support.</para><para>It gives me pleasure to speak for the first time we have had legislation that relates to the republican referendum that will be taking place in Australia later on this year. I stand here as a member of the Yes Committee that has been recently formed and I am an ardent republican, as indeed is my whole party. The Democrats long ago balloted and committed themselves as a party to supporting the change to an Australian head of state. We all look forward to being involved in what is a broad-ranging and inclusive debate as we head not only to the next millennium but also towards November and hopefully a successful result.</para><para>I welcome the changes contained in this legislation, which are primarily to facilitate the dissemination of the cases for and against an Australian head of state and, of course, to put the question of the new preamble to our Constitution to referendum. This legislation provides for the questions relating to the transition to a republic and the insertion of a new preamble to be posed on separate ballot papers. The Democrats consider that an important step in ensuring that these issues are dealt with properly and separately and are not confused at the ballot box. I think most people agree with that notion.</para><para>Both these issues are intensely important and have great political and symbolic value. I think all steps should be taken to ensure they are treated as separate issues. I also note that this bill rectifies an error in the legislation relating to the folding of postal ballots. It replaces an original stipulation where ballot papers had to be folded to conceal candidates' names. I understand that has now been changed to conceal the vote, which seems quite appropriate.</para><para>In particular, I welcome on behalf of the Democrats the provision which enables the cases for and against the change to a republic, as well as a preamble, to be put on the Internet. Access to information on these  issues through as many avenues as possible is something we support. We hope it will lead to a most inclusive and informed debate. For those people in regional and remote areas, younger 
 people and members of the broader community, the Internet is becoming an increasingly important channel and source of information.</para><para>In the 12 months to November last year, more than four million Australian adults accessed the Internet—approximately one-third of the adult population, which is actually a 49 per cent increase from February 1998. People will note that the Internet was one of the largest sources of information for those members of the community wanting to be informed about the goings on at the Constitutional Convention. Delegates were flooded with email. People accessed the site—I think it was the ABC web site—that provided ongoing information about the Constitutional Convention. That is exciting.</para><para>I hope that some of the excitement, some of the elation and some of the vigorous debate that was part of the Constitutional Convention in February last year will be recaptured as we head towards November and the referendum. I hope that we will see people talking about this issue in the community in pubs, clubs and schools—you name it. I have already put on record my affection for Mark Warren's slogan—`Put the pub back into republic'—because it is not just a debate for politicians or the elite. It is a debate that has to take place in our community at every grassroots level. So I hope that we will recapture some of that excitement—and the community was excited. Regardless of their political or constitutional views, people were engaged in this debate. I thought it was a good sign and, for that reason, the Democrats support one of the amendments moved today that relates to that.</para><para>We are on record many times as acknowledging some of the flaws, not of the model that arose from the Constitutional Convention but of the Constitutional Convention itself—the original notion that people should be half elected, half appointed. We put on record very early our concerns about that democratic make-up. However, I believe that, in the end, the Constitutional Convention was a very broad, very representative chamber. Certainly I found it far more representative than the current make-up of the federal parliamentary chambers, and I do not think anyone here would disagree with me. When it came to not 
 only representation of different ages, backgrounds and views but also indigenous and non-indigenous representation, it was exciting for that very reason, and I would like to see that replicated in the form of another Constitutional Convention in future years.</para><para>Cutting the frayed apron strings tying us to the UK is very much the first step in asserting our unique national identity. The transition to a republic and, of course, the insertion—hopefully—of a new preamble into our Constitution symbolise our development from a colonial outpost to a truly independent nation which acknowledges its full history and, I hope, the legitimate position of the traditional owners of this country.</para><para>Over the past 100 years, and in the last decade in particular, Australians have engaged in a wide-ranging and passionate debate over our identity and our future. This has canvassed issues such as the degree to which our future lies in Asia, how to cope with globalisation and reform of our social and economic institutions. In my opinion, all of these issues and more are encompassed by the republic debate. While some have denigrated the republican debate as a somewhat second order issue, one more to do with symbols than with political and economic decisions, I do not think the importance of symbols in our self-perception can be underestimated. I believe it is a crucial issue, and it is a crucial time to be considering this change, as we move closer to the centenary of Federation and the new millennium.</para><para>Over the course of the century, we have seen massive changes—radical changes—in policy. We have seen the abandonment of a white Australia policy and opened our shores to waves upon waves of new Australians. We have discarded terra nullius and recognised the need for reconciliation between Australia's indigenous and non-indigenous people. We have adopted universal suffrage and we have rejected discrimination on the basis of race, disability, gender, age and sexuality—not quite enough when it comes to sexuality, but we have got a private member's bill to deal with that issue. It is important that the outdated and discarded symbols and institutions that 
 we have are replaced with ones more appropriate to our needs as a mature nation.</para><para>The passage of this legislation enabling the referendum through parliament will afford opportunities to scrutinise various problems that may exist with the model. One of the primary concerns that the Democrats have with the model in its current form is the diminution of the role of the Senate. It is something that I put on record very strongly at the Constitutional Convention, and it is something that Senator Andrew Murray and other Democrat senators have put on record. If, through the combined efforts of the range of republicans, the referendum is successful and we achieve a republic, I hope that we will adhere to the commitment made at the Constitutional Convention to a second Constitutional Convention—a sequel of ConCon or `son of ConCon'—to review the operation of the model and to address further issues of wide constitutional change. I hope that this second Constitutional Convention will be just as important, if not more important, than the original, because this will give us an opportunity to evaluate alternatives, remedy the flaws and look towards greater, broader constitutional reform. This referendum is a vital part of a process to achieve a Constitution that truly reflects the state of the Australian nation.</para><para>Another equally important part of this process is incorporating a more expansive representative preamble into our Constitution which, hopefully, recognises the values that underpin the society that we have come to be and wish to remain, and which recognises the original owners and occupants of this land. The recognition of civil values such as representative parliamentary democracy, the rule of law, equality before the law, cultural diversity and respect for the environment are hardly radical in the context of today's society, and they are certainly worth protecting and enshrining in our Constitution.</para><para>We are already a signatory to a number of international treaties giving effect to these enduring and inalienable rights, and we should not be afraid to recognise them in our Constitution, even if we persist with the clause that nullifies their legal effect. So, if 
 people are really scared about putting some of these words in, that is a fall-back to reassure them.</para><para>I acknowledge that drafting a preamble is a very difficult task. It involves determining the common vision and the values of a nation and expressing them in a way that has the potential to make us feel proud, inspired and wanting to celebrate that vision. If ever there was a document that should engage as many Australians as possible in its drafting—a document that most Australians should feel proud about and have a role in creating—it is the preamble. But the preamble released last week by the Prime Minister can only be considered a draft, surely. We cannot be expected to go to a referendum with a preamble written by the Prime Minister and one or two of his mates. That is unacceptable and I suggest the majority of the community believes that too.</para><para>We do welcome the Prime Minister's offer for some community comment up until 30 April, and my leader, Senator Meg Lees, has written to the Prime Minister taking him up on that invitation. But it is not enough. We have got to ensure that this process is given back to the people and that Australians have an opportunity. I do not know what the Prime Minister's mailbag has looked like in the last few days but, in speaking to other members, all of our mail has been on this issue—Australians having ideas, making suggestions, expressing their concerns and wanting a say. The Prime Minister should be statesmanlike enough to recognise that and to at least involve them, if not incorporate their views. We recognise that the legislative timetable on this issue is extremely tight but we would like to see greater enthusiasm from government members for people to have a say.</para><para>Criticising sectors of the community as `narrow, petty, short-sighted' is absolutely outrageous. That is something we heard on record from the Prime Minister last week. A preamble is of little worth unless it is inclusive and resonant. Women, indigenous representatives and members of the ethnic community were among the first to criticise the draft released. Refusing to `placate special 
 interest groups' is not what the process of drafting a preamble is about.</para><para>The lack of full recognition of the ongoing rights of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders is a serious omission. Their place in the preamble should be about more than simply an acknowledgment of their continuing culture. Honouring their culture is one thing, but recognising their ongoing rights and custodianship of this land is more than appropriate. The Prime Minister began his second term with a commitment to reconciliation. A refusal on his part to consider greater recognition of the rights and status of Australia's indigenous people will see him once again miss out on a great opportunity for achieving meaningful reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.</para><para>Similarly, he should be wary of assuming that words that might come easily to him and might resonate with people of his generation will be as acceptable to everyone in our uniquely diverse Australian community. Everyone acknowledges that the use of the term `mateship' has drawn criticism. I acknowledge it is a colloquial term that has been included to evoke the camaraderie—if you like—that has come to define this nation and the relationships among Australians. However, it is a blokey term. It is one which is not popularly used by women, indigenous people or young people, and it has struck a jarring note. I put on record that people disagree with that view and they are entitled to do so. The people who have expressed concern about those words—certainly to my office—have particularly been women, young people and indigenous Australians. It has struck too much of a jarring note to be considered for inclusion.</para><para>I draw the Senate's attention to the article by Adele Horin in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> over the weekend, who talks about the distinction between friendship and mateship. It is quite a persuasive article. One of the best aspects of this article is the sentence: `Language matters.' Indeed it does. Language is powerful. It is symbolic. The Prime Minister knows this, otherwise he would not have used certain words and not others—certain words that he may have considered to be a rebuke 
 to political correctness. He acknowledges the value and importance of words.</para><para>It is important for us in this chamber to recognise that language evolves. Language changes, too. Words take on different meanings. Words that were relevant maybe decades or even a century ago may not be used today or may have different definitions or evoke different feelings and ideas, depending on who is using them and who is hearing them. So let us not pretend that language does not matter. Language also has the ability to inspire, and that is what we should be seeking to do with the use of language in a preamble.</para><para>Perhaps most strange was the Prime Minister's claim of the rebuke to political correctness. In the past, this government has decided that certain values and aspirations are politically correct, thus discrediting reconciliation, feminism, protection of the environment and immigration. I do not even know if multiculturalism is still a word that is utilised by government or not. I remember that at one stage it was considered not appropriate by some members of government. So we do acknowledge that language changes; language has power. It is symbolic.</para><para>However, all these values were recognised at the Constitutional Convention by delegates of all persuasions and from a diverse range of backgrounds. They all considered them as worthy of inclusion in the preamble. The Constitutional Convention recommended references to federalism, the rule of law, cultural diversity, the unique land and environment of this country, equality of all before the law, gender equality and the continuing rights of Australia's indigenous people. None of these has really found expression in the Prime Minister's draft preamble.</para><para>Talking to the SBS <inline font-style="italic">Insight</inline> program last Thursday evening, Dr Brendan Nelson MP made the following, quite remarkable, statement:</para><para>Perhaps we are choosing the wrong vehicle through which to achieve the things that we all aspire to be. Perhaps in fact we need an Australian declaration of values, beliefs and national aspirations, and the preamble of the Constitution may not be the right place to do that. 
</para><para>This misunderstands the nature of a preamble, which should be about recognising the shared values, rights and aspirations of our nation. Rather than rebuking fashion, it would be far better to recognise the continuing, inalienable and universal rights that are the true protection for us all against prejudice. These are rights that have already been recognised. We have actually bound ourselves by them in declarations in international treaties such as the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights.</para><para>Our vision in framing a new preamble should be bold and broad, covering the elements of our way of life and society which we cherish, such as our rich ethnic, cultural and spiritual diversity, our unique and fragile environment, the rule of law and the equality of all before it. The founders of our nation were not timid in their vision, nor should we be at the turn of the next century. The Prime Minister should be commended—and I do put this on record—for putting the question of a new preamble to the people. It is a bold move, a positive move of constitutional reform, appropriate to our move to a new millennium and the celebration of our nation's centenary.</para><para>However, the Prime Minister's part in this process is largely over. Having presented his version, it is now time to hand over this process to all Australians. Only by seeking comments from all Australians will we be able to discover what our common vision is and what our common values are, and to enunciate them in a form likely to gain sufficient support at referendum. Australians may not take up this challenge. I note that one senator suggested last week that the whole process was pretty dull. I am not sure who that is a reflection on. Nevertheless, whether the process was dull or not, some people might not be interested in this debate. But if people are, let us give them the opportunity to have a say; they must be given that opportunity. It is the Australian people who will ultimately decide whether the draft preamble is acceptable.</para><para>The reaction to this early draft suggests much change is required if we are to secure a yes vote. But like many people, I am excit 
 ed by this process. I am cautiously optimistic that we are going to see an amended version of that preamble go to referendum, partly as a result of modifications suggested by the people and other legislators and decided by the parliament. I am looking forward to a vigorous debate and discussion. I am cautiously optimistic that we will resolve our differences over words and principles to give form to our vision of a truly independent nation and that our words will sing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>3361</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to commend the previous two speakers, Senator Margetts and Senator Stott Despoja, for the positive contribution they have made to this all important debate on the Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. It is a debate about the direction of Australian democracy and the direction and cohesion that we as a people, as a republic, take as we go into the next millennium. It is also about the process that we undertake to ensure that the best comes of this historic opportunity to redesign the Australia that we are all so committed to and proud of.</para></talk.start><para>Hovering above all of this is an impending feeling that there will be failure, that the process is not proceeding correctly. In this chamber last year I held strongly that, at the outset, there ought to have been a referendum asking the people of Australia whether or not they wanted a republic. The question ought to have been, in essence, whether or not we wanted a foreign head of state to remain as the head of state of this country. I have no doubt that such a referendum would have passed. The people of Australia would have wanted a republic. From there we ought to have been proceeding, through vigorous public debate, to the form of that republic and what else we might do about a Constitution which is showing shortcomings a century after it was devised by the men who took on that task.</para><para>That is why I will be supporting Senator Margetts's amendment at the end of proceedings on this legislation that, if the referenda fail at the end of this year because of the shortcomings in the process, there nevertheless be another referendum putting the simple question to the people of Australia about a 
 republic—a plebiscite. If the referenda do fail I feel that, under those circumstances, the people of Australia will nevertheless want it to be known that the time has come for Australia to become a republic.</para><para>I will also be supporting Senator Margetts's excellent amendment calling for the findings of the Constitutional Convention to be implemented. This is an important matter. A year ago we were debating the set-up of that Constitutional Convention, and there was great criticism not only about the form of voting for delegates to the Constitutional Convention but also about the fact that the government was loading the convention. I maintain that all delegates to that convention ought to have been elected. Nevertheless, the convention proceeded and I might add, and you will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I changed my vote in this chamber, along with Senator Harradine, to ensure that the convention did proceed.</para><para>What we are now witnessing, however, is selectivity as to the outcomes of that convention as far as the government is concerned. We are not seeing the full outcome of that convention, as expressed by a diverse group of people getting together and coming to an agreement with a great deal of heartache, being followed up by the government. That was inherently the Prime Minister's promise, and that is what we should now be seeing.</para><para>Senator Margetts has brought forward a second reading  amendment which would put into effect the outcomes that the people who were at the Constitutional Convention required if they were going to give assent to the procedure now being undertaken towards a republic. These are important matters. Not least was the requirement that, in the event that a republic were voted in, there be a second Constitutional Convention  where, after a maximum taking of opinion, debate and dissemination of information to foster that debate, the people of Australia would have a say in the changes to the Constitution. These changes could relate to important things, like the role of the three tiers of government, the rights and responsibilities of citizens—we do not have a bill of rights in this country—and 
 whether the government should have an environment power.</para><para>You know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that we are seeing legislation before this parliament at the moment that removes a huge amount of the environmental powers and obligations to international treaties from the federal government and puts them back to the states. So we have a government that is actually going against the spirit of an aggregation of environment power, a power and responsibility of the Commonwealth when it comes to issues of national importance like the forests, the environmental ethos of the indigenous people of this country, our global responsibilities on issues such as global warming and our need to ensure that we reverse the degradation of the environment of this wonderful land of ours in the coming century.</para><para>The delegates at the Constitutional Convention wanted further discussion involving the people of Australia about the system of government and proportional representation; in other words, a fairer system of democracy in this nation—that we should catch up with the rest of the world and more advanced, more representative forms of government. Other issues for discussion are: whether the mechanism for constitutional change should be altered—largely, whether people should have more say; constitutional aspects of indigenous reconciliation; equal representation of women and men in parliament, an important debate which has been raging for decades in Europe and which is a very good one for us to take up in this country; and ways to better involve people in the political process.</para><para>The motion that called for that second Constitutional Convention was put forward by Mr Tim Costello and seconded by the then Tasmanian Greens leader, Christine Milne. It is important that we honour that outcome of the convention because it was known by, in particular, the government and the Labor Party that, without that motion succeeding, the outcomes of the Constitutional Convention would not have occurred—the yes vote would not have been there.</para><para>I will be seeking from both the government and the opposition during the committee stage 
 of this debate a renewal of commitment to those outcomes at the Constitutional Convention. I do not want to be part of a process which welshes on the commitment made at that convention by all parties, including the government, to a further Constitutional Convention aimed at implementation of the outcomes of ongoing public debate about the direction in which our nation should be headed.</para><para>That brings me to the matter of the preamble itself. The Prime Minister has arrogated, with some very limited advice, the business of writing a preamble. I can understand his excitement about that. I can understand that he wanted to be remembered as the inspiration for a key piece of national identity in terms of the constitution. But it was very likely to fail in anybody's hands and, in this Prime Minister's hands, it has failed.</para><para>The preamble that he has released does not excite the imagination or the passion of Australians as a whole. It has excited more division than it has excited cohesion. It has clear shortcomings which ought not to have had the Prime Minister's imprimatur. It would have been a much better process to have established a means of enabling representatives of the community to have an input into a preamble and, as other speakers have suggested, to have at least opened up the opportunity for there to be a number of preambles that could go to the people. That would not have been too difficult.</para><para>A couple of decades ago, the people had a choice of national anthem. I must say it was a surprise; I thought <inline font-style="italic">Waltzing Matilda</inline> would have got up. But it was the very words of <inline font-style="italic">Waltzing Matilda</inline>—not the magic of the melody—that was thought inappropriate by the voters, who gave us <inline font-style="italic">Advance Australia Fair</inline> instead. That was a judicious vote by Australians at that plebiscite. As Senator Stott Despoja says, the power of words is almightily important in these matters when we think of ourselves as a people and as a nation. That would have been a better way to go. I would advise the Prime Minister to reconsider now while there is time.</para><para>I have noted the numerous preambles that have been in the press and elsewhere in the 
 time since the Prime Minister released his preamble. In my opinion—and it is no better than that of anybody else—the majority of those preambles are superior to that which the Prime Minister has released. I am charmed, to say the least, by the inordinate clarity of thinking of young Australians in this matter. On a number of occasions I have seen preambles coming from high school children in Australia which have the magic that we are seeking and which have the feeling that we are seeking.</para><para>I do not know whether it is because, as we get older, we tend to get harder and tend to lose the beauty of language and commitment, and the feeling of oneness and direction which seems to be so well evoked by these young scribes; but I would feel much safer if a number of them were brought together and told to polish some of the work—although it does not need polishing—to find a common result. That could be put out with the Prime Minister's preamble in the referendum. I would bet my boots that the young people's preamble would win out in those circumstances.</para><para>I endorse wholly the feeling of frustration that the Prime Minister's preamble does not do more than `honour' the culture and long-time relationship with Australia of the indigenous people of this country. That is not the stuff of reconciliation, let alone the stuff of true, abiding and full recognition of the phenomenal contribution that the indigenous people of Australia make to us all as a nation. It does not recognise theirs as the fundamental culture that marks us out in this world, let alone their sovereign rights as the indigenous people who pre-dated the coming  of the rest of us in this wonderful community. Their relationship with the land is such an important talisman. It is a relationship we need to re-establish if we are going to avoid going into the next century with the degradation of the environment that has been catastrophic in the two centuries since non-indigenous people arrived in this country.</para><para>The Constitutional Convention called on the writers of the preamble to acknowledge that environment. They said that the preamble should have an `affirmation of respect for our 
 unique land and environment'. What did the Prime Minister do with that? Rather than an affirmation of respect for our unique land and environment, he came up with these words:</para><para>Our vast island continent has helped to shape the destiny of our Commonwealth and the spirit of its people.</para><para>He came up with a comment on history. The Prime Minister apparently does not have a relationship with or love of the land itself—our vast open spaces; our magnificent river systems; our wonderful coastlines; our grand forests, including the tallest forests in the Southern Hemisphere, and rainforests; and our unique wildlife, which is as diverse as the environments of this country it inhabits.</para><para>There is no feeling of that in here; it is absent. It is not only an opportunity missed but it is an opportunity denied because the Prime Minister, and sadly those few who were helping advise him, apparently do not have that connection, that passion, which I think is central to this nation's feeling of difference from the rest of the world as well as its feeling of pride in itself. And no-one could go beyond the passion of the indigenous people and their spiritual relationship with the land in measuring that passion. But you only have to look at the post-invasion poetry and song and history of this country to know how important that heart relationship we all have with the land is. To have it missing, to have it denied by the Prime Minister's preamble, even after the call of the Constitutional Convention to make sure it was specifically there, is not good enough. It is a failure to rise to the occasion. It is actually an indication that, for whatever reasons, the prime ministerial leadership in this country is not consonant with the feelings of the people of this country as a whole.</para><para>I will go to the second last sentence of the Prime Minister's preamble. There is a lot more I could say about it. The sentence says:</para><para>Australia's democratic and federal system of government exists under law to preserve and protect all Australians in an equal dignity which may never be infringed by prejudice or fashion or ideology nor invoked against achievement.</para><para>Come again? Ask the average punter, myself included, what that means. I dare to say: ask 
 the Prime Minister what that means. If there is going to be one thing that should be basic to constructing a preamble, it is clear, unambiguous language; clear, unambiguous English.</para><para>Let me deconstruct part of this sentence. Is the Prime Minister really meaning that under law Australians have an equal dignity which may never be invoked against achievement? That is what this says. So is our dignity on the altar of achievement seekers? Does the dignity of our people as a whole have to be sacrificed to those who want to achieve their ends by knocking down forests, by ripping up national parks, by riding across the top of indigenous people's wishes or by overlooking the interests of minorities? Is that really what the ethos of this country is? That is what the Prime Minister is saying here, if you ask me.</para><para>I am not going to sign off on such a poorly written sentence which, if dissected, has such a dastardly outcome. It is almost incredible that that sentence could have been forthcoming from the Prime Minister's office as an offering as to what might inspire Australians. Again we see the blinkered vision of the Prime Minister. He means well. He wants to see this nation united under his vision. But, because of his vision, he comes up with a tract for division.</para><para>We have a long way to go in this debate. I hope the Prime Minister will be able to take a greater reference back to the Australian people, back to the Constitutional Convention and even to the wider field of view there is in this place before we are saddled with that sort of preamble.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>3364</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on this bill, the <inline ref="r743">Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999</inline> . The basic purpose of this bill is to provide a more flexible arrangement for the expenditure of funds in the education program to the Australian public other than what is normally provided for in the normal referendum legislation, which is to fund a yes case and a no case to be circulated during the last period leading up to polling day. We in the opposition have no objection to the arrangements in this bill as far as that funding arrangement is concerned. As I understand it, 
 the proposals came out of recommendations from the Constitutional Convention held some 14 months ago, and very successfully, in the Old Parliament House here in Canberra.</para></talk.start><para>I rise to speak on this bill as a person who has had a particular interest, even before I was a senator, in the issue of whether Australia should be a republic. As far as modesty permits me, I say that one of the facts I am proud of in my political life is that I moved the resolution at the 1991 national conference of the Labor Party committing the Labor Party to a policy to achieve a republic in Australia by the centenary of Federation, 1 January 2001. In those first years after 1991 I took on, with several others, the responsibility of publicly promoting that desirable change. Of course, I was delighted when the Australian Republican Movement was established and I became a founding member.</para><para>I was particularly delighted when Mr Keating, in coming to the prime ministership at the end of 1991, immediately began promoting the need for Australia to become a republic and to have its own constitutional identity without equivocation or confusion. Mr Keating has to be given great credit for advancing the republican cause like no other person has in Australia's history. Just as Sir Henry Parkes was considered the father of Federation for the work he did in the 1890s, Paul Keating will certainly be recognised as the father of the republic when it is achieved in the near future.</para><para>The case is unarguable that we need to have an Australian head of state in our republic. It seems to me that most Australians now agree when you ask them, `Do you think we should have a citizen of our own as our head of state?' If you ask them that or whether it should be a citizen of another country, the answer—by nearly two-thirds of the Australian people—is for an Australian head of state. When the question is asked, `Should you have a republic?' the numbers are less because the republic has different connotations in different people's minds. But there is no doubt that any sensible Australian wants to have the honour of having one of their own—or, as Paul Keating said, `one of us'—as our president and as our head of state.</para><para>It is amazing that some people say, `We have a de facto republic anyway because the Governor-General is the head of state.' If you read the Constitution—of which I have a copy here signed by Sir William Deane, the Governor-General, on my swearing in as a senator for my present term on 20 August 1966—it is quite clear the Governor-General is not our head of state. He represents the present Queen of the United Kingdom, as her representative in Australia. I think it is one of the great fictions that the monarchists have used to say, `We don't need to change the Constitution—we are a republic in all but name.' If we are one in all but name, why not make it clear that we are a republic and have an Australian citizen as the head of state?</para><para>Some people say that, in constitutional and in recognition terms, it does not matter. It does matter. It is demeaning. In recent times we have had examples of how demeaning it is not to have our own citizen as our head of state. For example, in the early part of this decade Bill Hayden, as the Governor-General, visited France to be part of the commemorations—I think on the 75th anniversary—of those awful battles in which tens of thousands of young Australians died in the First World War on the Somme. He was going there to pay tribute to that contribution to the defence of France in the First World War. But what did the French government do? They treated him as a low level official. He was accorded no recognition of a head of state.</para><para>Some junior clerk, I understand, from the French government met him at the airport. He was given no recognition as head of state because the French government said quite rightly, `You are not the head of state. You only represent the head of state.' I find that particularly demeaning in view of the fact that there are 40,000 dead Australians lying in France who over 3½ years heroically defended French sovereignty from German invasion.</para><para>We have another example with Mr Hayden. He was planning a visit to Kazakhstan, one of the new central republics formed out of the break-up of the old Soviet Union. When a notice was sent to the Kazakhstan government that he wanted to visit, they said, `Who is Bill 
 Hayden, the Governor-General?' and someone said, `He represents the Queen of the United Kingdom as Australia's head of state.' So the Kazakhstan government sent a note to the British Ambassador in Kazakhstan: `Can you find out whether the Queen agrees that Bill Hayden visit this state as her representative to our country?' So the British Ambassador had the privilege of passing a message back to the Kazakhstan government saying, `We think it is all right for Bill Hayden to visit.' Is that the sort of business that we want to continue with? This is absolutely demeaning to Australia.</para><para>Someone has said—and Gough Whitlam made this change in 1973—that we have the Queen now being called `the Queen of Australia'. She is only the Queen of Australia when she is in Australia. She can never be the Queen of Australia anywhere else in the world. And the future heir to the throne, Prince Charles—as the next King of the United Kingdom and our head of state—is now on the public record as saying he supports the agricultural policy of the European Community. That policy absolutely discriminates against Australian farmers. How can we put up with having the next head of state of Australia going around saying, `I favour French, Belgian and German farmers ahead of Australian farmers'?</para><para>It is an extraordinary position to be in. Any country with self-confidence in what it wants would say, `Never. No. Let's get rid of this fiction,' and whenever I again here somebody saying, `We really have a republic already. We do not need to bother about it because the Governor-General is our head of state,' that will be a fiction that has to be hit right on the head. The monarchists and their fellow travellers on this are just making a deliberately confusing statement to defend a system that only a third, at the most, of Australians now support.</para><para>I have to say that the Queen has been absolutely impeccable on this issue. She has said it is a matter for the Australian people to decide and that, if they decide to have a republic, she will respect that. But put it around the other way: we now have a head of state whom only 30 per cent of Australians 
 support. Even if the referendum was unfortunately lost later this year, how could you go on having a head of state whom only 30 per cent of the people support clearly and positively? So I make it clear here that the fiction has to come to an end and that, for those of us who have argued for change since the late 1980s and early 1990s, the time has come for this referendum.</para><para>The next argument is about the minimalist approach versus a wider constitutional change. I have never argued that in this case we should have wider constitutional change because I do not want to confuse the argument—it is tough enough now to get constitutional change in Australia. But I want to make it clear that many of the other suggestions for constitutional change that this debate has created I want dealt with over the next decade, because the Constitution and many areas of managing and governing Australia are deficient for the 21st century.</para><para>On this issue I support the Constitutional Convention and what I would call—as have others—the minimalist approach, where the parliament, by a two-thirds majority, selects our head of state. That change is a minimal one to the Constitution. But do not let it be said that I do not want to support other constitutional change; I want to do it at a digestible level with which the Australian people are comfortable.</para><para>I also have to believe that, if we get the minimalist approach through to change to a republic, that will be a major positive psychological change for the Australian people. They will therefore be able to look more sensibly at other changes that we need, knowing that we have changed to a republic but  the country has not come to an end and there has not been an end to our democracy, and that it will strengthen our democracy.</para><para>The arguments for an appointed president versus an elected president are overwhelmingly in favour of an appointed president. If you have an elected president, you will get a politician. You will get either a Liberal Party or a Labor Party politician, because those parties are the only two organisations that can run an election campaign across Australia to get a majority vote to get somebody elected, 
 and they are the only ones who will have the money and the resources.</para><para>The public want to have an elected president because they do not want a politician; but, ironically, that is what they will get. Having an appointed president from a joint sitting of the parliament, with two-thirds from both sides, means the appointment of a partisan politician will not occur, because one of the major parties will say no. That will give us a non-partisan, non-politician president; and there are many excellent people in our community who, I am sure, would fill the president's position with distinction and with great pride for all of Australia.</para><para>I want to refer now to the present Prime Minister's role. Just as Paul Keating will be termed through the ages as the `father of the republic', John Howard will be remembered only as one of the few people who have done everything possible to stop the republic occurring. He makes no bones about the fact that he is a monarchist. He has sought every possible way to interfere with the process and argue against it.</para><para>His sudden conversion to finding a new preamble is only because he has suddenly realised that, come the referendum, he will be in the position of saying no. He as Prime Minister will put himself in the lame duck position of saying no. How can he get out of this? Let us have thrown onto the field of play another idea which he can say yes to. Therefore, let us have a new preamble, something the Constitutional Convention did recommend. But he wanted to draft it himself, and what a terrible mess he made of it last week. It is a preamble that in a negative way describes every one of John Howard's prejudices about what he thinks our society should be.</para><para>Can anyone imagine any student from our high schools, our universities, our primary schools or anywhere else going off and trying to learn his preamble by heart to be able to quote it? Not on your nelly! It is impossible to learn by heart, unless you spend hours and hours. There is no rhyme or rhythm, no `magic' to it, as Senator Brown said. There is no poetry to it. There is no memorable phrase—other than in the negative about what 
 you would not want. Fancy trying to remember the word `fashion'. I thought that he must have consulted Carla Zampatti, the spouse of the former Liberal member for North Sydney. How long will the word `fashion' last down the ages? This is his code for saying, `I do not want political correctness written into the Constitution.' And neither should political correctness be written into the Constitution: it should be a positive affirmation of how we see ourselves as people.</para><para>But John Howard could not get even that right. One can imagine him sitting there, scratching lines out, finding words that meet all of his prejudices about what he thinks there is in Australia. The only thing that he did not put into the preamble was the word `incentivation'. When he was leader back in the late 1980s, he invented a campaign slogan of `incentivation' which lasted all of a day before it was laughed off the stage. There was one other phrase that he did not put in, and I was waiting to see a mention of the white picket fence in front of everybody's home being in the preamble, because that is about the level of his vision of what he wants for Australia.</para><para>He did not have those words in but he had all of his other prejudices written in. As a result, this preamble has been roundly condemned. As Senator Brown and other speakers, such as Senator Bolkus the other day, said: ordinary Australians have, off their own bat, made a much better effort of drafting a potential preamble than this Prime Minister could ever do and has ever done. The only way that he is going to save himself from complete humiliation is to quietly withdraw this suggestion.</para><para>He ought to take note from his great mentor that he always looks to, Sir Robert Menzies. In 1966, Sir Robert Menzies proposed that our new decimal currency be called a `royal'. He announced this with great fanfare. Everybody laughed at him. Everybody fell on top of him within a week, and Sir Robert had to reluctantly admit that, although `dollar' was an American word, it was the only one that Australians were going to cop for their new decimal currency; and so he quietly withdrew the suggestion of the royal. I suggest to John 
 Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, that he should quietly withdraw the preamble, go to a proper consultation with all Australians and get a decent preamble.</para><para>On the preamble issue, Mr Acting Deputy President Hogg, I want to say that there is one area of it that I have a strong view about. I do not think reference to a religious figure, the phrase `almighty God' or `God', should be used in the preamble. Our Australian community is a secular state, guaranteeing the right of religious freedom—whatever religion it is—for all of our citizens. They have the complete right to their religion, if they so choose it. About 25 per cent of the community—and I am one of them—do not choose to support a form of organised religion or a spiritual being.</para><para>I absolutely respect the right of others to have a different view; but, as soon as you suggest that you should put one form of religion or one definition of God into a preamble of the Constitution, I think we move away from a commitment to absolute freedom of religion: you are trying to predict what the religion should be. I note in the Constitution, drafted in the preamble, there was mention 100 years ago of the phrase `almighty God'. I think they made a mistake even then. But time has moved on and, in the next century, I would hope that with a new preamble people would understand that not mentioning almighty God would not mean that we are against freedom of  religion but that it is in fact enhancing freedom of religion. This bill, as I said in my opening remarks, is just the beginning of other bills that will come in, in preparation for the holding of the referendum.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—What is your response to our third reading amendment?

That would be a much more appropriate person than the suggestion of John Howard, who is trying to grab the opening of the Olympic Games for himself, because he is jammed and does not want to have to invite the Queen to do it as our head of state. Australians want an Australian to open the Olympic Games; they want our head of state to do it, not John Howard, not the Queen.

It deals with public funding for a public education exercise, the public funding of the yes and no cases, and also the two separate questions to be asked—one in relation to the republic and one in relation to the preamble.</para></talk.start><para>These are very important matters indeed, and I thank senators from the minor parties and the opposition for their contribution. I did not really detect any opposition to those matters that I have just mentioned. But there was a great deal said on the preamble and generally the question of a republic. Those matters are best left for other legislation which will be coming before the Senate in due course.</para><para>In relation to the Greens' second reading amendment, this government undertook to pick up the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention held last year and to follow that through. The Constitutional Convention came up with a model for a republic, and that model will be put forward in legislation. Although it was not in the 
 terms of reference of the Constitutional Convention the question of a preamble was also raised at that convention, and there was a recommendation that a preamble be considered as well. The government decided to take that on board and accordingly there is now the second question of whether or not we have that preamble.</para><para>The government has stood by its undertaking to take up the suggested model put by the Constitutional Convention and has gone even further to take up the question of a preamble. Indeed, the question of holding a referendum was part of the government's platform for the last election and it is therefore appropriate that the government honour that undertaking.</para><para>The government is not persuaded to support the Greens' second reading amendment. The question is one which pre-empts the outcome of the referendum and is best resolved after the referendum has been held. The government is of the view that it has stood by its undertaking to the Australian people in relation to the recommendation made by the Constitutional Convention and that this question of any further action is one which is best resolved after the result of the referendum is known.</para><para>I can also foreshadow that the government is not persuaded to support the further amendment, which is of course a separate one moved by the Greens, that there be a plebiscite at the next election. The government would say that that is really superfluous to the referendum being held this year. The referendum being held this year will cost in excess of $60 million and if one were to have a plebiscite at the time of the next election, one which would have an appropriate mail-out, there would be a cost of $8 million to $9 million.</para><para>Leaving the cost of it aside, there will be a full debate this year on the question of whether Australia becomes a republic or not. There will be a public education campaign. No doubt there will be parliamentary scrutiny by way of parliamentary debate and parliamentary committee, the yes and no cases will be sent out by the AEC, and also there will be the two respective arguments being

There is no doubt that there is certainly opportunity out there now which did not exist under Labor. But our point is that it is not enough. There is still a major area of reform that is necessary if we are to maximise the job opportunities in this country and really give future generations their greatest possible opportunity to obtain jobs and to otherwise get full economic benefit.</para></talk.start><para>The major area of reform that is still outstanding, the area that the Labor Party always avoided, is of course taxation reform. Taxation reform, to Labor, was to increase taxes. Even though they would go to the people and deny it, that is what they did nevertheless. We are suggesting major reforms to our taxation system for a number of reasons. The first one is so we can give $13 billion back to the taxpayer. Why? Because lower income tax means greater incentive. It means small business in particular can grow, can thrive and can employ. It should be obvious, I would have thought, that if we provide lower income tax rates and higher thresholds, Australians pay less income tax and there is greater incentive to work: there is a greater opportunity for small businesses to grow and to prosper. I would have thought that was obvious. The fact that the Labor Party cannot see it is really quite extraordinary.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Cook interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Senator Cook, there is a time for you to contribute and it is not now.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—He had 13 years to contribute, Madam President. Under the current taxation system, which Labor wants to keep, only 30 per cent of taxpayers pay a tax rate of 30 per cent or less. But under the new tax system, the Howard government's proposed tax system, 81 per cent of taxpayers will face a marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less. I repeat: 81 per cent. So from 30 per cent of all taxpayers under Labor to 81 per cent under us will pay a marginal income tax rate of 30 per cent or less. That is an extraordinary change and a real incentive to employ and to grow. More Australians paying lower tax rates means business will expand. It is worth noting, further, that low income earners will particularly benefit. The lowest marginal income tax rate will drop from 20 to 17 per cent. The amount of income that can be kept before becoming taxable increases from $5,400 to $6,000. So low income earners especially benefit under the Howard government's tax proposal. Furthermore, families get an extra benefit—an increase of over $2 billion a year in assistance to families and a four per cent increase in pensions and other income support payments to benefit lower income earners.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I said the other day, the GST will mean that nine state taxes can be abolished. That means there will be lower compliance costs for business—a further incentive for business to grow, to expand and to employ more Australians. As I also said the other day, there is a special benefit for exporters because exports will be GST free. That is good for the bush, good for regional Australia, good for commodities, and good for exporters in particular. All in all, what we are giving senators the opportunity to put through this chamber is a totally new taxation system that relies much less on income tax and provides new incentives. It supports exporters and enables the economy to grow, helping to build upon the 400,000 jobs that Senator Knowles was talking about.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Services</title><page.no>3371</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3371</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Communica

Hardly anyone else out in the community does, unless they attend ALP branch meetings. The fact is, as you well know, as a result of competitive pressures Telstra has been lifting its game, both domestically and internationally, ever since your lot, when your current leader pro tem was the minister for communications back in 1991. That is when competition was introduced. Since that time Telstra has been expected to lift its game. As we know, there are always going to be problems with faults and installations. Nothing is perfect. I can tell you one thing: when it was wholly government owned, there were a plethora of complaints about the quality of service. That is one of the reasons why exposing it to competition is actually very beneficial. Enabling it to make sensible decisions without having government look over its shoulder is yet another very good reason.</para></talk.start><para>As we are talking about Telstra, I have to say that the gold medal for hypocrisy was handed out to Mr Beazley on the weekend because from the result of the New South Wales election he interpreted that the punters presumably did not like the idea of the 
 privatisation of the electricity authority, ergo they did not like Telstra. What is the logical conclusion from that? Presumably, it must be that whoever wins the election, their policy in relation to privatisation is the correct one. That can be the only logical interpretation of Mr Beazley's statement. In other words, because the New South Wales government happened to win, then their position on privatisation, hypocritical and two-faced as it might have been, was correct. What does that tell you about the last federal election, Madam President? It is breathtaking to think that Mr Beazley has made such a fool of himself again on this issue. The opposition can run that union line as long as they like. They can get out there and pretend that somehow this has something to do with privatisation when it has not.</para><para>Quality of service is a very important issue. We want a bill put through this Senate in the not too distant future that will give the government the power to give directions in relation to quality of service. Why are the opposition opposed to it? Why don't they want that to happen? Because they are blinkered, because they are not really interested.

For years, those of us living in rural and regional Australia under the Labor Party regime paid enormous excise on fuel, and when you live furthest from the capital cities and the ports the cost of transport is a very big impost. It is also obvious that a lot of the wealth of Australia comes from rural and regional Australia, and transport costs again add to the cost of that. That is why this is such a good package, because costs of transport will fall. Diesel fuel will be 25c a litre cheaper on the trucks that carry goods to the ports and bring material back to us in the bush. For business generally there will be a $10 billion saving in costs. For Australian exporters—and this is very important in rural and regional Australia—costs of $4.5 billion will go as a result of this package. There will be $1.1 billion taken off agricultural costs, which equates to an average saving of $7,500 per farmer in Australia. That is really good news for Australians.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Coonan mentioned local government.

We should not, therefore, jump to any conclusions and assume that what they happened to put in their memo, even if acting in good faith—and we can assume that, I suppose—faithfully represented any agreement that might have been reached between them. At the end of the day, the decision will be made by those in authority, not by parties and particularly not by those who might have an interest in prematurely releasing details of what one would have assumed were internal discussions.

Obviously it is clear that Senator MacGibbon has the same enthusiasm for this initiative as I do, as does the Prime Minister. On Friday night the Prime Minister did make a major announcement in a major speech to 800 people in Melbourne representing the community sector and the corporate sector—all of whom, I must say, were delighted with the initiative. Senator MacGibbon has made representations himself to the government on this initiative and the need for it. The government last year took advice from David Gonsky's working party on taxation reform in this area and it was as a result of that that the Prime Minister made the announcements he did on Friday night. So, in other words, something like $51 million of tax incentives in the coming year will encourage gifts to charities by the private sector, whether by individuals or companies. We expect that will mean something like $75 million going to Australian charities. No wonder it is regarded as being a far-sighted measure. The government is in no way suggesting that it will walk away from its responsibilities to look after those in need.</para></talk.start><para>This was an opportunity to enhance our society, to make it an even more caring one. It is interesting that those who were presented 
 with the Prime Minister's awards on Friday night not only gave of their financial resources; some of them more particularly gave of their expertise and personal time. The winners, Lend Lease, in partnership with the Sydney City Mission, were involved, with something like 2,000 of their staff giving of their time to projects nominated by the City Mission—giving of their time, their expertise and their money, where that was needed. But it is very important that corporate Australia is being recognised by the government for what they have been doing and, even more, for what they can do in the future. So the tax initiatives will help individuals; they will also help companies whereby gifting of property, either after death in testamentary gifts or during one's lifetime, will be made easier—red tape will be reduced and the opportunity to be more generous will be there.</para><para>The Prime Minister is setting up a community business partnership which will be run by a board, of which he will be the chairman. It will make recommendations on the Prime Minister's awards for excellence in business and community partnerships. I will be his alternate chair, and a small group of senior people in welfare and corporate Australia will make up the board. The board is designed not only to give the government advice but also to assist in the brokerage of significant partnerships between corporate Australia and the community sector.</para><para>This is a far-sighted initiative which will go to a more caring Australia, which will encourage a more generous Australia and which will make for better outcomes for those in need. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to highlight the leadership role that the Prime Minister has taken in this. He has a great personal commitment to it, and anybody who was at the dinner on Friday night would well understand that this is something very dear to the Prime Minister's heart. It is very dear to my heart as the minister responsible for the program. I am delighted to think that this Australian government is in partnership with business and with the community sector in getting better outcomes for Australians. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Information Technology: Outsourcing</title><page.no>3379</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3379</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Ellison, representing the Minister for Finance and Administration.

Senator Lundy was reported in the weekend press as saying that there should be a moratorium on this outsourcing, which would rob entirely small to medium enterprises of any chance of getting any IT outsourcing work. Let us look at the government's record in relation to outsourcing and small to medium enterprises. In our first contract, cluster 3, we created 275 full-time jobs and delivered 24 per cent of contract value to small to medium enterprises. This 
 had an Australian value added content of 80 per cent and delivered strategic investment worth $40 million. Senator Lundy implied in that statement that the government had put out propaganda on its stance in relation to small to medium enterprises and its outsourcing policy. I have just cited an example where 24 per cent of the contract value went to small to medium enterprises.</para></talk.start><para>What about the outsourcing IT needs of the Australian Taxation Office? There we saved taxpayers $100 million and delivered over $100 million in work to small to medium enterprises. That will see $280 million worth of products sourced in Australia and 138 new jobs created—86 of them in regional Australia. But there is more. Our third project, known as cluster 5, or group 5, will boost exports by $30 million and create 100 jobs in southern Queensland. It will boost local industry by $70 million. That is what the government's outsourcing is doing in relation to small to medium enterprises, and it is good news for them.</para><para>I will not comment on the detail of one particular tendering process because it would be inappropriate for me to do so. That is a matter which is commercial-in-confidence. I would say that, if Senator Lundy and the opposition had their way, there would be no IT outsourcing and there would be nothing not just for small to medium enterprises but for anyone.

It is the first substantial question we have had from the opposition the whole afternoon. There is a fair amount of meat in the question, but at least it gives us food for thought. Senator Stott Despoja was referring to the fact that food commodities using gene technology have been 
 in the marketplace overseas since 1992 and currently there are over 50 such commodities approved for food use worldwide. On 30 July 1998 health ministers, in their capacity as the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council, approved standard A18 to regulate the sale of foods produced using gene technology. This standard will come into effect nine months after the date of gazettal, on 13 May 1999. Senator Stott Despoja's question really should be asked after 13 May 1999 because the standard has not come into effect yet. Premising a question on the results after the standard comes into effect is not appropriate.</para></talk.start><para>Once the standard takes effect it will be illegal to send any food produced using gene technology unless it has been assessed as being safe by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority and approved by health ministers. The enforcement of the standard is the responsibility of state and territory health authorities. The pre-market approval requirement of the standard has been widely publicised in the media and in ANZFA publications, and the implications of the standard have been known by industry bodies and food companies in both Australia and New Zealand since the notification of a draft standard was announced in February 1997.</para><para>ANZFA has received six applications relating to foods derived from genetically modified crops, and public notification of these six applications was published on 28 October last year. ANZFA has completed the safety assessment of the first two of these six applications and has found that two commodities—one being herbicide tolerant soya bean and the other insect resistant cottonseed—meet safety requirements for food. These two are the principal genetically modified food commodities that are currently in the marketplace in Australia and have been in use by manufacturers for several years. A recommendation to the Food Standards Council on the regulation of these commodities is expected in April. The council is then to decide whether to approve these foods for continued use in the food supply.</para><para>Being aware that many imported foods may not be covered by these six applications, 
 ANZFA as a matter of urgency has notified food industry bodies, especially the owners of the original genetically modified commodity, in Australia, New Zealand and overseas of the need to submit applications for assessment. The minister is most concerned that, due to inaction on the part of the owners of these genetically modified commodities, many food importers and manufacturers in Australia and New Zealand may be damaged once the standard is enforced as of 13 May. If on 13 May, when the standard comes into force, ANZFA has before it applications that have yet to be fully assessed, health ministers will need to determine whether transitional arrangements are justified so as not to disrupt the marketplace.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3381</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the minister for his answer, but I ask the minister to clarify what he means by `transitional arrangements'.

Am I to understand from the minister's answer that he will ensure that any products that are not assessed by the commencement of standard A18 will be removed from the shelves, so any unapproved products will actually be removed from shelves? Thirdly, will the minister clarify whether he is stating that products that have been approved overseas will be available for sale in Australia, or can he guarantee that they will have to be approved by independent Australian assessment before they are approved for sale in Australia?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3381</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I can guarantee that ministers would not accept any transitional arrangement for foods which were known to pose a risk to public health and safety. That will be the bottom line, and I will certainly guarantee that. But the evaluation of the safety of genetically modified foods is the responsibility of the food authority, and it undertakes evaluations in accordance with internationally accepted best practice risk assessment principles.

It is very important that people see it in that light.

When it was written in 1900, the intention was to give some information on the reason for the enactment of the legislation. Our intention in updating it is to more appropriately reflect why we want to continue to join together in what is actually a contract between the states and territories and its citizens. These are the sorts of words that are in the current preamble, which I think very effectively illustrate why the Prime Minister—and indeed the entire government—want to update this particular part of our Constitution. It includes such words as, in the third paragraph:</para></talk.start></continue><para>Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows . . . </para><para>I do not think that there is a person in this parliament or indeed in this country who would believe that those sorts of words—`the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons'—effectively or appropriately anymore reflect the sorts of priorities that we have in this country or are an accurate reflection of the way that we are.</para><para>In my view, the government's draft preamble is not clumsy or awkward. It is more easily understood than what we have now. To me, it reflects more accurately our way of life and what has influenced us as we have matured as a nation. It expresses and reflects on our past, our future and on the important individual aspirations and freedoms that we hold for the future, in a way which enables each of us to interpret them as we wish.</para><para>Men and women who are around in times of trouble or sadness or celebration are people I call `mates'. They are my mates. I do not ring people up and say `mate', as some members of the Labor Party might do, and nor have I had any phone calls from people who might suggest that to me. But there is no doubt in my mind that the term `mateship' 
 means, to me, a non-gender form of endearment.</para><para>When my father died, my mother told me that she had lost her best mate. I understood absolutely and very clearly what she meant. She did not mean it in any blokey way, nor did she expect that I would take it that way. I understood entirely what she meant. Some people want Australia to be remodelled as a republic to freshen our image overseas, to give us freedom and independence, but talking down this suggested preamble means that in the middle of next century we could still be arguing about it—especially if we hear what Gareth Evans says: 30 years to codify the reserve powers of the Governor-General. At this rate, Gareth's select committee will still be considering this in 30 or 40 years time and there will still be no mention in our preamble of our indigenous families, no mention of those people who have come to this country over the last 200 years, no mention of anything that more appropriately reflects the kind of country we now are. We will simply have, if Gareth has his way, `Lords Temporal and Spiritual' and other inappropriate forms of words. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>3386</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—After the contribution from Senator Ferris, one realises how bad this preamble that the Prime Minister inflicted on the Australian people last week really is.

We have had an extraordinary performance from the Prime Minister. As I said before lunch in the debate about the <inline ref="r743">Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999</inline> , the Prime Minister discovered that, come the referendum to decide whether Australians should have one of their own as president, he would be one of the few people out there saying no and he would look an 
 utter dill in being so. He had to think of something he could positively put up and say, `I am in favour of it. Yes.' So he came up with the preamble—not the preamble that the Constitutional Convention proposed 14 months ago after at least two weeks of discussion among a cross-section of all political thought ranging across the community. No, we do not have that preamble; John Howard says, `I'm not a bad hand with a pen. I'll have a go at it.' He spoke to two people: Les Murray and Professor Blainey are the only two he consulted. He did not consult Robert Hill. He did not consult Senator Ferris or Senator Abetz—not one member of the parliamentary Liberal Party was consulted. They all had to have amnesia. Then he put it to them at the party meeting, saying `This is the wonderful document' and daring anyone to say no. They all rolled over and said, `Yes, it's fine.' Then they started leaking to the press this week what a dumdum the Prime Minister is and what a stupid preamble it is.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In particular there is the issue of his prejudicial view in not recognising the prior custodianship of Aboriginal people on this continent.

Of course, Senator Abetz's view of recorded history is what has been written in a law book printed in the last 30 years. That is his idea of recorded history. This is another example of the Liberal Party being so out of tune. A majority of Australian people are quite willing to say it is quite reasonable to have a preamble that states the fact that the Aboriginal people were here before white settlement; that they had custodianship of this land and that should be recognised.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Because of his prejudicial and 1950s view of how the world should be and how in particular Australia should be, the Prime Minister has written a preamble that does nothing else but reflect his view that Australia in the next century should be based on when  he thought Australia was at its best—the 1950s. It is a disgrace that he proposes this to the people. No wonder he is being derided all around Australia—laughed at by half of the Liberal Party. Even one of the most conservative figures, Bruce Ruxton, has dismissed it as pure corn. Others well noted for their conservative views have laughed it off the stage. The best thing this Prime Minister could do, as I said earlier, is take the view of Sir Robert Menzies when he tried to propose the name `royal' for our decimal currency amid great derision: he withdrew it. The Prime Minister should withdraw his preamble and allow a proper consultation within the Australian community about what would be a decent preamble for all of Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>3387</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What we have seen is a hysterical and affected opposition by Senator Reynolds and the Labor Party to a preamble. What Senator Schacht and those on the other side cannot overcome is the fact that they had 13 years in government to deal with this very sensitive issue. Did they ever once come up with a proposal for the Australian people? No, there was absolutely none, because they were too scared or incapable of dealing with such an important decision, with such an important provision for our Constitution. Senator Ferris has just told the Australian people what the preamble actually says at the moment. After having dealt with Labor's economic mess in our first term of government, we are now turning ourselves to some of the other social issues which are of importance to this nation. As a result, early on in this our second term, we are dealing with the issue of the preamble.</para></talk.start><para>Let us have a look at the draft for a national declaration of reconciliation forwarded by the chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Evelyn Scott, on 17 March 1999. Paragraph 2 states:</para><para>We celebrate the fact that the Aboriginal culture is the oldest living continuous culture on the planet. That culture is still alive. It is sacred, spiritual and practical, a unique way of living in harmony with the land. Through the land and its first peoples, newcomers to this country may taste that spirituality and rejoice in its grandeur.</para><para>In the draft preamble to the Constitution, the Prime Minister suggests:</para><para>Since time immemorial—</para><para>or oldest living continuous culture, according to the draft for a national declaration of reconciliation, which is very similar wording—</para><para>our land has been inhabited by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, who are honoured for their ancient and continuing cultures.</para><para>It is virtually identical to what Evelyn Scott and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation have put forward. Yet there is this affected hysteria from those on the other side who are trying to suggest that the preamble does not do the right thing by our fellow Australians who are our indigenous brothers and sisters. The reality is that that is exactly what the draft preamble is doing.</para><para>I suggest to honourable senators opposite that they take a broad view of the Australian population and ask themselves if they want to frame a preamble in the politically correct manner that Kim Beazley suggests, falling over himself to put wheelbarrow load after wheelbarrow load of political correctness before the Australian people. You can bet your bottom dollar that especially in the blue ribbon Labor seats that preamble would be rejected. The Prime Minister is seeking to chart a course not for political correctness but for what the Australian people, as a whole, will reasonably adopt, accept and incorporate into their Constitution to make it a more living document, to make it more representative of the aspirations of the Australian people, as our country exists today.</para><para>Indeed, the preamble goes on to talk about the enrichment to this nation provided by migrants. There are a lot of other excellent comments in this preamble—indeed, statements—which enrich our constitutional structure. It will be a great document for all Australians to read and consider when they think about what being Australian means. I 
 suggest to my friends opposite that they stop and think for a while. The next election is not going to be won or lost over the preamble issue, so take a statesmanlike approach to this sensitive issue and, for a change, don't be negative, look at it in a positive light and make a positive contribution to your country, and remember that for 13 years you had the opportunity and failed to deliver one word of preamble. We have given to the Australian people for their consideration a coherent, consistent and acceptable preamble, which is a lot more than Labor ever did and ever will do.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>3388</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Herron to Senator Faulkner on the preamble on behalf of the many constituents who have phoned my home and my office in the last few weeks.

Interestingly, they were all from women, and I will come back to that in a moment.</para></talk.start><para>People are disappointed that there is a lack of vision and dignity shown in the words of the draft preamble. I do not understand why it was that Mr Howard and a couple of his advisers did this preamble. I am not sure why they did not seek to use a Senate committee, which has the capacity to look at all of the distinct groups that make up this great nation of ours. Why were they, as a Senate committee, excluded from the process? Why has this document turned into a document belonging purely to the Howard government? It is a document that does not really belong to the present generation. My colleague Senator Schacht made reference to the preamble sounding like a document from the 1950s, and I would have to agree with him. It does not sound to me like a document for the future.</para><para>The draft preamble begins with a statement about hope in God. Surely the statement `faith in God' would have been more appropriate. Most people from various religious beliefs have faith in their God. That was one of the issues that was raised in one of the phone calls that I have had. It came from a Baha'i 
 woman living on the north-west coast. She made the point that there are many people of various faiths in this country and that she felt that the word `faith' would have been more appropriate than `hope'.</para><para>Most of the vocal criticism that I have had is from women who object to the word `mateship'. They say that it is too blokey in nature. If you think about it, there probably were not any women chosen to help advise on this preamble. Therefore, the culture of the thinking of the people who were contributing to the preamble probably belongs, as Senator Schacht has said, in the 1950s, when women were perhaps not recognised in the way that they are now.</para><para>There is no mention of the nobility of tenure prior to white settlement; no mention of the custodial nature of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and their relationship to the land; and no apology to them for the devastation that we have caused their culture. There is no acknowledgment of their care of the land prior to white settlement.</para><para>I wish to quote from an article in the Tasmanian press concerning one of the other issues that have been brought to my attention.

As Senator Abetz said at the beginning of his contribution, the Labor Party were in office for 13 years. They could have dealt with the difficult question of the preamble. They could have dealt with a republic. But no, they did not deal with it. They fiddled around, argued and used it as a diversion—very unlike what our Prime Minister has done. They complain about the fact that our Prime Minister, Mr Howard, claims some ownership of this issue. He has every right to claim that ownership. Mr Keating could have done the same, but he chose not to do so. He was probably too busy worrying about his piggeries and one or two other things. Mr Hawke could have acted, but he was too busy defending his back. We now have a Prime Minister who is prepared to deal with this issue and bring forward some suggestions.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Denman has just informed the Senate that she has had a number of phone calls regarding this issue. I have had a number of phone calls—some opposed to the proposal, some who could not care less and some who support it very strongly. At the end of the day, it will be the Australian people who determine whether or not the preamble is rewritten. But it is interesting to note where the opposition to the proposal by the Aboriginal people has come from. It is very small and rare. In fact, the communities in Western Australia, for example, want us to address the real issues that Labor failed to deal with in their 13 years of office. The Labor Party should be prepared to debate their record on Aboriginal people. They should debate the real issues that are close to their hearts and which protect their health, education, housing and so on.</para><para>I remind people of some of the problems that existed in the 13 years that Labor were in office and that they did not address—unlike the coalition. Our minister, Senator 
 Herron, in my view, has really focused on the issues that count and that Aboriginal people are worried about—that is, their life expectancy, infectious diseases and the fact that only 33 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Islander children complete schooling, compared with a national average of 77 per cent.</para><para>A total of 120 remote Aboriginal communities do not have an adequate water supply. So what did Senator Herron do? He organised with Mr McLachlan to get assistance, through the Army, to many communities in the Northern Territory. Senator Margetts should be one of those people who recognise that at long last we have a minister and a government that are prepared to address these matters—not go off on a draft preamble over words, muck around, dodge issues and what have you. Those opposite had their opportunity and they blew it. It is as simple as that: they blew it.</para><para>The government spent over $700 million more in real terms on indigenous specific programs over the years 1996-97 to 1999 than were spent in the last four years of the previous government. That speaks for itself. Commonwealth funding for indigenous specific programs will increase from $1.722 billion in 1995-96 to $1.887 billion in 1998-99—in real growth, almost 2.4 per cent. The government has guaranteed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs portfolio a budget for the years 1997-98 to 2001 quarantined from specific budget cuts over this period.</para><para>In 1998-99, over 70 per cent of government spending on indigenous affairs will be the priority areas of health, housing, infrastructure, education, employment and training and economic development. ATSIC's housing, health, infrastructure and existing Community Development Employment programs have been quarantined from the same saving measures. Total spending on indigenous and specific primary health programs will increase by $73 million. So we have here a government of action—a minister of action—when looking at the problems which exist for Aboriginal people, and unprecedented targeting concerning the requirements of Aboriginal people. I can tell 
 you quite clearly that the response we get from the communities is quite amazing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

 of Anti-personnel Mines.</inline>  The Convention is an historic step towards the aim of a total global ban on anti-personal mines. The Australian Government's commitment to the Convention is to be applauded. As is the passage, by this parliament, of the Anti-personnel Mines Convention Act 1998—which implements in Australian law the obligations imposed by the Convention.</para><para>Our report makes two recommendations aimed at continuing the momentum towards a global ban on anti-personnel mines:</para><para>.	 first, that the Minister for Defence formulate principles to guide the retention of mines for defence training purposes, so as to clarify the process and timeframe for the destruction of those mines not required for training purposes; and</para><para>.	 second, that, in appropriate international fora, the Australian Government put a strong position against the development of replacement weapons technologies which have indiscriminate and inhumane effects similar to those possessed by anti-personnel mines.</para><para>The committee also strongly supports the <inline font-style="italic">Bougainville Peace Monitoring Group Protocol.</inline></para><para>Australia has played a significant role in the Bougainville peace process:</para><para>.	 by facilitating truce and ceasefire discussions between the warring parties;</para><para>.	 by contributing around 250 civilian and unarmed Defence Force personnel to the work of the Peace Monitoring Group; and</para><para>.	 by sponsoring a substantial and growing aid program.</para><para>Given the scale and nature of the devastation caused by the conflict, there is much work to be done to restore even the most basic community services to those living on Bougainville. Australia's aid program will continue to play a crucial role in re-establishing services and infrastructure; in building new systems of administration; and in restoring a functioning economy.</para><para>The third major treaty considered in Report 20 is the Development Cooperation Agreement with Indonesia.</para><para>This Agreement is intended to provide a generic legal framework for Australia's development cooperation program with Indonesia. It is a usefully document, which will simplify the project development processes for both governments and for the non-government organisations commissioned to run aid projects in Indonesia.</para><para>The Agreement is important not only for what it provides, but because it signals that, at a time of great social and political upheaval in Indonesia, Australia is committed to building structures to

 from 10 December, when it met for the first and only time for the balance of the calendar year.</para><para>As such, the report deals with committee operations under the Chairmanship of the Member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), ably supported by the Vice-Chairman, the Honourable Member for Throsby (Mr Hollis).</para><para>The Thirty-second committee tabled five reports during 1998.</para><para>The total estimated cost of projects examined by the committee was $560.67 million.</para><para>The election period limited the committee's operations during the year. The five reports presented is the same number of reports presented during 1996. This relatively small number does not reflect the complexity of two references which consumed considerable time. These were:</para><para>.	 the proposed new facilities for the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies; and</para><para>.	 the proposed East Coast Armament Complex, Point Wilson, Vic.</para><para>It is rare for the committee's inquiries to extend beyond one or two days of public hearings. One reason for this has been the thoroughness of submissions and oral evidence presented by proponent departments in support of proposed works. Another reason is the general support of proposed works by state and local government and interested organisations and individuals. It is when these factors are lacking that the committee's inquiries may be lengthy and protracted.</para><para>The committee's inquiry into the Museum of Australia extended from December 1997 to mid-April 1998, during which four public hearings were held.</para><para>Although recommending that the project proceed, in view of a number of uncertainties, principally about the cost of the work and the suitability of the project delivery mechanism to be adopted, the committee requested to be provided with six-monthly progress reports. The government agreed with this request.</para><para>The committee's inquiry into the East Coast Armament Complex was also lengthy. The project referred to the committee was estimated to cost $72.27 million and involved the construction of facilities at Point Wilson (Vic) to support the ammunitioning and deammunitioning of RAN ships and to provide facilities for the importation of munitions for the Defence force.</para><para>The committee's inquiry extended from mid-February to mid-June 1998 and involved public hearings and inspections at six locations spread over geographical locations from far north Queensland to coastal Victoria. 
</para><para>The length of the inquiry can be attributed to an erroneous perception by the Department of Defence that the scope of the committee's inquiry would not extend beyond an examination of the need for and the scope of the facility to be constructed at Point Wilson. This inquiry provides a good illustration of the committee's role in safeguarding the public interest.</para><para>The report canvasses a number of other matters raised in the committee's reports during the year, overseas works, details of medium works submitted by Departments, Commonwealth fire safety policy and amendments to the Public Works Committee Act.</para><para>As I mentioned earlier, during 1998 the parliament was well-served by the committee under the Chairmanship of the Honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the Vice-Chairmanship of the Honourable Member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). I believe the report demonstrates how the honourable senators served the parliament through the committee with dedication and distinction and upheld the long tradition of bipartisanship which has been the hallmark of the committee's operations.</para><para>I would also like to place on record a vote of appreciation for the hard work of the other members of the committee during 1998 and, of course, the very capable Secretariat.</para><para>I commend the report to the House.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Accounts and Audit Committee</title><page.no>3396</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report </title><page.no>3396</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>3396</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present a corrected version of the finance minute to the committee's report No. 537—<inline font-style="italic">The Jindalee Operational Radar Network Project</inline> .

The arguments and the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that the government's tax package would be extremely harmful to the health of our environment and to the health of our cities. This report is a very well documented account of the negative effect of the government's new tax package over these wide-ranging fields.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What has been absolutely clear to the committee is the fact that the government has missed a rare opportunity to reform the tax system in a way that has positive outcomes for the environment and the arts. Australia is one of the few countries in the OECD which has not implemented ecological tax reform and, rarer still, in proposing to significantly reduce the price of fuel. Witnesses pointed out that not only was Australia proceeding along a path which would seriously worsen our air pollution problems but also vehicles were currently only required to comply with emission standards which are at least five years behind those of Europe and the US.</para><para>The committee's attention was drawn to Australia's international obligations on greenhouse gas emissions. This tax package sends a powerful message to the international community that Australia does not consider greenhouse issues to be of central importance 
 to the nation's future or, for that matter, to the world's. It has been difficult to cast any sort of positive light on the policy objectives which must have informed this tax reform package. Central to the deliberations of the committee were whether benefits to farmers and business could be delivered in a more environmentally responsible way, and I believe the recommendations do just that.</para><para>It appears that the package was prepared in isolation by Treasury and that neither Environment Australia, the Greenhouse Office nor the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts were consulted by Treasury. Neither were the many submitters with expertise in the field.</para><para>The diesel fuel currently imported to Australia has high levels of sulfur which results in a much higher level of particle emissions than do gaseous fuels. Medical evidence linking particulates from diesel engines with conditions like asthma translate into health and social costs which some estimate to be as high as $2 billion per year. There is sufficient evidence on the health impacts of diesel fuels to suggest that even the current level of diesel use should be lowered and powerful incentives and standards introduced to accelerate Australia's progress towards cleaner engines and diesel fuel with much lower sulfur content. The committee heard that it was likely that old polluting diesel vehicles would be dumped into Australia unless our standards were brought into line with Europe and the US.</para><para>Our present tax system does not impose an excise on gaseous fuels, and this provides some incentive to changing over from petrol and diesel to LPG and CNG. This industry would collapse under the new tax package. When the New Zealand government removed the price differential between gas and diesel there was a dramatic reduction in the use of gaseous fuels. Already, decisions are being made by bus operators in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and Geelong to pull back from converting from diesel to gas. Heavy transport engines are now available which can run either dedicated CNG or with dual fuel options. This package would discourage any move towards the use of these vehicles.</para><para>The massive reduction in diesel will bring about a very significant increase in road transport at the expense of rail with very serious consequences. A GST on public transport means that bus and rail will become more expensive relative to private transport. Solar hot-water services would rise in price by around four per cent relative to the price of similar gas or electricity hot-water systems. The world leadership that Australia currently has in solar electricity development and the potential for the industry to generate revenue in excess of $1 billion every year is also at risk.</para><para>The reduction in diesel fuel excise would bankrupt the oil recycling industry, leaving around 150 million litres of lubricating oil being dumped rather than recycled. In the view of the Democrats, the $3.5 billion in petrol and diesel tax cuts should be significantly reduced, and measures should be introduced to see that the remaining cuts are targeted to reduce transport costs for rural producers and are properly tailored to deliver better ecological practices.</para><para>It is the Democrats' recommendation to amend the tax package to: continue to tax petrol and diesel through the excise system rather than the GST; maintain the current 100 per cent diesel rebate for all agricultural and other fully rebateable off-road uses; cap the rebate for mining and other use at the current level and provide a pro rata amount for all off-road use, bringing in line industries such as tourism; provide rail with a 100 per cent diesel rebate, recognising that rail, too, is an off-road use; provide a tightly targeted rebate for heavy road transport by increasing the weight threshold from 3.5 to 20 tonnes; require companies claiming the rebate to progressively reduce fuel emissions; apply an additional sales tax to new motor vehicles with low fuel efficiency, based on a sliding scale; zero rate public transport; introduce a range of non-tax related measures to reduce pollution and other greenhouse gas emissions; and other measures to improve the viability of the gaseous fuel industry through exemptions and capital grants.</para><para>The Democrats recognise the important contribution the arts make to our cultural 
 identity, and we also recognise the financial vulnerability of many arts organisations and artists. I think there is little doubt that the arts sector will be damaged by this package. The performing arts groups are already experiencing severe losses, and the incomes of individual artists are already amongst the lowest of any working group.</para><para>I would like to finish by saying that the preparation of this report has stretched the resources of the committee secretariat to the limit. I want to sincerely thank Mr Richard Selth, Mr Ross Kilmurray, Mr Jason Vickery and Mr Tony Burke for an excellent report and for their patience and willingness to work long hours to have it tabled—not just in time but two days earlier than the due date. The secretariat had to meet very tight timelines for this inquiry whilst also conducting hearings into the government's new Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill, which were held in each capital city.</para><para>I commend this report to the Senate and hope the government can see their way clear to making urgent changes to their tax package as a result of such overwhelming evidence.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>3398</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is the first report in a series of four on the GST. I would like to make some general comments before I get into some of the specific issues of what we are reporting on today.</para></talk.start><para>We went to the last election totally up-front about a GST package. We said precisely what we are going to do in terms of collection of this tax and the way in which we are going to compensate people for that tax increase. We had a very wide-ranging set of measures in terms of income tax cuts and increased welfare benefits to offset that.</para><para>The Australian people, in October last year, gave their verdict. We went to the election with this tax package as the central issue, and we were re-elected. What we have in the Senate is, again, obstruction of the government program. We had the setting up of a series of inquiries—not one but four. After the time it has taken, and the amount of travel, to collect evidence around Australia, what do we end up with at the end of the day? We have a report and at the end of that 
 report the Australian Democrats have added their view; the Greens have taken a slightly different view; the Labor Party has a different view again; and the coalition has a different view again. That is exactly what we went into the last election on, and here we are, after all this process, all this time and all this cost, with precisely the same outcome again. What a waste of time it has all been.</para><para>There are none so blind as those who will not see, and that applied in this set of hearings. We had interest groups come along and provide us with evidence, all based on price increases with the GST, and I do not recall one ever taking into account the fact that we had a compensation package. In areas like the arts they were talking about changes in the price of tickets. They took absolutely no account of the fact that there were also changes in compensation through income tax changes and increased welfare benefits. They also totally ignored the fact that we are in a time of rising real income and incredibly low inflation and the fact that the arts industries have thrived over the last 20 years in times of very high inflation. We now have low inflation, rising real incomes and a compensation package for people who want to attend arts functions. To claim there is going to be some great crash in the arts as a result of this is absolute nonsense. As a matter of fact, I found a lot of the language—particularly in the recommendations from the ALP—extremist in nature, because a lot of the evidence showed that any effect was going to be very minor and there was sufficient compensation in most cases.</para><para>I would like to turn to the main point of the report, which dealt with the effect on the environment. The emphasis here was very much on fuels—on the way in which use of diesel fuel would change as a result of this tax. It defies the imagination to think that anyone, because there are lower prices of fuel, will suddenly start driving around a lot more and burning up that fuel. To back that up, I would like to quote from a news release from the National Farmers Federation. The news release states:</para><para>"Are the AMA and the ACF seriously suggesting that farmers will spend more time and more money than they need to harvest grain or plant crops, that 
 truck drivers will take the long way round between Sydney and Melbourne, or that passenger vehicle drivers in our major cities will choose to spend more time in traffic, just because the cost of diesel is reduced!", Mr Donges said.</para><para>I think this points out the absurdity of the proposition. Where is this big increase in fuel use going to come from? Some have claimed there will be an intermodal shift between road and rail. The evidence from the Road Transport Forum tended to show that this would be, if anything, quite minor; that the shift to suddenly transporting goods by road instead of rail would be quite tiny indeed.</para><para>The thing that it totally lacks is in the context of what is happening with technology. Because of the emissions standards in Europe and the United States, there is now a major shift towards compressed gas technology in big engines such as those that drive trucks and buses. That will dramatically reduce greenhouse gases from road transport, despite anything else that is happening. So all the claims and all the evidence about terrible health outcomes from this were totally exaggerated as well.</para><para>I suggest people look at the evidence from the Road Transport Forum. I suggest people look at the evidence from Environment Australia, particularly from Dr Beale, which shows that the positions of the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats are a gross overstatement of effect. Yet again, as they did in the election campaign, they are trying to scare people on some things that are not major concerns but are minor concerns. They totally ignore counterbalancing measures: in the case of transport, with new technology; in the case of the arts, with compensating money that is coming from the tax package. The people of Australia should be very aware of how these opposition parties are trying to dupe them on these matters. If we are to have a fully competitive economy that is international best practice, this country must move to have a reformed tax system. The GST package that we went to the election honestly on is the one that should be adopted in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3399</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak to this report. At the outset, I commend the secretariat and other 
 members of the committee for their arduous application to this inquiry and also to the other concurrent inquiry in respect of environment legislation, which has still not been completed. The committee has had a lot of work to do, and they should be commended for the way they have done it.</para></talk.start><para>This was an extremely useful inquiry. The inquiry went across the country, and it went across sectors that will be affected by the GST package. This inquiry  in a sense did the job the government was not prepared to do. We consulted and we met with people. We listened to industry concerns, and we met with environmentalists and specialists. It has to be said, at the end of the day, that the overwhelming evidence—if not the total evidence—that the committee heard expressed concerns as to the government's processes and policies. We found no consultations. We found no consideration of some quite critical issues. We found total disregard for the concerns of those who have concerns for the environment, for the arts industry, for the books industry and particularly for new emerging technological industries—export industries that will be very negatively affected by the government's proposals.</para><para>It has to be said that all but the government senators have agreed on the flaws in the GST package and, as I said, there are quite a few of them. Not a voice was put to us in support of the government's proposals. Many voices were put to us in opposition. Many voices were concerned because of negative impacts on the arts industries, on literacy levels and particularly on the environment. The flaws are many. The major flaw is that the government in no way considered the impacts of its package—for instance, on the environment. The only process that has been embarked upon by the government to consider the environmental aspects of this package, which has been years in the making, has been commissioned by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in recent days—long after the event. He started the process of commissioning it last November after the election, but it has only been in the last few days that a consultant has been given the job to do the work.</para><para>We are concerned because we see that the GST package is fundamentally flawed when it comes to environmental issues and to some pretty critical industries in the Australian community. The evidence before the committee was that the GST package would have a negative impact on all areas examined by the committee, including: the environment, especially in urban areas; public transport services; emerging technologies; exports; the arts, including books and literature; non-profit organisations; and information technology and communications.</para><para>One sector that spoke very strongly and with deep concern as to the impact of the GST on its business was the rail sector. If people anticipate that the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line will be completed under current funding arrangements, then they have something coming to them. If people think that the Melbourne to Darwin line will be completed under the funding arrangements announced by the Prime Minister, then they have something coming to them as well. This particular tax proposal sounds the death knell for those two railway lines unless the government is prepared to increase subsidies towards them. Why is this so? Because the impact of the government's fuel tax changes will mean greater reliance on and greater use of road transport as opposed to rail transport. That was a concern put to us not just by Australian Rail but by Queensland Rail and by a number of independent commentators as well.</para><para>The impacts on the environment are manifold. The government will in no way be able to meet its commitments to Kyoto greenhouse gas reduction targets. It will in no way be able to meet commitments to urban Australia in terms of environmental clean-up and the quality of air in our crowded suburbs. This is evidence that came to us across the spectrum. The natural gas industry came to the committee saying, `There are two things: first of all, we haven't been consulted; secondly, contracts that we expected for the use of natural gas vehicles and contracts to supply buses in New South Wales and other states are now under a cloud because of the economics of the GST package, which make the use of natural gas less productive and less profitable than 
 other fuels.' Those sectors need to be considered, and they are a major concern as well.</para><para>This is a package which, at the end of the day, also fails in terms of the compensation aspects. When you talk to the arts industry, the Autogas Committee of Australia—as we did—and to those involved in waste oil collection you can see that not only are they going to be negatively affected but also the compensation package which the government is touting across the country will in no way meet their concerns.</para><para>Michael Lynch of the Sydney Opera House, for instance, expressed the concerns expressed by many when he said:</para><para>My concerns are . . . with both the major organisations—</para><para>including his—</para><para>their stress point and the reason they have called an inquiry into them and the small organisations. The range of changes and the range of compliance issues they will need to deal with . . . are going to be extraordinarily onerous</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>I took notice of the comments about the small business package, but from my point of view a lot of small businesses in Australia are going to be going for that $500 million.</para><para>That $500 million will not hit first base when it comes to the impacts on the industries that this committee was concerned about. As I say, going back to the primary focus of this committee's deliberations, all the evidence before the committee points to disastrous and long-term damage to the environment.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">TIERNEY</name><name role="display">Senator Tierney</name></talker><para>—Nonsense.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—Senator Tierney, you are not blind, but you refuse to see.

He did not like what he heard. The coalition did not like it because these are issues of which the best interpretation is that they are an unintended consequence of this package. When the full Senate select committee looked at these issues on some small aspects relating to the mining industry, yes, the Liberal senators were impressed. Yes, they looked at each other, nodded wisely and said, `Ooh! Unintended consequence. Let us look at these and make sure we can make changes.' But when it is about the environment, about whether or not we are going to encourage people to make changes towards purchasing diesel rather than gas—you would have to be blind not to see the advertisements already in the media for new gas vehicles, for new diesel technology. The diesel distributors, the people who import diesel and diesel technology, cannot believe their luck. It is not going to affect most of the people in rural communities. The impact is mostly going to be on the 
 urban environment, on our health, our future and our greenhouse gas emissions.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We also need to look at the impact on the community. When it comes to business costs, yes, the coalition are impressed. But when it comes to community costs it is, `Gosh, who are they? Why are they important? Oh gosh, let us think about the business community and the private sector.' But when it is the community, then it is, `No, you can get over it;' the arts, `Hey, you can live.' The reality is that when real impacts on real people are mentioned, the coalition turn their backs.</para><para>The Greens (WA) and the Australian Greens have put together some recommendations. We have agreed with the general concepts produced by the main committee report, but we have also made some specific recommendations. I commend those recommendations to honourable senators.

What we have here is a policy which is going to seriously damage Australia's environment. It is a policy which is going to cut across 
 Australia's obligations to the international community and to future generations. The GST, as the committee has discovered, is a recipe for spewing carcinogens into our most populous areas, with consequent horrendous results, both human and economic, down the line. The GST package is a recipe for boosting the production of greenhouse gases in this country at a time when we need to be cutting back. The GST is even a recipe for getting our forests to the wharves $1 a tonne cheaper so that the woodchippers can continue the rape and destruction of one of this nation's most desired assets.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Not only does the GST package not help poorer people, but when it comes to the environmental aspects it also actually materially degrades the living environment for all Australians in the future, be they poor or rich. It is a failure of government policy because when you are bringing in a comprehensive tax change you have to look at the ramifications for the community right across the board and into the future. The GST package is not only anti-environment, it compounds the problem of fixing environmental taxes into the system so that we can catch up in the future with Scandinavia and other countries by taxing polluters and giving incentives to those who do the right thing by the environment.</para><para>I would say to our friends in the Democrats: we warned about this before the last election. Nothing has changed. The information has come in to endorse what the Greens said last year. This package is an environmental horror. It goes against the interests of this country and future generations. It is one more good reason why, when the GST package comes into this place, it should be voted down. It is time for the Democrats to change tack and to say they will not accept a package which has such an environmental impost buried in it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>3402</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>3402</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Ferguson)</name></talker><para>—The President has received letters from party leaders and an Independent senator nominating senators to be

Even if the Legal and Constitutional Committee had no other work, it would have been impossible for it to contact all twenty three proposed witnesses, obtain submissions, advise the departments concerned, determine who would give evidence, and hold a hearing within such a limited timeframe.

Senator Ellison indicated that half of $15 million would go to each of the yes and no campaigns, first of all saying that this was an education campaign which was not about presenting a case. Then the response goes on to admit that half of the $15 million would go to the yes/no advertising campaigns. This ignores the fact that in relation to the yes/no advertising campaigns, according to the explanatory memorandum and according to Senator Ellison, the people putting those together would be chosen somehow neutrally from those people attending the Constitutional Convention. Quite clearly, just about everybody admits that that was a very narrow process. The reality is that it was as controlled as it could be. So if you choose people from the same original process and then say, `We want you to continue with this narrow process,' you are indeed simply continuing that process. So even the yes/no debate is nobbled in that situation.</para></talk.start><para>I would like further information on spending that $4.5 million on basically explaining such things as the current Constitution.

 make it absolutely clear, we have $19.5 million, $15 million of which is to go on the yes and no case arguments. That is a separate and discrete campaign where there will be two different points of view put forward. The public education campaign makes up the remaining $4.5 million. That will deal with three aspects: information on the current system that is in place; information as to the process of referendum; and information as to what the actual question will be when the people of Australia go to the referendum in November. That is in relation to the $4.5 million only. They are the three aspects of the expenditure.</para></talk.start><para>It has not been determined as yet how that will be divided up in funds.

But the government does believe it has a responsibility to provide at the outset a neutral campaign of education and information for the people of Australia as to what the current system entails. You simply have to travel around Australia to realise that people do have other things on their mind than the make-up of the parliament and the constitutional system of this country, and the government thinks that it is appropriate that, when the people of Australia come to determine what the position will be, they have a neutral campaign of information.</para></talk.start><para>But there is nothing to stop the yes or no case using the funds allocated to them to provide information as to the current system; nothing at all.

They will have to spend the money on their case for the republic. They cannot spend it on something completely different, for instance, and arrangements are being put in place for there to be supervision

I can say to Senator Bolkus that the government's decision has been that only the republic question should be funded. The terms of reference for the Constitutional Convention were to look at whether Australia should become a republic or not, and in the terms of reference no mention was made of a preamble. The preamble was something which came about during the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention, and the government believes that it is the republic question which should be funded.

Isn't it fairer to say that you are not aware of anyone who is going to vote for it apart from the Prime Minister, his wife, Professor Blainey, and possibly Les Murray—but maybe not? There is a very strong body of opinion in the community and this parliament that the preamble does us no service as a nation and does the Prime Minister no service as a Prime Minister, so you have to acknowledge that the chances of there being a no case on the preamble are pretty big at this stage.</para></talk.start><para>I find it quite amazing that you are prepared to fund a no case for one of the referenda but are not prepared to fund a no case in respect of the preamble.

We have some important concerns with the preamble. Like every other interest group commentator in the country, we think it is a shambles. As a consequence, we will be trying to find ways, through the mechanisms of this parliament and Senate, to develop a preamble which is more in tune with the nation's aspirations and not with the Prime Minister's prejudices. That will be our immediate objective over the next few weeks in this place and through whatever committee might be charged with responsibility for the preamble.</para></talk.start><para>I have to say to you that it is not just in here and it is not just in Canberra but it is across the country that people think that the preamble is something that the Prime Minister probably concocted in a bad dream and that they have got to live with it. The other thing that needs to be put on the record is that the Constitutional Convention, charged with the issue of the republic, also deemed—as probably most lawyers in the country would expect them to—that a preamble was an important concomitant to the deliberations of that convention.</para><para>The purpose of a preamble in legislation is essentially to provide the context through which the legislation can be read and should be interpreted. The view of the Constitutional Convention was that, in a situation where we were going to be confronted with a proposition for Australia to become a republic, there was a need to have a preamble which was appropriate to the new, independent status of the nation. As I say, most lawyers see the purpose of a preamble being to reflect the legislation that the preamble is an antecedent passage to; and it is no different in respect of a constitution and no different in respect of a constitution which changes from a monarchy to a republic.</para><para>It is quite bizarre that the Prime Minister has taken the view that he can treat the preamble as something separate, that as far as he is concerned there is a need for a new preamble to the Constitution, though that preamble need have nothing to do with 
 Australia moving towards the independent status of a republic. That is why we think the two issues are in many respects interwoven, and that is why it was the view of the Constitutional Convention last year that the two issues were interwoven and needed to be addressed together.</para><para>Going back to your previous answer, when you said that there would be no money made available and no provisions for the no case for the preamble, but that members of parliament would be able to prepare a no case to be distributed to the electorate in the normal non-referendum mechanisms that are available to this parliament, don't you think it is a bit undemocratic that you are providing resources for your side of parliament, for those who have been long-time supporters of the Prime Minister and his attachment to the monarchy?</para><para>You are providing money for them to run the no case in respect of the republic, to oppose Australia becoming a republic, but you are not prepared to provide resources for those who are opposed to this shambles of a preamble to pursue their case legitimately in the democratic debate across the nation in the lead-up to this referendum. You are prepared to give money to your long-term mates, but you are not prepared to give money to those who are arguing—very cogently, I must say—against the preamble that the Prime Minister has put together in the darkness of his lodge at Kirribilli.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">FERGUSON</name><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name></talker><para>—What!

Can I say that the way that the government has devised this is to give Australians the maximum choice. If you were to combine the two questions of the republic and the preamble, you might deprive those people who want to vote no to a republic but yes to the preamble of a combination of votes; so we are saying that there are two distinct issues there. One is a republic and one is a preamble. You might not want the republic but you might want the preamble; you have that choice. You might want both; you have that choice. You might not want both; you still have that choice. In fact, you might want the republic without the preamble, and you can still have that choice because the two questions are separated.</para></talk.start><para>As I mentioned earlier, the preamble was never mentioned in the terms of reference for the Constitutional Convention; a republic was. The republic has been the issue here all along. In 1988, there was no public funding for the referendum then and that was an important referendum, but there has been no referendum quite like the question of whether Australia should become a republic. That is such an important question that the government believes it requires public funding for both sides, in order for there to be a full ventilation of debate. 	Comments about the Prime Minister in the darkness of the Lodge and the pejorative terms that are being used will do neither side any good in the debate of this matter. It certainly has been the desire of all the commentators and those concerned that this debate should be conducted in a mature manner. It certainly is the desire of the government that it be conducted in a mature manner, one which Australians by and large can understand, one which is not full of vindictive language or malice, but one which is based on reason and cogent argument. It is in the interests of the country and in the interests of all concerned that this debate be conducted in that way.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>3409</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, picking up your last point, do you not think the Australian public would be offended by the fact that you are providing resources for one no case and not the other?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>3409</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are providing for one yes case and not the other.

But let me not be distracted by that. The question is about the maturity of the process itself whereby the Prime Minister took unto himself the business of drawing up the preamble. That is quite an untoward reflection on the talent and enormous capability there is of a collective of Australians to do that job better than any single person.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am sure that, if the government had been in the position where, for example, Gough Whitlam, had decided to do this, it would have brought the house down over it. But here we have the Prime Minister,  John Howard, doing it, and the government is trying to defend it. But the exercise has failed. That is manifest by the division it has caused in the community and the protest there is about the failure of this preamble from the Prime Minister's office to live up to the 
 expectations of Australians that they would have a preamble which is memorable, which gives rise to pride, and which is something that Australians at school could learn and feel good about. This does not meet that high promise.</para><para>That being said, where do we go from here? I do not believe the Prime Minister's preamble as it stands is going to be the one put at the referendum, and changes have to be made in the next little while to ensure that there is a different option for the people of Australia. That being the case, I wonder if the government has been discussing this matter and can enlighten this committee as to what course of action is to be taken to give an alternative which is not going to be divisive but is going to be acceptable to the voters.</para><para>One of those alternatives, if the Prime Minister wants to stick with his proposed preamble, is to allow for an alternative or a number of alternatives to be put forward so that people have a choice. I said earlier that I have read some remarkably good proposed preambles coming from the pens of high school young people in Australia. I think a bringing together of them, for example, would come up with a succinct, poetic and uplifting preamble which many Australians would want to vote for.</para><para>This was not too difficult with the plebiscite over the national anthem. Three alternatives were put forward there. Not only is the talent available in Australia to come up with an alternative, but already alternatives have been penned which ought to be there so that the critics of the Prime Minister's version have a choice to make. The question is: is the government going to entertain the idea of putting a number of preambles forward so that the people can make a choice? If it is not, or while it is considering that, to what degree is the government determined that the only question to be put to the people of Australia will be the preamble as coming from the Prime Minister a week or two ago?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>3410</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The situation with the multiple choice is one which is just not possible with the legislation and the way we conduct a referendum. If you 
 were to have multiple preambles, then you would have to have a question for each one; you would not be able to ask voters to select which one they liked. You could do that by way of a plebiscite or a national poll, as you mention in relation to the national song, but you could not do that by way of referendum.</para></talk.start><para>Apart from that, there is another difficulty—that if you gave multiple choices by way of a referendum it would be difficult to achieve the constitutional majority that would be required. If you had three preambles, for instance, and you offered the people of Australia a choice as to which one they preferred you could end up with an even vote of one-third for each preamble. That would make life very difficult indeed, because you would end up with nothing. So in a practical sense you have to put to the people of Australia a preamble requiring the answer yes or no.</para><para>In relation to the other matters you raise, Senator Brown, the preamble will be the subject of legislation—as will any other amendment to the Constitution—and it will be the subject of the usual course of debate, both in the other place and in this chamber, and it is anticipated that there will be a parliamentary committee process which will closely examine all of those proposed amendments.</para><para>The government does not for one minute shy away from that process. As Senator Brown knows, having participated in a number of committees, the parliamentary committee process is a very good one indeed. People will be invited to give evidence. They will have the opportunity to give evidence on what they think of the proposed constitutional amendments, and the preamble will form part of that. For people to say that there will be no chance for scrutiny is totally false. There will be parliamentary debate and a committee process whereby people will have the chance to have an input. The government is of the view that that is only appropriate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>3411</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Ellison for that. It is an important debate and I am sure we are all thinking about it as it goes along. Having taken out the option of a plebiscite, it be

We all want to see a preamble that is going to be highly accepted by the Australian people.</para></talk.start><para>The government is saying that, if there are to be changes to the Prime Minister's proposal, they ought to come from a committee process and then, presumably, from a debate in the two houses of parliament. This is new ground. The government's thinking here is that the public ought to be ready to feed its thinking on the preamble into a committee and then to follow through the debate consequent upon that committee's deliberations.</para><para>Has the government given thought to encouraging Australians to be alert to what is going to be a concentrated timetable for this process? If people are able to feed their ideas into a committee—if this is the only option available to us—the parliament will then be prepared for the ensuing debate. I am sure it will be a difficult job for that committee to determine its findings. I would not be surprised if it puts for consideration to the parliament a number of different findings—dissenting reports and so on—for its consideration.</para><para>At the end of that process, the government is going to bring in here a single preamble—it is going to be a single preamble; we have established that much. To what degree does the government anticipate that the two houses of parliament, debating this and having been charged with the responsibility of coming up with a conclusion, will be able to determine the final words of the preamble? I can see that this is going to be a very tortuous, complicated and potentially unsatisfactory direction to go.</para><para>I put to the government that the net be thrown wider to people in our community—even to a selection process. A number of people could be selected and they could then get together and come up with a preamble that is an alternative to the Prime Minister's and put that to the committee. That would be listening to what Australians have to say. 
 There needs to be some order in this process. Australians are going to want a preamble that they all feel good about. I, for one, am prepared to forgive some things in order that others are there. There has to be give and take in this. I think Australians, at large, have an enormous repository of goodwill towards us finding a conclusion.</para><para>The government has to be big enough to throw open the process, with a very short timetable, so that a committee of citizens is able to say, `We have sifted through all of this and here is our recommendation to the parliament.' I am a little worried that the sifting of an enormous input coming to us from the populace is to be left to a parliamentary committee and that, consequent upon that, there is a debate, potentially along political lines, in the two houses of parliament.</para><para>I put it to the Prime Minister that, beyond Les Murray, he ought to try again with a group of citizens. It is better for us, as a parliament, to make a determination and nominate people. We can, by agreement, get a group of people together to write a preamble. They would know the basic ground rules, which would have come from the Constitutional Convention. It is better for us to get together a collective of wise and tried and true Australians to do this job for us than for us to try to do the job ourselves. I am trying to be very constructive in this, but I think if we leave it to ourselves, as politicians, we are going to come up with something manifestly poorer than if, instead of choosing the words, we choose others to write the words for us.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>3412</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I mentioned earlier that there was $4.5 million for a public education campaign.

Added to that you have the next phase of yes and no arguments in relation to the republic and, finally, the dissemination of the yes and no cases by the AEC. That is sent to every elector in this 
 country. I think that is a pretty extensive process which is going to cover the next eight months or thereabouts.

The AEC will send out the final yes and no cases, but the public education program will not be run by the AEC.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>3413</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I acknowledge my mistake about the advisory panel. That is what I meant to refer to. I am curious about the idea that the AEC would not have a role in that education process. I wonder what that means. Does that mean that we would have a public education campaign along the same lines of, say, the government's promotional work on the Common Youth allowance or, dare I say it, the GST or the new tax system campaign? Are we looking at a $4.5 million taxpayer funded promotional campaign? My initial understanding, when you referred to a 
 neutral education campaign, was that we would see booklets, explanatory information and advertisements on television. This, presumably, was to be organised or monitored in some way by the AEC. Clearly, that does not sound like it will be the case—that it will be signed off on by the advisory panel. Can you give me a sense of the promotional information, even if it is early stages? Are we looking at promotional campaigns that are comparable with other campaigns used to promote government policy or legislative change, for example?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>3414</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The campaign dealing with public education will not be espousing one view or the other. The role of the AEC is simply to see that things get out to the electors—that they receive the yes and no cases. The AEC has never been involved in drafting any sort of argument or proposition. The AEC has always been the conduit to the people—that is, the parliamentarians draft the yes and no cases and the AEC is the effective conduit by which that gets to the people of Australia. The AEC has never had a role in actually drafting the argument or in an educational sense—and this is a substantial educational campaign. The AEC has not extended to that. What we would be doing is saying to the people at large, `You have a system—a Westminster style of government—where you have two houses of parliament. You have a Senate and a House of Representatives. You have a Governor-General and a Prime Minister.' We would be outlining simply the system of government that we have.</para></talk.start><para>Prior to the Constitutional Convention a booklet was sent out in relation to the system of government, the republic and the Constitutional Convention. I thought that was a reasonable publication. There was a challenge to it in the courts, which was overturned. But I think it was accepted by and large. I do not see how this part of the campaign is controversial. It simply outlines the process—that there will be these bills introduced which will have these amendments; parliamentary scrutiny; the question of the yes and no cases—and the 
 AEC will send it out. That would be the manner of it. As to the question to be put, it will simply outline: `This is the question that you will be getting. Do you want a president appointed by two-thirds of the members of parliament?' That is put in rough terms. Of course, it will be couched in terms much better than I could muster. But that will be the gist of it. It will be a neutral campaign of education.</para><para>The government thought that it needed to be contrasted by funding two separate cases—yes and no. That will be a bit more adversarial, of course, because one will be espousing one point of view and one the other. I believe, Senator Stott Despoja, that you are on the yes case and will be contributing to that debate.</para><para>But the AEC really has a completely different role. It is the conduit of information to the people. It also, I might say, will be working overtime to get people on the rolls. It will be working to get young people especially. I was very pleased recently to see, at the orientation day at the University of Western Australia, a stall set up by the AEC to get young people onto the roll, which I think is a very good idea. We have a program with the Victorian government whereby young people who get a drivers licence are contacted by the AEC to make sure they get on the roll. We are exploring this with other states. We are very keen to see that as many people as possible get a chance to vote at the referendum in November.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>3414</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have a couple more brief questions. I understand the point about the AEC. When you talk about an education campaign that educates people about the process of the referendum, clearly that is the role that the AEC often fulfils. You have just articulated some of the examples: mobilising people so that they register to vote and explaining to people the actual mechanics of voting. That is why we have those wonderful ads that have people playing hop scotch or whatever the particular campaign flavour might be. I am not suggesting this is controversial, but when we use words like 
 `education' and `a neutral campaign', obviously it is very hard for anything that is involved in politics to be value neutral. Obviously people are going to be curious about the role of this education campaign.</para></talk.start><para>I was just trying to ascertain whether or not it was just educating people about the actual process—what ballot papers you have to fill in, by when you have to get to the vote and at what time you are going to have to register. Clearly that is a role for the AEC. You have actually answered one query in that they will have that role in the campaign. But the actual $4.5 million will be spent differently and for a different education purpose.</para><para>I have a couple more queries. Firstly, I acknowledge your strong support today on behalf of the government for the preamble. Certainly that is something we have sensed from members on the government side—strong support for the preamble that has been drafted by the Prime Minister. I am wondering if you are able to confirm to the Senate whether that vote in the parliament will be a conscience vote for the government or whether members will be bound to vote for that preamble. Senator Calvert is nodding. My understanding is that it will be a conscience vote, which to me seems a bit odd, considering the strong support we are being told about that seems to be coming from government. Perhaps you could answer or put on record as to why that is a conscience vote?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>3415</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Prime Minister has indicated that the questions of whether Australia becomes a republic and whether we amend the Constitution to include this preamble will both be free votes for the members of the coalition. I believe that view is taken because of the rather unusual nature of the question being asked. When I say `unusual', I do not think we have had too many referendums this century where we have talked about Australia becoming a republic. It is the first time since Federation that we have gone to the people of Australia and said, `Do you want to become a republic? Do you want this preamble included in the Constitution?' It is the view of the coalition that this is something which 
 is not just in the realm of policy, which you would determine in relation to health or industrial relations. It is something which is quite different. For those reasons it has been decided that the members of the coalition will have a free vote.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>3415</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is my final question. We have talked a bit today about the need for broader, more extensive community consultation. We have acknowledged that the Prime Minister has said that he would accept community feedback until 30 April. I am a bit disappointed that we cannot actually suggest that there will be anything more than an informal process—that is, that we will not be seeing anything tabled or any formal feedback from the Prime Minister at the end of those deliberations, ruminations or what have you.</para></talk.start><para>Given that this inadequate and minimal level of community consultation and feedback has taken place, does this mean the Prime Minister is going to consider modifications to his draft preamble—his final version of the preamble but I think we should consider it as a draft—so that we will be able to have a constructive and positive debate in this Senate chamber? Are we going to see a Prime Minister who is willing to take on some changes to his draft preamble so that hopefully we can achieve something that more appropriately and honestly reflects the values and visions of the community? If that is not the case, will the government reject any amendments proposed or, in fact, moved successfully in this place; is that the bottom line?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3415</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is very difficult for the government to say what it will do in relation to proposed amendments until we see those proposed amendments.

In the lead-up to the Constitutional Convention, one of the pieces of information that was funded was something similar—it was entitled `Describe in plain English how the existing constitutional system operates, identifying the arguments for and against change'. I do not know whether Senator Ellison is suggesting we have something different from that. If the government was suggesting this as part of the neutral education program—if it really was an education program—would it include, for instance, information on the elements of a Constitution, what generally goes to make up a Constitution, the issues involved and what parts of the Constitution are being considered for changing at this stage, and so on?</para></talk.start><para>I believe that Senator Ellison has actually argued our case by saying that part of this $4.5 million is going to outline the system of government which we have.

The communique said `a public education program directed to the constitutional and other issues relevant to the referendum'. It does not say, `Explain to the people the system of government which we have.' I suppose some of that might be included. In reality, the decision was asking for people to be given an explan ation of the constitutional issues relevant to the referendum, not `This is our system, isn't it wonderful?' </para><para>I am really quite shocked that the government is saying that they are prepared to promote the current system of government by putting it out in the public arena—I do not know how you would put it out without promoting it in some way; it is like putting out stuff during an election campaign—explaining what is in the current system of government when, quite frankly, if that is the government's choice then that should be part of their campaign to keep the system as it is. That should be part of the $7½ million and perhaps that extra $4.5 million should be spent on actual community involvement.</para><para>Perhaps Senator Ellison could also explain whether public education programs will have some interaction involved with them. What does a public education program mean? Does it just consist of giving people information—that is, the old bucket and spade approach of education—or does it involve people being involved in workshops where they can ask questions and have them answered in a real public education program?

I think Senator Margetts might have misunderstood me when she said that what we would be doing is saying, `This is our current system, and how wonderful it is.' The second part will not form part of the public education program. That will be argued in the yes and no debate.

I think Australians want to be reminded as to the system of government that we currently have.

 will have to be debated in the houses of parliament, and it will be the subject of scrutiny via a parliamentary committee. So we will have the current system, the proposed model and the procedure by which the referendum will be conducted.

It will be an unbiased campaign. Senator Bolkus said that it is aimed at shoring up support for the current system by making people better understand the current system. God forbid that we would ever have the people of Australia better understanding the current system! I would have thought it highly desirable that the people of Australia understand fully their own system. I think, quite frankly, it is a highly desirable goal, and it is one which the government aspires to.</para></talk.start><para>If you believe the system should be changed, then obviously you believe there are flaws in the current system and, if there are those flaws, no doubt they will be self-evident in that public education campaign and people will pick it up. This campaign is not designed one way or another to promote a yes or no position. It is simply putting the Australian people in the picture, and that is a fair enough proposal.</para><para>In relation to the timetable, you have heard mention made that we are looking for feedback on the draft bills by the end of April. We would be looking to introduce the legislation in May and with the introduction of the legislation there would be a low-level aspect of the public education campaign. That would grow, and in September I would imagine it would be at its peak. During the passage of the bills from the other place to the Senate, no doubt there will be committee scrutiny. A reference to a joint parliamentary committee is one that has been anticipated so that both houses are involved. The bills would then be back in the Senate in August for debate. We would then look to the normal process of the AEC fulfilling its requirements of sending out yes and no cases in the interim period between then and the referendum.</para><para>At that stage we would be looking at September-October for the more robust part of the campaign—where the yes and no cases 
 most probably would be in full flight with their respective campaigns. Finally, the voters of Australia would receive the yes and no case from the AEC before they vote in November. That is a rough timetable, as best we can describe it, but it will require cooperation from people. I ask you to bear that in mind, because we aim to have this referendum in November—some eight months away—and those procedures have to be gone through before we arrive at the referendum.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>3419</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am sure you did not misunderstand me earlier on, and I think it is important that Australians understand their Constitution.

If you were to have a flurry of education, activity, advertising and the like now, and then it dropped off, you might well find that that disadvantages people.

 a peak of information much closer to the referendum, because I think it is fair to say that people will turn their minds more to the referendum when the time arrives.</para><para>I can assure you that the majority of Australians—men and women in their daily lives out there—are not thinking constantly about the republic at the moment.

I am not saying that people will not be looking at it now, but I am saying that if you were to run a campaign with education information now, you could well miss the boat because you would miss those people who will only turn their minds to the referendum and what it all means much closer to the event.

The word `campaign' has no sinister connotation about it. It is a campaign to inform and educate. I have mentioned that it will be neutral, and it will be.</para><para>The question of the sorts of advertising that are employed, be it electronic or print, is another aspect of the information campaign. The wording has not yet been settled. Our advisory panel, which is yet to be set up, will advise the task force to ensure that we do get it right. Really, to say what form it will take in detail in the future would be presumptuous of me indeed because we will be seeking the advice of this panel, so I cannot give you the detail of it. If I did that, it would be outrageous. You do not have a dog and bark yourself. The fact is that we will have an advisory panel and we will take advice from it in relation to format, wording and substance. So I cannot give you that detail at this point in time but, as soon as we are able, it will be made public.</para><para>I reject comprehensively the question of this being an attempt to fiddle the books. It is an open, transparent process. It is one which involves informing people, as only we should do, in the lead-up to a referendum—a very important one. When it comes to the yes and the no cases, we have funded them equally. There are some people who might say that including an explanation of the proposed model is perhaps giving an advantage to the republicans. That is something which could be argued. So your argument that this is a one- 
sided attempt to promote the current system falls to the ground because we will also be telling people what the proposed model entails—the better the understanding, the better the situation. I think everyone agrees, Senator Bolkus, that increased understanding in this situation can only benefit the country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>3420</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, can you tell us who is on the task force?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>3420</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I mentioned earlier that the Attorney-General is on the task force; he is the chair of it.

At the outset, let me make it clear that this polling is in no way designed to achieve any result insofar as the referendum on the republic goes. It is not designed to achieve a majority constitution or otherwise. It is looking at what people know about the current system. `Do you know what the constitution is? Do you know what the Senate is?

It may well be helpful, of course, to the yes and the no cases, as to where certain understandings lie or do not lie. But that is up to them.

I brought up my previous question because Newspoll usually does not recognise Tasmania. It prints results for states right across the country but not for Tasmania.

There may be a problem there: if the polling is done on a population basis, Tasmania, with a smaller populace, will have fewer people being interviewed and therefore the results may not be quite as reliable. But the intent of this poll is obviously a good one. I can tell you that Tasmanians will be interested to see what the results are. I would predict at the outset that Tasmanians are going to come out tops in this poll because, with its different electoral system, people down there are very literate on political and constitutional matters; but let us see.</para><para>I want to come back to the question of the request by the Constitutional Convention that, in the event of a republic being established 
 consequent upon these elections, there be another Constitutional Convention to look at other matters—including the rights and responsibilities of Australians, the environment, indigenous peoples' recognition, and so on—in the Constitution itself. I would remind the committee that the request to the convention that another convention follow the establishment of a republic was essential to that convention coming to an agreement at all.

This parliament will come to an end some time, no doubt, in 2001—maybe 2002, and for us to be making decisions now as to what future parliaments should be doing is unwise.

The government was very heavily represented through its nominees at the Constitutional Convention, and we all 
 know that an enormous amount of goodwill and good faith was required, particularly in the final days of that convention, to get the result that we are now dealing with in this Senate. What the minister is indicating is that the Prime Minister made no commitment as to what the convention would come up with—and I can understand that. But inherent in the very tough negotiations within that convention was the belief that government representatives there would bring back the strength of feeling that was required and the commitment made by people who otherwise would not have allowed the outcome to be the way it was that there would be another convention down the line.</para></talk.start><para>If I can refresh the Senate's mind on this, there was a very strong feeling at the Constitutional Convention that it ought to go much further than just changing the section of the Constitution which would bring in a president. There was a feeling that there should be major changes to the Constitution to bring it into line with constitutions enjoyed by other countries and to bring it into line with the thinking of Australia at the end of the 20th century. At the end, there was only a resolution of this matter by those people who wanted far greater changes to the Constitution by a commitment from those who did not want those changes that this would be recommended as being dealt with by a consequent Constitutional Convention.</para><para>I do not think the matter is resolved by the Prime Minister saying he is not interested in it or he is not in favour of it. He placed a great deal of power, trust, deliberation and responsibility on that convention. These things are two-way. It is incumbent upon the Prime Minister to show good faith with the outcome of that convention and to understand that outcomes from Constitutional Conventions are rarely easy and that the points of view expressed by a convention should be taken seriously. Is the Prime Minister taking those things seriously? If the Prime Minister is making the decision here and not the government, that in itself is a remarkable factor, because the Prime Minister is not the fount of all wisdom when it comes to things constitutional for this country.</para><para>Here we have a clear request from a Constitutional Convention made up of people right across the country but with a large number of them appointed by the government—that is, the Prime Minister. The inference I get from what the minister says is that the Prime Minister does not give a damn about that. That is not good enough. The convention made a very specific request that there be another convention post-referendum. That was an essential part of the outcome. You cannot divorce the other outcomes from that. The Prime Minister cannot be selective about this—at least he cannot be selective without him and the government giving good reasoning back to those people who worked so hard in the convention and had, I think, enormous public participation in their representation at that convention,</para><para>This is not a minor matter. It is hugely important. It is going to even shape the way in which some participants of that convention who are opinion makers take a role in trying to get this nation to a consensus by referendum time—at least trying to get a referendum outcome that is dinkum. It is not good enough for the Prime Minister to say, `Oh well, I've got the components I want. The decision by that  convention to seek another convention after these referendums can go hang.' I would like to hear from the minister that that is not the situation—that the government is serious about taking all the recommendations of the convention. If it has dropped the one about there being another convention to look at further changes to the Constitution, then it ought to provide this Senate, the people who were at that convention and the people of Australia with a good explanation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>3428</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thought it would be appropriate to remind the minister of those members of the government who voted for the motion at the Constitutional Convention to which Senator Margetts and Senator Brown have referred.

That is very sad. I ask that the minister asks his colleagues, specifically his colleagues in this place, and certainly any of those frontbench members to whom I referred, to outline their change of opinion.</para><para>Given that on a number of other areas to do with the bills to alter the Constitution it is mooted that they will be free votes, I wonder why that vote was not a free vote for members in this place.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Margetts interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Indeed, I accept that interjection, and maybe that is why we did not go to a division.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Crowley)</name></talker><para>—Senator Stott Despoja, the rest of us did not hear that interjection.

I think it is pretty outrageous that those people have just completely contradicted a position that they held previously. No wonder people are cynical about politicians. At a minimum, I would expect those ministers to explain their position and put on the record their change of heart. I certainly suggest that the minister draw the questioning in this place to the attention of those honourable members in both houses, because the least that we deserve is an explanation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>3429</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is still opportunity for the government to show that the issues of a republic and a constitution involve a conscience vote.

The previous amendment to the motion that the bill be read a second time did not pre-empt any decision; nor does this amendment. It said `if' something happened. This amendment simply says, `If the referendum proposal for a republic in the form agreed to is not successful.' There are a number of reasons why a particular model for a republic might not gain acceptance by the majority of Australians in the majority of states. The reasons could be that the proposal has been shoddily put together, that at this stage it has not been properly explained, that people are taking particular exception to the choice of president, that some people believe that a proper process should have taken place in the first place and that Australia deserves better.</para><para>Regarding the range of reasons that people might not jump at the very first model that is thrown at them, like a pile of crumbs—I am not talking about the people: I am talking about the model—it might be that Australians are cautious at the first vote. Some people will say, `This is the only chance that you'll get.' That is a total nonsense, because we know it is likely that if we sit on our hands and do nothing for the next 10 years we will be a republic without a head of state. In reality, there could be no head of state because Britain may have changed before us. It is a nonsense to suggest that, if we do not do anything at this stage or in the foreseeable future, we will never become a republic. It is more reasonable to suggest that some people in Australia might choose carefully about whatever model they so desire and may express an opinion in this current referenda which says, in effect, `not this model'.</para><para>However, I believe those people have a right to indicate in the not too distant future whether what they are saying is `not this model yet' or `republic but'. If what they are saying is `a republic but not this one', I believe they should have a chance to make that opinion known. I would think there would be some people within the coalition ranks who would be rather concerned if it were a matter of this or nothing being proposed. They may well think that a republic in general is something Australia should be moving towards and that it is unrealistic to suggest that the very first proposal that is thrown to the Australian community should be jumped on no matter what.</para><para>I believe that all senators should be able to consider this matter on its merits. If that does not happen, I would have to wonder why. I would like to think that people from the Labor Party would have a chance to vote on this issue on its merits. It is one of those cases where, if I understand it correctly, there is no specific policy. I stand to be corrected on that. When it is not one of those areas where there is a specific firm policy, I believe it is fair and right for all senators in this place to be able to represent the views of their conscience.</para><para>Obviously the Greens (WA) believe in a consultative approach. We believe, in general, that a republic just for a republic's sake may not be good enough. However, there are people in the Greens (WA) who would disagree with me. Some think that you should go for a republic first and then the rest might come later. There is a degree of opinion in the Greens (WA). I feel sure that there are a range of opinions on this issue within the coalition and the Labor Party.</para><para>I feel that this is one of those issues where there should and must be a free vote—if what is being said is that free votes are acceptable in relation to a republic plebiscite or referenda. This is about whether or not being able to say, `Yes, I would like to move towards a republic' can happen by the next election. This is not deciding for another government. This is deciding, in this government, whether or not senators believe that at some stage—if the referenda are defeated—there will be a 
 firm commitment for another chance to make an opinion about the core issue of whether or not we move towards a republic and then talk about the details later.</para><para>I feel strongly about this issue. I am concerned about any indications that the Labor Party finds this too difficult or that somehow or other, by putting this in, we are going to give people another choice—so we will not force more people to vote for what I believe is a poorly thought out model. I would be very concerned if this is the view and process of democracy that the ALP considers right and legitimate. However, I am sure that the ALP will consider giving this a free vote because of the issues involved. I look forward to them supporting this perfectly reasonable proposal.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>3431</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support Senator Margetts's amendment. You will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, with unsullied clarity that last year when this matter was before the Senate I moved early on that the first thing that should happen in the process towards a republic was to ask the Australian people whether they wanted it, and then we should move to devise a form of a republic that would serve Australians best after that opinion had been given. I was totally unsuccessful in that. If the unthinkable happens from the republican  majority's point of view and the referendum fails at the end of this year—and there are lots of reasons now why that could happen; I hear tonight people on the republican side of the fence saying that the Prime Minister's preamble would be enough to sink the chances of the republic and some of the most trenchant critics are from the Prime Minister's side of politics—and the whole thing turns out to be a shemozzle because we do not have a Prime Minister who can see good process, let alone good outcomes in this hugely important and historic matter for the nation, then we will have to start again.</para></talk.start><para>As Senator Margetts says, it is ineluctable logic that we are going to get a republic. Anybody who thinks otherwise only has to look to the potential for Britain itself to dispense with the monarchy and for us to be left with a crazy situation of having a head of 
 state who may not even be a monarch in the future United Kingdom. We can speculate about that. What we must not put into the realms of speculation is the right of Australians to determine this nation's inevitable move to becoming a republic. If this process is so flawed that the yes vote does not get up at the end of this year, we will have to start again. Nobody is going to turn the tide of history. Nobody is going to throw out the opinion of the majority of Australians that we need a republic. It is simply going to become stronger. It is ineluctable.</para><para>Senator Margetts is saying: if the referendum outcome is negative, let us here clear the path for a proper process next time around. The first thing you do is ask people whether or not they want a republic and, having established that, you move to what sort of republic. This is saying, `Let's get it right next time around if things fall down this time.' I support the motion. It is good sense. The idea that this is a once only occasion is so absurd. The only reason I think people could argue—and I have not heard it yet, but we may hear it soon—against this amendment of Senator Margetts's is if they thought there was some better option. I know people will get up and say in the wake of the referendum, `Let's leave it at that. We'll devise where to go to next.' Senator Margetts is astute enough to say, `No, let's have a clear and sensible alternative in place if that eventuality is realised.' I support her amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>3431</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Democrats, I support the amendment moved by Senator Margetts. I believe a backup plan is appropriate. Certainly Senator Margetts is correct in claiming that there is a diverse range of opinions on this issue across the chamber and in different chambers in this parliament, and indeed in our respective political parties. The Democrats all have different views on this model and on other models but we share an underlying support for the republic and for moving toward an Australian head of state. We share an underlying concern at the diminished role for the Senate under this proposed model.</para></talk.start><para>Some of us are concerned about the complete absence of a role of the Senate in the dismissal process. Some of us are concerned about the notion that the Prime Minister can effectively dismiss the head of state, and I acknowledge that that is subject to ratification by the House of Representatives, I think within a 30-day period. Nevertheless, we suggest that perhaps there is an issue of natural justice that might not be afforded appropriately to that particular person, he or she. So there are flaws.</para><para>Again, I put on record my support for the referendum this time around and the move to a republic as soon as possible. I am also very much in support of a Constitutional Convention along the lines that we supported earlier, as mooted at the Constitutional Convention in February last year—a second ConCon was supported by a whole host of distinguished and honourable members from the government including the Attorney-General, Senator Newman, Senator Hill, Chris Gallus, Treasurer Costello and Mr Kevin Andrews.</para><para>I think a very important part of this whole process as we approach the referendum campaign is to acknowledge—as I said in my remarks earlier—that it is more important the second time around to iron out any flaws that we may perceive in the model. That is not to say that with its perceived flaws, whether you assess them as minor or major, we should not seek to make this change this time around. I am certainly a strong supporter of that position but, if for any reason the republic is not achieved at the referendum in November, then I would certainly want a backup plan of sorts. I would like the opportunity for the Australian public to be asked again—perhaps asked generally—whether they support a republic, and certainly have an opportunity to devise a model of their own making which they feel confident with and support.</para><para>I suspect that finding a model that is perfect to all Australians will be hard and that at times it may annoy some of us. But change is evolutionary; change does happen slowly. I see the first part of this fundamental change taking place in November with this particular model and, for that reason, I personally support it.</para><para>But, as I say, I look forward to having a backup plan just in case. Although I strongly support a referendum being successful this time round, we are taking no chances, given how rarely we have referenda in this country and how rarely they are successful. I also look forward to a free vote on this issue in the chamber, given the minister's earlier comments in relation to the rationale for a free vote on other issues—in particular the preamble.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>3432</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government's position on this amendment is quite clear: this is a similar situation to the previous amendment moved by the Greens, which was a contingent motion; that is, if we became a republic then there would be this convention. This amendment proposes that if a republic fails at this referendum then we have a plebiscite.</para></talk.start><para>It really does not make common sense to start deciding things before we know the outcome of the referendum, because who knows what will come out during the debate or the issues that will emanate from that debate and arise during that time leading up to the referendum. It may well be that something else  crops up which we have not foreseen here today. I think this crystal ball gazing into the future is just that. It is too hypothetical to make any decision on at the moment. It is too hypothetical to bind any government. It would make much more sense to say, `Let's wait and see what happens when the people of Australia make their minds up at the referendum.'</para><para>A plebiscite is not something which came out of the Constitutional Convention. It would go over ground which we will have gone over extensively this year as a nation. I have mentioned that the cost involved, if there were to be an appropriate mail-out, would be some $8 million to $9 million. That would be in addition to the moneys we are spending on the referendum this year. But, quite apart from that, there is the question of the value of a plebiscite. It would have no binding value. It would simply be saying, `There is a majority of people who might or might not want a 
 republic.' But it would not answer the question as to the sort of republic they want.</para><para>I must take issue with the previous comments in relation to the Constitutional Convention. The Prime Minister is not saying in any way that he does not care what the Constitutional Convention recommended or is disregarding it. The Constitutional Convention said, `If there was to be a republic then we look at a further Constitutional Convention.' Again, that was a big `if'. It was a contingent recommendation. All the other recommendations are being implemented by this government and are being pursued as we undertook to do so. We never undertook to pursue the question of a further convention.</para><para>It is unfair to attack those members of the government who were part of the Constitutional Convention and who voted for a convention to be held if we became a republic. I think it is pertinent that we wait and see what the outcome is and then we make up our minds on whether we have a future convention, whether we have plebiscites or whatever. But, at this stage, the government is opposed to this amendment and thinks it is unwise to plot any course of action in the future without knowing the result of the referendum. For those reasons, the government is opposing this amendment moved by the Greens (WA).</para><para>Can I also add that this is not a vote which the government sees as being appropriate for a free vote. It is one which goes to procedure, not to the issue or substance at hand. The government has said we can have a free vote on whether or not Australia becomes a republic and on whether or not that preamble is part of the Constitution. The government has said it is government policy to have a referendum. It is a governmental decision that we do not have a plebiscite and that we do not support this amendment moved by the Greens (WA). It is a procedural question, not one which goes to substance or conscience. Therefore, there will not be a free vote on it.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Margetts's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>19:54:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

It will pave the way for the introduction of an accrual accounting system in the government. As I do not wish to delay the passage of this bill, I will be brief. I thank the government for briefing my office, and I understand the bill has five key proposals.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, it is proposed that the current fund accounting arrangements be abolished and replaced with accrual accounting arrangements for government agencies. The proposed accrual accounting system will recognise the financial effects of transactions and events, not just the financial flow of cash. The opposition agrees that accrual accounting, as well as related changes to procedures in the management of public accounts, would help in reducing administrative and system costs. The proposed accrual accounting  system will also provide agencies with greater independence in managing their funds.</para><para>Secondly, special accounts are intended to be established within the Consolidated Revenue Fund, with the replacement of the Reserved Money Fund and Commercial Activities Fund. This would remove unnecessary transactions between accounts.</para><para>Thirdly, the Treasurer will be given the power to invest public moneys. I am aware that this is effectively an extension of the Treasurer's current powers available to him under the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve Act 1955. Fourthly, it is proposed that the Minister for Finance and Administration will have to prepare monthly financial statements and that the statements must be in the form that is consistent with the budget estimates for the financial year. Fifthly, it is proposed that in the course of the transition—that is, for the period 1999-2000—the finance minister need only prepare quarterly statements as opposed to the required monthly schedule. This proposal is reasonable on the grounds that agencies may not have fully adapted their systems to the new regime in the immediate short term.</para><para>The opposition supports the change to the accrual accounting standard as it would introduce a level of transparency in identify 
 ing outcomes and the true costs of delivering outputs. On the impact of accrual accounting on budget proceedings for 1999-2000, I am so far encouraged that the government has been prepared to discuss issues to ensure the readability of upcoming budget papers and accounts. In particular, the government has indicated that it would endeavour to provide a basis on which previous budget papers could be compared with the 1999-2000 version. Other issues are being sorted out between the opposition and the government on the budget process. I encourage the government to continue its helpful approach.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3434</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats support the <inline ref="r726">Financial Management Legislation Amendment Bill 1999</inline> .</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3434</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to talk about the <inline ref="r726">Financial Management Legislation Amendment Bill 1999</inline> . This is a very important issue because it changes how we will be reading and hearing about the way governments organise their budgets. Just a few days ago, the government held a seminar about how this might work in a budget context. Quite a few MPs were there, mostly from the non-government side—Labor and Greens parliamentarians and their staffers. It does seem that there are quite a lot of questions that are still to be asked and answered, and there are still a lot of unknowns.</para></talk.start><para>One concern that I have is that, while it has the potential for greater accountability, it also has the potential to be a little reductionist—although it depends how it is organised, and it depends how it is reported. The potential for good or bad is what worries us at the moment. This bill attempts to bring the legislative framework provided by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 into line with the accrual financial framework that will begin on 1 July 1999.</para><para>The move to an integrated accrual budgeting resource management and financial reporting framework was recommended by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its reports Nos 338 and 341 of November 1995 and by the National Commission of Audit in its report of June 1996. The primary change 
 made by the bill is to repeal the provisions dealing with fund accounting while retaining the essential features of the funds and the ability to hypothecate money for specified purposes through provisions to establish special accounts within the consolidated revenue fund—the CRF.</para><para>The Greens have a number of concerns about this bill. Some of these are specifically to do with the provisions of the bill itself, some arise in the context of accrual accounting as a framework, and some arise from the broader issues of the kinds of indicators we are looking at to determine public policy in this country.</para><para>Let us look at the reporting requirements. The Greens have concerns about the less rigorous reporting requirements in this bill. The reduction in reporting requirements allows the minister to publicise the Commonwealth financial transactions every quarter rather than every month. We acknowledge that this arrangement can last for only 12 months at the most. However, this issue is important for transparency. Not only is it important for transparency, but it is also important when we struggle—and every year we struggle—to work out what has happened between one year and another. It is especially so at this time of change and we really need more, not less, transparency while we are trying to track massive changes in accounting systems, although the government acknowledges this will be difficult to track. We understand that the government acknowledges there will be difficulties, but we do believe that it is possible.</para><para>We have been given assurances that this is a backup provision only—a contingency plan. We are advised by the department and by the office of the parliamentary secretary, Mr Slipper, that it is the intention for the minister to report under section 54 of the Financial Management Act on a monthly basis unless it is impossible in a practical sense to do so. We are advised that Senator Ellison will clarify this intention, and we will be seeking such a clarification on the record during the committee stage of the bill or perhaps during the final second reading contribution.</para><para>In addition, the Greens are concerned that departments may be left underfunded during this changeover period to accrual accounting. While the government recognise that there may be troubles with gathering data for reporting, they are not acknowledging the possibility of extra start-up costs for departments. It seems that there is little doubt the start-up costs will be an issue. It may require more staff—certainly, updated software—and other system changes. Advice we were given at the seminar indicates that a lot of the information that is normally available during Senate reports will be available again. This would indicate that probably there is going to be more information provided in the reports, and surely this may mean more people involved. It certainly may mean more work for those people interpreting that data.</para><para>The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, report No. 338 <inline font-style="italic">Accrual accounting: a cultural change</inline>, August 1995, pages 48 to 51 and the National Commission of Audit Report to the Commonwealth government of June 1996, especially pages 229 to 232, are relevant, especially this sentence:</para><para>The initial cost of the move to full accrual accounting should not be underestimated, particularly the differential impact of the changes on smaller departments and agencies.</para><para>The government appears to have rejected the JCPA's August 1995 recommendation that supplementary funding be provided to agencies to help them redevelop their financial management systems to facilitate the move to full accrual accounting.</para><para>Mr Slipper's office has assured us there will be a review of all departments and specifically their funding arrangements. Consequently, the Greens seek clarification that the departments' resources and their abilities to deal with the accrual accounting framework will be a highly relevant consideration during the review of the financial position of departments as part of the budget process this year. We would hate to think that they would be required to find those resources somehow by other means.</para><para>I move now to issues relating to the more general concerns with the accrual accounting framework. From our point of view, there are 
 unknown ramifications. In general, the change to the accrual accounting system will have a number of positives for transparency in management of the Public Service. The system will provide a more comprehensive basis for making managerial decisions as it gives a more accurate outline of all the resources used by the department. It changes the management focus from one primarily on cash flows and fund balances to one that focuses on all resource flows and assets and liabilities.</para><para>There certainly was a case to be made that the Public Service was much too process oriented and too little outcome oriented. However, honourable senators will realise that in Senate estimates when people asked about outcomes there were a whole range of outcomes that were sought. I am not sure whether or not this range of outcomes that the community believes are important has been gathered. We will get to that later.</para><para>What is the cost of this move? It is fair to say that many of the holes and the problems in the accrual accounting framework have not yet been realised. It is likely that the full ramifications of the proposed changes are not yet fully comprehended by those who will be affected by them. They may well be much worse than expected. The Greens have a number of concerns already. Anecdotal reports suggest that the implementation timetable may be somewhat ambitious for many of the departments. Indeed, this is suggested by the Department of Finance and Administration themselves, as they are concerned that it will be difficult to meet the usual monthly reporting requirements.</para><para>I will also be keeping a watching brief to see that the focus on outcomes does not swamp important procedural issues, such as consultation in actually devising outcomes and outputs and consultation in pursuing programs and initiatives. You may recall that one of the first processes, got together by COAG to work out benchmarks, was on schools. I have mentioned this before in this chamber. A whole bunch of Treasury officials got together to decide on what were good outcomes and benchmarks in schools. The only thing they forgot was that perhaps this 
 was not the best way. They were not actually the right, qualified people to work out what were good school education benchmarks.</para><para>On that particular occasion, a group of concerned parents contacted the Greens (WA). It seems that they provided information to the wider community. They were allowed—it was not advertised—to make submissions to this process. We do not really know exactly what happened in this process. What we do know is that the process did not continue in the same manner as was proposed in the beginning. Here we are with a huge leap of faith that somehow or other outcomes can be devised out of thin air without so much as a process—any visible process—by which opinions are sought as to what are good outcomes in a whole range of programs.</para><para>The Greens have general concerns with the whole thrust of so-called reform that accrual accounting is based on. `Reform' as a word means a change for the better. The then Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquired into this issue. They said that one of the underlying reasons for the Financial Management Improvement Program (FMIP) was to:</para><para>. . . encourage contestability or market competition to influence the way in which goods and services are provided—</para><para>and later—</para><para>Accrual accounting can be characterised as being one element of the various commercial reforms which have been introduced into the Australian Public Service.</para><para>The Greens have major concerns with the immense business focus. While it provides some benefits, it can drastically cut public interest corners. When you are looking at a situation where, in effect, you are treating every department and program as if it has to stand on its own feet, as if it is a business system, then basically what you are doing is putting to those departments that they are going to have to raise revenue or sell assets, or basically come to their own account's defence.</para><para>I do not think that is necessarily the way to run a federal government. It might be. I am not even sure it is the way to run a business—that every part of the business has to stand on its own feet. There are very good 
 reasons why businesses support or even subsidise one element of their business. It could be public relations. Who said that public relations had to necessarily, or at least initially, bear its own fruit? However, there are very good reasons why some elements of a business should be supported at one stage and not at others. The very reason that government activities are supported is that there is an understanding by the wider community that governments are expected to do those things which the private sector generally will not, or will not do particularly well. It is inappropriate to consider that each of those programs has to run as if it is a business. Here we have a giant leap of change on the assumption that this is what everybody wants. I am not sure that that is the case with the Australian community.</para><para>The Greens do have major concerns with this immense business focus. While it provides some benefits, as I say, it can cut public interest corners. The national competition policy is linked to this issue. Basically what we are seeing is that our accounts systems in relation to budgets are going to link into the 1995 national competition policy. Honourable senators would realise that, for the first time since 1995, we are actually looking into the national competition policy to see what the impacts are. I find it extraordinary that we are actually now leaping into putting accrual accounting to match this national competition policy before we know what the impacts of the national competition policy are. We are looking here at the short term and at price over some broad public interest concerns. Any time you say that, someone will say, `Oh, you can always put the other issues into contracts.' The reality is we have not trained people to put those kinds of things into contracts. We cannot pre-think of all of those issues which are not within the price mechanisms and are not within the market mechanisms. The kind of glib responses you usually get, when you are talking about issues other than simply price and bottom line, do not make many people feel terribly relaxed and at ease.</para><para>It is necessary to realise that government departments and government business enter 
 prises are more than businesses—much more. They exist to administer government policy and government policy has, at its heart, public interest. If it has not, one would wonder why. It is not about highest profit and lowest cost. So it is not always appropriate to try to overlay business considerations on government departments. The goals of profit maximisation are rarely appropriate in the public realm. This should always be at the forefront of our minds.</para><para>There are broader issues. An accrual accounting system will generally always seek to measure the full costs of a particular transaction, task or process. It does so by using benchmarks or standards. Despite the concern expressed, the Greens believe this is a step in the right direction in some areas. Measurement of the full costs of any given transaction, program or decision is extremely useful from a managerial and transparency perspective.</para><para>What are the full costs? I would argue—as would many people in the community—that, for instance, when the government claim that their ANTS package has benefits for the community, you cannot know that unless you have looked at things like the environmental costs, the social costs and the health costs of such major policy decisions. The government will generally say, `Sorry, that is about the environment not about the main issue, which is dollars.' That shows a flawed understanding of what full costs and benefits should be about.</para><para>The Greens would like to see this principle of accrual accounting extended further to include, as many other countries have done, environmental accounting systems. We would like to see these kinds of accounts integrated into the national accounts and the budgetary process so that the value of our natural resources is as transparent as the value of the capital stocks in the Defence Force. I hasten to add that that is not necessarily particularly transparent.</para><para>The economy and the natural environment interact at many points, and these interactions raise analytical questions. The nation's wealth includes natural resources, such as oil and gas reserves and timber, that are used in produc 
 tion. At what rate are these resources being used? What does it mean if you get a certain amount of so-called profit but you have run down your resources?</para><para>The income of producers in the mineral industries includes a return to the drilling rigs, mining equipment, and other structures and equipment engaged in production, as well as a return to the mineral. What share is attributable to the mineral? Economic activity adds to the proved stock of natural resources by exploration and technological innovation. How much of the use of natural resources in production has been offset by these additions?</para><para>Households, governments and businesses all make expenditures to maintain or restore the environment. What share of their spending is for the environment? The economy disposes of wastes into the air and water, and the resulting degradation of the environment imposes costs, such as lower timber yields and fish harvests, higher cleaning costs and maybe even costs to human lives. What are these costs? Which sectors bear them?</para><para>The answers to questions such as these about the interaction of the economy and the environment are often based on partial and sometimes even inconsistent information, suggesting the need to identify and quantify the interactions within a systematic framework as a basis for more informed analysis and decision making. The United Kingdom, Canada, many Scandinavian countries and the United States have already implemented these systems in a sophisticated manner. We should be following the lead, and substantial groundwork should be done in these countries.</para><para>We have already gone some way to providing the basis for getting environmental accounts up and running. In 1995 the ALP government of the time allocated $3.5 million to enable the Australian Bureau of Statistics to develop environmental and resource statistics linked to the national accounts. As noted in the press release associated with the announcement:</para><para>This move was to allow for the development of an integrated framework which links the measurement of economic activity to changes in the environment and the country's resource base . . . It also extends to assessments of possible policy issues such as 
 regulations, charges and incentives impacting on the environment.</para><para>The ABS has already issued some extremely useful publications that attempt to put forward both qualitative and quantitative assessments of Australia's natural assets. In particular, in June 1996 <inline font-style="italic">Australians and the Environment</inline>  was released. Also, the ABS has released three documents related to satellite accounts: the energy account, the minerals account and the fish account. The water account is due out later this year. The forest account and the wastes account are being prepared.</para><para>The 1996 <inline font-style="italic">Saving our Natural Heritage</inline> coalition policy document indicated that the development of green accounts would have priority in the ABS forward work program. So where are they? In addition, I note with interest that on 9 September 1996 the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, responded to a question on notice about the green accounting process by saying that a progress review of achievements was scheduled for the latter part of the 1998-99 financial year. I will be waiting with bated breath for that report.</para><para>The ABS has already gone a long way down the track to providing a basis for the ability to engage actively and rigorously in environmental accounting. What is needed now is commitment to using in a positive and integrated manner the excellent information provided by the ABS. The government has already made the right noises. The government now needs the political will to look beyond the narrow budget and national account indicators and to see things holistically. The Greens will be supporting the passage of this bill but will seek clarification during the committee stage with regard to the issues raised previously in my speech.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>3438</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Hopefully I can allay some of the concerns of the Greens in this reply. In relation to the reporting requirements, the publishing of the report once a month will occur in that transitional period only if it is possible. If it is not possible, then it will be quarterly. It is only for that transitional period of 12 months that there is the possibility of quarterly reporting. 
 Thereafter it will be fixed on a monthly basis. That really takes care of the question asked by the Greens in relation to reporting. The only possibility of the quarterly reporting is during that 12-month transitional period.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to underresourcing, I can tell the Senate that the government will ensure that departments are adequately resourced to ensure the efficient delivery of programs under the accrual management resource framework. That is a commitment by the government. It is the government's view that the funding question here is not an issue. It will not be an impediment to implementation.</para><para>In relation to the question of environmental aspects, questions of natural resources being included in accrual accounting, it is true that the ABS has come a long way in relation to this. The matter was first raised in 1995, as Senator Margetts pointed out. The World Bank at that time had also looked at this very question. I can undertake to Senator Margetts to take this up with the Minister for Finance and Administration. At this stage I do not think we are in a position to commit either way in relation to what we can do with that now, but I will certainly take it up with the Minister for Finance and Administration. I thank members of the minor parties and the opposition for their support, and I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>3439</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>3439</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to ask the minister some questions on this issue. The answer in relation to the monthly accounting, I guess, was phrased in a slightly different way from the way it could have been. The minister says it will be provided monthly only if it is possible; if not, it is quarterly. I am afraid that is not quite the emphasis that I would like to hear. I would like to hear that it will be produced on a monthly basis and only if it is not possible will it be quarterly. I know it is pedantic but the reality is that, if you start off with `will do it only if', that is actually giving the wrong signal to the department. So I 
 would like some assurance that the emphasis from the government is actually on the other foot, that they are assuming that people will come up with monthly accounts and report it monthly and that only if there is a good case put up for the impossibility of that will it be done in the quarterly accounts.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to ask a few questions also in relation to environmental accounting. The minister has said he will take this up with the Minister for Finance and Administration. However, I would like him to take it on board and perhaps respond if he can. What we have indicated is that there is a stated commitment that this is government policy in general. We have clear indications, both from the previous government and the current government during the time of the previous government and the current government, that the resources and the information exist for environmental indicators, and I add social indicators, to be part of the process so that we actually know whether we are taking a step forward in our total economic framework or whether we are taking a step back. That would indicate whether there are social, environmental and other costs that sometimes might be more important than some of the economic benefits.</para><para>So I would like to know that there is some commitment that the resources that exist will be used and that that information will at some stage be used. If not, I guess we will have to see from the government a different policy. So I do not think it is a matter of `we will take this up with the minister'. I understand that Senator Ellison cannot answer on the spot, but surely this is either a government policy or not, whether there are some moves to further integrate or take up this information or whether unfortunately this good information is going to sit there in the ether in the odd report and will not actually become a part of any of the accrual accounting process that we are moving to. I am not just talking about the environment budget statements; I am talking about budget statements on defence, social welfare, sport or recreation. I am talking about budget statements in any program or area where the Commonwealth may be involved. Somehow or other there needs to be an understanding that the other costs, 
 whether they are social, environmental or even health costs, can be at some stage integrated, that there are indicators that eventually will tell us whether in fact we are moving forward. If we are not, this will give us an indication of what we need to do to change the way we act so that we are looking at the full costs, so that we are not perhaps transferring costs from the private sector  to the public sector on the assumption that there are going to be overall benefits.</para><para>I come to this debate, I have to say, with a number of years behind me of trying to work with communities to try to talk to local, state and federal governments about these issues. I know how important they are to the wider community. They can understand and they have a sense of what the issues are for their community. Often local communities need assistance in getting that information together. But they cannot understand why governments are not prepared to see that there are some things other than dollars and that their concerns about social or environmental costs ought to be part of that consideration of whether a project or a program is good, or whether it needs to be altered or strengthened. These are things that are very important to a wide number of people, and I guess I need a firmer statement on that.</para><para>I would also like to hear from the government—this may well be on notice as well—the government's position on whether they are prepared to support a reference on environmental accounting, and I would have to add social and environmental accounting, to the Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. I would like to see that at some stage the government are prepared to support this. Obviously I need to talk to the Labor Party on this as well. But at some stage we need to look at how these types of accounts are integrated into the system and whether there is any indication from the government that at some stage they will support such an inquiry to look at integrating these kinds of accounts.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>3440</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In relation to the first issue, can I say to Senator Margetts that it is the intention that there be 
 monthly reporting unless that is not possible. So the way that you had termed it, Senator Margetts, is the correct way, and I can give you that assurance. What I was stressing was that the only possibility of quarterly reporting is during that 12-month transition period, but the intention is definitely that it be monthly, unless it is not possible.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the building into accounting standards of environmental costs, the government has no policy, although accounting standards are moving in the direction of building environmental costs into the accounts. An example which has been given to me is where you have a mine to which remediation might be required. That is an environmental cost.</para><para>Certainly the ABS has been doing work on this. That started under the prior government and has continued under this government. I can give you an assurance that the government is mindful of this and that I will take it up with the Minister for Finance and Administration. The government has looked at the work done by the ABS. That work by the ABS has continued under this government. It is not work that has been halted in any way. It is something which is evolving; it is certainly not something which can happen overnight. You have to look at the difference between national accounts and departmental accounts. That is another thing which has to be borne in mind.

So I would like to think that there is some commitment that we would move to that in the not too distant future, that basically the commitment is that we would not only allow the ABS to continue collecting this data but would actually see that as positive and that it should be part and parcel and become an automatic way of talking about the way we are progressing in the economy.</para><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>3441</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>) read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3441</page.no><id.no>r697</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE—FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r665</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>3441</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 24 March.</para><para>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</para><para>The bill.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—There is a revised running sheet on this.

That is not to say that that is the limit of remote Australia; clearly there are parts of remote Australia in other states, such as in Queensland and New South Wales.</para><para>We believe that the provision, as it is currently drawn, is drawn too tightly. In the debate that will come on amendments Nos 1 to 4 and Nos 6 to 13, the opposition will be indicating support for those government amendments. We believe that those amendments are essentially technical in nature and are required to make this bill more understandable and able to function more effectively. But, with respect to amendment No. 5, the amendment that I have moved will improve, I believe, the position that the government advances in order to clean up this bill before it goes for royal assent—assuming, of course, its carriage in this chamber.</para><para>My amendment seeks to protect the interests of people, as I have said, who are living in remote areas, people who live in communities such as Aboriginal communities—but not exclusively Aboriginal communities: there are other workers in remote and regional Australia, and workers in the mining industry come to mind. The amendments will ensure that certain fringe benefits paid to compensate employees in remote areas will be not fixed with a financial penalty under this legislation. The two additional benefits to be freed are a benefit in relation to occasional travel to a major population centre in Australia provided to employees and family members resident in a location that is not in, or adjacent to, an eligible urban area and, in subclause (k), a benefit in relation to freight costs for foodstuffs provided to employees resident in a location that is not in, or adjacent to, an eligible urban area. They are the two additional benefits to be freed under this amendment.</para><para>I could speak at some length on this matter, but I want to make these key points as to why the opposition believes this amendment is necessary. People who live in these localities are important Australians and need to be recognised as such. They are Australians who contribute to the overall need to develop and provide points of community within areas that most Australians do not want to go and live in. Their living conditions are not equal to those in urban Australia and, indeed, even in regions of Australia that might be regarded as farming or other areas where there are considerable locations of population. In other 
 words, they have special needs; and to treat those people as if those needs do not apply and as if they are the same as everyone else is to treat them unfairly and unequally.</para><para>The amendment that I have moved addresses in part, I believe, that imbalance. That means to say that occasionally these people need to be able to travel from their remote locations to capital cities, either to provide contact with their family or to provide relief from the hardships of their regional location. It also is the case that, in areas of regional Australia, the cost of food is high and freight costs are one of those input costs that ensure that foodstuff prices are much higher than you will find in capital cities.</para><para>I know that the government may respond that they have a tax package which will reduce some parts of the freight costs but, even so, it will not reduce all of them; and the disparity between remote location prices and the prices of the same goods in the capital cities will remain. And it will remain very high because, in most cases, a monopoly rent is extracted by the carriers of food from city to remote locations. Usually this is not a competitive market: there is only one carrier and the market is charged what it will bear rather than the most competitive price. As a consequence, there is a higher cost of living in these locations than would otherwise be the case, and any change to the tax law under the government's upcoming GST bills will not remove that but will in many cases—according to evidence given to the Senate committee on the GST—exacerbate it.</para><para>But that is not the debate before the chamber. The debate before the chamber is the fringe benefits reporting bill. This is a bill that we support and we see the need for, and it is part of the overall tax package. Taking it separately from the tax package, we support the measures that are made, but only if this amendment is accepted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>3443</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have to apologise for a very croaky voice this evening. I would like to speak to this amendment because, as my colleague Senator Cook said, it really goes not only to fringe benefits reporting but also to being able to recruit and maintain people 
 who work in remote areas. It specifically came to my attention when we had a look at the range of people employed in the Northern Territory Public Service. The kinds of people we are talking about are nurses, Aboriginal health workers, teachers, Aboriginal assistant teachers, police, police aides, and the people who provide the sort of critical infrastructure in those communities that would not be there if it were not for public servants.</para></talk.start><para>These entitlements are not in fact part of a salary package. They are not part of an attempt by these people to opt out of any tax payment or avoid any responsibility they have in the social security system. They have been brought about mainly because they are allowances and conditions of service that are paid to these people as cash in kind. The Northern Territory government pays the fringe benefits tax. I am talking about the amendment to (j) regarding occasional travel.</para><para>In the Northern Territory, places of isolation and remoteness are generally in one of three or four categories. The special category to which this amendment would not apply includes Adelaide River, Batchelor, Jabiru, Pine Creek and Yulara. They currently get only the rental rebate, so there is a provision in this bill to include those people. People living in those areas do not get particular isolated fares and do not get assistance with food, so they may not be covered by this.</para><para>Category 1 in the Northern Territory includes people who live at Elliott, Mataranka, Newcastle Waters, Tennant Creek or Ti Tree. Category 2 includes places which are a little bit more remote, such as Harts Range or Imanpa, Neutral Junction, Wallace Rockhole, Stirling, Milikapiti. Category 3 includes places which are quite remote: Docker River, Milingimbi, Numbulwar, Ngukurr, Ramingining, Wadeye (Port Keats), Willowra, Yuendumu. I have a list here of the way in which those communities have been categorised for reasons of remoteness.</para><para>If you live in category 1, 2 or 3, then you are currently entitled to two sorts of benefits: one is fares out of isolated areas—and we call them FOIL fares. The fares entitle these people and their families who are resident in remote localities to paid travel—either by air, 
 or by motor vehicle at 49c a kilometre—to Alice Springs or Darwin two or three times a year, depending on their location. So the benefit is specifically designed to assist these people to get out of these isolated communities two or three times a year.</para><para>I think people need to understand why this was negotiated and why it holds such a special place in attracting and maintaining these people. It is very hard to work in a place like Docker River if there is no incentive to get out to Alice Springs a couple of times a year. The Northern Territory government used to provide these people with tickets or a way out; they now pay that up as cash.</para><para>The freight on foodstuffs also applies to these people. From 1 October 1996, there was a provision to subsidise these people for freight on foodstuffs—they were reimbursed on production of receipts. There are currently different categories for this. If you have dependants, you are entitled to have 23 kilos of freight of your food paid for. There is an additional 12 kilos for each dependant. There is a further incentive of another eight kilos if you are in particular remote communities.</para><para>So this amendment maintains the benefits for those people in remote communities. These two benefits were always negotiated to attract and recruit but, more importantly, to maintain these people in isolated areas. In closing, I repeat that it is not an attempt on the part of these people to move out of any obligation in relation to social security payments or to diminish their responsibility in payment of tax. It is an amendment to this bill that allows these people to maintain these two benefits, which are well in excess of $1,000 in relation to fringe benefits that are paid to them, without them appearing on their group certificate, because it is a recognition by the government that their expertise is needed to maintain the infrastructure in these communities.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>3444</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government does not see the need for this amendment moved by the opposition, as we think it in some way detracts from the policy objec tive of preventing salary packaging to avoid income threshold limits.

That leaves aside amendments 14 and 15, which I oppose. I support the ones that I have indicated backing for on the basis that essentially, as explained by the minister, they are technical and necessary amendments to make the bill read properly. Amendments 14 and 15 deal with the issuance of group certificates. From my recollection, these are amendments that, if carried, would mean that the rules would be changed and that workers severing their employment with an employer would not, as is currently required, be required to be provided with a group certificate within two weeks of that severance but would be provided with a group certificate at the end of the year—and not all employees would be in that situation.</para></talk.start><para>Before I go on, I do not think a case has been made out for why the current system should be changed. In fact, a case can be made out that this will impose greater red tape on business and inconvenience workers considerably. Where workers are involved in a downsizing or have left or are in companies where there is a high turnover of staff, the normal thing is for those workers, when they go on their way, to receive their group certificate so that they are in a position, at the end of year, to properly report their income. If this clause were to go ahead, they would have to wait until the end of the year to receive their group certificate.</para><para>If there is any large-scale downsizing, that means that it imposes extra burdens on the employer as well as on the workers. As I said, 
 far from simplifying the task for business, this will make the current system more complex. If the amendments succeed, there will be two classes of employees who have different rights to obtain group certificates. Those with fringe benefits will still get their group certificates within two weeks, if they leave work, and those without fringe benefits will have to wait until the end of the year. Differentiating between the two classes just makes life for employers more complicated, and unnecessarily so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>3446</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As there has been a debate on the last two amendments I have moved, why don't we debate the amendments which we might be in blazing agreement on and get those out of the way.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>3446</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate that the Democrats will support items 1 to 4 and 6 to 13.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that government amendments 1 to 4 and 6 to 13 be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—We now move to government amendments 14 and 15.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>3446</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Cook raised a number of issues.

Further, where car fringe benefits are calculated under the statutory formula method, it will be difficult, although not impossible, to calculate an employee's reportable fringe benefits amount for a group certificate at a date earlier than 30 March. This is because the car statutory formula method requires the employer to know the odometer reading of the car at 31 March.</para><para>To avoid these problems and to minimise employer compliance costs, the government 
 proposes that the requirement to issue group certificates early not apply in cases where there is a reportable fringe benefits amount to be shown on the group certificate. Employees who receive fringe benefits with a taxable value of less than $1,000 will not be affected by the measure. It is estimated that there will be very few employees who receive reportable fringe benefits who will need an early group certificate as generally only employees who are departing overseas permanently are entitled to an early assessment of yearly income.</para><para>The case that we are putting to the chamber is one where we are trying to minimise compliance costs.

The Labor Party have raised some real problems and we have to look at this from two perspectives. One is from the employer's perspective, and the difficulties with compliance and systems, and the other is from the employee's perspective. Dealing firstly with the employee, one of the benefits of the present system, as I understand it, is that an employee can get their group certificate relatively quickly after leaving someone's employ. There are categories of employees whose advice of their movements—their own personal household management—is less than wonderful. In other words, they may move and not let the former employer know where they have moved to, so they might have difficulty in receiving these forms by post. In turn, there is the danger that if too large a gap exists between the arrival of the group certificate and the ending of employment, the employer—particularly small businesses—may have gone broke, closed or sold their business. These are practical difficulties.</para></talk.start><para>When I looked at the government's amendment I was somewhat concerned about the use 
 of the words `calendar year'.

I am surprised that we have not used the words `financial year', `the calendar year following the financial year', or something of that sort. That is a plain reading of it, as I see it. Frankly, it makes me nervous about the effect on employers and employees. I would also suggest to the minister that if his own advice is inadequate in this area, because we have many of these tax bills still to come before us we can always revisit this if it can be better worded later.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>3447</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think that some of the arguments that Senator Murray made rather cogently put the case for the amendment we have moved.

The two arguments I would put are that there are so few people affected and it adds an extra degree of difficulty. At the same time, if the minister is hampered in answering questions by the lack of the right adviser, that complicates this debate a little further. Perhaps it would be wise to accept the advice of the Democrats on this.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>3448</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am also having some difficulties with this amendment. I had difficulty understanding the arguments of Senator Cook initially, certainly in terms of the complexity and considering there were so few people involved. I think most people expect to get their group certificates at the end of the financial year. I have been in that situation when doing part-time jobs. I certainly did not get those group certificates until the end of the financial year. Most people's expectation is that they will get their group certificates and any fringe benefit notation at the end of the financial year, but I would draw the minister's attention to the example of a person who lost their job in January 1998. This would mean they would not get their group certificate until July 1999 and that is the only way I can read this. I do not think that it is a matter which we can get back to later; it has to be sorted out or we have to have a commitment that we are going to deal with it at another hour or in another bill. I do not think we can sort it out any other way.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>3448</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Seeing that Senator Murray has raised the issue, it may be best if we move to the other amendments and come back to this amendment.

So that is the way to do it.</para><para>These amendments to  A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998  seek to include superannuation contributions made by employers on group certificates. I spoke at length on this in my speech during the second reading debate but I will briefly recap the 
 arguments. The intention is simple, that group certificates show the full value of the remuneration package provided by employers. This will have several advantages. First, it would allow employees to see at a glance exactly how much their remuneration is worth. That would help to improve the standing of superannuation for employees as something real and practical and we think do wonders for its attractiveness.</para><para>Secondly, it would allow the superannuation high income earners surcharge to be collected based on group certificates rather than from funds. This was the unanimous recommendation to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation at the time that the surcharge tax was introduced and that recommendation was from business, the unions and superannuation industry groups. It would dramatically reduce compliance costs for superannuation funds and ensure that no-one misses the surcharge net and that no-one is inadvertently caught up in it. I must stress that we have not moved to change the surcharge in this bill to do this.</para><para>What we are proposing is that we provide the mechanism whereby it can be done later. Since group certificates are to be changed anyway for fringe benefits, it is the logical time to simultaneously add superannuation into the group certificates so that the collection mechanism for the surcharge can be revisited later.</para><para>Thirdly and most importantly, it will allow superannuation to be added into the means test for other benefits. This will ensure that salary packaging attention does not just move from fringe benefits back to superannuation. The Democrats—and this view is shared by unions, business and superannuation industry groups—believe that the total salary of fringe benefits, superannuation and actual remuneration should be shown on group certificates.</para><para>The government has already acknowledged that it is entirely appropriate that super contributions should be included in the means test for the 15 per cent high income earners superannuation tax surcharge. But that does not apply to the other superannuation rebates such as the spouse's contribution threshold; nor does it apply to the other tax surcharge on 
 the high income earners from the 1996 budget, which was the Medicare surcharge; nor does it apply to social security benefits.</para><para>There are still considerable benefits for high income earners to salary package, using superannuation to get access to other benefits and rebates which they should not have access to. The measure that we have put forward has the potential to increase the savings from cracking down on salary packaging from the $270 million proposed by the government to possibly twice that amount. That is not something to be lightly dismissed. It is for that reason that I commend the amendments to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3450</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Amendments Nos 1 to 12 and 14 to 27 to <inline ref="r697">A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998</inline>  and the amendments to <inline ref="r665">A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 1998</inline>  proposed by the Australian Democrats seek to have employers' superannuation contributions reported on employee group certificates and be included in the base calculations for various income tests. The government rejects these amendments because, firstly, superannuation contributions made to a complying superannuation fund are exempt from fringe benefits tax. Therefore, the inclusion of these payments on group certificates would be inconsistent with the exclusion of other FBT exempt benefits from the reporting requirements.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, employers' superannuation contributions are already taken into account when calculating an employee's liability for superannuation surcharge.  This means that employees are unable to avoid paying the superannuation surcharge by swapping their gross salary for employer superannuation contributions. Therefore, amendments Nos 26 and 27 to A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998 are not only incorrect but also effectively include employers' superannuation contributions twice in the calculation of adjusted income for surcharge purposes.</para><para>The time and cost which would be expended by employers to report superannuation contributions on group certificates would be 
 significantly greater than the time and cost which would be expended by employers to report fringe benefits. In particular, employers are generally not in a position to know the detail of superannuation contributions attributed to employees who are members of defined benefits superannuation funds and therefore could not comply with these amendments. The requirement to record reportable fringe benefits on group certificates would not apply to all employers and employees, because not all employees receive fringe benefits. However, to include superannuation contributions on employee group certificates would generally impact on all employers and employees, including employees on low income as a result of the superannuation guarantee arrangements.</para><para>Superannuation funds are required to provide the Australian Taxation Office with surcharge information by 31 October following the financial year. This does not align with the general requirement for employers to issue employees with their group certificates by 14 July following the financial year. There is an error in amendments Nos 4 and 5 to A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998. When an employee leaves employment between 1 April and 30 June in any year, the amendment requires the reportable superannuation contribution for the next year of income to be included on the group certificate. This is not logical as the employee has already left their employment before the next year of income starts.

I understand where he is coming from. If I apprehend correctly what he has said, he is concerned that these bills, which deal with fringe benefits tax, cut off any avenue for avoidance or evasion. It is out of that quarter that he approaches this legislation and focuses on superannuation as a possible means of tax minimisation in a sense which would be unfair. I understand that motivation. In fact, I join Senator Murray in the motivation. But, looking at these amendments, I am not sure that I can support them.</para></talk.start><para>The first thing I should say about superannuation is that we see it principally as deferred income and therefore addressing issues of living standards after retirement or after the age of 55 and also addressing issues of national savings. I am sure Senator Murray sees it in those terms too, but I think it is necessary to get that on the record.</para><para>Secondly, according to the schedule, super goes up to a maximum of nine per cent of salary by 2002. If these amendments go ahead, then workers would lose more of their social security benefits as their superannuation went up. I do not think that is what is intended but I think that is what the effect is. I do not want to delay this but I would not mind if Senator Murray just addressed that question. If that were the application of the amendment, then I am afraid I would have to support the government in this and would do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>3451</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A couple of key points have emerged here. One is whether we are going to consider a review of income taxation as being part of this total tax reform process. It is the Democrats' view that income tax has to be viewed holistically; in other words, the actual money you receive at the end of the month plus all fringe benefits and any other benefits such as superannuation. There are, as you know, a number of fringe benefits still left out of those which are going to appear in the fringe benefits box. What we are inclined towards is a very transparent and open system whereby salary packaging essentially becomes 
 a thing of the past. What you see is what you actually get. That is the principled approach we take to it.</para></talk.start><para>The second theme was emphasised by Senator Cook in his earlier remarks, which is that there are people, particularly in the higher income areas, who are using salary packaging—or fringe benefits and superannuation—to minimise their tax. The result is that the tax burden on those who pay their full way is naturally increased. It lessens the ability of the system to cope.</para><para>The third area which you have raised is notionally a problem, but it really relates far more to our whole system whereby working people who put in a good day's work are not appropriately remunerated and have to skive and scrimp and find other ways in which to advance their wage. That is not universally true, but it is certainly true of some sectors and some industries.</para><para>We would say that if somebody was achieving a nine per cent superannuation benefit but the taxation consequence of adding that to their salary pushed their disposable income below a living wage, that is clearly an unacceptable outcome. But the problem is not with evaluating the superannuation as part of the package. The problem is how much they are actually getting as a living wage. If superannuation and fringe benefits were added to salary, many more Australians would be excluded from the benefits they get from the social security system. We think that is desirable, because if people who are not entitled to do so access the social security system, it makes it much harder for the disadvantaged and low income people. What we have been concerned about is that the government have been hammering away at the people at the bottom, whereas if they attacked more of the people at the means tested end, we could get somewhere with this.</para><para>If, as a result of my earlier remarks and the construction of the amendments, the Labor Party have some sympathy but still have some concerns, I would suggest to you, Senator Cook—since we are in the middle of reviewing a total package and there will be other opportunities within the total package of some 29 bills—that perhaps you would come back 
 to the Democrats and say what you do or do not like, and we could pursue this again at a later stage.</para><para>To the government I say: you are starting to pursue the principle that we need to look at, which is that a person's total package needs to be evaluated for taxation purposes and at the interface of means testing with the social security system. This means that, in our view, at some time you have to address the issue of superannuation and how it is recorded in terms of a person's total salary package. The group certificate would provide the tax office with a single piece of paper which is the vehicle for saying, `This is the entire salary package that this person is getting'—salary plus fringe benefits plus superannuation. We are saying, simply put, that you have only gone part of the distance on this.</para><para>In the same way that I have made the offer to the Labor Party, I make the offer to the government: if the principle and the prospects which we are outlining attract you, there are opportunities over the next few months, in dealing with the overall tax package, of addressing our particular concern. I personally have difficulty in understanding why, as a principle, it would be objectionable to pursue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>3452</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to indicate that the Greens (WA) will support the Democrats' amendments.

We include it in our amendments because of our desire to highlight that tax reform should be about improving the progressivity of the tax system—that means ensuring that high in 
 come earners are made to pay their fair share while the tax burden is lifted on low income earners.</para><para>The rises in graduate taxes in 1996 were the most regressive move on tax made by this government. If tax reform proceeds without some relief for very low income earners now facing punitive rates of tax, then we will have failed as a parliament and as a Senate to do the best we could by low income earners.</para><para>The original theory of the HECS repayment was that graduates should pay a portion of the above median income that they earn, recognising that university education has contributed to that. That fundamental underpinning of fairness, of tax equity, was undone by the 1996 HECS changes. The repayment threshold was reduced from $28,200, or 82 per cent of average weekly earnings, to $20,700, which is now around 53 per cent of average weekly earnings. By any measure, someone earning half of average weekly earnings is not a high or even a modest income earner; he or she is a low income earner. Yet this government increased the tax paid by low income earners who have had some higher education by $621 a year, which is a weekly tax increase of around 20 per cent. For someone on average weekly earnings of around $38,000 a year, the HECS changes increased the tax paid by $2,325 a year, or 25 per cent.</para><para>The Medicare levy is not payable for a couple without children who are earning less than $22,594. Under our proposal it would not be payable for any  income less than $24,450, which is the taxable income at which the low income earner's rebate finally phases out. Beyond that, the Medicare levy exemption adds on $2,100 for each additional dependent child. The additional family assistance means test adds on $3,000, from $24,350 rising to $28,200 from July next year. At present, a family with three children is exempt from the Medicare levy on incomes less than $28,984 but is eligible for additional family assistance right up to $30,350.</para><para>From June next year, they will be eligible for family assistance right up to $34,200 a year. So, even with the Medicare levy exemption, a lot of families and around one in nine individual taxpayers who are regarded as low 
 income earners by the rest of the tax and social security system are caught up in what is supposed to be an above average income earner's HECS tax surcharge. The Medicare levy exemption picks up only 70,000-odd of the 929,000 taxpayers eligible for the low income earner's tax rebate, so there is a clear need for further movement in this area.</para><para>As an interim measure, to start reducing what is a grossly unfair impost on those who are clearly low income earners, the Democrats are proposing some measures to take effect with this bill to exclude from HECS repayments those people who are clearly recognised as low income earners. They include those taxpayers who receive the low income earner's tax rebate, which cuts out at $24,450, and those who receive additional family assistance, which commences cutting out at around $23,000. This is only an interim measure but, given that this bill will require employers to change their tax repayments to the HECS scheme, it strikes us as a logical time to do it. I commend the amendment to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>3453</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Amendment No. 13, proposed by the Australian Democrats, seeks to raise the threshold which determines when a person is required to make a compulsory repayment under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme.

 Funding Act 1998 deals with the repayment threshold for Higher Education Contribution Scheme debts. In 1996 the coalition lowered the repayment threshold from average weekly earnings to $20,700. After indexation, this amount is now $21,334. However, people who are entitled to pay no Medicare levy or a reduced amount of Medicare levy are exempted from HECS repayments. This means that certain people who have or had a spouse are not required to make HECS repayments if their family income is below $24,425 and they have no dependent children or students, and up to $35,777 for five children. The family income limits are higher for additional children.</para></talk.start><para>My understanding of the Democrats amendment is that it seeks to make further changes to the threshold using the same principle—that is, exempting from HECS repayments some people whose income is over the base repayment threshold but who are entitled to certain tax rebates or social security payments. I note that, while the amendments before us refer to `additional family payment', under the Social Security Act there is nothing called `additional family payment'. I therefore assume that what is meant here is the maximum level of family allowance.</para><para>The opposition's views on the coalition government's changes to HECS are well known. At last year's election, Labor committed itself to raising the repayment threshold by $1,000 each year from the year 2000. Labor remains committed to the reform of HECS, as outlined in the speech on 16 March by the Leader of the Opposition. A policy review process was set in train following the election, and consideration of changes to HECS will be part of that process. In the meantime, we are not prepared to support random changes to HECS until the opposition has completed its own policy review process on the issue of HECS and higher education more generally.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Murphy)</name></talker><para>—For the purpose of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  record, I want to correct something that was said earlier.

I said, as I looked around to my left, that we obviously needed some additional advice on the matters that Senator Murray raised. I have now obtained that advice, which I will relay to the chamber. This measure will greatly assist employers in minimising their compliance costs. This is a very vital aspect. If these amendments do not pass, employers will need to have systems in place in two days time, on 1 April, to issue early group certificates. I think everyone in this chamber would recognise that that is an impossibility and would be seen to be quite unreasonable.</para></talk.start><para>In my previous answer, I think I indicated a qualification that I needed to seek additional advice—that the preliminary advice was uncertain. Nonetheless, I relayed that to the chamber and agreed to seek confirmation of the advice. Because of the complexity of the question—an appropriate question, nonetheless—it was appropriate that we should provide appropriate advice. Senator Murray, I can now confirm that if an employee leaves employment after 1 April in a year, they may not receive their group certificate until 14 July the following year. I think that was the point you were making. However, I am advised that in fact there are very few employees who actually request early group certificates. My understanding is that this is not a usual circumstance. But as I said, in the drafting of this bill, it is important that this amendment proceeds because, if it does not, we may be faced with the circumstances that employers may need to have systems in place in two days to issue early group certificates.

So with some trepidation I suggest to you that I might be being a little obtuse in this, but follow me with this and see why I am wrong.

If you lost your job on 1 July, you would get your certificate by the following 14 July. That is what I am trying to get you to give me back. I do not think the amendment says that, and the reassurance you gave me did not do that. I am not going to suggest to you how to phrase it, and I have no objection to you amending it on the run. But, frankly, the longest period under your suggestion that anybody would be without a group certificate should be no less than 364 days plus 14. So if you lost your job on 1 July 1998, you would get your certificate by 14 July 1999.

Against that, you have to balance the fact that their systems are in place now for the law as it is now and that that does not, therefore, require them to do anything.

I intend to devote the few minutes available to me to the coalition government's <inline ref="r739">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1999</inline> . That bill introduces voluntary student unionism to the Australian universities, less those in Western Australia—the progressive state—which has had voluntary student unionism for about five years. The Western Australian legislation was passed during the time that I was still serving in the state Legislative Council. There are several major myths associated with the fear of 
 bringing in democratically proposed voluntary unionism. Part of those myths can be dispelled, if not all of them.</para></talk.start><para>I am not in the habit of publicising the Australian Democrats, a political party for which I do not have much time at all, let alone agreeing with what they say. But when the Australian Democrats' higher education principles were released, I found there was some common ground that I had with them. I do not know whether that is an indictment of me or whether the Australian Democrats are becoming more democratic in their old age.</para><para>They have a pledge to decrease student fees and charges. They have a pledge to enhance access to higher education. They also have a belief that students must be able to control their own affairs. They support the incubus of compulsory student unionism, however, which is contradictory to those beliefs.</para><para>I can only come to the conclusion that they do not really mean it. If those three points were introduced, do they agree with some universities introducing and following through on the idea that degrees will not be granted unless student fees with respect to their guilds are paid? What VSU does is reduce barriers to higher education. It removes a compulsory up-front fee. It does not necessarily remove fees but it removes the compulsion to pay fees. It gives students freedom of choice to control their own affairs. That is not a bad start to democracy in tertiary education. And it puts power back into the hands of the students. It gives them the taste of power for their future lives. It recognises that students are sensible, intelligent and responsible enough to decide for themselves in a democratic process how their money is to be spent. What we don't say is that student unions, or any other union in Australia, should be outlawed. What we do say, however, is that if students want to join a union they can. We are not saying: do without unions. We don't say that in the work force. We don't say that either in the Western Australian legislation. But we do say that in this enlightened world students should have a choice as to whether they join a union or not.</para><para>I understand what the reason is behind compulsory unionism in tertiary institutions. It gives the socialists—that is, the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats—who want to inculcate a culture of compulsion in unions the start to put that in the minds of tertiary students. In some cases this carries on, of course, throughout their adult life. What that does is give the Bill Keltys, Bob Hawkes and Paul Keatings of this world a great advantage, and that is the culture of compulsory unionism—no ticket, no start. That is not what a modern world is about; that is not what Australia is about.</para><para>Let me draw a distinction between the legislation passed under the Victorian model, which used the term `voluntary student representation', or VSR, and the voluntary student unionism of Western Australia: a model which the coalition government's legislation superimposes from Western Australia, where it has been in now for five years. The Victorian model draws an artificial distinction between essential services and non-essential services. Under VSR, the Victorian model, a compulsory fee is still collected to fund those activities deemed non-political. We do not think that is good enough. Who is to decide what is political and what is non-political? We want students throughout Australia to decide for themselves whether or not they join a union with respect to their tertiary education.</para><para>Myth 2 is that, under the VSU, organisations and services will cease to exist. That is the big bogy. Of course, it does not happen. Let me have a look at some of the things at UWA. Voluntary unionism is five years old there. Cards are still available at Steve's Nedlands Park Hotel. You get a bar discount, you get a Steve's cafe discount and you get a bottle shop discount. The Grosvenor Hotel has discounts and the Metropolis Hotel has discounts. It goes on. There is a whole list of discounts that the student guild still runs. There are nightclub discounts. To change tack, the guild sells discounted clothing and merchandise. The guild runs a copy centre. The guild runs a second-hand bookshop. It sells cards, gifts and stationery. It runs a University of Western Australia tavern. It runs 
 a guild market. It provides Hostelling International membership. It runs dry-cleaning. It runs Talking Heads hair design. It runs a campus pharmacy and eye-care centres. It runs a travel agency. It even runs American Express at a discount. It runs boat trips to Rottnest Island at a discount. It has got live jazz in Cafe Acorn. It has got Winthrop Australia, which is a computer shop that the guild also runs. Don't tell me that services have dropped off.</para><para>Okay, you say, that is UWA, which is a fairly distinctive, perhaps top end of the street university and is one of the best universities in Australia. But look at the Student Guild at Curtin that everyone said would collapse. It has membership benefits. It has student assistance with respect to making life at university better. It offers campus services, clubs and activities, housing and the Guild Council. It connects with overseas student bodies. It has the Curtin Postgraduate Association. It runs a bookshop and it runs a paper—all funded by the voluntary contributions of students. It offers bookshop vouchers, discounted parking permits and accident insurance. It runs clubs and societies vouchers. It runs free entry to guild shows. It runs a copy centre, a sports store and a tavern. It runs all these things that people like those opposite, the socialists in this chamber, said would collapse. They did not collapse.</para><para>Some of the credit for the introduction to Western Australia of the VSU, which was ultimately copied by the federal government because they could not improve on it, must go to the present Minister for Tourism and Mines, the Hon. Norman Moore, in the Legislative Council of Western Australia. He was assisted by Mark Dale, who is currently president of the national body of the Young Liberal movement in Australia, the Young Conservative movement. They put it together in 1994, and it is that system that the coalition government in the Commonwealth has decided to use, because it works; we know it works.</para><para>I do believe that one of the things that we can do for youth today, in particular youth in tertiary education stepping out into life—a quantum leap from secondary education—is 
 show them that democracy means the freedom to choose. I think it is a great indictment of universities and of previous governments that they did not allow students to choose when it was a formative area of their lives. What the coalition government is doing is giving students choice to join or not to join.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presidential Powers</title><page.no>3458</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>3458</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The powers of a president as proposed for the republic deserve to be addressed more fully than they have been to date. The Constitution of this country is high law. It is the highest law we have and the people who decide on it are the High Court. There are many powers that reside with the monarch which have not yet been tested in the High Court. And there are those who believe that convention can overtake the law which is extant in our Constitution. I think that is an untested proposition.</para></talk.start><para>I want to address in this speech the so far rarely debated question of the proper powers that will attach to the office of the Australian president, if there is to be one, under the bipartisan republican model. I further want to draw to the Senate's attention some of the contradictions of that model with reference to the theory and practice of the exercise of presidential power.</para><para>The existing Australian Constitution vests considerable express powers in the formal head of state, the monarch—the Queen. Most of these are of little or no practical application today. One power that still has practical application, however, is that of the appointment and dismissal of the Governor-General. This power is very much alive. This power is exercised on the advice of the Australian Prime Minister. Notwithstanding such advice, however, the Queen retains by Constitutional Convention and practice—in Bagehot's words—the right to be consulted, the right to encourage and the right to warn. Thus, when the Prime Minister says `jump' in relation to his or her advice to the Queen with regard to appointment or dismissal, the Queen has every right to ask not how high but instead `Why?' and `Is this the best course of action?'</para><para>A brief look at recent political history is instructive over the potential role of the Queen. In 1975, for example, had then Prime Minister Whitlam sought the removal of Governor-General Kerr prior to Kerr's dismissal of the government, the Queen would have been under no obligation in law to act without delay. This could potentially have given Kerr the necessary time to remove the government before the Queen acted on Whitlam's advice. Subsequent claims by some commentators that Prime Minister Whitlam was simply not quick enough to phone are therefore clearly erroneous. Such action by the Queen as our head of state, based on convention, would not be justiciable. The Prime Minister, in other words, was and currently is hampered in simply getting in first to dismiss the Governor-General in a similar constitutional crisis. The Queen does have power.</para><para>This admittedly odd structural arrangement has the advantage of providing a safety net, albeit an autocratic one, in allowing the removal of a government that, for example, was—in the opinion of the Governor-General—acting in the most serious manner against the national interest. This arrangement gives the Governor-General breathing space to exercise a reserve power without the danger of being dismissed beforehand.</para><para>Consider a situation where a Prime Minister had lost the confidence of the lower house but where another member could command such confidence. But the Prime Minister, in an effort to prevent the other side of politics from gaining power, goes to the Governor-General advising a dissolution under section 5 of the Constitution. In such a situation, it is imperative that the Governor-General have the power to refuse such a dissolution and instead appoint the alternative government. Thus the current mechanism whereby the Governor-General can contemplate the exercise of reserve powers without fear of instant dismissal is a mechanism that must be retained, although obviously not in its now autocratic form. The parliament should therefore give serious consideration to the provision of such a safety net for the proposed president.</para><para>The government's exposure draft for the republic, however, would increase executive 
 power by destroying this safety net. It does this by enabling the Prime Minister to dismiss the president without delay, thus stripping the president of the capacity to exercise his/her reserve powers first. That is clearly a shift in power from the monarch and the Governor-General to the Prime Minister. These reserve powers, as carried across from our present constitutional arrangements, are those that are thought to be exercisable under certain conditions at the Governor-General's own discretion. Four are usually cited as falling within this category: one, the power to appoint the Prime Minister; two, the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and therefore the government; three, the power to refuse to dissolve the House of Representatives under section 5 or both houses under section 57; and, four, the power to force a dissolution of the House of Representatives.</para><para>But under the exposure draft, the Prime Minister can simply pre-empt the proper presidential exercise of a reserve power. Where a Prime Minister had lost the confidence of the lower house, the Prime Minister—rushing to the phone—could dismiss the president instantly and prevent the appointment of an alternative government. This would throw our system of government into disarray. In effect, the reserve powers would become of historical interest only. In a scenario where the government was acting to the  serious detriment of the nation, Australia would be plunged into a constitutional crisis with more grave implications than 1975.</para><para>Some might think that the scenarios I have portrayed are far-fetched in such a supposedly stable system of government as ours. But to those people I say: who could have predicted the events of 1975? Senators must understand that the integrity of constitutional structures are put to the test not in everyday affairs, but in precisely the sorts of crises that I have adverted to.</para><para>It is in these extreme situations that we find out whether our founding document has what it takes to protect our system of government from the unscrupulous and the power hungry. That is why I so persistently and consistently rail against the creation of what is an executive republic, against the moving of powers 
 from the monarch and the Governor-General to the Prime Minister. The government's model must therefore be modified to allow a proper role for the exercise of presidential reserve powers. The most meritorious option to achieve this is to require that, in any case where the Prime Minister wishes to dismiss the president or where the president wishes to exercise a reserve power by acting against the advice of the Executive Council, the action be first ratified by a majority of each house of the federal parliament sitting separately.</para><para>This would have the considerable benefit of, firstly, giving to the parliament—which is the elected representative body of the Australian people—the power to confirm or deny the propriety of the proposed action. Secondly, it would ensure that, even under the bipartisan republican model, Australia would take on more of the character of a parliamentary republic, as opposed to the proposed executive republic. Thirdly, it would go some way toward diluting the inordinate power proposed to be given to just two office holders in our system of government and instead would distribute it more evenly within this system. That is, parliament would gain a sovereign position not only as the elected body of the populace but, importantly and properly, as a directing hand in times of constitutional conflict.</para><para>It is my opinion that the senators and parliamentarians give up their duty to the Australian people if they accept the executive republic which is being proposed to us at present. I think it is a perfectly legitimate view to take that some would prefer a parliamentary republic to a directly elected, popular republic. I can understand that difference. But to allow a change of our system which would increase the power of the executive and put at risk the sovereign rights of the people and the protections within our existing system is very dangerous for our society and needs to be resisted. It is for that reason that I raise the issues of the actual powers of the monarch, particularly with regard to appointment and dismissal of the Governor-General.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Balkans Conflict</title><page.no>3459</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>3459</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As we sit here tonight, half a world 
 away the Balkans is again aflame. Honourable senators would be aware from news coverage that horrific acts of brutality are now taking place in the area of Kosovo. The BBC reports that, for example, 60,000 refugees had streamed from Kosovo into Albania since Saturday. The British Foreign Secretary said this evening that refugees are being herded into concentration areas and that a sterile zone 10 kilometres wide has been established inside the borders of Kosovo. Elsewhere there are other frightening reports.</para></talk.start><para>NATO itself believes that as many as half a million people out of a population of two million are displaced. There are reports of 20,000 people in the town of Drenica being crowded onto trucks and taken away to unknown destinations. In Montenegro, refugees arriving in the city of Pec say that young men are being rounded up and taken away and that atrocities are occurring on a daily basis.</para><para>How, at the end of the 20th century, could this nightmare be repeated in Europe? The reason this nightmare is being repeated in Europe is that a massive miscalculation was made by President Clinton and others in NATO—a miscalculation on a scale which will leave unutterable terror for many people. The miscalculation was simply this: NATO and President Clinton believed that a war could be waged by air power alone and that a war would be waged without sending troops onto the ground.</para><para>On 25 March, President Clinton said that troops would not be necessary to ensure security in Kosovo, a claim he repeated yesterday. Yet, immediately the international observers left and the air strikes began, the real need for troops on the ground became apparent—because it is very clear that Serb forces have now taken this opportunity to round up their ethnic enemies and commit acts of atrocity and barbarity upon them. This happened because a fatal mistake was made. It happened because NATO, in their arrogance, thought that they could fight a war and not shed any of their own blood. The tragic consequence is that it is the blood of innocent people that is being shed at this very moment.</para><para>There are now frightening reports that a group of Serbian paramilitaries active in Bosnia—a group called the Tigers and led by a man known as Arkan—are once again waging the policy of ethnic cleansing, this time in Kosovo. And all without anybody to save these innocent people; all without even a person to observe the atrocities that are being committed. But we do not need to see the innocents executed to know that a monstrous evil, on a scale not seen since the long night of Nazi tyranny in Europe, is once again at hand.</para><para>The mistake having been made, the question is: how do we rectify it? The great dilemma now facing NATO and the Western world is surely that to stop the air war now would mean that Milosevic and the people like him who wish to wage ethnic war will have won, their capacity to continue to commit atrocities will be unblunted. But to blunder on, without clear plans, will inevitably mean—barring some fortuitous circumstance in between—that troops in Western Europe will be inexorably sucked into an abyss of ill-planned involvement, sucked into involvement without any clear objectives.</para><para>The danger this poses to the security of the Western world is this: if there are no clear objectives and troops get committed to the ground, then there is no way of containing the war, and containment of this conflict is absolutely critical. I remind honourable senators that 80 years ago a failure to contain a similar conflict in this very area of the world precipitated the First World War. It is incumbent upon the wise heads of the Western world to now formulate a plan as to how this conflict will be brought to an end. But it must be brought to an end in a way which ensures the safety and security of people who, but a couple of weeks ago, were living in their own homes. It must be brought about in a way in which there will be security, safety, and some chance of real life for those displaced people.</para><para>It is not an easy task and we must remember that peace was never won through temerity. Yet the West seems to be involved at the moment in a plan of cringing reluctance 
 to pursue objectives with the conviction needed to succeed. In short, the West has embarked upon a very dangerous course of conduct indeed. The reason I stand here tonight is that I believe it is incumbent upon those of us who are in a position to lend some moral guidance—albeit from afar—to do so. We cannot stand by, now that this situation has been precipitated, and do nothing. We must urge the formulation of a plan to end the conflict.</para><para>I conclude with the simple thought that right now the very moral fabric of the Western world stands adjudged. If the Western world lacks a commitment to deal with this matter decisively, then I fear that history will be a very harsh judge indeed.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Electromagnetic Radiation</title><page.no>3461</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>3461</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise again tonight to speak on the issue of electromagnetic radiation. The subject has not received much attention here in Australia of late, even though right now Standards Australia through its TE7 committee is considering relaxing the current standard—a matter I will return to a little later. There is however a great deal of action overseas. According to the World Health Organisation report, this is one of the four most important global issues.</para></talk.start><para>British and European parliaments are currently debating whether or not there is enough evidence to support prudent avoidance principles and policies. The sitings of cellphone towers in many countries in Europe, in the US, South Africa  and South America continue to be flashpoints for community anger and frustration.</para><para>The Italian health minister is expected to call for a prudent avoidance policy when the European Union meets again in June, and the EU has called for the labelling of mobile phones as potential health hazards. In the UK, parliamentarians have criticised the government's telecommunications legislation as being too much `weighted in favour of industry and not of the environment'. Labour and  Liberal Democrat members have said that the government would be `foolish to rule 
 out the possibility of a health risk from radio frequency-microwave radiation'.</para><para>In Austria late last year, 16 of the top scientists in the area signed the Vienna Declaration, which recognises that low intensity microwaves can cause biological effects or damage to humans. In Salzburg, the public health department has adopted an interim public exposure standard based on a study that showed adverse health effects from mobile phones on sleeping subjects. They have consequently introduced a standard that is 2,000 times stricter than the Australian one.</para><para>A South African mobile phone company has been the first in the world to offer its 112,000 staff a free radiation shield. And in that country, a long-term mobile user who has a brain tumour is bringing legal action against the industry. In England, a legal firm is acting on behalf of 24 brain tumour victims.</para><para>In the US, a number of community groups, including the Communications Workers of America, supported by 22 doctors, have filed a suit against the Federal Communications Commission alleging that the guidelines fail to protect public health and the environment from harm.</para><para>In Sweden, the Union of Clerical and Technical Employees in Industry organisation has published a new booklet entitled <inline font-style="italic">Hypersensitive in IT Environments</inline> to advise their work force on how to deal with emerging problems of electroradiation. A recent British study shows that mobile phone radiation stimulates a morphine-like chemical in the brain. As cancer is recognised as being triggered by endocrine system imbalances, the long-term ramifications of these results might be considerable.</para><para>It has come to my attention that birds too are affected by electromagnetic radiation. In the US recently, thousands of homing pigeons have been lost, with pigeon racing clubs claiming mobile phone infrastructure as the cause. The <inline font-style="italic">Washington Post</inline> reported last October that, of the 1,800 birds competing in a 200-mile race, 1,500 failed to return. In another race, 700 out of 900 went missing. In a 350-mile race, the number lost was 1,000 out of 1,200.</para><para>Clubs are saying that such losses are extraordinary, but have been on the increase over the past few years. Ireland has also recently reported similar occurrences quoting pigeon club authorities as saying that the problem of lost birds has worsened as satellite television and mobile communications networks in the state have developed. New Zealand has had similar problems.</para><para>In the US, organisations are also saying that wild geese no longer fly in their characteristic V-formation and, back home, members of the Victorian Homing Association have told my office that the 700-mile race to Queensland has experienced unexplained losses in recent years. They have also noticed that birds are more likely to be lost if they fly through areas where there are significant numbers of mobile phone towers as opposed to flying across the desert.</para><para>As senators will be aware, birds navigate by means of magnetic particles in the brain, so it stands to reason that they will be vulnerable to the changes in electromagnetic environments. The implications are not just serious for pigeon fanciers; presumably, migratory birds are also having difficulty with  navigation. It is quite possible that preserving important wetlands, through the Ramsar convention, is not going to be enough to protect these migratory water birds.</para><para>You would expect the federal government to be interested in these phenomena, and I hope we do not get the usual dismissive jokes from Senator Alston about mice or, in this case, birds and mobile phones, because the wireless communications industry is moving very quickly to flood the air spaces with low level microwaves and flood the market with equipment which exceeds current Australian standards.</para><para>As we found out last year, the Australian Communications Authority does not have the capacity to check mobile phones for compliance with our standards and certainly no-one is going around testing mobile phone tower emissions. Nevertheless, all of our mobile phones are made overseas and there is a push to relax the standards so that we can have uniform worldwide compliance and, therefore, 
 no need for us to be embarrassed about our inability to insist on compliance.</para><para>As Stewart Fist commented in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> two weeks ago, our standards have little to do with anything but heat emissions in any case and they fail to recognise radio frequency microwave radiation emissions as having any biological effects. You could argue that a standard which is anyway measuring the wrong thing is not worth fighting to retain. The CSIRO argues strongly that it is, because at least there is some brake on the energy that can be put to your brain. As I see more and more executives talking into microphones dangling under their chin, with their mobile phone held at a distance, I think we all know that there is more to fear than a phone warming up your cheekbone.</para><para>For the past couple of months, government and the industry have been trying very hard to relax Australia's radio frequency microwave public exposure standard. Standards Australia informed its TE7 committee just last week that it would upgrade the standard. The committee has struck a bit of bother because the community reps on the committee, the unions and the CSIRO cannot be persuaded by industry to support the move. In spite of the fact that the committee is stacked with industry and government, they need an 80 per cent vote in favour to adopt a new standard, which they did not get when the question was put to the vote.</para><para>The ACA has intervened and last week threatened these reluctant members that it would be obliged to step in by mid-April, saying that its preferred option is the adoption of the new standard. It argues that the old standard will shortly expire and that this is the only sensible course of action. I have commented in this place before tonight that there is no longer any justification for industry to dominate standard setting. We are not talking here about component parts like nuts and bolts being standardised so that they fit together. The many people who are experiencing effects from using mobile phones are worried not about whether the phone has standard features but whether it is slowly damaging their brain.</para><para>As it stands at the moment, the standard setting process in Australia for telecommunications is not precautionary and is not in the best interests of health, and most people know that. The ACA and the industry should not be allowed to relax our standards until they are able to convince our pre-eminent scientific body, the CSIRO, and ordinary citizens on the committee that it is the right thing to do.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aris, Dr Michael</title><page.no>3463</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>3463</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I want to talk about the death of a hero. Dr Michael Aris was a humanitarian academic, a Tibetan specialist and the husband of Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.</para></talk.start><para>Dr Aris passed away on Saturday, 27 March. His illness was brought to international attention by the Burmese military regime's refusal to allow Dr Aris to visit Daw Suu Kyi in Burma before he became too seriously ill to travel. Dr Aris had been applying for a visa for the past three years, even when he was not aware of his illness. In recent months, however, the requests became urgent. Even when he was ill, he did not pressure Daw Suu Kyi to leave Burma to visit him in Oxford because he respected and supported the immense and unwavering responsibility which she has for her country and its people.</para><para>The story of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Dr Michael Aris is one of commitment, sacrifice, courage and love. They were married in 1972 and they have two children, Alexander and Kim, both now in their 20s, and both cut off from their mother for years because of the actions of the Burmese military regime. These young men cannot visit their mother in Burma because the military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, will not allow them to. Daw Suu Kyi will not leave Burma because the SPDC has made undertakings to her in the past about her freedom of movement but each time has reneged on its promises. The SPDC now tell Suu Kyi that she may leave Burma to attend her husband's funeral. She feels she cannot because she would not be allowed to return. In this, as in so many things, the SPDC cannot be trusted.</para><para>Dr Aris died on his 53rd birthday. It also happened to be the Myanmar National Army Day—Tatmadaw Day—a day when the army parades its strength, and did so with 6,000 troops taking to the streets in what has become an annual part of the military's intimidation tactics. Ironically, the day was originally called Resistance Day, and was meant to be a day of celebration for the Burmese people to celebrate the struggle of the Burmese people against Japanese occupation in World War Two. Now it serves to remind of the struggle of the Burmese people against another kind of occupation—that of their own military junta.</para><para>The opposition—the National League for Democracy—of which Daw Suu Kyi is the leader issued a statement calling for unity and restoration of democracy in Burma. In doing so, they are also pleading for the support of the international community for their cause—the protection of human rights and the restoration of democracy.</para><para>The military was also condemned by the national coalition government of the Union of Burma, which comprises members of parliament who were driven into exile after the military refused to honour the result of the 1990 national election which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won in a landslide victory. Australia is now home to several of those exiled members of parliament.</para><para>We take our democracy so much for granted in this country that we just cannot conceive of what it must be like to actually win government and never be allowed to govern. More than that, just because you are a member of the political party successful in an election, you are subject to torture, imprisonment, arbitrary detention and persecution.</para><para>Daw Suu Kyi enjoys overwhelming support from the Burmese people, and from the international community. She lives a restricted life of virtual house arrest and has done for many years. The military have used many strategies to attempt to force her to give up her struggle. Through all this, and for the whole of their life together, Michael Aris was unfailingly understanding and supportive of her. </para><para>International human rights groups, the President of the United States and the United Nations Secretary-General have all condemned the military's decision not to grant a visa to Dr Aris to enable him and his sons to visit Suu Kyi. I am concerned, however, that the Australian government seems to be wavering in its resolve to support Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the properly elected government of Burma.</para><para>It concerns me that the minister recently criticised the European Union for maintaining the policy prohibiting visits by Burmese military ministers and also that Australia broke ranks with other Western nations by attending a controversial narcotics conference held in Rangoon at ambassadorial level, not just at the law enforcement level, as originally offered as justification. I hope that the government is not weakening Australia's position on Burma. I believe now is the time for it to clarify that policy.</para><para>Dr Aris last saw his wife in January 1996. After that, the Burmese SPDC repeatedly denied him a visa, even when they knew he was dying. He was reported to have been willing to die in Rangoon, if he could just have seen his beloved Suu one more time. It is too late now for a husband and wife to be united, but it is not too late for a mother to be reunited with her sons. The SPDC should, of course, immediately grant visas to Alexander and Kim Aris to visit their mother at this most tragic time for their family.</para><para>Michael was one of a group of distinguished scholars who focused on the humanitarian aspects of Buddhism and the history of</para><para>parts of South Asia. He was the gentle scholar and she was the political activist. His great love for his wife drew him into the role of her spokesman, and an unwavering supporter of the rights of the Burmese people.</para><para>The situation in Burma is just as awful as that in Serbia. Australia must look closely at our own actions in relation to Burma, and our own failure to influence change there. We send our condolences to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her two sons, Alexander and Kim, and we hope that the SPDC can be prevailed upon to at least allow them to be together at this very sad time.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>22:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>3465</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 10.33 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>3465</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>3465</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Broadcasting Services Act—Commercial Television Conversion Scheme 1999.</para><para>Civil Aviation Act—Civil Aviation Regulations—Civil Aviation Orders—</para><para>	 Amendment of section 82, dated 25 March 1999.</para><para>	 Exemptions Nos CASA 09/1999-CASA 12/1999.</para><para>	 Instrument No. CASA 73/1999.</para><para>Export Control Act—Export Control (Fees) Amendment Orders 1999 (No. 1).</para><para>Health Insurance Act—Declaration—QAA No. 1/1999.</para><para>National Rail Corporation Agreement Act—Agreement between Commonwealth of Australia, State of New South Wales, State of Victoria, State of Queensland, State of Western Australia and State of South Australia—Third Amending Agreement, dated 22 March 1999.</para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript></hansard>
