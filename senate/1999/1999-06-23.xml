Although the usual practice would have been to extradite persons accused of such crimes to the country where the crimes occurred, at the time it was considered politically unacceptable to extradite persons to countries behind the so called "iron curtain". 
</para><para>The "iron curtain" has fallen and many of the republics, including Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania are now independent states and have been accepted as members of the Council of Europe. Australia has, in the past, been prepared to enter into extradition arrangements with any country that is a member of the Council.</para><para>The Government is actively pursuing the possibility of establishing modern extradition arrangements with many of these newly independent States. However, even if a modern extradition relationship was in place, it would still be impossible for those countries to comply with an extradition request while section 22 of the War Crimes Act remains in force.</para><para>Effectively, section 22 of the act provides that where a person's extradition from Australia is sought for conduct covered by the act no surrender for extradition is possible unless the requesting country establishes a prima facie case. Thus, notwithstanding a modern extradition relationship with these countries, if the offence for which extradition is sought is a "war crime" then the requesting state must provide a prima facie case. Because of the differences between civil code and common law countries the practical effect is that it would be virtually impossible for a civil code jurisdiction to successfully seek the extradition of a person suspected of a war crime.</para><para>The concept of a prima facie case in determining sufficiency of evidence is one to which most common law countries are accustomed. However, those countries which operate under a civil code system (e.g., Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania) do not use this test in criminal proceedings. The practical issue is that the laws of evidence in common law systems are such as to make it very difficult for a civil code jurisdiction to supply evidence in an admissible form.</para><para>The repeal of section 22 will remove the fundamental barrier to Australia's cooperation with the international community in relation to suspected war criminals.</para><para>This is not to say that extradition of a suspected war criminal would be automatic. Any request for the extradition of a suspected war criminal would be subject to the general extradition arrangement with the requesting country. Such arrangement must include all the usual safeguards spelt out in the Extradition Act 1988. All that the amendment will do is to remove an additional onerous requirement that relates only to the extradition of war criminals. This Government sees no reason in principle why this practical impediment to the extradition of war criminals should be retained.</para><para>The amendment to the act will not have any financial impact.</para><para></para><para>CUSTOMS (TARIFF CONCESSION SYSTEM VALIDATIONS) BILL 1999</para><para>This bill is designed to remove any doubt about the validity of certain decisions made by officers of the Australian Customs Service in relation to the tariff concession system.</para><para>The tariff concession system allows goods to be imported at a concessional rate of duty essentially in circumstances where there are no local manufacturers of substitutable goods.</para><para>In November 1995, the chief executive officer of customs generally delegated his powers and functions in relation to the tariff concession system to certain officers of customs.</para><para>In July 1996, the government made changes to the tariff concession system.</para><para>Those changes resulted in amendments to the Customs Act, including the introduction of additional powers and functions.</para><para>New delegations were not sought for powers that were added to sections of the act which were already the subject of the November 1995 instrument.</para><para>It was thought that that instrument was sufficient.</para><para>The sufficiency of the delegations for the tariff concession system was questioned in a recent hearing of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</para><para>In light of this, the chief executive officer signed two instruments on 31 May 1999.</para><para>The first revoked all existing delegations for the tariff concession system.</para><para>The second issued new delegations covering all the powers and functions in relation to the tariff concession system.</para><para>Both instruments took effect on 1 June 1999.</para><para>Notwithstanding, it is possible that certain decisions and actions taken in relation to the tariff concession system subsequent to the 1996 changes to the act may not have been the subject of adequate delegations.</para><para>This bill aims to remove any doubt about the validity of these decisions and actions, to the extent that they were taken in reliance on a delegation that may not have been sufficient.</para><para>Finally, the government has decided that this bill should not apply to certain matters before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or to certain applications for refunds of customs duty, which had not been decided before 1 June 1999.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned till

The environment debate, by the end of the time allotment, will have spread over two parliamentary days after some 11 months in committee. The new tax system spent 75 weeks I think in total in Senate committees, and this was through a Senate committee system which was designed, of course, to reduce the load of Senate debate in the committee of the whole. The reality is that, after 70 weeks in Senate committees, the time in the committee of the whole again has seen one of the longest debates in Australian Senate history. I commend the allotment of times to the Senate.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>6043</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have just heard one of the most infantile and vacuous contributions ever in this chamber from a manager of government business. I congratulate Senator Campbell on managing not to address the motion but to string his contribution out for at least seven of the 10 minutes that were available to him. What we have here is a proposal to confine debate to literally a couple of hours on legislation that is before this chamber for the first time—the environment package—that contains an unprecedented 906 amendments. That is what we are debating—a proposal from the government to stymie debate on this significant environment legislation.</para></talk.start><para>There are 906 amendments to the legislation and 569 government and Democrat sponsored amendments that this chamber had not seen before late last night. More than 300 of those amendments are to be debated in just one hour. A total of 511 of those amendments were hatched in secrecy by the government 
 and the Australian Democrats without the knowledge of the green groups or the conservation groups and without the knowledge of, or consultation with, state governments and industry groups. That is because, as Senator Lees has made quite clear, she would not trust the conservation groups. She cannot afford to let anyone understand the details of the fix that she has come to with the government.</para><para>I look at Senator Lees and know that, with the government, she is sponsoring another guillotine in the Senate. Senator Lees, you have become the Madame Defarge of the Senate. You sit there sponsoring this guillotine. All we have from you is the click of the knitting needles as the parade of tumbrels comes past. Whose head are you chopping off? You are chopping off the heads of the Wilderness Society, the Australian Conservation Foundation and Greenpeace. You are chopping off the heads of the environment constituency, industry groups and the states, and you wash your hands of it. That is the problem that we have at the moment.</para><para>Rather than acting in the way that the Democrats have traditionally, having a proper debate and a review of legislation—in the case of the environment legislation it is a legislative outrage—Senator Lees has been, and is about to be, in the final two weeks of this session, responsible for the bloody mutilation of Telstra and the bloody mutilation of the tax system, ensuring forever that we no longer have the checks and the balances that should be inherent in national environmental policy. That is the responsibility of Senator Lees, the Madame Defarge of the Senate and the Australian Democrats.</para><para>Instead of using the electoral clout, the influence that the Democrats have been blessed with, to stop this sort of carnage, what is Senator Lees doing? She is sitting in the corner of the Senate and all you hear from her is the clicking of the knitting needles as the guillotine falls. I am quite confident that Senator Lees will not be thanked for this. What she will reap is an electoral backlash.</para><para>The guillotine motion before the Senate allows virtually no debate. Literally, what the guillotine that Senator Lees and Senator Hill are sponsoring allows for is a few seconds 
 debate in this chamber on 906 amendments. This guillotine does not apply just to the environment legislation, where it is an absolute outrage, although we acknowledge that it is less outrageous in relation to the tax legislation. We have a brand new tax system being proposed by the government. The proposal that the government went to the election on has been completely up-ended by Senator Lees and the government. Senator Campbell tells us about the longest debate in Senate history. This is a brand new debate. Again, in the GST package there are two new bills and 119 new government and Democrat sponsored amendments. Government mismanagement and Democrat interference has resulted in ANTS package mark 2, mark 3 or whatever we have before us. We have just received pages and pages of amendments from the Table Office. These are indicative that the tax system in this country is going to become utterly ramshackle at the conclusion of the Senate's debate.</para><para>We say, `Let's examine the legislation properly. Let's give the Senate an opportunity for proper scrutiny of this legislation.' That principle has applied until recently, under all former Democrat leaders—but not under Madame Defarge—and it was accepted by the Australian Democrats. It is no wonder, Senator Lees, that already two of your number have ratted on you. Most of your party membership have ratted on you. And so they should, because you have sold them out. You have also sold out those Australians who voted for you.</para><para>Not only has she done that but she has also sold out more than 300,000 small businesses that hang on the amendments we have to the tax package before the Senate that could become law. Small businesses and members of the public would say that the Senate is abrogating its duty if these matters are not properly examined.</para><para>I have to say with some disappointment in relation to the Australia Democrats: have we ever witnessed a truer illustration of the old adage that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely? Because this is what has happened now. The Australian Democrats have the government over a barrel. They have 
 real political and parliamentary leverage over this government, but they are not willing to use it. They are in the closed doors fix. They are selling out constituencies that I would acknowledge over the years have been considered integral to their political interests.</para><para>They had an opportunity to say to this government, `We will give you your GST and the Democrat-government GST package, but we will give you only that package.' But they squibbed it; they sold out their own party's interest. They even sold out members of their own parliamentary party and they certainly sold out the organisational wing of their party. Senator Lees has ensured nothing other than the political demise of the Australian Democrats, as well as her own political demise. Sadly, as the Madame Defarge—as the supporter of the guillotine in the Senate on this legislation—that is precisely what she deserves.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>6045</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I find it extraordinary that the Australian Labor Party seems to think that we are in government.

Nevertheless, we recognised that Telstra was coming to a vote in this session, that the debate was probably not going to alter anyone's mind and that issue was dealt with.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Secondly, we have said from the start that we believe the tax bills should be brought to fruition before 30 June. We thought that was the government's right. We did not guarantee on which day they would come to a vote but, essentially, that is the reason we had all those extra sitting hours. But, of course, it was not the Labor Party that withdrew the tax bills. We were in committee; we were at 10 per cent the way through. It was the government that pulled the tax bills off, not us. Now they want to put a time limitation on it—what a terrible word; I should be saying `if there is an undemocratic guillotine'. What is this political correctness that we are starting to use—time management and time limitation! It is sickening. I at least would have expected the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, as a political pragmatist, to approach it and say, `This is a guillotine.' But we have got into all these other phraseologies.</para><para>I would have expected that, if we are to guillotine the tax bills, given that there are such comprehensive changes to it—and if there are not comprehensive changes to it, the Democrats have been total failures as negotiators—they themselves would have asserted that there have been massive changes to this tax bill proposed in the amendments and that there should be some time in which to consider them. However, there is some argument for a guillotine on the tax bills, provided the 
 hours allotted are reasonable. We all agree in this chamber—virtually all anyway, not everyone—that it is desirable to have these matters resolved by 30 June, one way or the other. We were always intending to keep our guarantee in that regard.</para><para>The one that is difficult to come to grips with is the environment bill. This is a bill that Senator Hill acknowledged in question time yesterday as having had a long gestation period. He said that it had been to committees, it is an important and critical bill, there have been consultations with the states, and the stakeholders have all been consulted. That is eminently sensible. The situation we now find is that in spite of all that consultation and consideration there are going to be massive and dramatic changes to the environment bill. The 560 amendments constitute almost a new bill. So none of the stakeholders have really been consulted about this. If they have, it has been in the last 16 hours, because these amendments were only released at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. What chance have the states had, for instance, to see and evaluate them and influence the states house here? What chance have most of the environment groups had to look at these amendments? What chance have the various foresters, miners and all those critical people had? They have had no chance to look at these amendments and comment on them.</para><para>This is a bill that could be held over until the spring sittings, because one thing we know is that it will have 45 certain votes in the spring sittings. It could be left to sit on the table. We could get on with the tax debate immediately and leave that one until the spring sittings. Why not? A lot of these people would like to have some input on it. If the numbers are there—as they are there today for the guillotine—and if there is time wasting, as Senator Lees alleged would occur in the spring sittings, and the bill did not come to fruition, then you can guillotine your bill through. But leave three months. Leave all the amendments sitting on the table so that we have at least got a chance of reading them. How many senators—I say through you, Madam President, to Senator Lees—are going to get the chance to read and analyse 
 those 569 amendments that were tabled at 4 o'clock yesterday? Some of us may not want to or some of us may not bother but, for those who are diligent, what real consideration can this parliament give those amendments?</para><para>Basically what I am saying is that, apart from the gormless way it was done, there is some justification for a guillotine on Telstra, there is some justification for a rolling guillotine on the tax bills so that people will be able to ration time, be able to concentrate on particular areas and get a chance to debate this raft of government amendments on the tax bill. But on the environment bill this is just impossible. There are two motives for the guillotine on the environment bill. There is the government motive. They would obviously always prefer to guillotine than have Senator Hill have to spend hours here trying to justify his amendments. He would much rather be back in his office—if I were him, so would I—doing the things involved in the normal course of events than being subjected to a cross-examination from Senators Bolkus, Brown, Margetts, et cetera. But that is actually what he is being paid to do. However, that would have only got this resolution 37-odd votes.</para><para>Why are the seven Democrats voting for this? It is absolutely obvious. Having done the deal with the government, they do not want to be pressured. They just want it over and done with. They want the agony to end. They do not want to have to justify themselves for the next three months—back to their own party members, back to the constituencies that they appeal to. They do not have the intestinal fortitude, they do not have the mental strength, to go through that process.</para><para>So we are facing a debate that will conclude at 6 o'clock today in which over 900 amendments have to be considered. We are facing a debate where 569 government amendments have to be considered by then. There is no way that those amendments can have proper scrutiny. The rest of the bill can. It has been through the processes. All of the rest of the existing bill is well known, well debated. It is simply these amendments that cannot be considered.</para><para>I am going to take the government at their word—saying that they want a reasonable time on the tax debate. I propose to moved an amendment to their guillotine. The amendment has been circulated in the chamber. I move:</para><para>Paragraph 2(a), omit "3.30 p.m. to 6.30 pm", substitute "3.30 p.m. to 10.30 pm".</para><para>We want a little more time on the tax bill, Senator Lees. That is what we are asking for. We are asking for another four hours on the tax bills in total. I am sure that will appeal to you.

It believes in generous guillotines.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What do they have to give up in order to get this extra four hours? What they have to give up is the valedictories on Thursday night. Oh, shock horror—just think, we are not going to be able to spend four hours here listening to vacuous hypocritical slimy speeches on our colleagues, when suddenly we are forgiven for all past sins. Imagine the saving in cliches. Imagine the savings in ersatz sentiment that we will make by supporting my amendment. Here is your chance. Deep down in the government, most of you want to get out of the valedictories. You can vote for my amendment. You can vote for an extra democratic four hours on the tax bills and miss all those things.</para><para>But I have more. I will not only throw in steak knives; we will allow the valedictories then to occur at 10.30 on Thursday night. Let us see who sticks around. Let us see who runs for the cars, let us see who stays to send their colleagues off in style. I have news for you, Madam President.

The subject that we are really debating in this motion is whether sufficient time has been allocated to consider the proposals that have been put before this chamber. When it comes to talking about sufficient time for important pieces of legislation that have been moved by successive governments before this chamber, the Labor Party ought to look at its own record. In this particular case, the Labor Party intend to oppose these bills. They have publicly stated that they will oppose the amendments. They have publicly stated that, regardless of any debate that takes place, they are going to oppose the proposals that are brought forward by the government and the amendments that have been agreed to by the Democrats. The Greens, Senator Brown in particular, are urging people to oppose the bills regardless of the debate.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable senator interjecting—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—Yes, he got 50 people to attend his demonstration. But he is going to oppose the bills regardless of the debate that takes place in this chamber. The Democrats and the government have come to some agreement and they are going to support the amendments agreed to, regardless of the debate that takes place in this chamber. Let us say that, particularly in relation to the tax bills, over the period of time that these matters have been before the public record there has never been more scrutiny of proposals 
 that have been put before the Australian public than has taken place over the tax bills that we are debating and that we are being asked to agree to in this place.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us have a look at Labor's record when it comes to issues and matters of importance in regard to legislation. I seem to remember that, soon after I came into this place, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton, brought forward what were considered to be the most important changes to industrial relations that had ever taken place in the history of this federation. What time did that Labor government give us to scrutinise that industrial relations legislation? Of course, back in those days, Labor controlled the committees and so they most generously said that, in order to debate and discuss and have hearings on the most important industrial legislation to come before the parliament since Federation, they would allow three days of committee hearings—one committee, three days; that is it, finished—and then it was back into the chamber with a reasonably short debate and then their legislation was passed.</para><para>Compare that with Peter Reith's industrial relations legislation that came before this parliament in 1996. What happened to that industrial relations legislation, which was then considered to be the most important legislation that came before parliament at that stage? We were forced to a roadshow circus for 18 days—18 days of scrutiny by the committee, and then back in the chamber for something like 50 hours of debate before that legislation was passed. So the Labor Party, before it starts to criticise the Liberal party or the coalition government on its attitude to important legislation and the amount of time that is made available for scrutiny of these bills, ought to look back at their own record and see just how much time they allocated when they brought their important bills in, compared with when we brought ours forward.</para><para>The tax reform bills have had scrutiny unprecedented in the history of this parliament. They have gone to four committees. I always understood when I first came to this place that the purpose of taking legislation to committees—and we had legislation at that time—was so that the public could have some 
 input, so that we could listen to the submissions of those interested parties and then, when the bills came back into the chamber, less time would be taken for debate. I have to say that in the last three years that simply has not been the case. We have had extended committee hearings, lengthy hearings—and then, when the bills have been heard in committee and have come back into this chamber, we find that we have another extended debate at the consideration in detail stage. So one wonders why on earth we ever send them out to committees if, when they come back, we then have 40 or 50 hours of debate on amendments in this place, when in fact the committee system was set up in order to alleviate the length of time that was taken in this place for debating bills.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">RAY</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>—You abused it straight off.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—I would say in response to that, Senator Ray, that you know very well that, back in the time when the committee structure was set up, in fact it did alleviate lengthy debates in the chamber, because committees did the work and, when the matter came back here, it short-circuited the lengthy debates that we continue to have here. If we want that system to work, and if we do not want it to be abused, and if we want it to reach the stage where the Australian public has a chance to have some input into the legislation that is being put before them and where amendments can be brought about simply because of that input that the public has, then we ought to make sure that that committee system works.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When we talk about the number of amendments that have been agreed to by the Democrats and the government and about the amendments that have been agreed to in relation to this environmental package, let me say that they are as a result of consultation. Senator Lees and the government have had input from all the various industry groups and bodies who actually want the original legislation changed. It is as a result of constructive negotiations with the Democrats that we have in fact reached the stage where we have those amendments in place and the Senate is ready to vote on them.</para><para>The Labor Party are not going to change their vote one iota regardless of any debate that takes place. If we thought that the extension of the debate might actually change their mind and that they would support the government's position on tax reform, I am quite sure that we would allow the debate to go longer. We know that they are intransigent. We know that regardless of what debate takes place they will not change their view on any single issue. For that reason it is only sensible we put in place strict time limits so these bills can be dealt with and so the Australian public can know with some certainty what the bills are going to contain for the next 12 months as they get themselves organised to handle the new tax system which we have proposed.</para><para>In relation to the environment, Senator Brown has been left on his own, so anything that Senator Brown might say is totally irrelevant. I understand that all of the major conservation groups in Tasmania have cast Senator Brown aside and have supported the position taken by the Australian Democrats, which is a sensible position. It is a position that we in the government have agreed with and can work for the good of Australia. Senator Brown has been cast aside. He will cut a very lone figure after June 30 when he comes up with some of the more ratbag ideas that he has been used to bringing up in this place. I am pleased that we have a sensible environmental package that can be passed today with the support of the Democrats. The people who have made representations to them have certainly been taken into account. The people whom Senator Brown thinks he represents no longer exist so he can get up and say all he likes about this package.</para><para>I conclude by saying that no matter what time we take in debate of these issues it will not make one difference to any vote that takes place here today. The arguments will not be listened to on either side, so we ought to proceed and make sure these bills can be put in place for the good of the Australian community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>6051</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That about sums up the government's position: the arguments will not be listened to. 
 It also sums up the position of the Liberal lap-warming Democrats, half of whom have fled the chamber already. Let me put on the record that, of the seven Democrats who signed this obsequious letter in defence of the government's appalling environment position, we do not at the moment have Senator Bourne in the chamber; Senator Woodley is not here; Senator Murray from Western Australia has fled the chamber; and Deputy Leader Natasha Stott Despoja is nowhere to be seen. That is part of the story. I note that Senator Faulkner referred to Senator Lees as Madame Defarge with the knitting needles clicking as the tumbrel rolls in.</para></talk.start><para>Let me carry that analogy further: it is the environment of Australia in that tumbrel. It is the environment of Australia—as well as this legislation—that is facing the guillotine. It is the great forests of Australia, the great indigenous lands of Australia, the fisheries of Australia and the plains of Australia that are facing the chop in this legislation.</para><para>I want, firstly, to correct a lie which hangs in the air in this chamber and which comes out of the press release put out by the Democrats. They said they had to have this debate, they had to cave in to the government and they had to jump into the Howard lap to crucify the environment because, if they did not, the Independents would and that is why they have to guillotine this debate today. But, Madam President, you will be aware that last night a motion was brought before this House by Senator Margetts which said, `Let this bill wait until August.' You will know that in August the numbers will be different here and the Democrats will have the complete balance of power for government legislation.</para><para>Senator Harradine voted for that motion. Senator Colston was not in the chamber. The Democrats had the numbers to get that motion through, to hold this across to August to give them total power to get through the things that they failed to get at the Howard polished table in secret this last week. But what did the Democrats do? They are so comfortable warming the Liberal lap that they sat this side and denied themselves that opportunity because they cannot take that responsibility. They sold out on the forests. Remember, they 
 went to that table last week saying, `We have got to have global warming in this legislation,' and they could have had that had they supported that motion of Senator Margetts last night but they gave it the thumbs down.

We have the Democrats claiming that this legislation is an improvement because the Minister for the Environment and Heritage now has the role of making decisions. What a joke. Anyone who has been involved in government and anyone with a day's experience in this place would understand that there is no such thing as unfettered ministerial discretion. The systems of cabinet and the systems of government are such that a minister consults with other ministers. At the end of the day, matters go to cabinet. For Senator Lees to be saying on radio this morning and here today that this is a major improvement because from now on Senator Hill will make huge decisions in respect of mining, in respect of logging and in respect of protecting the environment is basically a hoax on her supporters and on the Australian public. There is nothing further from the truth.</para></talk.start><para>What this legislation does is to actually reduce the transparency of the decision making process. At least under the existing legislation there is transparency and there is publication of decisions and recommenda 
 tions. That will go. The system adopted by the Australian Democrats and pushed by the government will mean no transparency. It will mean less accountability. It will still mean a minister consulting and being, in a sense, influenced by cabinet, but we will not have the same degree of transparency and, consequently, accountability because of the grubby little deal that the Democrats have entered into.

It would be a joke to try to go through them all. The reason they have done this is to save their own skins. We are all asking why. I will tell you what has happened. The government has given them an assurance that they will not change the voting system for the Senate. That is what is behind this. There is no core concern for the environment, no core concern for biodiversity and no core concern for nuclear actions. There is no core concern for anything that they have pretended to be concerned about for such a long time. When it came to the crunch, when they sat down with the government across the table, maybe over a cup of tea, the assurance was given to the Democrats that the government would not change the voting procedures.</para></talk.start></continue><para>To save their own skins, they are prepared to jeopardise the skins of so many of their constituents. This is what this is all about. For what other reason would they be rejecting the sorts of amendments that we are putting up this morning? These are the sorts of amendments that will ensure that a federal minister cannot write off any scrutiny or any assessment through the mechanisms of bilateral 
 agreements, declarations or conservation agreements.</para><para>These are the things that Senator Allison has railed against for so long, yet these are the things that she now embraces. These are mechanisms to avoid national scrutiny. She said, `We've got six matters of national environmental significance,' but she knows, and Senator Lees should know—if she does not know, she is incompetent; if she does know, then she is guilty of misleading the public, who do know—that these matters of national environmental significance can also be cascaded through to the states. They also know that there is no degree of public accountability and participation that is adequate enough, because they are the sorts of amendments that they are rejecting this morning.</para><para>They are rejecting amendments that would introduce a pretty wide range, as opposed to their limited range, of criminal offences. They are rejecting amendments about the protection of critical habitat. They are rejecting amendments that would protect against expansion of the nuclear industry. They say, `We've got an amendment,' but the amendment they have does very little to protect against new generations of industry development in the nuclear industry in Australia.</para><para>They are rejecting these amendments either through incompetence or deliberate action. They are rejecting in this batch of amendments a trigger for greenhouse actions. We have circulated one; we are moving one. It is a trigger that has been on the table with the minister for quite some time now. Greenhouse actions are defined in our amendment—the trigger is there. Let us spend some time looking at it. We do not maintain that it is perfect. We do maintain, however, that it is within the capacity of this parliament—and we have had some time to do it—to actually define a greenhouse trigger. But no, this trigger has been rejected by the Australian Democrats as part of the deal to save their own skins. Indigenous people have also been sacrificed in that respect. The Democrats are embracing a concept where, by declaration, a Commonwealth minister can basically exempt Commonwealth land or Commonwealth agencies from the operations of environmental 
 assessment and scrutiny. They are adopting a system where, through bilaterals, this same thing can happen. They say that the bilateral arrangement has been refined. I will get to that in a minute.</para><para>They are rejecting proposals for public participation. As I said earlier, they are rejecting proposals to extend nuclear actions to include the establishment or significant modification of nuclear fuel fabrication plants, nuclear reactors and power plants, nuclear storage facilities and enrichment plants. They are rejecting proposals that would ensure that only on the grounds of the security of the Commonwealth, as opposed to this broad, ever-blossoming exemption clause of commercial-in-confidence, will public accountability be excluded. They are rejecting amendments that would ensure that ESD principles are firmly entrenched. They are rejecting amendments to protect world heritage properties. In respect of the Northern Territory there is an agreement, and there is an agreement with respect to bilaterals, but this legislation is nowhere near the benchmark provided for in the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act in so many matters. There are some incremental improvements, but this is not as good.</para><para>This deal adopted by the Australian Democrats lets the cause of the environment down enormously. One only has to look at the leading lawyers in this country and their views to come to that conclusion. Associate Professor Rob Fowler, the Director of the Australian Centre for Environmental Law at the Adelaide University, had to work overnight like the rest of us to examine over 500 government amendments. His view is that the Democrats are wrong and misleading on key provisions of this legislation. He is right. It does not take a Rhodes scholar to work out that they have sold out.

They are adopting a system that is flawed, a system that will give us duplication and a system that will basically accredit not just state laws but laws made under state laws. It will accredit local government authorities. We are moving to a system whereby national responsibility can be divested to the Shire Council of Hervey Bay. If sand mining on Fraser Island is allowed under a management plan accepted in this place, warm and fuzzy as it might appear, then this parliament writes off its powers to intervene and protect against that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I could talk all day about this, but I know Senator Brown and Senator Margetts want to

In actual fact he is quite wrong. This is a major reform of Australia's environmental laws that has been recognised by academics, including the one to which he referred, as long overdue. I do not think I have come across anyone who has objectively and carefully looked at Australia's environmental laws at the Commonwealth level and not found that they are significantly wanting. They are really outdated. They are not in fact immediately triggered by environmental issues at all; they are triggered by actions that might be taken by the Commonwealth government that have no direct relationship to environmental matters at all.</para><para>This is the point that I was seeking to make last night: it makes no difference to environmental consequence if the funding of a particular project is funding from overseas that requires a FIRB approval, as opposed to funding internally. It is a nonsense to now say that the Commonwealth should have a responsibility only where it related to the overseas funding and not where it related to the domestic funding. The test, of course, for the 
 Commonwealth—and for Commonwealth intervention—should be whether it concerns a matter of national environmental significance. It seemed to the government—and it actually seemed to others before we came to government—that that was the logical way in which to progress a reform of environment laws in this country. This is bearing in mind that, in the federal system in which we operate, what makes sense is to define what should be the Commonwealth responsibility and, as a consequence of that, to make it clear what remains a state responsibility—from an assessment point of view and also from the point of view of responsibility—and then to put in place procedures that allow for an interrelationship of the two to achieve a better national outcome.</para><para>The Labor Party was aware—as I know when I came to government—of these issues and of these representations from the type of academic to which Senator Bolkus has referred. But in their 13 years in government unfortunately they found it too hard, like so many other things, such as the new taxation system that we are going to be debating for the remainder of this week. It remained in the too-hard basket, therefore it did not ever get to the chamber. We acknowledged that the reform was long overdue and that we should tackle it, even though it was complex and politically difficult. We are well aware that there are a range of stakeholders in these debates—industry being one, obviously the states being another, conservation groups another, indigenous groups yet another—and often it is not easy to find a formula that can meet the satisfaction of all.</para><para>Notwithstanding that political difficulty, we decided the time had come and that we should tackle it. We said that the logical starting point was to seek to negotiate with the states on where that dividing line should be between Commonwealth responsibility and state responsibility so that it is much more meaningful to the community than what currently exists. Thus we sought to define—and I mention this in particular because this is part of the clauses that we are debating, between chapters 2 and 4—matters of national environmental significance, and there has 
 been considerable debate as to where that line should have been drawn.</para><para>We have heard, in the early parts of this debate, the Labor Party list a whole range of other issues that they say should have been included as primary Commonwealth responsibility—for example, land clearing. But land clearing was not included because in our view the primary responsibility on issues of natural resource management, such as land clearing, does and should remain with the states. That does not mean that there is not a national interest, and that does not mean that the Commonwealth will not take an active interest in the matter. In fact, as you would know, Madam Temporary Chairman, this government is investing substantial sums of taxpayers' money to revegetate Australia and to protect remnant bushland. This is pursuant to agreements that have been reached between the Commonwealth and the states whereby the states have agreed that they will ensure that action is not taken within their jurisdiction that threatens endangered species or ecological communities and also that they will work towards a reduction of overall land clearing in this country.</para><para>The fact that there is still too much land clearing and that overclearing has caused very significant environmental damage—in particular its linkage to dryland salinity and the like—is not in dispute, and the response must therefore be partnership between the Commonwealth government, the state government and the community. But the primary responsibility in terms of the regulatory response for land clearing must be that of the states: some states have introduced appropriate regulations as a safety net, and some states are still yet to do that. We did not see that the Commonwealth should, in effect, take over that primary role of the states in that regard; the pressure should remain on the states to make sound decisions and the role of Commonwealth should be to support the states and, through them, the community to achieve better outcomes in that very important environmental area.</para><para>So that is an example of an issue that is of national importance, but we have not defined it as a matter of national environmental 
 significance in terms of a Commonwealth trigger. By a `trigger', I mean where the Commonwealth is primarily responsible for assessment and approval of an action that might have a detrimental consequence upon that matter of national environmental significance. Our definitions at this stage are more limited than that but they are very significant. I think the most significant one of all is in fact that of endangered species, because it demonstrates a change of attitude by the Australian community. There was a time when endangered species were seen as primarily the responsibility of the states. There is a species in South Australia on the verge of extinction and there is no doubt in my mind at all now that all Australians regard that as a matter of concern to them; a matter in which they expect the involvement of their Commonwealth or national government. We have listed matters of endangered species as a matter of national environmental significance, so an action that might have a detrimental effect upon such a species would require assessment and approval at the Commonwealth level.</para><para>That takes us to the other important part of these chapters. Whilst we acknowledge that the Commonwealth should take primary responsibility for these areas of national environmental significance, such as endangered species, world heritage, Ramsar internationally listed wetlands and the like, it is also not always appropriate for the Commonwealth to carry out the assessment process itself. This is because the states are physically closer to the action for which the consent is being sought. They have the bureaucracies on the ground that are often better able to carry out this work than the Commonwealth. Therefore, it seems to us, again in a system where we have a cooperative relationship between the different tiers of government, that there will be circumstances when it will be better for the state to carry out an assessment process for the Commonwealth. It might surprise some in the chamber to learn that that actually occurs now, but it occurs on an ad hoc basis.</para><para>What we are more interested in is putting in a process that can give the public confidence that, when the state is carrying out that 
 assessment process for the Commonwealth, it is carrying it out according to best contemporary practice. So we have developed this concept of bilateral agreements between the Commonwealth and the states that will allow the states, in certain circumstances, to assess for the Commonwealth the consequences of a particular action and, in even more limited circumstances—but there is no surprise in that because we have said it to the states all along—to even make an approval for the Commonwealth, pursuant to bilateral agreements.</para><para>There was concern—and I concede that concern—by some that this might mean, in practice, a passing of responsibility from the Commonwealth to the states. A number of the amendments that we have before us in these parts that we are debating today are to ensure that the responsibility of the Commonwealth is not passed while we pass the administrative role. It was never our intention that that responsibility pass but, nevertheless, we accepted that the community has a right to be confident beyond our assertions to that fact. We are building in with these amendments a number of processes of public participation, greater transparency and, in certain limited instances, even the capacity to disallow by this body.</para><para>On the issue which is more likely to happen in practice—the state carrying out an assessment for the Commonwealth—it may not be that that bilateral agreement will be through regulation that will set out the benchmarks, although that will be our goal and we will be heading down that path forthwith upon the passage of this bill. But if it is impossible for us to get the agreement of the chamber to that bilateral agreement—in other words, if it were disallowed—we would still be able to proceed. We are confident that we can get an agreement of best practice in relation to assessments that can be put in the form of regulation and that will not be disallowed. But we have the two fall backs, and I think this is important to industry. Those fall backs are that we can proceed under the state agreement, if we have made our best efforts, and we always have the alternative of being able to carry out the assessment ourselves.</para><para>In relation to approvals, which are of even greater concern to some conservation groups, as I said, there are further restrictions. That is not surprising, because when the responsibility is passed to the Commonwealth by legislation it would be an unusual experience indeed for a Commonwealth minister to say that the state minister can make the decision—that is, the decision rather than the process—for the Commonwealth minister. We have demonstrated, particularly in relation to Shark Bay, that it is possible under management agreements that have been approved by the Commonwealth minister, that meet the best contemporary standards, that within such limited circumstances that responsibility can be passed. But we have said, as an extra safeguard, that that will be disallowable in this place. Of course, if it is disallowed, although I do not think it will be, it will revert to the Commonwealth responsibility. So industry does not miss out in that it is not delayed, and also the system will work.</para><para>Why do I say that this will be unnecessary? It is really because what we are planning in the development of the bilateral agreements is a transparent process. We want the involvement of the community in that process; we want the involvement of parliamentary parties. That is why we sought to negotiate these amendments with the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens, but neither were interested. If after the passage of this bill they do want to be involved—I hope the Australian Democrats will also be involved in the development of these bilaterals—to ensure that we are adopting best international practice, we would be very pleased to engage their participation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>6061</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are left with two minutes for a debate on the most comprehensive environmental matters while the Australian Democrats sat mute and allowed the minister to give a long dissertation.

The government has taken the view that the process of regional forest agreements is outside of this legislation because they have been in themselves a most comprehensive process—I think one can fairly say the most comprehensive assessment of Australian forests in our national history. The government chose to take that course of action—which, I concede, was to adopt a national strategy that had been negotiated between the previous Labor government and the states—because it, for the first time, set out a framework within which there could be some certainty for forest industries but with a background of protecting a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system and also to ensure that the forestry that was to take place in relation to native forests, on the balance—that is, that which is outside the comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system—had to be conducted in both an ecologically and economically sustainable way.</para></talk.start><para>The precedent of that structure is regarded as world best practice. I can recall two years ago, for example, attending a CSD meeting in 
 New York when WWF International held up the Australian precedent as the example that they would like to be achieved globally, because the reserve system was of course of a higher composition than the recommendations that they were putting down internationally. Also just as important is to ensure that the forest that is to be harvested is harvested, as I said, not only in an economic way—which is what has been considered in the past—but also in an ecologically sustainable way.</para><para>We went about the task of conducting those assessments. I would be the first to acknowledge just how difficult that process has been. Nevertheless, those RFAs that have been agreed—the RFA for Tasmania, the RFA in Western Australia and two RFAs in Victoria, in Central Highlands and East Gippsland—I think have achieved the goals that Labor actually had set down for us in the National Forest Strategy. I am pleased to say that we are very close to completion of the agreement for the Eden region in New South Wales. We are close to another agreement in Victoria. We are finally making some progress on the balance of regions in New South Wales and with regard to the Queensland proposal. Whilst it has been politically difficult and it has been difficult in practice to implement, we are achieving those goals.</para><para>After such a comprehensive assessment as that it makes no sense, to the government in any event, to then come back through this legislation and seek to achieve another path for assessment. That is why we have chosen to take the course of action of leaving the RFAs outside of the bill as such. I can see that there are others in the chamber who would argue that that is not the best course of action to have taken. We have a difference of view in this particular matter, but that is the basis on which we have taken this action.</para><para>I make the point because I want to demonstrate, in case it is misrepresented by some, such as Senator Brown, as an attempt to avoid the responsibility for assessment and for making proper decisions in relation to natural forests, that it is quite the contrary. It is in recognition that there has been a parallel process of a comprehensive nature to carry 
 out those assessments and to achieve the best possible outcomes both environmentally and economically. That is the reason we have moved in this direction.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>6104</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Here we get to the heart of this terrible business. The minister has just tried to say that the forests are outside of this legislation. If any honourable senators turn to pages 40 and 41, they will see that division 4 is given over to forestry operations. I want you to remember, Chair, throughout my delivery in the next 15 minutes, that everything I refer to here has changed since last week. Last week the Democrats were the defenders of the environment and the forests. Now they have become not only part of the problem but also the pivotal vote in cementing into place the destruction of forests around this country for the next 20 years.</para></talk.start><para>I read earlier from a letter from world noted scientist Dr Aila Keto of the Australian Rainforest Conservation Society, who is also representing another dozen conservation groups in Queensland. In this heartfelt letter that she sent to Senator Lees yesterday, the fourth paragraph reads:</para><para>The legislation will entrench Regional Forest Agreements, locking in ongoing threats that have put so many forests and their wildlife on the brink of extinction, and it will be nearly impossible or too late to do anything about it for the next 20 years.</para><para>In that 20 years, under this Democrat approved process, more than one million hectares of Australia's wild forests, ancient ecosystems and wildlife—the bird life, the possums, the bats, the insects, and the fish and the platypuses in the rivers draining from those places—will be threatened with extinction because of this dark Democrat deed being done today. This legislation would not be going through—this imprimatur of the Democrats on the regional forest agreements, as laid out in this legislation—except for their going to the Howard table last week to gain a little bit of power and, in the process, as entry to that table, dropping all of their past principles. Let me read from section 39 on page 40:</para><para>The purpose of this Subdivision— 
</para><para>Chair, you will understand if I interpret this now by saying that it is the purpose of this now Democrat approved subdivision—</para><para>is to ensure that an approval—</para><para>that is, a ministerial approval before something dastardly is done to the environment—</para><para>under Part 9 is not required for forestry operations in a region for which—</para><para>a regional forest agreement is in place. What we have here, with the approval of the Democrats, is the minister washing his hands, for 20 years at a national level, of responsibility for the great forests of Western Australia; the wild forests and their wildlife in Victoria and New South Wales; the forests of south-east Queensland; and the forests of world heritage value in such places as the Sticks, Huon, Weld and Picton valleys in Tasmania, the Great Western Tiers, the Tarkine, the North-East and the Tasman Peninsula, just to name some of them.</para><para>Democrat approved chainsaws are now moving in on these forests, these ecosystems and this wildlife. When the Democrat approved chainsaws have gone in and felled the forests which the woodchippers want to take—and they are taking 90 per cent of the trees; Senator Murphy might have something to say about what an economic and resource abuse that is—and have sent those trees through the paper mills of Kyoto and Tokyo to the rubbish dumps of the Northern Hemisphere, now approved by the Democrats, the next thing is that the incendiaries will move in.</para><para>We have before this Senate at the moment a change in civil aviation regulations to reduce the qualifications required for those pilots who take helicopters or light planes over these ancient forests—once they have been felled and the woodchippers have taken out what they want—and drop thousands of incendiaries to create a firestorm. This is happening at the end of every season in Tasmania. Thousands of hectares of these ancient forests have been felled—rainforests included. Indeed, the Democrat purpose here has become, through those incendiaries, to kill the cotyledons—the little growth opportunities for new rainforest trees—the root systems and any living fur, feather or flower left in this 
 recently ancient ecosystem so that genetically manipulated eucalypts, fast growing for the woodchippers' purposes, will replace them. That is what the Democrats are giving their approval to.</para><para>The Democrats have now, through their imprimatur on this legislation, approved the bringing in of 1080 to these wild forests to be sprinkled through the fire holocaust area. Any marsupials—wallabies, potoroos or possums—which hop in from adjacent forests to forage on these genetically manipulated little eucalypt seedlings will be poisoned—murdered by this Democrat action. Senator Bartlett from Queensland, who has been something of an advocate for Animal Liberation but is now a 1080 poisoner, is going to get up here in a minute and tell us that the Democrats have an amendment which they expect the Labor Party and the Greens to join with them in putting through here that will overturn this particular part of the legislation. But it is utter deception, and it is knowing deception, by the Democrats and they will not get away with it.</para><para>Let me explain. They went to the table and said to the government, `We want different provisions for the forests. We don't want to be seen as responsible for the 20 years of destruction that Dr Aila Keto has referred to as coming down the line for the forests, with no federal powers to stop it.' This legislation removes all federal powers to stop it. But the government said no. These Democrat puppies, these poodles of Liberal politics, put their tails between their legs and accepted that. But they thought, `We must greenwash. Senator Hill greenwashes all the time and it seems successful. We'll try it. We'll bring in an amendment here which we will get the numbers for if the Independents agree,' knowing that it has no effect. That amendment is not going to go through the House of Representatives, and they know it.</para><para>What the Democrats are doing here is giving their stamp of approval to the destruction of the forests for the next 20 years. I cannot accept this pathetic little effort to try to cover up their tracks and deceive their membership, conservationists or anybody else out there—and 87 per cent of people, according to recent <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> polls, do not 
 want this Democrat destruction of the forests. I cannot accept their little effort to try to deceive people into thinking that they really do care.</para><para>Every tree in those forests that dies, every owl's nesting place, every possum, every endangered species—like the great Tasmanian wedgetail, which is bigger than the mainland species, or the white goshawk, which is down to 200 breeding pairs, as I told the Senate two days ago—is now pushed closer to extinction because of Senator Allison, who laughs over there in her seat; because of Senator Bartlett; because of Senator Stott Despoja, who stayed absent from this debate but put her signature on the bottom of this death warrant for forests; because of Senator Lees; because of Senator Murray from Western Australia; and because of Senator Woodley from Queensland.

That is what the Democrats have given their seal of approval to in this very anti-environmental measure.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>6107</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A number of times during that last contribution—if you can call it that—there were frequent comments as to the laughter coming from the Democrats benches. I guess it is a bit hard not to laugh at such a joke, and it is a bit of a shame that someone that did have such credibility on environmental issues in the past has allowed himself to be reduced to that. As I said yesterday, it seems that it can happen occasionally in politics—people have been in it for so long that they forget what they are in it for. I guess that, as Senator Brown has been a politician for around 18 years or so, obviously he now sees his role as a politician as trying to out-compete people like Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray with vitriol, abuse and gross distortions. If that is the way that he wants to perform his role, that is fine. But it is a bit of a shame 
 that someone who does have the opportunity to—and is seen as someone who previously was able to—put forward arguments on behalf of the environment is willing to sacrifice credibility for the sake of what he obviously sees as nothing more than a political opportunity to bash the Democrats.</para></talk.start><para>That, I suppose, demonstrates how much, sadly, he has just simply become a politician that is interested in nothing else but ignoring what he was originally there for—to try and protect the environment—and has simply turned into someone that is willing to seize a political opportunity to attack other political parties that he sees as his opponents. In doing so of course—as highlighted throughout his previous contribution—he is quite willing to misrepresent the facts, distort the facts and completely ignore the facts for the basis of what he sees as his own political campaign. He has obviously chosen to take on that role, and that is a shame, from my point of view, because I would rather see as many credible voices as possible in the parliament promoting and trying to save the environment. It is a bit of an unfortunate situation that he has chosen to ignore that role.</para><para>I would make a plea to the conservation groups who work so hard for so little recognition in such a dedicated manner throughout the country to think carefully about this issue. There are clearly differences of opinion amongst conservation groups at the moment. Some of them are still reacting to the significant concerns that the Democrats identified, in conjunction with them during the committee process, with the original bill and have not yet been able to recognise that what the Democrats have achieved here is a major advance for the environment. If they wish to simply take a role of attacking the legislation as a whole and trying to knock off those advances, whether they like to or not they will be associating themselves with the sort of nonsense that Senator Brown is willing to go on with—that, somehow or other, the Democrats are responsible for clear-felling Tasmanian forests.</para><para>Of course, for every mention of the word  `Democrats' in his previous contribution—how we have now got our hands on the 
 chainsaw and all of that sort of nonsense—you could go through that speech, cross out `Democrats' and put in `Tasmanian Conservation Trust', who have approved the amendments that the Democrats have managed to gain to this legislation as a significant advance for the environment. So he may as well be criticising the Tasmanian Conservation Trust—and all of those people in the environment movement who have praised this agreement—as equally having their hands on the chainsaws and as equally gleefully staffing the bulldozers.</para><para>If he wants to try and divide the environment movement that he as a person has done so much to build up in the past, it is a bit sad. He has now got to a stage where he is willing to use his position as a politician to try and divide and weaken the environment movement that previously he has contributed so much to. That is a shame, but the real problem is in relation to an issue for the environment groups, and I would urge them to consider that. Certainly, as Democrats we have no problem with them calling it as they see it. I know that some of those who have concerns with this amended legislation are doing so. They are going through it and are willing to call it as they see it—as they understand it—as they try to avoid some of the absurd statements that Senator Brown makes. But they do need to be careful that their credibility as environmental advocates is not tarnished if they allow themselves to be associated with such nonsense. It is a shame that for political purposes that sort of risk and that sort of threat is being put to the environment movement.</para><para>The issue that we are debating at the moment concerns forests. It is one of the areas where the Democrats, as much as anybody else, have highlighted that there is a failing in this bill. It is an issue on which the Democrats, as much as anybody else, have pledged to continue to fight to protect our forests. But the obvious fact, which has been confirmed by Senator Brown's speech, is that the destruction to the forests is happening now—it is happening now under existing laws—and this parliament is powerless to do anything about it. What we are doing in this legislation 
 in many areas is providing opportunities, for the first time, for the parliament to do something about it. Senator Brown wants to prevent that opportunity and that extra avenue of activity from being able to occur. The Democrats will not ignore the advances that have been achieved in so many areas in protecting the environment through this overall set of amendments simply because we will not be able to ensure that the forests are protected. But we will continue to try and do that. As indicated, we will be moving amendments to put forests back into the bill and to include forests as a trigger.</para><para>One of the useful aspects of this debate has been that it has served to rekindle the interests of the Australian Labor Party in the environment. Many Labor Party members who were in the chamber earlier today—not so many are in here now—were suddenly playing the role of being major supporters of the environment. Given that there has been such a lack of any policy position from the Labor Party on the environment since the last election, hopefully this will serve as an opportunity for them to develop a policy on the environment and to put forward indications about what they would do if they were in government. This debate gives them a chance to indicate their policy and to give public statements on how they would protect the environment if they were in government. They have spoken previously about greenhouse. This debate gives them a chance to get their state Labor colleagues in Queensland to come out and say, `We will support greenhouse being put in place as an environment trigger.' The Democrats would welcome them on board because it would give us an opportunity to put that into the legislation, adding to the other gains that have already been made in this area.</para><para>As I have said previously, the Democrats do not say that the bill is perfect. As amended, we see it as a significant advance. It is equally important that we highlight the gaps that still exist. The issue of forests is one of those gaps that still exist and where improvements desperately need to be made. Attempts are being made to put around a big fabrication that the inability to address that issue some 
 how leads us to a situation where the forests have even less protection than they have now. That is false. There are any number of indications and explanations that you could give to outline why so many aspects of this legislation are an improvement, but this was probably summarised quite well by Stephen Lunn in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> with the simple headline, `New laws an improvement, but major concerns remain'. That would just about be an assessment of the Democrats' view: this legislation is a significant improvement, but we still have major concerns that we will continue to work on.</para><para>The initial comment by Stephen Lunn, leading into his article, was, `The system was broke and needed fixing.' There is still some fixing work to be done, but at least we have a vehicle that will provide us with a better opportunity to make further advances in those areas where there are still significant concerns. This aspect of the legislation that we are debating at the moment deals with the issue of forests. It is an area where the Democrats will be moving amendments to take out the exemption clauses for forests in the bill. I have not seen any amendments put forward by the Labor Party in that regard but, given their new-found concern for the environment, I am sure they will be supporting us in our amendments.</para><para>It is equally important, when looking at the whole issue of how we address the legislation and the issue of forests in future, to look at how we can best ensure that mechanisms are in place and that we have a legislative vehicle to make further improvements. This forests section that we are dealing with is a significant problem and it needs to be removed from the bill, because our forests are being destroyed. That is something that is recognised by all conservation groups, including all of those that have supported the amendments and the improvements that the Democrats have managed to achieve.</para><para>We have had a lot of involvement through the committee process with conservation groups in the process of developing our amendments. Again, we have heard a lot today about the lack of ability to examine issues because of the need to ensure that these 
 achievements are passed by the parliament before it rises. However, this bill has been subject to a significant number of committee hearings over a long period and the concerns addressed in the amendments that the Democrats have gained support for are based on all of the input from conservation and indigenous groups during the inquiry.</para><para>Despite all the noise from Senator Brown, when we look at what he does in his role as a parliamentarian to try to advance the environment, and when we ask how many times he turned up to any of the committee hearings on the environment legislation to hear what the concerns of environment groups were, to ask questions and to try to put the government on the spot about what it was doing, the answer is zero. Senator Brown is quite able to come in here, be the politician and see how he can compete with Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray in the abuse stakes but, when it comes to doing anything other than abusing the Democrats and significant proportions of the environment movement throughout Australia, there is nothing else there; there is nothing else to fall back on.</para><para>Let us actually look at what has been achieved by Senator Brown in his role in the Senate on environment issues and at how many amendments he has actually had passed in respect of environment legislation in his time here. Having examined his record on improving things for the environment, I can say that he has had one amendment passed in respect of environment legislation, back in 1997. All seven disallowance motions he has moved have been negatived, the urgency motion has been negatived, and the two references to committees have been negatived. His sole contribution, in terms of a concrete outcome, has been one amendment. Obviously, he makes frequent contributions in terms of hurling abuse at the Democrats, trying to attack the Democrats for political purposes and trying to now split the environment movement to get them onside as an attack weapon against the Democrats for his own political purpose.</para><para>I guess we can look at how successful he has been in that regard as well. The other day he was calling on myself and Senator Stott 
 Despoja—as everybody knows, we have indicated our unwillingness to support the tax legislation—and saying, `You disagree with this legislation; you should quit the party if you are serious.' I suppose that shows the obvious consequence of that: if every time you disagreed with other people and your colleagues you split the party, you would end up with a pretty small party pretty quickly. Perhaps that is why Senator Brown is in a party of one, and perhaps why he has achieved only one amendment in his time here.</para><para>We are quite willing to work through our differences, and I hope the conservation movement are willing and able to work through their differences constructively. We certainly look forward to working with them in an ongoing fashion constructively in lots of the opportunities that have been gained through passing this legislation as amended. We are quite happy to hear their concerns and to take their criticisms about the areas that still need work, and we will do that constructively. If we have concerns or disagreements about their assessments, we will discuss that with them. That is the measure of the Democrats' work and the approach we are going to take, and we are going to keep doing that because we are here to get gains for the environment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>6110</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to make a few comments in respect of both what Senator Bartlett has said and this part of the proceedings. It is quite understandable that Senator Bartlett would take the position he has taken. It is basically a very pathetic response to the arguments put forward by the opposition and the Greens this morning. But Senator Bartlett is basically, I think, working on the basis of ignorance. He comes in here and tries to pull on this stunt and in doing so tries to argue that the Democrats still have a compelling conviction and commitment to environmental issues. As part of that, he says that they have achieved improvements.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Bartlett, you can quote any journalist you want, but you have had direct advice this morning from Associate Professor Robert Fowler, Director of the Australian Centre for 
 Environmental Law, and he has put it to you that your deal does not deliver; your deal does not enhance protection. In fact, he put this to you:</para><para>I reluctantly conclude that the amended bill is still inferior to the existing scheme of adhockery triggers for Commonwealth assessment and approval in relation to environmental matters.</para><para>He has asked you to reconsider this particular aspect of the bill. This is a person who has been a guru to the green movement and to the Democrats. This is a person whom Senator Allison praised lavishly in hearings, and he has put direct to you that you have failed and that the pretence you are putting to the Senate and to the Australian public is a fraud. You do not understand constitutional law, Senator Bartlett. If you did understand constitutional law, you would have acknowledged that over 20 years from 1970—30 years—because of the environment movement, because of Labor in government, because of activities of people like Senator Brown and Senator Margetts, we have actually enhanced the scope for Commonwealth interest, activity and legislative capacity.</para><para>Those cases that were fought through Tasmania and through Queensland have given the Commonwealth an enhanced role and capacity to act in respect of the environment. It is that law that you are now unwinding. It is that law that you are winding back. You have failed, Senator Bartlett, and you cannot run away from that. Unfortunately for the environment, for the whole morning the record will show that, while the debate has raged on in this place, the Democrats have sat there like dummies in a sideshow, like those clowns that you see with heads moving, nothing coming out of them—absolutely nothing of any relevance. That has been your role now and that, I must say, has been your role in terms of negotiating outcomes.</para><para>You come here now and say, `Well, we would have considered a greenhouse trigger.' You had the chance to vote for one. You sat there compliantly while Senator Hill refused us leave to move it. There was a greenhouse trigger moved this morning. I sought leave to move it separately to the rest. Where was your voice, Senator Bartlett? Where was 
 Senator Allison? Where was Senator Lees? Nowhere to be heard. Now, having sold out on the constitutional basis for Commonwealth action, having sold out on greenhouse triggers, what do you do? You come in here and move a stunt.</para><para>Why wasn't this issue—if you are so committed to it—a core issue in your discussions with Senator Hill? Why do you raise it now as an afterthought? You know full well that the only way you could have organised delivery on this, that you could have delivered anything on this, was to have put it on the table with the government. The numbers in this place are not sufficient to deliver.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—They wimped.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—Of course they wimped.

Senator Hill can walk away with his legislation. He has set up a couple of committees and a couple of processes—he is happy. That is all he has had to give, a bit of embroidery.

I am suggesting they were conned. So you come in here and raise this as an afterthought. As I say, if it is a fundamental issue, you should have organised an outcome with the government. Why not recognise that the numbers are not in this place sufficient to force this on the government? Now you try and cover up your sell-out. That is all this is about: `let us try a bit of fluff in the air and let us see if we can divert people's attention and let us see if, through that, we can put the heat on Senator Brown and on the Labor Party and so on.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>But just think of what you are doing. Firstly, you are imposing a guillotine on this debate. Secondly, you know that the only way 
 it could have got up was through the government. But by imposing the guillotine on this bill, do you know what you are doing? You are ensuring that there is time for the RFA legislation to be debated in this place and to go through. That is the direct result of your complicity in the most undemocratic manoeuvre taken in this place for the 18 years that I have been here. You will ensure, through your complicity in the guillotine, that we will get RFA legislation. It does not matter what you do; it does not matter what we or the Democrats do.</para><para>We have got amendments, and the amendments that we will move to the RFA legislation represent an advance on what you have agreed to in this legislation. You have signed up to this bill—all seven of you. You have signed up to a regime that we are still trying to improve and which we will move amendments to improve, in terms of linking it to national forest policy, in terms of tighter definitions and in terms of accountability in this place. Where were those amendments in your discussions with the government? They were nowhere to be seen.</para><para>So do not come in here now, at the end of this debate, having sold out, having signed up, having not got anything out of the process with Senator Hill on the forests, and say to the world, `We're greener than the Greens and we're better than the Labor Party.' You were probably a kid when the Labor Party was pursuing constitutional cases in the High Court to expand Commonwealth power. When Senator Hill, amongst others, was out there belting the cause for states rights, promoting and protecting Joh Bjelke-Petersen whenever he wanted to use a bulldozer to go through anything, we had those debates in here. We had those attacks on the then Attorney-General, Senator Evans. We actually fought the hard fight. We do know about environmental issues, Senator Bartlett, but we also know about the complexity of them. We are not conned like kids in a creche in respect of this, as you have been.</para><para>You should lift your standard. In lifting your standard, could I give you a bit of advice: it does you no service to go out there and say of the peak environmental movement, 
 `We can't trust them,' as your leader said this morning. They cannot trust you, and with good cause. You reinforce that distrust by coming in here after the event, facilitating debate, facilitating the bringing on of the RFA legislation, having achieved absolutely nothing. We will try to enhance the government's position, but we will do that in the RFA legislation. We will not fall for your stunt here.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>6112</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The issue that we are dealing with here is in relation to forests. The reason that we are dealing with it is because it is one of the triggers that do not exist under this new legislation. The quite clear information that was provided in the report that was signed by the Greens and the Democrats in relation to this bill indicated that the original bill was abysmal in terms of how it was to be a vehicle to wind back the Commonwealth's responsibilities. That was clear, and there was a solid bank of opinion.</para></talk.start><para>The government and Democrat amendments barely change this abysmal situation. The only changes are those at the margin in terms of ensuring adequate and effective Commonwealth roles. They are marginal. It is in fact mere tinkering. I heard Senator Hill yesterday, in a comment by way of an aside, explaining about the number of amendments. He said, `Most of these are merely technical.' Basically, the minister, if I overheard him correctly, does not consider these amendments to be particularly significant. That is why he said it is okay to have them in large chunks. So the minister did not think they were particularly significant.</para><para>The bill remains a major step backwards. There is no way of getting around this. There may be some groups who think that, for a particular issue, they might get better coverage than they have got now. But the overall picture involves a massive step backwards. To borrow the words of Senator Stott Despoja regarding the Reith-Kernot agreement in relation to industrial relations, it is draconian legislation only marginally improved. That goes for this legislation as well. Quantity should not be confused with quality. There may be 400 or so amendments that the Demo 
 crats have achieved, but in terms of overall substance, they are inadequate. Maybe 20 per cent of those are what is needed for good environmental legislation and have been achieved, not the 80 per cent that has been claimed. The numbers do not actually relate to the quality of the concerns that people have.</para><para>Make no mistake: the government still have a number of triggers—that is, a mere six—and it will not be hard to give them exemptions for every one of these. When we are talking about endangered species, if the issue focuses on the clearance of their habitat, the government will weasel out of it if they can.</para><para>There is an urgent need, as many people have said, for a greenhouse trigger. Where are the commitments by the government to do other than consult with the states? I have not seen a single promise from the government about doing anything other than consult. With respect to land clearance and water, what do the Democrats claim? Merely that land clearing may be regulated if it affects a matter of national environmental significance. I cannot find a single amendment that relates to land clearing, water or the stating of the obvious situation—that something may be regulated if it affects the NES matter about which they are claiming to have achieved a partial result, even if the probability of significant land clearance being stopped is minuscule.</para><para>As for the forests, which is what this bunch of amendments is about, the Democrats have not achieved anything. They have not even consulted with the Greens on the matter, despite knowing how concerned we are about the exemption of forests from the bill. This lack of consultation is now par for the course. Just consulting with a few select groups, when it should have been possible to consult all in the process, illustrates the tactics that the Democrats have learnt from the government—that is, pick off the groups that you think may be easily scared. If we are talking about threats, the major threat, as has been mentioned, comes out in this Democrat release, which says:</para><para>It was clear to the Democrats that the ALP-Greens strategy was an extremely risky one. If Senators Harradine and Colston supported the bill, the 
 Democrats would have had to start to argue for the very substantial amendments required on the floor of the chamber.</para><para>Shock, horror! The release continues:</para><para>Clearly, this would have exposed the environment to unacceptable risk. There was much to lose and the potential for real gains was ignored.</para><para>The government said their priority in this section of the parliamentary program was the tax package. The government said that again and again and again. For public credibility, the agreement should have been that, if the government's priority was the tax package, the time priority should also have been for the tax package.</para><para>We are not in a situation where this Senate has been debating the committee stage of this bill for days on end, even though it is important enough to have done so and the number of amendments and the complexity would warrant that happening. We are not in that situation. The gag was imposed before we even started on the committee stage of an environment bill. So, here we are dealing with, in my understanding, an unprecedented situation where a minor party in this case is using a gag in a situation where they themselves have argued in the opposite direction in the past. Where is the logic? I have thought and thought to see where that logic is. The only answer I can get is about as unkind as I can be at this stage, which is that in the recent past there has been a situation where the Democrats wanted to regain a seat in Western Australia. Of course, they have won that—to my loss, to the green network's loss and, I believe, now obviously to the wider network's loss because we know what they will do with that power. They have already signed up to it. With that loss of competition, temporarily, from Western Australia—hey, there is no need to be put down as the true green party and no need to appeal to that electorate because they think they have got it sewn up.</para><para>I do not usually make statements like this but this is all I can think of that must have been in the minds of the Australian Democrats in reaching this decision. We saw yesterday quite clearly that they did not have to be pushed at this time. We saw they had a 
 golden opportunity to say, `Let's listen to what Aboriginal groups, peak conservation groups and the wider community are saying and let's leave this committee stage until the August sittings. Let's make sure that the new bill'—which it is—`is then given a chance for consultation.' No, not good enough. The opportunity was here. It was not taken. So, it was a nonsense to suggest—and I believe it was an unfair threat to the environment movement in Australia to do so—that they had to make a decision then because otherwise something worse would happen. Unfortunately, the worse thing that is going to happen is that after the end of June we are not even going to have a say. I am certainly not going to have a say on these issues. There won't even be this concern by the Democrats that there might be someone else around from Western Australia at least to show where they are wrong in their statements and where they are not representing their electorates, which they promised to do. All of the statements, all of those leaflets, about protection of the forest are now clearly shown to be false because they have let down that community, let down that electorate, unnecessarily.</para><para>The Democrats assert that the disallowable nature of the management plans will ensure stringency. I can only foreshadow that exactly the same thing could happen with any disastrous plans of management as is happening with this bill. We do not know now that the Democrats will not be thrown some crumbs in order to pass it because, when nobody that I know of can understand why this decision is being made now and rushed on and pushed on without debate and gagged, I cannot guarantee—and I do not think anyone can guarantee—what would happen if those disallowances come to the Senate. Since the plans of management can only be disallowed and not amended, those crumbs will be in some totally different area and the Australian people will be left with bilateral agreements that give the Commonwealth power.</para><para>Note that the Democrats and government did not support the Greens' amendment to retain even a Commonwealth reserve power so that the Commonwealth can intervene in, say, a development project if state processes 
 are totally inadequate. Madam Chair, as I say, the reasons behind this deal originally escaped me, but I do recall that Senator Lees went through a `pick me, pick me' stage in relation to the consultation and sell-out in relation to tax. The only thing that I can suggest is that after the `pick me, pick me' it became very hard to move away from the table. There are also people, I admit, from the environment movement who were attracted to that feeling of power at the table. It is very difficult for people in that situation not to see how badly they are being done over—and unfortunately they were.</para><para>The environment movement, yes, has been divided in this process. It has not been the Greens dividing that movement. The movement was very clear and has put in hours of work. And I know because I have seen people in my office from environmental defenders and we have put in many hours. I have had a volunteer worker working with me day in, day out for months on this issue. You cannot talk to me about the work that has been done, because I know that that work has now been betrayed for the sake of the Democrats and some people from the environment movement who thought it would be good to be at the table, despite the fact there was no need for them to be forced to be there.</para><para>If Senator Harradine or Senator Colston had considered that they wanted to pass this bill, the indications were not here yesterday. But even if they had, if I were in that situation I would not want my name on that bill. The government are laughing all the way to the bank. They cannot believe that the Democrats have put themselves in this situation of taking the heat for what in fact is the government's abysmal bill; and that is what has happened. The government cannot believe their luck. If this deal had been made, carried on and debated after the 30 June, there would be no clearer indication that it was a Democrat deal. At the moment the Democrats can pretend that they had to do it because something worse might happen if they had not. After 30 June there would have been no excuse and that is the reason why we are being forced to vote on this now; that is the reason why our 
 forests will get no further protection and that is the reason why we are being restricted to six matters in a very narrow way that is worse than what exists now.</para><para>The minister and other ministers in this government have clearly said they do not want people asking about wider issues if there was an export power involved. They do not want people, for legitimate reasons, questioning very bad decisions by state governments. The federal government do not want to deal with it and this is what has been achieved in this bill. It is no wonder it is being rushed through now. It is no wonder that the amendments by non-government parties have not even been allowed to be put. I have been here six years and I have never seen that situation in the Senate before. Okay, lots of things happen in the House of Representatives, but this is supposed to be the states' house. This is supposed to be the people's house. I have never seen a situation like this where cross benchers, in a party that is supposed to be about the environment, have denied the right of minor parties to put their amendments.</para><para>Was this part of the original agreement and, if it was not, I believe the Democrats would have had the right to say to the government, `All bets are off unless you give other people the chance to put their amendments. This is not part of our agreement and all bets are off.' There is still the opportunity for the Democrats to say that all bets are off unless we have a proper debate; that all bets are off unless we have the chance to scrutinise these bills in a democratic way so that people can see what we have agreed to.</para><para>But no, I have not seen this. Even if we voted on them all at the end of the time, all in a lump, how meaningless that process has become. I believe that the people from my own state of Western Australia will be feeling very betrayed as a result of what has gone on in the last couple of days. Some people thought there would be some deals associated, but I do not think very many people realised how bad this would be in relation to the forests, which is what these amendments are. In my state I know that people have very, very long memories.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>6115</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just wanted to respond in relation to the forests and point out that the Greens have had so many opportunities in this place to make a difference on matters of forest protection and have taken up none of them. What I find so extraordinary is that, when the government brings forward environmental reform legislation which is designed to achieve better national environmental outcomes, it gets damned by the Greens without any willingness to contribute to developing a process to achieve a better outcome.</para></talk.start><para>We offered the Greens, as we offered the Australian Labor Party, the opportunity to work with us towards better environmental outcomes. I know that as a matter of principle Senator Bob Brown will not work with the government, no matter what the consequence. No matter what benefit he could get for the environment, he still will not work with the government to achieve that benefit. I do not understand it. I presume it is just something to do with his past when he made his name as a confrontationist and became a hero to the green movement as it then was. He is concerned that by now moving on and being prepared to negotiate better environmental outcomes would in some way put him at risk with his very small remaining constituency. I can only assume that that is what this is all about. I regret that. When we look back at the opportunities that Senator Brown has had over the past few years to achieve better environmental outcomes in this place we see that he has wasted the whole lot. I just cannot understand why the remainder of his green constituency stands by him.</para><para>When I look at the advantages—and I see nothing wrong with this at all—that Senator Harradine, for example, has been able to achieve for Tasmania, I would have thought that Senator Brown, also being a Tasmanian senator and one who claims to be here representing an environment constituency, would have recognised that he had the opportunity to win some real gains for the environment. But has he ever come to our door and said, `I want a better green outcome and this is my proposition'? Of course not. When we come 
 to him and say, `Do you want to participate in a process to achieve a better green outcome?', he washes his hands of us. In other words, to preserve his political stature with what remains of his constituency, he sacrifices the opportunity to achieve a better environmental outcome.</para><para>I know that is Senator Brown and there is nothing much we can do about it, but I would have thought Senator Margetts, who I know has a genuine interest in the forests of Western Australia, would have approached this matter differently. I would have thought she would say, `If the government is going to embark upon a major environmental reform, this is a wonderful opportunity for the green parties to become involved in the process to seek to achieve some of our aspirations.' Is that not logical? Is there some major flaw in my logic? But of course they will not do so. In other words, she has been wedded to the Bob Brown style of politics which is not to work with governments to achieve better outcomes but to go out there and run the old battles of the past and to try to achieve what? Notoriety, personal notoriety. That is the aspiration of Senator Bob Brown and it is very much a regret to me that Senator Margetts is prepared to lock herself into the same political mentality and sacrifice the opportunities that she has had to achieve better green outcomes.</para><para>How could negotiating with the government to achieve a better green outcome be described as selling out her principle? How does Senator Margetts know if she has never tried, if she refuses to participate in a process? How can she assume that the outcome would not have achieved any of her goals? That is the fundamental flaw in the position of both the green members of this Senate, and I think it is very much a matter of regret, not for me of course but for the environment, because there are people out there that have elected Senator Brown and Senator Margetts because they actually thought that they would make a difference. But as has been demonstrated today, they have not made a difference at all. They have wasted their time in this place. They certainly have looked for political notoriety, particularly in the case of Senator 
 Brown, but they have achieved no outcomes for their constituency.</para><para>They can stand up and say `We've fought the good fight, we belt the government every day', but that does not get a better environmental outcome.

We have had a situation where Australia is a party to the International Convention on the Protection of Biodiversity, and some years ago there was in fact a strategy for the conservation of biodiversity negotiated between the Commonwealth and the states. Regrettably, the last Labor government did not take the one extra step and set up a legal framework at the Commonwealth level to implement its commitments under that strategy. We are very pleased that the Howard government has been prepared to take the initiative and provide for Australia its first law for the conservation of biodiversity.</para><para>The amendments to the chapter improve the provisions for management of species and ecological communities and of protected areas, and also they continue the statutory office of the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which I will come back to in a minute. The amendments provide for increased recognition of the important role of indigenous peoples in conserving biodiversity and managing jointly managed Commonwealth reserves. In particular, representatives of the traditional owners will have the power to withhold consent, within reason, to the appointment to the joint management board of a person nominated by the Northern Territory. The amendments provide increased transparency for listing species and ecological communities and for decisions about permits relating to them. Strict liability is applied to some offences or elements of offences. It will now be possible to list key threatening processes purely on the basis of scientific criteria. Whilst I mention key threatening processes, it also overcomes the technical deficiency in the previous legislation which meant that a process could not be listed if it crossed the boundary between state and Commonwealth jurisdictions. So some of those matters 
 that were not listed on a technical basis could be reconsidered in the future.</para><para>I would also take the opportunity to thank the volunteers, really, within the scientific community who have given us advice, and so much sound advice, in endangered species areas. In fact, the men and women on the advisory bodies that we have in this area—the biodiversity advisory body, our threatened species scientific body and threatened species advisory body—do play a very important part in the conservation of our biodiversity through the assistance that they give to government and in the community leadership that they provide. It is not sufficiently or often enough recognised, and I am pleased to do so today. Also, the capacity to proclaim conservation zones to afford interim protection to the areas while their values are assessed will be retained.</para><para>I said I wanted to come back to the matter of the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Although there has been much comment about the number of amendments before the chamber, in fact many of those amendments simply relate to reinstatement of that position. It is no secret that we in the government believe that there was opportunity within this legislation to streamline administrative structures in relation to environmental protection and as such to remove what some would say is simply another tier in the structure—that is, the position of the director as a statutory officer—and then have a more clearly defined line of command and responsibility between government and the decision making process in relation to national parks.</para><para>That policy preference was consistent with the stand this government has taken across portfolios—that where possible separate statutory authorities should be removed. Regrettably, in the past so many have been created really as a cushion for government, and in particular for ministers, to avoid having to take direct responsibility. That is not the view of this government. This government believes that ministers should take responsibility for decisions that are made and not pass that responsibility off to third parties in the form of statutory authorities. Having 
 said that, and still believing that it would be sound administrative restructuring, it was strongly objected to by the joint boards, to which we are a party, for, in particular, Kakadu National Park and Uluru.</para><para>After sitting down with the traditional owners on a number of occasions—it is interesting, because I have heard in this debate those on the other side asserting that there was no consultation on this issue with indigenous people—I have not been able to convince them that the removal of the position would not be seen as some symbolic downgrading of the relationship. Of course, it was the director who signed the leases. Out of respect to the traditional owners, I therefore took the decision to not proceed with that proposed reform. Of course, to reinstate the position of director has meant that many clauses have had to be re-amended, and that makes up a large block of the amendments that are before us today. That is why we revised our opinion on this matter. It does in fact demonstrate that consultation does work and that this government is prepared to listen. Where a decision is going to cause distress, even though we might think it is sound administrative practice, we will vote to avoid distress.</para><para>In relation to the Northern Territory representative, we are not moving from our strong commitment that the administration of both parks would be enhanced by a Northern Territory representative. But I would like to stress, contrary to what was asserted in the Senate yesterday, that we are talking about one person, one representative, on boards that have a majority of traditional owners. Furthermore, what we are providing through these amendments is that the nominated representative must be approved by the traditional owners—in other words, it will be with the consent of the traditional owners. We have provided that that consent will not be unreasonably withheld, because unfortunately in my experience third parties, including the ALP, put considerable pressure upon traditional owners in these matters. I listened to the ALP's presentation yesterday in relation to the Northern Territory, and it was a totally unjustified and unreasonable condemnation of the 
 Northern Territory government. I have to say that, based on my dealings with the new Chief Minister in the Northern Territory, he is somebody who wants to build a good working relationship with indigenous Territorians, as they were called in the debate yesterday. I say that that is something that should be recognised and applauded.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>6120</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Member for Leichhardt: East Trinity Development</title><page.no>6120</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>6120</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage.

The Australian Labor Party again tried to drag an individual through the gutter in circumstances where it seems that what he, a parliamentary representative, was doing was trying to enhance the environmental outlook of his home city, or near home city, of Cairns. It is true that Mr Entsch has taken an interest in the acid sulphate issue in the Trinity Inlet and I commend him for doing so. I would have thought that that would be the minimum that one would expect of a local representative. As I tried to indicate on radio this morning, the difference between Mr Entsch and some other representatives—I hasten to say, on the other side of the chamber—is that he actually gets out there and seeks to get done what he is complaining about. In other words, rather than just saying that there is an acid sulphate problem in Trinity Inlet, he was interested in helping to take remedial action. Again, I would have thought that he should be applauded for that.</para></talk.start><para>He has mentioned an acid sulphate problem to me on a couple of occasions—the occasions that I can recall were of an informal nature; I am not saying that there may not have been others. On the last occasion that I can recall, I was actually doing a joint press conference with Mr Entsch in Cairns, at a venue which coincidently overlooked the port area. I might say that the press conference was on a different subject matter. It was on marine conservation, which is a matter of great interest to the Howard government, but was of little interest to the previous Labor government. And I can recall Mr Entsch on that occasion waving his hands and talking about the acid sulphate problem. As well, I can remember him on a previous occasion, when we were walking to a party meeting in this building, talking about acid sulphate problems in the Trinity Inlet. As I said after question time yesterday, he in fact asked my department in the first instance whether we would support CSIRO officers attending a community based meeting on the subject in the Cairns area, and we were prepared to do so.</para><para>I have not seen anything that would cause me to do anything other than commend Mr Entsch for his interest in a significant environmental issue and his willingness to get out there and seek to do something about it. If we can solve the issues of acid sulphate along the Queensland coast, we will be making a significant difference towards achieving a better environmental outcome. Those people, such as Mr Entsch, who are prepared to contribute to achieving that better environmental outcome, I commend for doing so and I only wish a few others would join them in that task.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>6121</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

But in that time, the Labor Party did sell some Australian icon assets. They sold the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas, and good luck to them for doing it. But when they sold things, they used the proceeds for recurrent expenditure. They did not reinvest it at all.</para></talk.start><para>I am pleased to say, as Senator Parer has raised, that we have sold a further 16 per cent of Telstra and that money is going back into Australia. First of all, we are paying off the huge debt that Labor ran up in government. That debt did more than anything to increase interest rates and make life unbearable for people in the bush. So that is the first thing we are doing with it. But, in addition to that, we are spending about a billion dollars on tangible, positive assets, on positive things for people in rural and regional Australia. </para><para>I am saddened that some of the media in my state and, particularly, the Premier, Mr Beattie—either he is lazy or not competent to understand—have not been able to comprehend just what this deal, the sale of a further 16 per cent of Telstra, will do for Queensland. On top of the original benefits from the social bonus, a new sum of $36 million will be available to Queenslanders as a result of the sale of Telstra. That will include some specifically identified initiatives, such as a further $20 million for the private sector incubators under the Building on IT Strengths program—something that will be great news for Queenslanders; a further $10 million for an enhanced telecommunications network under the Building Additional Rural Networks program; and, in my own area, a further $6 million to Queensland councils for the Local Government Online program. As well, Queensland communities will bid for some of the funds in the national programs, like the additional $250 million going to the Natural Heritage Trust, the $25 million that will extend mobile phone coverage along the national highways—and there are a lot of them in Queensland—and the $70 million for the Rural Transactions Centre program, which I am proud to be involved in.</para><para>In relation to that RTC program, I am pleased to say that that is up and running with the sale of a further 16 per cent of Telstra. The members on the advisory panel met in Canberra this week in fact and actually saw the historic vote, when additional moneys were provided for that program. That will be great news for country people; it delivers basic banking and telecommunications services. The benefits that we have initiated will also provide for SBS coverage in areas of Queensland, and Australia as a whole, which currently do not get it. They will be doing a lot of things. I cannot understand why Queensland senators actually oppose that, while Mrs Kernot, a Queenslander, said that `it was not good news' for Queenslanders to share another billion dollars worth of effort. Mrs Kernot said that it was not good news that Queenslanders could participate in that 500-branch rural transaction network. I cannot understand why that has happened. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Member for Leichhardt: East Trinity Development</title><page.no>6122</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>6122</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister.

 therefore he should resign.' What a nonsense! But the failure to mention that he had disclosed the properties was not the only misrepresentation that we heard from the Labor Party yesterday. Implied in the question was that he had bought the property cheap—you know, a secret deal. I heard this morning that in fact he bought the property at a public auction. So where is the secret deal? Was that said? Furthermore, yesterday we were told the value of the property, a fairly substantial sum of money, and we were told the price of his purchase, and the implication was—and there was a huge disparity between the two—that there was some wrongdoing. In actual fact, I understand that he bought the leasehold, for which I am told he pays $10,000 a year, but the valuation that was referred to by Labor was for the freehold. All of this was not to disclose the truth; it was to muddy the truth. And they succeeded of course. What did they get on the television last night? They got what they wanted—suggestions that there must be something improper, because the journalists did not ask the Labor Party the full story.</para><para>The Labor Party would obviously know all these things, because they have been into it in such depth.

I know that in the first term you are frustrated and you go through these things, but it is now the second term in opposition. Sooner or later the Labor Party have to start looking at themselves. What do they want to be in the future? Oh, they are silent now, aren't they! Do they want to spend all their time in the gutter trawling for muck?

The committee looked at government funded family relationship services and talked to a variety of experts and stakeholders about how to improve them.</para></talk.start><para>What was unique about the report's recommendations was their attention to education and prevention strategies—that is, how can we help families stay together rather than just provide assistance after the families break up? Putting fences at the top of the cliff rather than only ambulances at the bottom is the way I would describe it. That focus on prevention rather than cure is one that we have endorsed wholeheartedly for some time, and we have been moving in that direction in a number of policy areas.</para><para>The pilot voucher scheme which the Prime Minister announced today will enable couples who have notified of their intention to marry with a marriage celebrant to access pre-marriage education services. The pilot program will be for vouchers in a couple of areas of Australia, I think. In addition, a relationship kit will be developed which will assist people, particularly those in rural and regional areas, where they may not have ready access to pre-marriage education services. This initiative builds on the $15 million announced in the 
 budget for marriage and relationship education services and also for the men in relationship education services.</para><para>The administrative arrangements the Prime Minister has put together have brought the major policy areas for families and the programs into one portfolio, the Department of Family and Community Services. So the government is in the best possible position to develop a comprehensive response such as we have seen today in the government's announcements. Of course we believe that all families and strong families are crucial in maintaining a stable, cohesive and compassionate society. But, as the Prime Minister said today, we cannot legislate to make people be nice to each other. It would be really nice if he could legislate that—we might get a bit of better behaviour from the people sitting opposite us in the Senate, but the relationships there seem to be permanently fractured. Our challenge as a nation—not just as governments but as communities, families and individuals—is to try as much as possible to prevent family breakdown happening. We have a very important obligation to help families nurture, enrich and enjoy their relationships.</para><para>Since we came to office, our government has delivered on its promises and increased significantly funding and services designed to strengthen and support families. That includes a mix of financial help through the tax and social security systems for around two million families with children. Our tax reforms will provide $11.9 billion in personal income tax cuts and $2.5 billion in additional family assistance. But government is not just about dollars and statistics; it is also about providing substantial support services to help families when they reach critical times in their lives, such as: marriage—getting used to living together and supporting each other; the birth of children—certainly the first child; young people going through adolescence, which is often a difficult time for families; finding a job. The services are for crucial times in families' lives.</para><para>The education and prevention approach is not new to us. We are already moving in that direction by introducing programs in preven 
 tion of youth homelessness, of youth suicide and of domestic violence. It is now supported across the political spectrum and accepted by most experts as a sound investment in the future of any country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Member for Leichhardt: East Trinity Development</title><page.no>6125</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>6125</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I direct my question to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister.

The safeguards in place at the moment would be those in the forensic procedures bill which was passed just before the last election.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Stott Despoja may be aware that there is a Model Criminal Code Officers Committee report dealing with these matters and trying to shift towards a uniform approach around Australia for dealing with this. That report will be referred to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Anybody—and that, of course, includes the Democrats—is welcome to participate in discussions on that final report. The report deals with a range of things: the types or categories of persons from whom DNA should be able to be collected; the mechanisms for protection, and the appropriate mechanisms for disposal once the DNA has been used for the purpose for which it was collected; and the restriction of it to the use for which it was collected. I am happy to send Senator Stott Despoja some copies of that report if she does not already have them.</para><para>The last thing that I want to point out in relation to this is that the DNA that the Commonwealth is looking at collecting will come from 10 sites. One of those sites will identify the gender of the person from whom the DNA comes. The other sites are, I am told, referred to as `junk' sites—that is, they tell you nothing about the person from whom the DNA comes. They do not tell you their hair colour, eye colour, height, weight or anything. In that sense they are far more impersonal than a description that might be distributed over the radio: `Watch out for someone six feet five and weighing this 
 much, with blond hair and brown eyes.' They do not tell you that kind of information.</para><para>What these sites will tell you is that it is a particular person. If you can then match that DNA with another piece of DNA all you can say is that this DNA is from the same person. In a sense, it is a very up-market fingerprint that gives the police much wider opportunities than fingerprints do to access information as to who was at the scene of a crime. It will be particularly useful for local police in fighting crime. In the case of, for example, burglaries, the United Kingdom have more than doubled their clear-up rate of home burglaries. That is because, instead of having five police stations investigating a burglary in which the same person was involved, they suddenly know the same person was involved and those investigations can be put together. Of course, when you put all of the resources together, you often find you are much more efficient. Of particular interest to women is that the DNA database will be particularly useful in sexual offences. That will be of interest to men as well because there are numerous examples where men have been improperly charged with rape or accused of rape or a sexual offence and DNA has proven they were not the perpetrator—(<inline font-style="italic">Time expired</inline>)</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>6126</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

This is a very serious issue for which vigilant approach is necessary to overcome the potential tragic consequences highlighted by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I have read in today's media the reported comments of ATSIC commissioner Colin Dillon, the commissioner with portfolio responsibilities for the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Madam President, you 
 will recall that I appointed Commissioner Dillon, then Inspector Dillon, to the ATSIC board in 1996 because of his background as a Queensland police officer and the valuable experience he could bring to the job as ATSIC commissioner. I share his reported concern. He said:</para></talk.start><para>So much was spent in financial resources to set up the royal commission and we have very little to show for it today.</para><para>It is now 10 years after the royal commission. It was established under the then Labor government, which spent $400 million implementing the recommendations. More than three-quarters of this funding went to ATSIC. The rest went to the states and territories and other agencies to implement strategies and programs which would overcome deaths in custody. Tragically, despite this expenditure, deaths in custody continued to rise, from nine in 1992 to 21 in 1995. The coalition government has taken a different approach in working with states, territories and indigenous communities to overcome the problems which lead to deaths in custody.</para><para>Any death in custody is a tragedy. No-one likes to talk about statistics when they represent people's lives and the effect on their extended families. However, it is interesting to note that in the past three years the figures have started to decline. While it is too early to be conclusive, the figures are certainly encouraging. It is also worth noting that in 1997-98 the rate of deaths among indigenous prisoners per 1,000 was 3.72, which was lower than the rate of non-indigenous prisoners, at 4.59 per 1,000.</para><para>The issue of indigenous overrepresentation in the criminal justice system was a focus of the 1997 Ministerial Summit on Indigenous Deaths in Custody convened by the Commonwealth government. The summit involved the states and territories, which are responsible for the administration of the criminal justice system. Initiatives agreed to by the states, territories and indigenous organisations arising out of the summit included the development of targets in each jurisdiction for reducing this overrepresentation. These initiatives will be revisited at the next Ministerial Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs 
 meeting, scheduled to be held in September this year.</para><para>While the state and territory governments are primarily responsible for the criminal justice system, the federal government is committed to addressing the underlying causes of incarceration because that, after all, is the basic reason for this occurrence. The royal commission found that the underlying cause of indigenous overrepresentation in the criminal justice system is the social and economically disadvantaged position of indigenous people.</para><para>The Australian government remains committed to addressing this disadvantage and enabling indigenous people to participate fully in Australian social and economic life. The Australian government funding of indigenous specific programs is now the highest on record, with $2.2 billion programmed to be spent in 1999-2000. The government's policy focuses on improving basic services such as housing and infrastructure, access to education, training and employment opportunities, health care and economic empowerment. We believe, by doing this over the next few years, we will enable indigenous Australians to share in the economic opportunities that this government has presented for every Australian.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Heffernan, Senator Bill: Financial Interests</title><page.no>6128</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>6128</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister.

There are a number of issues that impact on non-completion.

Senator Hill finds it very offensive when the opposition exercises its responsibility to hold the government accountable and to scrutinise the executive. I must say, to be fair to Senator Hill, that he is not as bad as Senator Heffernan who, true to form today, has scurried from the chamber, not willing to respond to the serious issues that have been raised.</para><para>This is the way Senator Heffernan operates in politics. I respect most senators in this chamber for at least having a go. Nearly all of the 76 senators in this chamber have a go; they are willing to defend themselves, they are willing to argue their case and they are willing to put up and argue matters of public policy that they believe in or that their party believes in. There is one very noticeable exception to that: Senator Heffernan.</para><para>What the opposition were doing today was asking questions. We were asking questions about whether Senator Heffernan failed to disclose his 50 per cent shareholding in Sestial Pty Ltd, which of course is a beneficial interest according to the Prime Minister's criteria. We were asking whether Senator Heffernan's shareholding in Cooba Pastoral Company Pty Ltd was disclosed. That is a beneficial interest according to the Prime Minister's criteria. We were asking if Senator Heffernan failed to disclose his directorship in Cooba Pastoral Company Pty Ltd. We want answers to those questions. We want to know whether Senator Heffernan has also failed to disclose 1,972 hectares of land under perpetual lease in the Balranald area, the title of which is in Senator Heffernan's own name. Of course, this is all contrary to the Senate's disclosure requirements, and it is contrary to the Prime Minister's code of conduct.</para><para>We also want to know whether Senator Heffernan, as a parliamentary secretary, has been lobbying for changes to the current 
 government policy on taxing trusts the same as companies, which would substantially disadvantage persons with trust structures, like Senator Heffernan, who would obviously much prefer to return to the present treatment. It does appear from Senator Heffernan's disclosure of his pecuniary interests that he has a beneficial interest in some seven family trusts. Again, this behaviour is, at a minimum, contrary to the spirit of the Prime Minister's much devalued code of conduct.</para><para>We want to know whether Senator Heffernan's public lobbying in relation to the capital gains tax proposals at the last election, which would have affected Senator Heffernan's extensive pre-1985 purchased properties, worth millions of dollars, was driven by that position of self-interest. Again, it is, at a minimum, contrary to the spirit of the code of conduct. We want to know about Senator Heffernan's responsibilities as a parliamentary secretary. If he is responsible for giving final approval to the introduction of legislation into parliament, as we have been told, has he signed off on bills that are relevant to issues such as taxation relating to trusts or any other issue that might conflict with his own private interests?</para><para>These are fair questions to ask. This is what question time is about. It is reasonable to hold a government accountable. It is reasonable to apply that level of scrutiny to a government, and the opposition is entitled to answers, not the sort of response we received today from Senator Hill. I make this absolutely clear: if Senator Heffernan does have a shareholding and a directorship in the Cooba Pastoral Company Pty Ltd then the same basis on which Mr Howard let Mr Entsch off the hook serves to completely ensnare Senator Heffernan. Senator Heffernan must go.

 today. It failed the moment that Senator Faulkner asked in this place whether it was the case that Mr Entsch had a substantial financial interest in a development on the eastern side of Trinity Inlet in Cairns.

As Senator Ray well knows, there is a golden rule in politics and that is that you never ask a question unless you know the answer.

Of course you cannot be a farmer unless you have some land, by definition. You need to farm something, you need to plough something, you need to put the sheep or the cattle on something. You cannot be a farmer in a suburban backyard, although I am sure that some of the financial geniuses of the Labor Party tried that in their tax avoidance days.

There was no attempt by us to distort the relationship between where Mr Entsch's property is and where the major development is going to occur. But the relevant point of course is: the major development can only go ahead if the environmental matters are dealt with. Once they are dealt with, the bridge gets built—and the bridge not only serves NatWest but also serves Mr Entsch's property. There is the conflict of interest, and it is unassailably a conflict of interest. It is Mr Entsch that takes the CSIRO report, distorts it and says the only solution to this area is development, when the report clearly shows there are other options. Therein lies the conflict of interest.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In terms of Senator Heffernan, Senator O'Chee runs a defence that Senator Heffernan is entitled to own land because he is a farmer. Of course he is. Senator Heffernan has declared his directorship of a number of companies. Senator Heffernan has declared his beneficial interest in a number of companies. Senator Heffernan has declared his beneficial interest, in addition, to six family trusts and one unit trust. Senator Heffernan has declared property and house ownership, but what he failed to declare was his directorship in Sestial Pty Ltd. When he gets around to correcting the record after two years—remembering that it is a matter of privilege in this place if you do not adjust your pecuniary interest form within 28 days, and it takes him almost a year and a half to get that directorship right—he then does not declare his shares in that particular company. We are entitled to ask why. Senator O'Chee says we do not know the answers. Of course we have done the company searches, of course we have done the land title searches and of 
 course we know the answers; what we want to know is whether there was knowledge in the government about this or not.</para><para>That was a reasonably serious matter, but I have to say Sestial Pty Ltd equals the Entsch position in reverse. Mr Entsch declares a beneficial interest but not a directorship; Senator Heffernan declares a directorship but not a beneficial interest. So, if we were to try to convict Senator Heffernan on the Prime Minister's interpretation, then he would get off on the Prime Minister's interpretation.

So for the moment we have to go on the assumption that it continues to exist and it has not gone into another entity or otherwise. But Senator Heffernan has a form there. You wonder why he cannot fill out a form properly—and this comes from the individual that gets to sight all cabinet documents. This comes from the individual that is running around at the moment trying to stir up the National Party and others to oppose the proper tax reform of trusts. Why?

He broke the world 100-metres record to get out of here at 3 o'clock, like he always does. The typical modus operandi of Senator Heffernan is to sit here, snipe at individuals, sleaze around the

One group of people who have been misled and done over by the final compromise between the Democrats and the Greens are indigenous Australians. This is an environment bill and a lot of people would be misled into thinking that maybe there are not enormous indigenous issues in respect of this legislation. The truth of the matter is that there are. Whether it is in respect of diversity, hunting and gathering rights, native title rights or the management of some pretty important national parks in Australia, indigenous Australians have a role by law and by social policy. </para></talk.start><para>Probably the most fundamental role is that if we as a parliament were to take more than token recognition of the concept of self-determination, we should involve indigenous Australians in decision making, particularly as it affects them directly, as is does in this legislation. In the last few hours there have been a number of press statements issued by indigenous organisations, including the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Board of Management, the Kakadu Board of Management and the Central Land Council. The issue of self-determination is best summed up by the media release from the Central Land Council, where Tracker Tilmouth not only condemns the deal but makes the point that:</para><para>The debate has been deliberately limited and has excluded many Aboriginal people who are still not fully across the issues.</para><para>He goes on to say:</para><para>Until there is a political process which is inclusive of Indigenous interests the question of our very basic right to self determination remains a myth.</para><para>He calls his press statement, `Political process sends us back to the mission'. Later on, I will go to the press release from the Kakadu Board of Management, but it is also worth noting at the outset one of the comments that Mick Alderson, the Chairperson of the Kakadu Board of Management, makes in respect of the way they have been treated. He speaks on behalf of not only Aboriginal members but also the tourism representative of the Kakadu Board of Management. They express their concern and he says:</para><para>We are tired of being treated like jacky-jackys, sitting on the sideline watching non-Aboriginal people making decisions about our land.</para><para>These people raise these sorts of concerns because they have been misled, not just by the government but also by the Australian Democrats. It was this minister who wrote to the boards of management saying that there would not be a change in the management arrangements without the consent of the boards. The next thing they knew was that legislation had been introduced to change the structure of the boards of management. There was no consultation in between and no consent sought. The minister just comes in here and introduces legislation, and not only does he not consult but he breaks a commitment 
 and a promise. Further down the track, this felony is compounded by the Australian Democrats, who not only sell them out but try to portray their sell out as a great win for indigenous Australians. That is adding insult to injury, Senator Allison.</para><para>When you look at yesterday's press statement from the Australian Democrats, you see that they claim to have acted in the interests of indigenous Australians; they claim to have acted to stop the appointment of Northern Territory government representatives on the boards of the two Territory national parks—Ulura-Kata Tjuta and Kakadu. Big achievement! But if you read on in the documentation, you find that that achievement is not what it appears to be. Basically, they chose a deliberate course of deception and deceit, not just of indigenous Australians but of the broader Australian public. This is the mob who claimed victory on the environment legislation when the most eminent constitutional lawyers in the country told them that they had failed.	So we should not be surprised about what they have done.</para><para>They have told indigenous Australians, `Look, we have taken measures to ensure that there will not be a Territory rep on the board of management,' but when you go into the documentation, that is further redefined to mean that the appointment of a Northern Territory rep on the boards of Kakadu and Uluru-Kata Tjuta national parks is now subject to the consent of traditional owners, with the rider `which may not be withheld unreasonably'. If you go further into the documentation to try to work out what that means, you find that if they resist—if the boards of management do not like a Northern Territory rep on the board of management—the decision will be taken out of their hands and given to the Commonwealth Ombudsman.</para><para>This is defence protection Australian Democrats style. This is the new wave of Australian Democrats social conscious and social policy: `Sell them out and try to make them feel good on the way through.' Senator Allison, this is the depths of deceit and you ought to be ashamed of yourself in respect of it. I have been with you when you have looked traditional owners, the elders of these communi 
 ties, straight in the face and said, `I will not let you down.' Not only have you let them down but you have tried to con them on the way through. Your voice is worthless in that community from now on and that is depicted by the press statements, releases and letters from these boards of management.</para><para>They write to Senator Meg Lees of their concerns about the proposed bill. They call on the Democrats to stall the debate. They want to have time to look at the amendments. These are not unreasonable things, given the fact that the sorts of people we are talking about and the sorts of management structures we are talking about are very successful examples of management by indigenous Australians. Kakadu was the first place in Australia to set up a joint management model. It has been internationally recognised and other parks, not just in Australia but around the world, have learned from us and have made stronger laws for joint management. That is the view of the Chair of the Kakadu Board of Management, Mick Alderson.</para><para>But what do we do here? We have put poison in the well. We have put a Northern Territory government representative on the board of Kakadu, and of Uluru. Maybe not on day 1, but give it three months and it happens. Three months is not a long time to wait for the Northern Territory government; they have waited a long time. They are on record in their most recent statements on this matter as saying that they want to take over control of these national parks. These are things that you cannot avoid, that you cannot run away from, Senator Allison, because they were told to you directly. You were there in Darwin at the meetings, and I was sitting next to you, when the Northern Territory government representatives made it very clear that they wanted to take over. They still want to take over. There is distrust there.</para><para>You have a great board of management structure that is working. So what do you do? You bow to the government again. Why? People have to ask themselves why you are doing this. These are the most fundamental rights. You know they are fundamental rights because, not only are they social rights, rights of decency and rights of recognition enshrined 
 in international covenants, they are also rights enshrined in leases under our law.</para><para>Those leases provide—and you yourself know full well they provide because, once again, we have had copies presented to us—that in circumstances such as this, even if legislation is introduced to disrupt or overturn the established management structures of those boards, whether it is Kakadu, Uluru or Wreck Bay, the traditional owners have a right to revoke those leases. It is a legal right of theirs. But, in total disregard for this—and we expect it from the government because the minister made his position clear from the start—you have traded away these legal and social rights in secret, without consultation, pretending to represent all these people.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">CROSSIN</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name></talker><para>—Outrageous!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—It is outrageous, Senator Crossin. No wonder these people reckon that they are seen by the political process of Australia as `Jacky Jackys, sitting on the sideline'. As I said, there are major concerns. They have been spelt out in the two letters to Senator Lees and the press statement. The concerns as stated in the Central Land Council media release are that:</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Bill</para><para>.	 severely restricts traditional and subsistence use of wildlife by limiting use for traditional purposes as laid out in the Native Title Act 1994 and removes existing protection in the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974</para><para>We do not know to what extent this government is going to reinstate the role of the National Parks and Wildlife Director. But we do know that the independence of that position has been marginalised enormously over the last 12 to 18 months. I sat next to Senator Allison, hand-wringing and expressing concern about what had been happening, about how a public servant under the direction of the minister was now in that position. That concern does not filter through in terms of any outcome of the compromise in the agreement between the Democrats and the government. The next point in the press release expresses concern that the bill:</para><para>.	 ignores native title and cultural heritage protection laws 
</para><para>Your protection of existing native title rights, as agreed with the government, is not good enough; it is not adequate enough. You cannot hide behind incompetence on that one because you knew, and you continue to know, that that was an issue. But did you seek consultation with those who have actually defended Aboriginal Australians in respect of native title? Did you become aware of it? Did you let them come to the table as you were sitting there, cozy with the Prime Minister, Senator Hill and others from the government? There was no room for black people at the table of negotiation on this particular bill when it came to even their most fundamental rights. The deal does not protect the Native Title Act, which passed this place after a long debate less than a year ago. How do you reconcile that? How will you go back to your supporters in Victoria and explain to them that you have actually sold out on the protection of that Native Title Act? You are going to have to. The press release further states that the bill:</para><para>.	 does not provide an effective framework for negotiation of indigenous land use agreements . . . </para><para>That is another area in contradiction to the Native Title Act 1993. The next point states that the bill:</para><para>.	 allows the Commonwealth to transfer responsibility to the States and Territories without sufficient accountability</para><para>To some extent, you have protected against bilaterals, but you have not protected against that list of myriad mechanisms that are available under legislation for this minister, this government, to basically flick-off responsibilities in that area. The second last point is that:</para><para>.	 there is no requirement for consultation with indigenous stakeholders</para><para>You would not want that, because you have not had it. You have not allowed them at the table, so it is no wonder that that does not find itself in the legislation. The last point states that this bill:</para><para>.	 gives the Commonwealth Minister wide discretion in key areas</para><para>That is right; that is something that your minority report expressed concern about. So we do have here a sell-out of the Kakadu, 
 Uluru—Kata Tjuta and Wreck Bay national parks and the destruction of their boards of management. But I suppose the most offensive thing about all this is that it has been done with absolutely no participation of indigenous Australians. Their view, as last expressed to us, is that they want more time. They do not want the Northern Territory rep. They reckon—not only do they reckon but the international bodies reckon—that they have a good board of management structure. You have sold out on that; you have done it in the dark and you have done it trying to mislead the people most directly affected.</para><para>So I say to you: any time you put your head up, Senator Allison, and any time the Democrats put their heads up in the future pretending to be defenders of indigenous Australians, we will remind you of two things—the fact that you have sold out their rights and the fact that you have sold them out without even warning them and trying to deceive them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>6142</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Since Senator Bolkus quotes so freely from press releases, I will do so as well.

Indeed, Mr Djerrkura says that he would too; that he would like to see another round of consultations with their constituents before the bill passes into law. We would like that too, but the fact of the matter is that this legisla 
 tion has been around for 18 months; we have had a very extensive inquiry; and I have had meetings with Aboriginal groups both as part of that inquiry and outside there. What remains is that, once Aboriginal people are across the detail, they are—ATSIC tell us—not uncomfortable. I will just run through some of those indigenous benefits.</para><para>The objects of the amended bill recognise the role and the knowledge of indigenous peoples in relation to the conservation and sustainable use of Australia's biodiversity. Senator Bolkus cannot claim that any of his legislation has done that. The amended bill explicitly states that it does not affect the operation of native title or Aboriginal land rights legislation.

In entering into a conservation agreement the minister must take into account obligations under biodiversity convention and the national biodiversity strategy relating to indigenous people's customary use of biodiversity and indigenous knowledge of biodiversity. Again, this is something Labor did not do. The minister must also have regard for the role and interest of indigenous peoples in the conservation of Australia's biodiversity in developing bilateral agreements, recovery plans and threat abatement plans.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Existing provisions relating to indigenous people's rights to use Commonwealth reserves for hunting, food gathering or ceremonial and religious purposes have been reinstated. The Biological Diversity Advisory Committee will now include indigenous representation. So all that Jacky Jacky stuff is nonsense. Our amendments make sure that the voices of indigenous people are heard and that they will have representation on that advisory committee. An indigenous advisory committee will be established to advise the minister on the operation of the act, taking into account the 
 significance of indigenous people's knowledge of the management of land, and the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.</para><para>The appointment of a Northern Territory representative, as you have already indicated, on the boards of Kakadu and Uluru national parks is subject to the consent of traditional owners. Furthermore, there is an opportunity for them to review that appointment and for them to, if necessary, replace that member on the board. So we are not talking here about the Northern Territory taking over control of those two boards of management—nobody has ever suggested that. In fact, as I recall, Senator Bolkus—and I think you were there at the time—a suggestion was put forward by the Kakadu Board of Management that they could live with a Northern Territory member on the board, provided that that statutory role of the National Parks and Wildlife position remained intact.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOLKUS</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name></talker><para>—And an expansion of the board?

I am persuaded by the government's arguments that, in terms of the future for relations between the boards and the Northern Territory government, there may well be some strong argument for there to be a Northern Territory rep on that board. We have judged, based on what we were told by the Kakadu Board of Management, that this is not the end of the world and that if it is one member it is not going to mean that indigenous people lose control of the board or anything of that sort.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOLKUS</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name></talker><para>—This is outrageous.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name></talker><para>—So your criticisms, Senator Bolkus are really unfounded and, again, I draw your  attention to what Mr Gatjil Djerrkura has said.

 concerns. I think for the first time we are going to see legislation which really reflects the important role that indigenous people in this country have in biodiversity.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On the general subject of biodiversity, we have negotiated a range of amendments under this section. I am very proud to say that this country now has the first national biodiversity legislation. We have upgraded the number of categories of threatened species and increased the types of communities listed. We have specified time lines for all the steps of the listing process. We have uncoupled the decision about listing a threatened species from the decision about the feasibility of a threat abatement plan. So that will stop a lot of existing problems where political decisions were used to stop listing threatened species. That listing will be made solely on the basis of scientific criteria. Recovery plans at present are required for only listed species occurring entirely or partly on Commonwealth areas. Now they are required for all listed species and ecological communities as well.</para><para>We have registers of critical habitat, deeper safeguards for migratory species than ever before, strict liability in relation to threatened species, and we are banning the capture of dolphins for live display. Anyone who thinks that wild dolphins should be caught and put in a swimming pool for their life is obviously barbaric. Commonwealth fisheries will now be subject to strategic environmental assessment during the next five years. And there has never—I repeat never—been an environmental impact assessment on a Commonwealth fishery. The Democrats see this as a major positive step, with so many fisheries vulnerable to collapse from overexploitation. There will now be conservation agreements entered into for the protection and conservation of biodiversity anywhere in Australia. There will be identification and monitoring of biodiversity and preparation of bioregional plans.</para><para>One of the most important agreements we have made with Senator Hill is that there will be a public inquiry into the use of and access to biological resources. Indigenous people will be specifically funded to make submissions and to participate. That will be an open and 
 public inquiry, and it will feed into the regulation making process under this bill. Senator Bolkus will recall that indigenous people have been calling for this kind of inquiry for some long time.</para><para>Another important measure is that all wildlife on Commonwealth land will be protected unless it is specifically exempted in a schedule. There will be a regulation making power to list invasive species—again, a first. It is a pity that Senator Bolkus and the Labor Party never thought of this while they were in government. Invasive species, as the Democrats know—Senator Brown probably does not know this—are a major ecological threat, and there are no provisions to deal with them in existing Commonwealth legislation. There is nothing here at present.</para><para>This is yet another area in which the Democrats have made a difference and have made sure that this legislation is not only greatly amended from the original version but also a great improvement on the status quo. There are very many other ways in which biodiversity is protected as a result of this bill, and I am proud to say that the Democrats will be part of introducing the very first Commonwealth biodiversity act.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>6144</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to build upon the comments I was making before lunch on the indigenous issue.

They wish their parks service to play the same role as parks services in the states, and they cannot really see why the Commonwealth still needs to be involved. But they are not against joint management between themselves and indigenous people. Senator Crossin would be aware of the Nitmiluk National Park and of Gurig.

What we need—and I would say this to Senator Crossin and to Senator Bolkus, who also seeks to win political points out of these issues—is to move forward. And a Northern Territory representative contributing constructively can be a significant step forward—without any threat, because it is only one representative. I accept that it should be somebody who is satisfactory to the indigenous people.</para><para>That is a safeguard but, as we know, traditional owners are influenced by third parties and by people such as Senator Crossin who are much more interested in fighting the political battles than in the advancement of indigenous people. So they are influenced and decisions are not always made on the basis of what is the best outcome, but they get dragged into the political process of the Northern Territory. That is why we have put the provision in that consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Obviously, the person 
 who would be found for these positions would be a person who is sensitive to indigenous issues. This provision will not come into effect for a 12-month period, and there will be no difficulty at all in finding a representative of the Northern Territory government who is sensitive to indigenous issues and can actually work to the betterment and improvement of the parks and of indigenous people who live in those parks. As I have said so many times, they are not just simply parks; they are also communities.</para><para>On the same subject, I heard it said yesterday that the government has not consulted. The government has consulted. I have consulted on these issues since this process started in 1996. As I said this morning, I listened to the consultations and I abandoned what I thought would be a good administrative reform by reinstating the position of the director of national parks because that was the request of the indigenous people and of the traditional owners of those two parks. I have watered down the provision and added extra safeguards in relation to the position of a Northern Territory representative so that there can be no threat—and there was never any—or perceived threat. But will the Labor Party acknowledge that? Will Tracker Tilmouth acknowledge that? Of course not. If the Labor Party took Tracker Tilmouth seriously, they would have preselected him. They will not preselect him as a candidate but they come here and want to use his words to support their case.</para><para>There are so many other aspects that have been built into this package to ensure a full contribution by indigenous Australia. I want to make particular mention of that which we agreed with ATSIC, that is, to establish an indigenous advisory body. We recognise that indigenous Australians bring to the table a different perspective, a unique perspective, in relation to biodiversity. It is important that that perspective is part of the debate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOLKUS</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name></talker><para>—Where is the funding coming from?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—What do you mean `where is the funding coming from'?

That committee will ensure at the highest levels at the table an indigenous contribution to this broader environment debate, a contribution that has never been facilitated by such a structure in the past. I would have thought that that would be acknowledged by even the Labor Party. But no: because it would spoil a political point.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There was not within the bill, and I have to acknowledge it was inadvertent, a specific place dedicated on the BDAC committee for an indigenous representative. That has been pointed out and it is now corrected, and it ought to be acknowledged. When I met with the board in Kakadu there were some misgivings about the quorum provisions imposed in the bill. Although I thought they were misconceived, I know they were repeated in submissions made by the Kakadu board and traditional owners to the Senate committee. We have taken steps to amend that so there can be no doubt—in other words, we listened to the indigenous representatives and we acted on their concerns.</para><para>Within this bill we have protection for traditional use of land and water in Commonwealth reserves, something that ought to be acknowledged and recognised. We provide for conservation agreements to be entered into with indigenous communities, which is a positive step in the right direction. As was mentioned in the last contribution, there will be a special place for indigenous Australia within the proposed study of access to biological resources because, again, as I said, there is a unique indigenous perspective of these issues and it is important that that perspective is part of the debate.</para><para>Consultation requirements have been expanded to address indigenous interests in relation to bilaterals and the recovery plans. That ought to be recognised and it certainly has been by those who take indigenous issues seriously. The objects of the bill have been expanded, also to address indigenous issues. Bilateral agreements will not apply to actions in relation to Kakadu, Uluru and Booderee, 
 contrary, again, to what I recall Senator Crossin saying yesterday. A provision confirms that the bill does not affect the land rights act and the Native Title Act, contrary to what Tracker Tilmouth says in the document to which Senator Bolkus refers. All he has got to do is read the amendments and he would find that what he is asserting in that document is incorrect.</para><para>So if you package all of that up, you must concede there have been real steps to ensure that indigenous Australia has a vital place in the whole perspective of how our country manages its natural assets and conserves them to the benefit of future generations. It is in fact an unprecedented opportunity from which all Australians will benefit. Getting full benefit from the Aboriginal perspective is not just to the benefit of Aboriginal Australians but to the benefit of all Australians, and that has been our philosophical approach to this particular act. I hope, as such, that in this year it will be recognised and recalled as a significant contribution to reconciliation as well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>6146</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is remarkable, is it not, that the patronising can be so glib? The ultimate decision about who is on the boards of these great natural areas, which are indigenous people's areas and which, through their generosity of spirit, they have opened up to all Australians, is now being moved—by sleight of hand endorsed by the Democrats—into the hands of a non-Aboriginal officer appointed by the government. That is where this process has ended up.</para></talk.start><para>I want to briefly talk about biodiversity—because I know Senator Crossin wants to speak on the indigenous issues—and to follow up on what Senator Allison had to say about what a great deal the Democrats have got for biodiversity. Let me start by informing the Senate that half of the biodiversity in Australia—that is, half of the spectrum of wildlife and plant life—is in Australia's forests. We know that wildlife is concentrated in the forests of the world and, because of deforestation primarily, some 50 to 100 species of our fellow creatures on this planet are going to extinction every day.</para><para>Here in Australia the count is not kept. For example, in the Tasmanian forests, which are very much affected by this Democrat endorsed bill, there are some 10,000 forest insects. We do not know their role in the forests. We do know by rule of thumb that at least some of these creatures with their ancient lineage will be very important to human health and survival further down the line. But they are not listed, they are not studied and they are not protected.</para><para>The Democrats' process today involves endorsing what the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Robert Hill—with his reputation as the worst minister for the environment in this nation's history—has done in the Regional Forest Agreement process, which says that all the unprotected forests of Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland will in future be out of reach of any federal minister. With that goes the wildlife and the plant life, and now with that comes the Democrats' endorsement. Senator Allison gets up and speaks glibly about what she is doing to protect things, but she is selling out half the wildlife species range in Australia in this one fell move.</para><para>Not only is she selling it out with her fellow Democrats—in the lap of the government, because they put their place at the Howard table ahead of Australia's biodiversity—but she is saying, `We are going to pass this legislation'—they will vote later today for the third reading—which means that for the next 20 years half the biodiversity of Australia is going to be unprotectable by the minister for the environment, because there is a bilateral agreement in place, unless a state government wants to come to the party. The states will have the control.</para><para>What we do know is that in Tasmania the governments are far from taking up that role. In the north-east highlands, beyond Ben Lomond and towards Weldborough—if you can imagine the heart-shaped island of Tasmania, it is in the north-east corner—a forest is being pulverised by the big woodchip companies, with the authority of the Howard government and now with the authority of the Democrats. </para><para>There has been turmoil in those forests, with people risking arrest not least because in the damper, more rainforested part of these highlands there are two species listed as endangered. The Simson stag beetle is a huge, magnificent, glistening forest floor forager. The north-east forest snail, <inline font-style="italic">Anoglypta Launcestonensis</inline>, is larger than the introduced garden snail with which most Australians are familiar. It is brilliant orange, and it has a magnificent carapace on its back. It is listed as endangered, but the loggers want its territory.</para><para>So what has been happening while the minister for the environment and the Democrats bind their hands? Forestry Tasmania has got in a consultant. The consultant said, `Well, yes, this has been listed as vulnerable, endangered and on its way to extinction, but we guess'—because they cannot do better than that—`that if we leave some remnants of this to-be-pulverised forest along rivers and roadsides, which we were going to leave anyway, and we let the bulldozers, chainsaws and firebombers drop incendiaries at the end of the season to burn to death everything in the logged areas, including the north-east forest snail on the endangered list, that's okay.'</para><para>Because this snail was getting in the way of logging, they have now gone so far as to move into a process of de-listing, Senator Allison. You do not know about this because you are not aware of the impact on the wellbeing of the biodiversity—the spectrum of wildlife in this country—of handing back power to state governments. We already know from the Regional Forest Agreement—honoured now by the Democrats—that when you hand Commonwealth responsibility for the nation's wildlife, its creatures and its diversity back to state governments, who are under pressure from corporate extractors, the corporate extractors win the day.</para><para>So, very early, one creature on the list of threatened and endangered species will simply be removed from the list. It is no longer going to be on the list as endangered because it is no longer going to be allowed to get in the way of the bulldozers, the chainsaws and those people who, at the end of the wrecking 
 of these forest ecosystems in the highlands of north-east Tasmania, come with the firebombers and the 1080—and the same for the rest of this country and the diversity in those forests.</para><para>The Democrats today are endorsing the Robert Hill dictum that this embarrassing problem should be handed back to the loggers and the woodchippers. That is what this process is about, and that is why this is such a shameful day—as the Democrats turn their backs on all those years of tub-thumping and saying that they stood for the environment. Today they stand for the chainsaws and the diminution of this nation's environment. The things that Senator Allison read out ought to be part of any decent piece of legislation—but a minor part of it.</para><para>What is notable here is how much Senator Allison, when she went to that polished Howard table, failed to get. What is also notable is that Senator Allison—so recently able to march the streets of Melbourne with conservationists for the protection of the forests of East Gippsland—is now endorsing the Regional Forest Agreement which is going to lead to the pulverisation of forests in East Gippsland and the threatening of species in East Gippsland. If you cross the border, breeding koala habitats are marked for destruction under the Regional Forest Agreement endorsed by this bill and about to be endorsed by Senator Allison, Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Woodley, Senator Bartlett, Senator Lees, Senator Murray and Senator Bourne—these new friends of the government environmental wreckers—when they vote yes for this bill on the third reading later today. Let them live with it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>6148</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I make some comments further to my speech yesterday, I want to say how terrific it is to see some young kids up in the public gallery—and young babies, at that.

I want to take some arguments through about one particular aspect of this bill, and that is the proposal to change the arrangements for the management of the national parks at Kakadu and at Uluru. I do not want to raise my voice and get angry, but I must say that I am surprised, Senator Allison. Last week we sat together at an inquiry to look at Jabiluka and we met the traditional owners from that area. One of the things that you must not have failed to grasp when we talked to those people is that all of these arrangements—the lease arrangements and the idea of us passing laws in Canberra to change their lifestyle—are very complex issues for them. I have met with these people time and time again, and they have not ruled out having a Northern Territory representative on the board; in fact, they have said they would welcome further discussions and thinking about it. But at this point in time they have said no to that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the things that must have impressed you, as it has impressed me, is that they talk about Aboriginal law being constant. It does not change; it has been with them for many, many years. So if you are going to put changes and suggestions to these people, they need time to think about them and synthesise them. When I put it to them that a Northern Territory government representative on the board may be the way to go, they talked about it and said, `Maybe, but we would want an increase in our Aboriginal representation if that were the case.'</para><para>In a letter from the Kakadu Board of Management which was sent on 18 June, they talk about perhaps being serious about having a Northern Territory representative on the board if the Kakadu Board of Management were to have statutory powers to run Kakadu National Park. So those are two suggestions that I have heard traditional owners in this area come forward with. In other words, they are prepared to negotiate and think about changes, but they are not prepared to tolerate people making decisions about the manage 
 ment of the park without their being consulted—and by that I mean consulted in the last five, seven or 10 days—about these amendments. If there is one thing I would urge, Senator Allison, it is that this amendment be withdrawn while you take it back to Aboriginal people, get them to have a look at it, and bring it back in August. If nothing else is achieved today, perhaps this section of the bill could go away for further discussion with the people who matter.</para><para>What we are talking about here is an arrangement between people who own the land being leased to the Commonwealth. They have an arrangement as to who is going to control the park. They know who sits on the board of management and they have agreed to that, but it does change. They have not agreed to a change in composition of the board. They have not even had a chance to discuss your amendment or your proposal. The worse thing is that nobody even bothered to make two phone calls to the chairperson at Uluru and the chairperson at Kakadu. When you talk about a Northern Territory representative being on the board unless their consent is unreasonably withheld, what does that mean? Have you taken the time to explain to these traditional owners what those words mean? Even for the sake of this parliament, what does that mean?</para><para>Time and time again there have been a number of things that both this government and the Northern Territory government have done, things which Aboriginal people have not agreed with, but they have gone ahead anyway. The government has persisted. So I think at the end of the day the words `unreasonably withheld' will be shown to be meaningless.</para><para>Senator Allison quoted a letter from ATSIC. The other thing she should have learnt from talking to Aboriginal people is that they respect the words of the traditional owners. Gatjil Djerrkura and ATSIC do not speak for the traditional owners of Uluru and Kakadu. If you asked Gatjil Djerrkura, he would verify that. He is a traditional owner from north-east Arnhem Land. He cannot make and would not make decisions about Uluru and Kakudu, and 
 I am sure he would support the traditional owners of Uluru and Kakadu in this stance.</para><para>Last week, in relation to the Jabiluka approval process, when we asked the traditional owners whether they had been consulted by this government and by this company, Yvonne Margarula said to all of us who were present, `They talked to the traditional owners in this area, but we are the ones who count; we own the land. Other traditional owners disagree with us, but they do agree in our right to say what we want to happen with our land.' If you ask Gatjil Djerrkura whether in fact he upheld the views of the boards of management at Uluru and Kakuda, and ask Mick Alderson and Joanne Willmot for their views, they would support the boards of management. I have no doubt on that. I think this view goes more to a general statement about the bill, as opposed to these specific areas. We have received a couple of letters from Kakadu in only the last 24 hours which talk about either stopping or slowing the process of this legislation. They go on to say:</para><para>When the current government came to power, the way of doing business changed in Kakadu and joint management from the inside is now not so good.</para><para>From Uluru, in a letter to Meg Lees, those people say:</para><para>The traditional owners are asking you and other senators not to agree to amendments to do with their land but to delay the passage of the bill.</para><para>They are not saying, `Don't pass it.' What they are saying is, `Delay it.' On behalf of the constituents whom I represent, who have control over these two parks, perhaps what I am saying to you is that this is one area that should just be set aside while you go back and ask them if this is what they want or whether there could be a compromise in order to achieve this. The letter from Uluru goes on to say:</para><para>The minister has misled us by initially declaring that the proposed Bill would not affect the joint management arrangements at all.</para><para>Senator Hill will say, `There is no change.' In the minds of the traditional owners there is a significant change. First of all, they have not been consulted about these changes in the last week. Secondly, they have an arrangement with the Commonwealth that does not involve 
 a state or territory government representative on the board, and they do not understand the words `unreasonably withheld'. You need time to sit down and talk to the traditional owners about that. They go on further to say:</para><para>The bill was then tabled in the House of Representatives before we were aware of its grave implications to existing arrangements.</para><para>They also say:</para><para>The Minister has not agreed to repeated requests for sufficient time to consult properly and negotiate what amounts to the future of joint management.</para><para>I think in this case they are right. They have also raised the fact that they believe there are legal requirements which have not been fulfilled in the process of preparing these new bills. That is not a road which I want to go down, but I do want to impress on people here, particularly on the Democrats and on Senator Hill, that out of the blue we had amendments tabled on Monday night—it does not come as a surprise—where the traditional owners at Kakadu and Uluru know you have been thinking about expanding the membership of the board. They have not ruled it out. They have already put a couple of compromises to you about them having statutory powers to run the park or perhaps increasing their number of representatives. Those compromises are certainly in correspondence that I have received and they are certainly in correspondence that Meg Lees has received—both letters are in front of me.</para><para>These people do not want to shut the gate; neither do these people want to be dictated to and told what the new arrangements are. It is not the way they operate, it is not the way they want to operate and it is not the way they should have to operate because they own that land. That area has been disregarded in all of this. It would be like you leasing your house to some person and a third party coming in to sit on your board of management to help you control that lease arrangement. Unless you had been consulted about that, I would have thought you would be pretty annoyed about it.</para><para>I am trying to impress on you that there is no urgency about this section of the bill. There is no requirement to get this part of the bill through by midnight tonight. The tradi 
 tional owners of these national parks have put their trust in the Commonwealth and have undertaken a lease with the government to run that park. They are now saying, simply, `You want to change our best practice arrangements and you want to change the way in which the park is managed. You want an additional person on that board, but we have not said yes to that.' Mind you, they have not said no outright either. As well, you have not offered them a complementary person, so you are not going to increase the numbers—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">HILL</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—I did.

One of the main concerns emanates from the title. We are asked as a Senate to consider the <inline ref="s197">Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1998 [1999]</inline> , but that title is something which does not satisfactorily reflect the legislation. Once again we have a bodgying up of the process, once again we have an abuse of the rules and once again we have the government trying to conceal something in this legislation that they should really be more up-front about. Once again we have the Australian Democrats as the conspiratorial joint party to this particular deception.</para></talk.start><para>Let me read what the Parliamentary Library say about this legislation. They make some comments about the legislation and about how this bill is described as a `consequential amendment' bill. They say on page 22 of their report:</para><para>The Office of Parliamentary Counsel has advised that although there is no formal limitation on the content or scope of a `consequential amendments' Bill, such a Bill would usually contain provisions required to implement a new legislative scheme and would not normally contain provisions (technical or otherwise) that were unrelated to the scheme's establishment.</para><para>This Bill implements a range of necessary amendments that are consequential to the implementation of the EP&amp;BC Bill. However the Bill also makes a range of other amendments which can be interpreted as substantial new proposals which supplement, rather than arise from, the EP&amp;BC Bill. This raises issues as to the adequacy of consultation and scrutiny of these substantive measures by all relevant stakeholders. On that point, it is notable that the current Bill was not included in the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee's inquiry into the EP&amp;BC Bill 1998 until 24 March 1999. The Committee reported on 27 April 1999.</para><para>They are the two primary concerns. First of all, you have misdescription. You have this legislation described as `consequential' when in essence it is more than consequential. In essence it raises other measures that are of 
 enormous relevance and importance to stakeholders but about which those stakeholders have not had the normal advance notice. More importantly, this bill was sent to the committee late in the process—only three or four weeks before the committee reported.</para><para>These are not minor amendments. They are also reflective of how this legislation has been handled by this government and this parliament. We have had amendments introduced to the major bill and amendments to the consequential bill. Those amendments have been discussed in secret but, in respect of this bill as well as the other, we have not had engagement with industry or with the states, I must say—and the states have an enormous stake in the management of operations under these two bills—and, extremely importantly in respect of this particular consequential provisions bill, we have had no engagement with indigenous Australians. We are not talking about inconsequential amendments; we are talking about consequential amendments. Yesterday Senator Hill said that, if we were serious, we would have given him notice in respect of certain matters before we came in here yesterday.</para><para>Well, if he were serious in respect of this legislation, he would have given us—this parliament—notice as to his amendments before we came in yesterday. So, once again, this legislation is in the same category as the major piece of legislation—that is, there are amendments to it; amendments which have avoided public scrutiny and which have not had sufficient parliamentary scrutiny as well. When you are looking at the process, something like 20 seconds per amendment is totally inadequate parliamentary scrutiny.</para><para>The best assessment of this legislation also comes from the library's <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>. What does this legislation do? It does exactly the sorts of things that we have been talking about for some little while in this place. It affects indigenous people's interest in, stake in and rights on the boards of management of the Kakadu National Park, the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park and the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community council. It appears that, although these issues were raised in the 1998 consultation paper, it was not indicated 
 in the central aspects of the act that changes would be made. So you had indigenous Australians having to take last-minute mercy dashes to appear before the committee to try and defend their positions as to joint management and their concern in respect of the abolition of the position of the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. That is something that we are told has been wound back, but we have not been told the details of that. There were concerns in respect of what they thought would be a compulsory transfer of the lease from the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service to the Commonwealth.</para><para>These matters in themselves are important matters, not consequential on the other legislation, but they were thrown in here primarily, I suppose, because the government was thinking that we would believe it was an after-thought, but they were thrown in here in a way that did not give stakeholders sufficient notice. The concept of the addition of a Northern Territory board member also arises in this consequential legislation. This legislation also affects the traditional use of land and water by Aboriginals. Section 70 provides, in essence, a limitation of rights to those appearing in the current legislation, so we do have some concerns in respect of indigenous Australians.</para><para>We also have concerns as to what this particular legislation does to the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. Not having done enough damage in their primary legislation, the government then seeks to amend the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. The Council of Australian Governments' 1997 heads of agreement provides the policy basis for the proposed EPBC act. It states that the Commonwealth and state heritage ministers would develop a cooperative national heritage protection strategy. The government's environment reform 1998 consultation paper proposed the introduction of a new heritage protection law at a date following the debate on the primary legislation.</para><para>This new heritage legislation has not been introduced in the parliament. Given this, we would deem it inappropriate to remove the links between the Commonwealth environ 
 ment minister and the Australian Heritage Commission in relation to actions that may impact on heritage areas. In order to avoid the creation of a regulatory vacuum on these issues, it may be—and we will be moving amendments to this effect—advisable to continue the operation of the EP(IP) Act in relation to heritage matters until a new heritage regime is introduced.</para><para>We should save the operation of the Heritage Commission Act—our amendments will go to that. But, given the conduct of proceedings in the last 24 hours or so, there is absolutely no way that those substantive amendments will get up. We might get some mealy-mouthed alternative from the Democrats, we may get some promise of a committee or an inquiry down the track—all those sorts of things—but the substantive operation of the Australian Heritage Commission will be affected by this legislation, as will the operation of the world heritage protection act itself. We have in the government's legislation some incremental improvement in respect of the protection of world heritage areas but we also have some monumental wind-back from the currently prevailing law, and we are also seeking to protect those provisions that are about to be affected.</para><para>There are other aspects. There are amendments to the Lands Acquisition Act and there is the repeal of the Biological Control Act 1984, all under the guise of consequential amendments. So we say the government stands condemned because this is not a consequential amendments bill; this does much more than that. We say the government and the Democrats stand condemned because they have entered into an arrangement which does over some substantive rights and some pretty substantial protections in terms of indigenous Australians, world heritage and the AHC. We also say they stand condemned because no-one in here, let alone anyone outside of here, has had enough opportunity to give this legislation adequate scrutiny.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>6157</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The previous speaker in this debate on the <inline ref="s197">Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1998 [1999]</inline>  was absolutely right. Not only are we in the position where we are 
 dealing with a bill which claims to be consequential on the major environment bill that has been debated for much of the day, but also we have been asked by the government to deal with this bill before that environment bill has gone through and before we even know how it is going to be amended. That is an extraordinary situation for the Senate to find itself in. It shows that the government and the Democrats are in a complete mess as far as the handling of this environment legislation is concerned. They do not know what their strategy is. They did bring in the guillotine. They thought that was the end of it and that all this stuff would be finished by half past five this evening, but now they are in a complete mess because people on this side of the house who think differently from the Democrats and the government about the environment have wanted the debate to go on.</para></talk.start><para>Let me just take up what Senator Bolkus said a moment ago about the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. The Australian Heritage Commission was established in the wake of the flooding of Lake Pedder in 1972. There was a national parliamentary inquiry into that disaster by the then Whitlam government in 1974. That inquiry found that never again should the Commonwealth be in the position of not intervening on the loss of heritage of national significance, that such places ought to be listed and that there ought to be a facility for warning the federal government when such heritage, be it natural heritage or cultural heritage, was at risk. As a result of that, the Australian Heritage Commission was established in 1975.</para><para>The commission has had a major role in the defence of Australia's environment since then, even though in the last decade successive governments have tried to wind down its influence and power. I am very well aware that the Heritage Commission was central to the saving of the Franklin River. The Australian Democrats claim a role in that but their role pales into insignificance when compared with the active role of the Australian Heritage Commission at the time. In fact, the Australian Heritage Commission was so active at that stage in alerting politicians and the public to the threats to the Franklin River that no doubt 
 in the collective political memory that was a reason for it being put under strangulating political repression in the years that have followed.</para><para>The legislation that the Democrats and the government are railroading through the chamber today—we will get back onto that later at the committee stage—effectively gets rid of the Australian Heritage Commission and its relevance. But the agreement between the states and the Commonwealth has been that, instead of having the Heritage Commission, there be a joint arrangement. Let me outline how that arrangement would go. Following the meeting of the Council of Australian Government heads in 1997—that is, the state and federal heads—there was an agreement for the Commonwealth and state heritage ministers to develop a cooperative national heritage strategy. Let me interpret that. The arrangement was to get rid of the functions of the Australian Heritage Commission and replace it with ecowaffle—a passing of the buck between Commonwealth and state heritage ministers—which was going to do nothing in particular to protect heritage in the way the 1975 establishment of the Australian Heritage Commission was meant to do.</para><para>The government's environment reform 1998 consultation paper proposed the introduction of a new heritage protection law following the environment bill which the Democrats are pushing through this place today at the behest of the government. This new heritage bill would be the replacement, essentially, for the Australian Heritage Commission and its past good works. But we do not have such a bill. Here we have legislation effectively getting rid of the Australian Heritage Commission on the promise that there will be a Commonwealth-state arrangement to replace it, but there is no replacement. We have a vacuum of that function. It has been abolished. We are back to the flooding of Lake Pedder, thanks to the Democrats supporting the government on this matter.</para><para>We are being asked to support what is called a consequential bill which is nothing of the sort. It is a bill to abolish the Australian Heritage Commission's powers and replace them with nothing at all. I will not be part of 
 that. The Democrats, of course, will be, because they do not even understand what is in this consequential bill. They are more interested in their moment of power at the Howard table of power. They are more interested in selling out any environmental principle that will get in the way of them keeping that seat at the table. They are more interested in trying to put a gloss on the environmental disaster that they are delivering through this parliament to the people of Australia in these terrible days for the environment. If an arrangement has been made between the states and the Commonwealth to look after matters of national heritage importance—if this cooperative national strategy has been established—I ask Senator Woodley, who is the only Democrat in the chamber, to get up and explain what it is.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—You are the only Green.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Senator Abetz intervenes from the other side of the chamber, but he does not know either. We could ask him to get up and explain this alternative that we are supposed to accept as coming into place which is not mentioned anywhere in the bill. It is a wing and a prayer, or at least a promise that we are supposed to accept coming from the chainsaw driven offices of the minister for the environment or, as we now have it, the subservient hand on the chainsaw gang of Democrat senators who have sold out so comprehensively on the environment these last few days. I know that no Democrat will explain to the Senate what they are doing, for the simple reason that they do not know. They have abrogated their policies; they have dumped their policies. In the vacuum that that leaves, they are simply reliant on Howard government environmental policies. That is the measure of their strength of commitment to the environment these days.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Democrats are prepared to guillotine this bill but they do not have the foggiest about how to explain why we should be voting for a situation where the Australian Heritage Commission goes west and the promised replacement is nowhere to be seen. We are in this extraordinary situation on another matter—biological control. We are being asked to deal with legislation which 
 gets rid of the effects of the Biological Control Act 1984 because they are no longer appropriate, but we have not yet dealt with those amendments to the environment protection bill. We have this extraordinary situation, this remarkable failure of process by the Democrats. There is not even a Democrat adviser in the place. They have fled altogether to try to work out what this bill is about, because they were not ready for it.</para><para>They were depending on the so-called environment protection bill—I would call it the environment wreckage bill—being passed. It has not been passed because they have been outmanoeuvred this afternoon by the people on this side of the chamber. The guillotine was not dropped on debate on that important environment legislation at 5 o'clock because, despite the combined brains of the government and the Democrats, they still did not see what was coming and they were outmanoeuvred. That outmanoeuvring means that the environment protection bill has not gone through. We do not know what the outcome is going to be, but here are the Democrats asking us to abolish the biological control provisions which the Commonwealth currently has in place. They have not replaced them with anything. They talk about how they want biodiversity protected in this country, but they are getting rid of control mechanisms and so far they have put nothing else in their place.</para><para>That is why they are such environmental puppies. As I said yesterday, they have rushed around the room barking at everybody and then jumped onto the first lap available. They are political poodles. Of course, the first lap available was Senator Hill's. Last week on the GST it was the Prime Minister's, with room also on Mr Costello's. But the Democrats do not know what they are doing, except for this: they do know that there is an open door at the end of the green carpeted corridor, on the occasions when it suits the government, where they can sit and feel important. And they will trash any policy to keep that door open and they have trashed many a policy in the last few days. We have this extraordinary situation where, having got rid of protection mechanisms which have been developed over recent 
 decades, as of this moment they have nothing to replace them with.</para><para>We do not know whether or not the amendments to the environment protection bill are going to go through. We have no way of knowing that. It would be quite irresponsible of us to deal with this so-called consequential bill which abolishes the existing protection for the environment until we know what is going to happen with the major bill, which the Democrats are supporting the government to get through. That is the extraordinary tangle we have got into. Maybe it is worth recalling that time-honoured quote:</para><para>Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive.</para><para>The Democrats have practised to deceive those people who voted for them—the environmentalists; a million Australians who thought that they would stand by the environment; people all across this country who thought that the Democrats' record would be good. Can you imagine what would have happened to the Democrats if their sell out over the last fortnight on their social and environmental principles had been known to the electorate last October? They would have been decimated. I have to admit to being one of the millions of Australians who is gobsmacked by the way in which they have dropped every founding principle of the party to get to the table of power. That is what they have done, but I am not going to be one who supports this piece of legislation and leaves a vacuum. There may be a vacuum of Democrat policy; there is now a vacuum of Democrat principle.</para><para>There is now a failure to understand the almighty consequences of what they have done by Senator Lees, Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Bourne from New South Wales, Senator Woodley and Senator Bartlett from Queensland, and Senator Murray from Western Australia. There is a vacuum of appreciation of what they have done, but they are sticking with it because they want to be counted as one of the big players. As one of those senators said to a business lunch, as reported in the national media a couple of weeks ago, they are flushed not only with the new sense of power but also with the prospect 
 now of getting some of the kick-backs—that is, donations—that come from the corporate sector when you do the right thing, as far as vested interests are concerned in this place. The Democrats are moving from being a party of the people and the environment to being creatures of the big end of town. That is what this is all about.</para><para>However, when such revolutions in process occur, there are glitches and one is occurring right now. I note that Senator Lees has come into the chamber and therefore I expect that we are going to have a clearing of the air by Senator Lees as to what has happened to the Australian Heritage Commission's powers; why there is no replacement; and why she is asking the Senate to effectively abolish the powers of the Australian Heritage Commission and replace them with nothing else at this particular juncture on this Wednesday afternoon in June 1999.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>6160</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have just listened for about 20 minutes to an assault on the Australian Democrats by the sole Tasmanian Green in this chamber.

But I would just kindly remind him that, on page 11 of the explanatory memorandum, he might find some of the answers to the questions that he posed in a rhetorical way. If he had spent more time studying the legislation and the explanatory memorandum, he might have been in a position of not having to devote so much of his 20 minutes to a wholesale assault on the Australian Democrats.</para></talk.start><para>The bill that we are considering is the  Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1998 [1999] . This bill continues the process of Commonwealth environmental legislation. Labor and the Greens used to talk big about the environment, but they failed to deliver. What they cannot abide is the fact that, since the Howard government was elected, there has been a program of environmental reform in this country not witnessed 
 before. Of course, the Natural Heritage Trust is one of the examples of environmental reform in this country. It has delivered millions of dollars for repair to the environment—a project never thought of by Labor or the Greens but one that we were able to do because we were willing to forgo the public ownership of Telstra to ensure that something more important remained within our grasp; that is, the environment of this country. So the Natural Heritage Trust is part of our environment reform program, as is the Green Corps—a fantastic program that has delivered environmental repair throughout the breadth of this nation.</para><para>But has Senator Brown acknowledged the wonderful work of the Natural Heritage Trust? Does he acknowledge the wonderful work of all those volunteers in the Green Corps, who actually do something for the environment? Absolutely not. Senator Brown locks himself away in his rooms and dreams up these speeches. I have to say that I think the dreaming has lapsed somewhat of late because it is the same speech repeated time and time again. It is becoming a bit boring. All we ever get to hear about is a chainsaw. In fact, he is starting to sound like a chainsaw—that repetitive buzz and the noise do not make much sense, except in Senator Brown's mind; most of his contributions these days are not to build up but to destroy.</para><para>We have the Natural Heritage Trust and we have the Green Corps program. What else have we done for the environment? We have the wonderful Regional Forest Agreement that, for the first time in this country's history, has balanced conservation and the needs of the forest communities who get a living from the forests. Let us not forget that what we harvest from the forests is in fact a renewable resource. If you do not have the timber harvesting, what do you have?

Firstly, it will provide for the repeal of the five acts to be replaced by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999] .

It makes sense to have this reform of environmental legislation. Secondly, the bill puts in place savings and arrangements for a smooth transition from the processes that are in place under the existing acts, including environmental assessment and permitting arrangements to the new schemes established under the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999] .</para><para>Thirdly, the bill also amends Commonwealth government legislation that is affected either by the repeal of the five acts or by the content of the proposed  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999] . This bill, together with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998, provides a new environmental law regime which enables the Commonwealth to join with the states in providing a truly national scheme of environmental protection and biodiversity conservation, recognising our responsibility to not only this but also future generations.</para><para>What this legislation is about is trying to ensure that we as a federation cooperate with the states on environmental issues, rather than taking the sledgehammer approach like Senator Brown, who could not win the debates in his home state of Tasmania and therefore had to seek federal intervention to win them.

I think it is an extraordinary motion to propose to the chamber. It is extraordinary on many counts. One of the most outstanding counts is that this is a procedural motion to deal with the repudiation of decisions made 
 by this chamber before now in this debate. This is the debate on the government's tax package, the so-called headline GST package. We do not even have before us at this stage a running sheet for this debate; we have no running sheet whatsoever. The running sheet that we have is the running sheet that was left over when we terminated the debate after the famous speech by Senator Harradine in which he said he could not bring himself to support the government's legislation. That is the running sheet before us.</para></talk.start><para>One reads in the press that a deal has been done between the Australian Democrats and the government to alter the tax package considerably. That deal substantially changes the nature of the proposition that we had before us. We did not see the amendments that give legislative voice to that deal until late last night. We saw one of them then and some have dribbled out during the day. We did not receive an explanatory memorandum until quite late in the day. There are 119 of these amendments—so it is not an insubstantial number—and we have no proposal as to how they should be dealt with in this chamber. I would have thought that that was a matter of considerable importance in terms of parliamentary procedure.</para><para>Before we move to motions about how we will conduct a parliamentary debate on the Democrat-government GST deal, we are, I am sure, reasonably entitled to have some explanation by either the government or, if they are too afraid of making it, the Australian Democrats as to what the proposition is. We remember the Prime Minister saying, when asked whether he would remove food from the GST—and these were his words—`No, no, no, no, no.' Apparently, he has agreed to do so, but what explanation has been afforded to this legislative chamber, the Australian Senate, as to what the package is now? There has been no explanation. All we have had is the parliamentary secretary moving a motion about procedure so he can knock off things that this chamber has decided to do previously in this debate. There has been no explanation at all as to the substance of the matter. This is a contemptuous attitude towards the powers of the Senate.</para><para>I would be disappointed if the Democrats supported this procedure without there being any explanation to the chamber. If there is one thing the Democrats are famous for it is for insisting, in speech after speech, year in, year out, in every parliamentary sitting that I have sat through for the last 16 years, that this chamber should be afforded the opportunity of greater and proper scrutiny. In fact, Meg Lees's second reading speech to this chamber chided the government for not allowing proper parliamentary scrutiny in the time allotted to this debate in the chamber.</para><para>Are the Democrats going to be compliant in ramming a procedural motion down our throat in the absence of any explanation at all? Are they going to repudiate years of so-called Democrat principle that this chamber is entitled to scrutiny and explanation? What sort of complacency do we expect from a government that has done this deal and, in effect, says to us in this chamber, `Read about it in the paper. We just want to move on. And, by the way, we haven't got a running sheet and, by the way, we don't know whether all of the amendments are before us yet and, by the way, we're not going to tell you a damn thing about it'?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Calm down.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—No, you calm down, parliamentary secretary.

If this is going to be the government's attitude to this debate, it will be a very rancorous debate, because this is an abuse of power. This is a conscription of the Democrats to the will of the executive and a standing over of the rights of this chamber.

I cannot anyway: I only get five minutes. Senator Cook is right. I think the Manager of Government Business in the Senate has assumed that everyone knows the reasons for his moving the motion. I think he should have at least outlined them. Apart from an explanation, we probably should have 
 had an apology. What this motion does, in effect, is say, `I'm sorry we have wasted the parliament's time by going through the committee stage for 40 hours or so.' Senator Campbell indicated today, in an earlier burst of rhetoric, that we have spent 40 hours or so on the committee stage of the bill. The effect of this motion is to scrap it all.</para></talk.start><para>Technically, this motion is probably required because, in order to consummate the deal between the government and the Democrats, the government virtually have to move the same amendments as the Democrats moved and absorb them as their own, and standing orders do not allow that to occur. Senator Campbell could have explained that to us. He could have said, `I'm sorry for wasting the committee's time for 44½ hours. We misjudged our negotiating stance. We put all our eggs in Senator Harradine's basket. The moment that fell through, we had to run and cut a deal with the Democrats and agree to amendments that we had already crushed, defeated, in this chamber.' That is, I believe, the effect of all this.</para><para>Senator Cook is right: the manager should have given us a more adequate explanation. What we will see happening over the next four days is the government supporting concepts and amendments that it had previously indicated it would oppose in this chamber. Of course, that is a humiliating backflip for the government. Nevertheless, it is a course it has chosen. I am not sure whether we were given notice of this procedural motion. Maybe when he sums up the debate the manager will indicate whether he notified us of this motion in advance.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—We gave notice of it.

Senator Campbell should fess up and admit that this is necessary because of the dramatic change of course with the negotiations with the Democrats. We might then be able to proceed to a vote on it. I am not sure the opposition would seek to 
 divide on this matter. I will seek the guidance of others. Nevertheless, a better and more adequate explanation of this matter may have facilitated the time of the chamber.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>6230</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think the points have been made by the opposition in so far as the inadequacies of the explanation given for the proposal that has been put forward by way of a contingent notice of motion. I think we need to appreciate that there may well be a majority in the chamber for this proposition because I would not have expected Senator Campbell to have put it forward, with such obvious slight regard for explanation, if he did not think there were sufficient numbers to support it. Given the events of today and that there has obviously been support given by a majority of senators to the government in proceeding these questions, I do think it is important to get some questions drawn to the attention of the Senate. It was only recently that Senator Lees lectured the Senate on their approach in their relationship with this government.</para></talk.start><para>I recall, for instance, that just last year she said that she thought the government's:</para><para>. . . contempt for parliament does not stop with the bullying of the Speaker by Messrs Howard and Mr Reith. It runs far deeper than that.</para><para>She then indicated that, on the question of the government's approach to parliamentary processes:</para><para>The very same bullying tactics adopted by the Prime Minister against his own Speaker are regularly employed to downgrade the status and powers of the Senate.</para><para>She went on to indicate a number of examples and particularly indicated her concern about attempts to pre-empt the decisions of the Senate in a number of ways. I think that what has occurred in recent times on this issue highlights the action now being taken up. There are none so zealous as those who have been converted to a position and we will no doubt be able to demonstrate that over the coming four days. I am reminded that it was Senator Lees who said that:</para><para>It is no secret that this thuggish government—and I stress the word thuggish because that is what it is—has set it sights on the independence of the Senate, the body described the former Auditor- 
 General John Taylor as the last effective brake on executive government.</para><para>She then went on to say that:</para><para>This government has shown far greater contempt for this parliament than any government in memory. Democracy and the people of Australia are the losers if this government with its born-to-rule mentality succeeds in avoiding the checks and balances provided by the parliament. Australia will not be served by a parliament that cannot hold the government to account, that does not provide a balanced and fair forum for debate on day-to-day issues, that does not provide a pressure valve for the public to actually have a say to express its views on government proposals that are either plainly wrong or unpopular.</para><para>I would have thought those sentiments apply quite directly to the proposition before us today and of course apply in general to the questions that are being raised about the unanswered and unexplained nature of the arrangements entered into between this government and the Australian Democrats on the GST. I think and I would hope that Senator Campbell might have learnt something from the experience of today and would seek to explain to this chamber, in a great deal more depth and clarity, what the government is seeking to achieve and the reasons for it. On the basis of the actions that we have seen, it is quite apparent that this government is most anxious to avoid scrutiny, as are the Democrats.</para><para>They are anxious to avoid being held accountable for the arrangements that they have made, which will have far-reaching consequences for many hundreds of thousands of Australians in areas that in past the Democrats were said have represented. I speak specifically of those people with whom I am in close contact, particularly those concerned with educational issues. I say to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that it would be appropriate to explain what he is intending to do on these measures and it would be appropriate for the Democrats to come clean on the nature of the arrangements that they have made to impose upon this country a most unpopular and unwarranted GST.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>6231</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by 
 leave—I thought that this was a fairly simple proposition. I gave what I thought was a quite clear explanation on it. In plain English, it means that under standing orders 118(2), if the Senate has made a decision about an amendment, you cannot revisit that amendment in the same debate. I think that rule applies generally to most meetings and meeting procedures throughout the world, not only in the Senate. We are seeking to suspend that. I gave notice of it some time ago so that the whole world, including all senators, would know about it. In fact, if those honourable senators who are interested turn to page 28 of today's <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> , they will see that the proposition that we are dealing with is clearly set out on that page.</para></talk.start><para>I make this point because I have been asked to go into more detail. I have said in plain English that this effectively means that you can re-put an amendment that has been voted on that is the same or substantially the same and have it voted on again. I am reliably told that the one matter this specifically and definitely applies to—and there are some amendments that are similar and so it may apply to those—is an amendment in relation to acupuncture. The whole debate we are having now is potentially related to just one amendment in relation to acupuncture. I suspect those people who find relief from stress in acupuncture could do with a bit after a day like today in the Senate.</para><para>I do not know whether that answer will satisfy the opposition or any other senators, but that explains why we are doing it. Quite clearly, we need to revisit the acupuncture amendment and of course some others, and this gives the Senate the power to do that. I do not think that giving a contingent notice, having it published in the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> to be brought on when the bill comes back on, is any sort of hijacking; it is certainly not meant to be. The reason you give notice of things and bring them on at the appropriate time is so that no ambushes can take place, and I certainly did not seek to do that at all.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>6231</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I seek to put a question to the parliamentary secretary 
 which might expedite this matter. I would like to also direct it to Senator Murray, representing the Australian Democrats. The question is: does the government or the Australian Democrats, or do both of them conjointly, propose to make an explanation to the Senate as to what they have now done and how they intend to proceed in terms of the changes they have made? I ask the question because these are substantive changes. This is not anything like the same bill we were considering before. In the normal course there would be a second reading speech to at least make an explanation about the global changes that are being made. We would have a chance, at least, to respond to that and have a process that we are well attuned to in order to conduct the proper processes of scrutiny. But just to assume that we resume as if nothing has happened and that we understand everything that occurs off-stage, out of this chamber, through the media is, I think, somewhat contemptuous. I just ask the question: is it intended that an appropriate explanation will be made to the Senate as to why these measures, in which we clothe the Senate with the power to expunge decisions that it has already made, are being sought?

Secondly, I have in my right hand at least one, if not more, explanatory memoranda, which I will table as soon as we get into committee. I am not allowed to do it before then.

I am also assured by the Assistant Treasurer, who will have carriage of the bills—I am only carrying these procedural matters—and whom I trust implicitly and have enormous respect for, that he will give, in his normal style, an eloquent explanation which I am fairly certain will satisfy you.

Those have been increased, so you are dealing with the same issue but a different set of numbers. On Commonwealth-state financial relations, we believed that those did need to be reformed in the manner that the government intended, but the consequence is that some items have been left in and out. None of these matters that I am outlining to you, Senator Cook, are insubstantial—and I think that is your point. They are substantial and they matter. But they fall within the intent that the government had originally put to the people.

I thought that, prior to getting into the detail of the amendments and concluding the amendment which is now before the chair, I would make a short statement which provided an overview of what is now intended.</para></talk.start><para>Following yesterday's final agreement between the government and the Australian Democrats, the government will now move forward with the legislation to reform the Australian tax system. I welcome the involvement of the Democrats in the tax reform, which we believe and which they believe is in Australia's national interest. In contrast, of course, Labor does have a policy vacuum on tax reform. I think that has been well revealed during the debate so far.</para><para>I can inform the Senate that the government will be proceeding with all key elements of its tax reform package. A 10 per cent GST will be introduced from 1 July 2000, with basic food to be GST free. Personal income tax cuts targeted at low and middle income earners will be maintained. This means that the government will keep its commitment to ensure that over 80 per cent of taxpayers face a marginal tax rate of only 30 per cent. There will be some paring back of the proposed tax cuts for taxpayers earning over $50,000 per 
 annum, but significant benefits are retained. In addition to the tax cuts, generous compensation for the introduction of the GST through improved family assistance and the social security benefits will be enhanced.</para><para>The government has agreed to some changes in the GST and the diesel excise reforms. These have been well publicised over recent days. Reforms to diesel will proceed and legislation was introduced yesterday in the other place to enhance the existing diesel fuel rebate scheme and to establish a new diesel and alternative fuel grants scheme for on-road fuels. As a result of the benefits being delivered through a grants scheme, diesel credits will be taken out of the GST system.</para><para>The government has circulated amendments arising out of discussions with the Democrats, clarifying how the GST will apply to food, health, education and the financial services sector. I will not, obviously, in the interests of time go through all of the amendments, as we will have an opportunity to debate them. However, I will point out the following.</para><para>As a result of food being GST free, most food items will fall in price. The legislation provides that food for human consumption will be GST free, except for (1) savoury snacks, confectionery, ice-cream, biscuits and certain beverages currently subject to wholesale sales tax; (2) bakery products other than bread; and (3) prepared food, including take-away foods and food supplied by restaurants.</para><para>The health amendments include the following. Products on schedule 2 and the standard for the uniform scheduling of drugs and poisons will be GST free, including smaller packs of pain relievers identical to schedule 2 products. Under this amendment, over-the-counter pain relievers will be GST free. The range of health professionals who may provide GST-free health services will be expanded to include appropriately qualified naturopaths, acupuncturists and herbalists. Certain public health goods will also be GST free, by way of ministerial determination—subject to the approval of the ministerial council. Initially, the government will seek the inclusion of sunscreens, folate supplements, condoms and personal lubricants as GST-free public health goods. </para><para>The education amendments include the following. Adult and community education courses likely to develop employment related skills will be GST free. First-aid or life-saving courses offered by non-profit bodies will be GST free. To address concerns raised concerning compliance costs of school based organisations, school tuckshops will be given an option to be input taxed.</para><para>With respect to financial services, the government has agreed to allow partial input tax credits to purchasers of a specified list of services used by enterprises making financial supplies. This measure will particularly benefit smaller organisations in the financial sector, such as credit unions, which operate with a large range of outsourced activities.</para><para>Other amendments put in place are increased compensation measures, enhanced family assistance arrangements and changes to the income tax scales.

We are being guillotined and required to complete the debate within the hour set by this chamber in a collusion between the Australian Democrats and the coalition. It is the government's bill but a bill which has 
 been substantially altered to suit Democrat convenience, because of the principled position of Senator Harradine.</para></talk.start><para>We know that the government sought to persuade Senator Harradine to vote for the original package. It was only after Senator Harradine made what by now must be a famous speech—the `I cannot' speech—that the government knew for certain that it did not have the numbers to allow its legislation to pass in this chamber. As a consequence of that, as the opportunists that they have now been revealed to be, the Australian Democrats proceeded to `negotiate with' as they call it—but by any other standards it would be `sell out to'—the government on a range of tax measures that we now have fetched up on our shore for debate this evening.</para><para>We participate under protest because there is a straitjacket on this debate. We participate under protest because a guillotine has been introduced. We participate under protest because the amendments that give voice to the changes that have been agreed between the Australian Democrats and the government have not been given to us with sufficient notice. I note in passing that the committee stage of this debate was delayed for a day or two so that the Democrats could get ready, even though they had had significant notice, as we had had, of the changes that the government had proposed—some 218 changes, at that stage.</para><para>No such courtesy is extended to us on this occasion. The fact that the Democrats have had prior notice of the amendments and that they and the government circularised the press gallery last night before releasing those amendments to the opposition for scrutiny does indicate not only a degree of concern about news management—so that proper scrutiny can be avoided and the government's and Democrats' preferred spin can be imparted on these amendments—but also a contempt for this chamber and the processes of this chamber, in that the amendments were given to the press before they were given to honourable senators. They were held back until late in the piece—and then not all of them—and now there are 119 of them. And now the explanatory memorandum dribbles out late at 
 this stage, so that when this debate kicks off there is not even the dignity of this chamber having a running sheet before it.

What the media in this place was telling us and everyone else—and they reported it, in fact, this morning—was that the Democrat party room pored over the amendments and ticked them off finally. Maybe then the formal amendments were generated, and so you are technically right, Senator. But I have to say that you will excuse me if there is a fair degree of cynicism that you did not know what the amendments would contain until 10.20 last night. We certainly did not. I accept your acknowledgment now that you did. And that was indeed my point.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The point is: for proper debate and scrutiny in this chamber, polite and reasonable notice should be extended. That is a principle the Democrats have insisted on and it is a principle that we have tried to acknowledge and accommodate, but it is not extended to us on this occasion and that is why, under protest, we participate in the early bringing on of these bills in this manner. I think it is ludicrous to expect that we are in a position to respond properly and appropriately in all of the circumstances, given the shortage of notice, the inadequate supply of information and the conspiracy that has been entered into to put the favourable spin by the government on the legislation.</para><para>I am not alone in saying those things. This morning at the Park Hyatt in Melbourne, at a small business breakfast, the Premier of Victoria, Jeffrey Kennett, went on to say how sad it is that this legislation is coming forward and how sad it is that it has changed all the things he believed the coalition—and he is a leader of a state branch of the principal party—stood for. He made a very powerful speech which I recommend the Democrats read, because this is the beginning of the Howard alibi.</para><para>If these changes are made—and I suspect they will be, as I apprehend the numbers in the chamber to do so—and if the compliance cost difficulties start to bite, as they will, and if the unintended consequences that always emerge in rushed legislation begin to surface, this government will disown the Australian Democrats at a speed of a million miles an hour. They will hang the albatross of `It is the Democrats' legislation, not ours' around their neck. Jeffrey Kennett started the process this morning by saying, `Blame the Democrats for all of these changes. Blame the Democrats for the increase in compliance costs. Blame the Democrats for the confusion and for not having a wide enough tax base. Blame the Democrats for the problems that we in the states will experience if this legislation goes through.' That only echoes what Mr Howard has said.</para><para>But I make that point in passing because the more devastating criticism has been made by Professor Peter Dixon from the Monash Centre of Economic Studies. He put out a paper yesterday in which he made the obvious point: what is the information base upon which this ill-gotten conglomeration of changes is being made? Do we know the economic impact of this new series of changes? Do we know whether it has been modelled? Is that information available? Are we being asked to legislate blindfolded as to the impacts? The Democrats, and I think rightly, take some pride in causing in this chamber a majority viewpoint about an inquiry into the GST. That was a valuable inquiry, and that has been acknowledged by all parties, except by a reluctant government burdened by the penetration of some real insight into the 
 clouded myopia of propaganda that they had spread about their ANTS package. Everyone else welcomed it.</para><para>But what do we know about the economic implications of this in the public domain? We have not been told anything. No modelling has been set out. No macro-economic parameters have been published. What is the impact on employment? What is the impact on growth? What is the impact on our trade balance? What is the impact on people on low and middle incomes? Nothing. Silence. Do the Democrats step forward to enlighten us? No, they do not. The big advocates of proper scrutiny are silent on this point, absent without leave from the field.</para><para>I make those observations because Professor Dixon goes on to find, on reasonable research available to him and on papers and studies published between now and when the last study was done, that the impact of this set of changes will be adverse to the national economy, unemployment will increase and there will be slower growth.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—What absolute rubbish!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—Why don't you shut up!

The covering letter told me that the pack contained a discussion paper on the principles of corporate governance as they apply to Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies, and it makes very interesting reading. It states that the definitions of corporate governance are many and varied, but there are some key elements and they are: the transparency of corporate structures and operations; the implementation of effective risk management and internal control systems; and the accountability of the board to stakeholders through clear and timely disclosure. And, of course, Commonwealth authorities and companies are accountable to parliament.</para></talk.start><para>The ANAO paper also states that `the board can only fulfil its responsibilities if it meets regularly and collectively with clear agendas and records decisions and outcomes'. I might add these are basic rules that one would expect from the local sporting club, let alone a Commonwealth authority or company. One would certainly expect these processes to apply to the board of any statutory authority. The discussion paper specifically goes to the operation of boards. It also states that `the effectiveness of board meetings is dependent on carefully planned agendas and providing board papers and materials to directors sufficiently prior to board meetings' and that `it is important that minutes accurately record outcomes from meetings'. Again, this sounds basic, but it is also very important.</para><para>In relation to a corporate code of conducts for boards, the ANAO paper states:</para><para>The board and senior management are responsible for promoting high ethics and integrity standards.</para><para>It also says:</para><para>The language, attitudes and actions of directors and senior management affect the integrity, ethics, values and other aspects of corporate culture.</para><para>The reason for my interest in this paper and my heightened interest in corporate governance relates to recent estimates hearings of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee—specifically, the evidence given to that committee by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</para><para>There are two issues flowing from those hearings that I wish to address. They are: the circumstances surrounding the appointment of a member of that board to a senior management position within that organisation; and also the manner in which the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board conducts its business. When both of these matters are considered against the standards outlined by the Auditor-General, Mr Barrett, I believe there is significant reason for concern. In fact, the evidence given during those hearings in relation to both these matters may require further investigation by the Senate and certainly requires urgent action by the minister, Mr Anderson.</para><para>Over the past couple of years the structure of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority has gone through a number of changes. The explanation for this probably lies in the instability in both the board and senior management over that period. The current management structure was settled around July last year. It consists of three main units: safety compliance, safety standards, and safety promotion. In addition, there is a corporate services area. These new management arrangements were debated by the board over a period of time. All board members were involved. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority Director, Mr Toller, told the committee on 6 May that no directors absented themselves from this process.</para><para>According to the CASA annual report for 1997-98, the board members at that time were Mr Dick Smith, Dr Paul Scully-Power, Mr Bruce Byron, Mr Michael Ryan, Mr Tony Pyne, Mr John Pyke and Mr Laurie Foley. Mr Foley was appointed to the CASA board on 8 May 1997, the same day as Mr Dick Smith was appointed. In fact, Mr Foley was appointed on the basis of Mr Smith's recommenda 
 tion to the then Minister for Transport, Mr Sharp. The board not only was actively involved in the development of this new structure but it also approved a process for recruiting senior staff to fill the newly created positions.</para><para>A key player in this process was Mr Wes Willoughby. Mr Willoughby was a regional manager in the Civil Aviation Authority, and he took a redundancy package some time around 1991. Obviously, he worked for that authority until 1991. He came back to this organisation as a consultant, I understand on the recommendation of Mr Dick Smith, on 7 August 1997. His initial work, at a rate of $1,000 a day, was with an American, Mr Brodrick. His contract was then extended by Mr Smith.</para><para>In addition to the base rate of $1,000 a day, Mr Willoughby was paid $200 an hour plus expenses to advise Mr Smith. I understand that those expenses included accommodation, travel, weekend fares from Canberra to Melbourne and Melbourne to Canberra for himself and his wife, as well as access to a car. Mr Willoughby, who I understand to be a competent officer, did well from those arrangements. In fact, for the month of July that year he was paid $57,684. I learnt that from an answer to a question from Senator Mackay to Mr Toller, the Chief Executive Officer of CASA, in estimates on 6 May this year. According to Mr Toller, the current structure was formally approved by the CASA board some time prior to May last year. He thought it was around February.</para><para>A company trading as Spencer Stuart was engaged to assist with the recruitment process. According to Mr Toller, this company had been engaged by CASA before. Spencer Stuart had a close relationship with Mr Willoughby. On 7 April Mr Willoughby sought board approval to engage a recruitment firm to fill the new executive position. The matter was settled by the board in a closed session on 15 April. There was no tender process but a call for expressions of interest on that same day.</para><para>A decision was taken to engage Spencer Stuart on 24 April, just nine days later. I understand that, over a period of time, Mr 
 Foley also had a number of dealings with Spencer Stuart, along with a fellow board member, Mr Bryce Byron. So there appears to have been a close relationship between this company, Mr Willoughby and Mr Foley before it was given the contract to provide candidates for key positions under the new structure. The contract with Spencer Stuart was signed on 5 May, but that company commenced work on the consultancy well before that. Mr Toller told estimates that this was because the company was given verbal advice that it had the job some time between 24 and 28 April.</para><para>Mr Foley had advised Spencer Stuart that he was available for work early in 1998. This occurred while he and his fellow board members were developing a new CASA structure and, along with it, a number of new senior positions. Mr Foley participated in the selection process that led to the appointment of that company. He then approved, along with the other members of the CASA board, the engagement of Spencer Stuart, but it appears Mr Foley had not advised the board of that obvious conflict of interest. He continued to be an active participant in the work of the board even though he had a direct and significant personal interest in the outcomes of a number of matters that the board had before it.</para><para>Mr Foley met with Spencer Stuart on 5 May to discuss his candidacy for one of the positions that that company was seeking to fill—that is, he met with the headhunter he had helped to appoint to discuss his interest in one of the positions he had helped to create. Again, he failed to advise his fellow board members of his actions. Two days later Mr Foley told Mr Wheatley from Spencer Stuart that he was a candidate for one of those positions, but again he did not advise the board of his decision.</para><para>At a board meeting on 15 May, the process to be followed in interviewing candidates for these jobs and the role of the board in that process was discussed. The process was to involve the establishment of a number of panels with a member of the board sitting on each panel. Mr Foley told the board he was not able to participate in that process, but he 
 did not advise the board members why he was unavailable. I asked Mr Toller, who was present at the 15 May meeting of the board, whether or not Mr Foley told his fellow board members why he would not sit on any selection panels. Mr Toller said Mr Foley gave no reason at that time. There is a lot more to this story and, given that my time is about to elapse, I advise the Senate that I intend to resume this story at the next available opportunity.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Population Policy</title><title>Immigration</title><page.no>6240</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>6240</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Few would argue that Australia's long-term social, cultural and economic development are all inextricably linked to the size and make-up of the nation's population. This is a topic which I think deserves greater attention than it gets. As an example, critical mass in the national population is an important although often underresearched issue in identifying a pool of people capable of developing technological skills. Without a critical mass, a talent pool is something that other nations will claim at Australia's expense. The United States has recognised this and has aggressive recruitment programs to encourage young and talented people from other countries to take up opportunities in the United States and even to settle there permanently to build the country's knowledge base. I think it rings alarm bells for us.</para></talk.start><para>The forces that change our population are natural increase and migration. A fertility rate of 2.2 children per female would be required for the population to replace itself. The current Australian fertility rate is 1.85 children per female. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has based its population projections on assumed fertility rates, ranging from 1.6 to 1.75 births per woman by 2005-06 and then remaining constant. According to the ABS projections, the rate of population growth in 2051 would be between 0.0 per cent and 0.3 per cent, compared with around 1.2 per cent in 1997. A fertility rate of between 1.65 and 1.8 and net migration of between 60,000 and 100,000 per year would result in a stationary 
 population of between 24 million and 26 million by around 2037.</para><para>There have been many expert and, indeed, other opinions, and they are divided on what might be an ideal population target. The reality is that Australia has a below replacement fertility rate and has had for more than 20 years, and there are no signs that this trend will change. The infusion of youth into our population structure has therefore been declining for some time, and I think this is a serious issue for our future economy. The capacity for natural increase to sustain population increase is really collapsing. Moreover, as we have heard so often, our population is ageing. Under current trends, the population aged 65 and over will increase by 100,000 a year in the decades to 2031, and the population aged 65 and over will rise from 12 per cent in 1997 to 22 per cent by the year 2031.</para><para>The prospects through to the middle of the next century are for a major escalation in aged dependency for Australia. That is hardly news, but Australia, by default, is drifting towards a position of negligible population growth. By doing that, we risk closing the doors to advances such as those enjoyed in earlier times of spectacular growth in this country.</para><para>Any discussion on population inevitably raises the matter of immigration, a topic on which opinions legitimately differ. Some environmental groups, for example, have taken the view that Australia should adopt a policy of zero net overseas migration. Business and industry bodies, on the other hand, have argued the case very strongly for a very substantial increase in the immigration intake in order to increase growth and reduce the impact of the ageing population. Some have talked about population targets of 50 million in 50 years time. I am not arguing for that target, but I think it would be unrealistic not to acknowledge that many Australians have deeply held concerns on a number of migration issues, and we need to address them. Equally, it is difficult, in my view, to find any sustainable arguments against a well-researched and properly thought out population policy that will meet our needs, aspirations and national goals for the next couple of 
 decades. This will mean maintaining the community's confidence in our migration program.</para><para>I think it is worth looking back a little bit. It is undeniable that the modern history of Australian society has been built on successive waves of immigration, first from England, then from Europe and more recently from Asia. Each wave has brought with it new and profound social, political and cultural influences. The tide of postwar immigration has transformed Australia into a nation with an open and vibrant economy, a strong services sector and greatly improved health and education facilities. But where do we stand now on the immigration front? There has been a lot of water under the bridge, but immigration rates have been falling since the 1980s. Before that, immigration typically contributed more than one per cent to Australia's population each year—now it is less than half that. This trend is taking place at the same time as birth rates of the non-immigrant population are declining.</para><para>The rather stark reality of our declining population base is ample reason for us to rethink our attitude to migration as being both positive and necessary to maximise Australia's potential. The critical questions are what sort of migration will not only swell our numbers but also make a positive contribution to Australia's productive base, and what policies will encourage migrant settlement outside crowded metropolitan areas where environmental pressures already threaten the fabric of our major cities.</para><para>If we are to encourage increased migration to Australia—and I am certainly in that camp of persons who think we should—we need to give very careful thought to policies that will assist regional development by encouraging a much more balanced distribution of the migrant intake. Until recently—and, indeed, to a large extent, this still obtains—the settlement patterns of migrants, including skilled and business migrants, has been heavily skewed towards settlement in and around Australia's largest metropolitan centres. The patterns tend to exacerbate Australia's population concentration, particularly in Sydney, 
 which receives about 40 per cent of the migrant intake each year.</para><para>The contrast with other cities is very interesting. South Australia, which has some 8.3 per cent of Australia's population, attracts between four and five per cent of Australia's new settlers. Tasmania has some 2.7 per cent of Australia's population but attracts around one per cent of its immigrants. The Northern Territory attracts one per cent. Western Australia, with 9.4 per cent of the population, attracts about 12 per cent, but of course with an overwhelming majority settling in Perth. A similar situation obtains in Queensland, where the great majority settle in the south-east corner of the state.</para><para>This raises some very interesting issues for us to think about in relation to the migration program. The government's regional migration initiatives aim to assist regional development by encouraging a more balanced dispersal of Australia's migrant intake. We have introduced a number of initiatives to facilitate this. They cover migration to not only rural and regional areas but also other major urban centres, including Cairns, Townsville, Canberra, Adelaide and Hobart.</para><para>Research into patterns of population distribution and the reasons why migrants decide to settle in certain areas of Australia have shown findings which are really not surprising. They show that there are two factors which are of primary importance in making that decision. Of course, the location of family, where applicable, is very important, and the other factor is the availability of employment. The initiatives already in place are designed to be consistent with these findings, and they focus very strongly on the settlement potential of applicants, the skill profile of applicants and, in the case of business skills, an applicant's capacity to both invest in business and create employment.</para><para>There have been a number of initiatives that I will not have time to outline to the Senate tonight, such as skill matching, linking up people to available jobs and sponsoring migration to regional areas. There are some very important initiatives. As Australia faces its, no doubt, global future, I think it makes abundant sense to construct a population 
 policy that serves the nation well for the emerging challenges ahead, and the role of rural and regional Australia in this process must receive paramount consideration.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education</title><page.no>6242</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>6242</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak on education. On a day when the government and the Democrats are working closely together to put a tax on books, it seems curiously apt to be talking on this subject tonight. Education is central to Labor values. Kim Beazley went to the last election promising, if elected, to serve as the `Education Prime Minister'. In this, he is not alone. Bill Clinton in 1996 and Tony Blair in 1997 both went to the polls proclaiming education as their top priority.</para></talk.start><para>Education is no longer just one issue among many. Knowledge, skills, education and training are now matters that have moved to the core of the policy debate. In my own shadow portfolio of trade, education is vital. This may seem odd at first, so let me explain why. Labor believes that trade liberalisation is the best solution for Australia. The tariff cuts we put in place under the Hawke and Keating governments made industry more efficient and allowed us to lobby for comparable cuts in the tariffs and quotas of our trading partners. They put an extra $1,000 per year into the pockets of the average Australian family.</para><para>However, for some Australians, particularly those in regional Australia, trade liberalisation brought mixed blessings. Over the past two decades, job insecurity has increased throughout the world, and Australia has been no exception. Some of the industries have had difficulty adapting to the removal of the walls of fortress Australia. But the answer is not to keep buttressing the fortress; the answer is to invest in people by ensuring that education and training is available to everyone. Young Australians should be encouraged to finish school and given the opportunity for further education if they want it. The philosophy of lifelong learning needs to become a reality for everyone. The days when a worker needed only one set of skills because they would 
 have only one job during their lifetime are long gone.</para><para>Labor also recognises the value of education exports. Education services are Australia's fifth largest export. They are worth around $3.5 billion per year and are responsible for employing nearly 9,000 teachers. Labor regards a successful education exports sector as important in creating a vibrant, outward looking, intellectual Australia. As Kim Beazley pointed out last year:</para><para>The great thing about education is that it empowers the individual. It helps them expand themselves. It opens vistas and opportunities they never had before. What better legacy could Australia bequeath to our neighbours in this part of the world than to have provided that sort of key to the future for them. What better legacy for Australia than to have done it in a way that makes us a better nation too.</para><para>Labor went to the 1998 election with a range of innovative policies to boost education exports, including cutting the cost of a student visa, boosting funding to promote Australia as a place to study and establishing an education exports roundtable. I am proud that we made education exports a high priority.</para><para>I will now say a few words about Western Australia. Universities are not the first thing that people think of when they think of Western Australia. Perhaps they think of mining, deserts, the America's Cup, our precious forests or holidays in Broome. All these are things that people associate immediately with the West. But we need to change that attitude, because universities in my state of Western Australia are rapidly becoming one of our biggest industries.</para><para>This was vividly demonstrated last week with the release of a report commissioned by Curtin University, the largest university in Western Australia. The report is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Contributing to the Community Through Education and Research—a comprehensive study quantifying the economic impact of Curtin on the WA Economy</inline>. The study team was led by Mr Peter Kenyon and the report was released by the Vice Chancellor, Professor Lance Twomey. It makes some key findings about the importance of Curtin for the local economy. Curtin is the 11th largest business in the state and the 600th largest business in Australia if you include all private and public 
 sector businesses. Curtin employs 2,500 people on campus, and is responsible for generating 1,600 more jobs off campus. Curtin adds about $370 million in human capital to the economy each year. This is measured by the increase in salaries which its graduates get as a result of having a Curtin education.</para><para>The flow-on effect of spending by Curtin, its staff and its students makes a total contribution of $434 million to the Western Australian economy. Curtin receives over $25 million per year in research income, which leads to a $65 million benefit to the industry in Western Australia. In relation to international students, the report points out that, of Curtin's 24,500 students, over 3,000—or 12 per cent—are overseas students. International fee-paying students and associated family and visitors contribute nearly $70 million per year to the economy. As the report points out, this is over five times the amount contributed to the WA economy by the state's wine industry. As senators would be aware, the Western Australian wine industry is a substantial exporter. All up, the study estimates that the total impact of Curtin University on the economy of Western Australia is in the region of $700 million to $870 million, or 1.5 per cent, of total economic activity in the state.</para><para>The potential is there, but this government continues to drag the chain. As Kim Beazley pointed out in his budget reply speech, 37 per cent of our labour force did not finish high school. This compares to 19 per cent in the United Kingdom, 14 per cent in Germany and 11 per cent in the United States. Fifteen per cent of Australians have at least a university level education compared with 26 per cent of Americans. We are starting from behind.</para><para>Education needs to become not just a priority for this government but the priority; yet the government continues to slash and burn instead. The 1999-2000 budget delivers $800 million a year less in direct Commonwealth higher education funding than in Labor's last year in office. Taken together, all the Commonwealth support for education, training and both public and private research and development activity has fallen from 
 three per cent of GDP when we were in office to 2.5 per cent in the latest budget.</para><para>Let me end on a note of optimism. Education is a powerful force for change. Not only does it provide skills; it also engenders trust. In the long term, the solution to the xenophobic scourge that swept Australia in 1996-98 is to raise education levels. Education is also good business. It is a great export earner for this country and, with the right government policies, it will grow rapidly. When students from other countries come to study in Australia, they enrich our culture. They also take back a little of our fundamental values—tolerance, democracy and equality. I would like to commend the work of Curtin University to the Australian Senate. I hope that the government will do more to encourage this sort of evaluation of the contribution of higher education to the national economy in the future.</para><para>I note in the presentation of Curtin University's report that they made some reference to similar studies that are being undertaken, or have been completed, by other universities in Australia, including the University of Western Australia. There is now a critical mass of research on the value that universities contribute to society in economic as well as in social terms on the national agenda, from which you could project the total value to Australia of having a vibrant higher education sector. Perhaps the opportunity is there to start to render this in realistic figures in terms of value so that not only can the recipients of higher education appreciate the value to them as individuals—the</para><para>enrichment that it brings to their lives—but also others can appreciate the addition to our social infrastructure, as well as the economic impacts, that a higher education community can bring.</para><para>In weighing those things, I would of course put most value on the social elements. But in recognising that many debates about value in Australia these days centre on the economic contribution, I would not want to overlook that. It is substantial; it is major. It surprises most Australians in terms of the extent of the contribution made to our national economy. It is the reason why industry and other sections of the community should support a stronger commitment to higher education, better training and more accessibility for ordinary Australians to those facilities. Again, I commend the work of Curtin University and the study to the Senate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>6244</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.49 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>6244</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>6244</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Aboriginal Land Commissioner—Report—No. 55—Carpentaria Downs/Balbirini land claim no. 160 and explanatory statement by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron).</para><para>Treaty—<inline font-style="italic">Multilateral</inline> —Text, together with national interest analysis—Amendments, done at Grenada in May 1999, to the Schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946.</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>6245</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Federation Fund Program: Applications</title><page.no>6245</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 373)</subtitle><id.no>373</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>6245</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator West</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, upon notice, on 10 December 1998:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the Federation Fund program, applications that were made by organisations in the Eden-Monaro electorate for funding for the Queanbeyan indoor swimming pool, Queanbeyan showground, the Batemans Bay spine road, Moruya Heritage Centre and the Eurobodalla shire water and sewerage improvements:</para><para>Given the Minister's joint responsibility for this program with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill), where necessary in consultation with Senator Hill, for each of these applications:</para><para>(1) When were the applications submitted.</para><para>(2) Under what category of the Federation Fund was each application considered.</para><para>(3) On what date was a decision made on each application.</para><para>(4) On what date or dates were successful applications under the relevant programs publicly announced.</para><para>(5) On what date were unsuccessful applicants notified of the decision.</para><para>(6) Was the federal member for Eden-Monaro notified of the decisions; if so, on what date did this notification occur.</para><para>(7) (a) What criteria were used to make decisions on applications; and (b) how did each application rank against the criteria.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>6245</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Arts and the Centenary of Federation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>Senator West refers to Senator Alston having joint responsibility with Senator Hill for the Federation Fund program.
