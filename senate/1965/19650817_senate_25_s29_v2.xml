          <para>- Honorable senators, I would be less than human if I were not aware of the responsibility that you have placed on my shoulders in electing me to be your  President  for the next three years. I appreciate the honour that you have conferred upon me. I am aware of the great responsibility of ensuring that the dignity of the Parliament is upheld and that the Parliament as an institution does not suffer because of our association with it. This is of very great importance today, because Parliaments in various countries are changing. It is from a country such as Australia and from a House such as this Senate that much inspiration may be derived by other countries in ensuring good government and good behaviour in the legislative sphere. With your co-operation, understanding, and a continuance of the goodwill that I have experienced during past years, I am quite sure that the ensuing years will be quite successful from the legislative point of view. I again thank you very much. </para>

We all know the distinction which you have brought to the office, both inside and outside Parliament, and over the yearshave respected the impartial manner in which you have at all times exercised your authority. It will be of interest to honorable senators, particularly to new senators, to know that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, have</inline> served continuously as  President  of the Senate for a longer period than any previous </para>

These facts speak for themselves and reflect the obvious high regard which has prompted the Senate to re-appoint you from time to time.

            <para>. - by leave - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> the agreement reached on the formation of a free trade area between Australia and New Zealand, following the negotiations between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marshall,</inline> the New Zealand Minister of Overseas Trade, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McEwen,</inline> Minister for Trade and Industry, has now been confirmed by our respective Governments. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A free trade area has a technical connotation. It is an arrangement between two or more countries which provides for the goods included in it to be traded free of duty between them, but allowing each country to maintain separate tariffs on imports from countries outside the arrangement. It is different from a customs union which requires the members to introduce a common external tariff against imports from other countries. Under the present arrangement Australia and New Zealand will each maintain separate tariffs against imports from third countries. </para>
          <para>The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade requires that, when two countries enter into a free trade agreement, substantially all the trade between the two countries should be subject to the free trade provisions. This indicates that some areas of trade can be excepted. There are no precise rules to indicate the dimensions of the trade which must be included, and there is no strict rule governing the period over which &#34; substantially all of the trade &#34; must be brought into the free trade arrangement. </para>
          <para>The arrangement reached between our two Governments has token these considerations into account. Our agreement includes items covering some 60 per cent, of the total trade between our two countries -not 60 per cent, of the trade of each country, but approximately 60 per cent, of total trade between the two countries. The bulk of the items to be included initially in this 60 per cent, of the trade between the two countries are those already traded on a duty free basis. The balance of the items are at present dutiable. It has been agreed that, where duties are very low, they will be removed immediately. In other cases they will be reduced to free over eight years. In certain cases it may be agreed to extend the period beyond eight years. </para>
          <para>It has been recognised by both Governments that there are some items which may not be included in the duty free list. Where serious harm, or serious unemployment would result from competition by the other country the items concerned will never be traded duty free. The items of trade which have not been included at the outset will come under periodic examination by both countries for decision as to whether, or when, they should be moved into the duty free section, under the agreement known as </para>
          <para class="block">Schedule A. Where items of trade included in Schedule A are not being produced by one of the countries, that country may, at a later date when production commences, temporarily withdraw an item from the schedule and introduce protective duties. Where the establishment of an industry is essential for economic development an item may be withdrawn permanently from Schedule A. </para>
          <para>The greatest single generic item of trade between the two countries - forest products, ranging from timber and paper pulp to paper - will now be predominantly duty free. Only a limited range of paper products will remain dutiable. </para>
          <para>New Zealand is the biggest customer for our manufacturing industries. The agreement will sustain and over the years develop that position, while not depriving New Zealand of the right or opportunity to establish further manufacturing industries. New Zealand is, of course, predominantly an exporter of primary products. Australia will accept certain of her primary products duty free. In some cases a limit has been set on the quantity to be imported duty free from New Zealand, but in no case at a level which would result in measurable harm to the Australian industry concerned. Provision has been made for the phasing out of duties over as long a period as eight years so that no sharp consequences may result. </para>
          <para>Before the list of products to be included was finalised the circumstances of the industries concerned were investigated and confidential discussions were held with people who could advise the Government on the competitive position of the industries in Australia and New Zealand. Items in Schedule A of importance to New Zealand export industries include, frozen peas and beans, dried vegetables, cheese, lamb, pigmeats and timber and paper products. The present duties on these items will be phased out over a period of up to eight years - nine years in the case of frozen peas and beans - after the agreement enters into force. In regard to cheese and certain pigmeats there is also provision limiting the quantities to be subject to the duty free arrangement. Duty free imports in the first year will be 3,000 tons of pork and 400 tons of cheddar cheese. The ceiling reached on cheese after 5 years will be 1,000 tons. Special arrangements have been made in respect of the items mentioned above to ensure that New Zealand&#39;s quantitative import restrictions will not prevent Australian producers from having an equivalent opportunity to compete in the New Zealand market within their range of production. </para>
          <para>I will now describe in more precise terms the provisions in the agreement which will govern the whole character of the new trading relationship between our two countries. The existing trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand, which has been in operation since 1933, will form part of the free trade agreement except as superseded or modified by it. This means that the contractual rights we both enjoy under that agreement have been maintained. As already indicated, provision is made for the regular review of trade in goods not listed in Schedule A with a view to the inclusion of additional items. The objective of these reviews would be the progressive addition of goods to the schedule except where their inclusion would be seriously detrimental to an industry in either country or contrary to the national interest. The first of these reviews will take place within two years of the entry into force of the agreement. </para>
          <para>There are a number of provisions designed to ensure that there will be fair and equitable trading conditions between the two countries in the commodities included. Particular situations in which action might have to be taken by one of the parties to prevent unfair trading have been identified and provisions drafted to deal with them. Where goods are being dumped or are in receipt of a subsidy from the exporting country, provisions allow the importing country to take necessary action to safeguard any affected domestic industry. </para>
          <para>There is an article dealing with deflection of trade which might arise if producers of one country had access to raw materials or machinery at significantly lower prices than producers in the other country. This article will permit the second country, following consultations, to take corrective action to protect affected producers. Either country, following a consultative procedure may suspend temporarily its obligations in respect of products which are being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten serious injury to its producers. </para>
          <para>Rules of origin which determine whether goods included in Schedule A will qualify for reduced duties in terms of die agreement are the same initially as those provided under the existing trade agreement, lt is proposed, however, that the rules should be reviewed within two years. </para>
          <para>The agreement provides that one country shall not maintain quantitative import restrictions on imports from the other unless it is at Ohe same time applying such restrictions to imports of a third country. Australia undertook not to impose quantitative import restrictions, introduced for balance of payments reasons, on imports from New Zealand. Because of its continuing and serious balance of payments position, New Zealand was not able to give a similar undertaking, but has indicated that it will provide for special arrangements in respect of some imports from Australia. Quantitative import restrictions will be removed on certain products from Australia including timber plywood and veneers from the date of entry into force of the agreement. </para>
          <para>The care taken in the selection of items, the quantity limitations prescribed in certain cases and the arrangements to phase out existing duties over a number of years, together with the safeguard provisions to prevent any serious dislocation of trade should ensure there will be an avoidance of serious injury to existing industry in the two countries. </para>
          <para>In selecting commodities which at the outset would be included in the arrangement particular attention was also given to the interests of third countries. There should be no disruption to the trade of our other trading partners. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provides for free trade arrangements between members and that organisation will be advised of the details of the agreement as soon as practicable. </para>
          <para>It has also been agreed to set up a consultative committee on forestry products comprising representatives of the two countries. This committee would meet, as necessary, and would advise the two Governments on the steps necessary to develop and coordinate all phases of the industry in the two countries to achieve the best use of their forest resources. </para>
          <para>New Zealand has undertaken, where import duties levied on goods from Australia are higher than the lowest rate applicable to goods imported under the same tariff item from any third country, to eliminate the difference in the rates at the earliest practicable date. Australia has already eliminated any similar differences which had existed in the Australian tariff. </para>
          <para>Special reference should be made to the understanding reached in regard to raw sugar. Raw sugar is not listed in Schedule A but is nevertheless included in the scope of the agreement on the basis that the existing import duties shall be phased out in accordance with the provisions of the agreement but that the non-tariff measures at present in force shall continue. The agreement will continue for ten years. After that it will remain in force but be subject to termination with 180 days notice. </para>
          <para>Time has not yet permitted the agreement reached between the two Governments to be translated into a formal document. It is still necessary to finalise the legal drafting of the articles of the agreement and to ensure that the commodities in Schedule A are defined accurately in terms of the tariff classifications of both countries. The agreement will then be printed. When this is done, it will be signed. These processes will be completed with a minimum of delay and it is expected that the agreement will be printed and ready for signature within a few weeks. At the earliest opportunity after signature, arrangements will be made for the relevant documents to be tabled in the Senate. </para>
          <para>The conclusion of this free trade arrangement represents the culmination of intensive activity by both Governments extending over two years. It constitutes an historic landmark in the development of trade relations between Australia and New Zealand. Although its immediate results in new trade will not be spectacular, the free trade arrangement is expected to have farreachinglongterm effects on the welfare, development and growth of our two countries. </para>

        <para>The document entitled &#34;Particulars of Proposed Provision for Certain Expenditure in respect of the Year Ending 30th June 1966&#34; contains details of the proposed appropriations for these purposes. I advise honorable senators that a full set of these documents will be available when the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> has finished delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1965-66. It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the Budget proposals of the Government. </para>
        <para>The Budget for  1965-66  makes provision for  a  greatly enlarged expenditure  on  defence,  a  substantial increase  in  payments  to </para>
        <para>State Governments, further growth in social welfare payments, increased international aid and increases in many other items encompassed in the Budget as a whole. Together, these proposals comprehend an estimated increase in Commonwealth expenditure this year of &#163;275,000,000. This is the largest expenditure increase for which a Commonwealth Budget has ever had to provide. Our steadily expanding economy will give us a large increase in revenue but one falling substantially short of the proposed increase in expenditure. To help meet this additional expenditure and to offset to some degree the additional call Government expenditures of this magnitude will make on resources, the Government proposes certain increases in taxation. I shall mention these in detail later. </para>
        <para>Basically, of course, the annual Budget comprises a set of proposals submitted to Parliament for raising revenues and other receipts and for expenditures to carry on various activities and to meet various commitments. But it has long since become accepted in all advanced countries that, since the Budget has important social and economic effects, the policy of the Budget must be shaped, both in the large and in detail, with these effects in view. </para>
        <para>Budgetary policy must necessarily form part of overall economic policy, be consistent with it and serve identical aims. We have often stated the broad aims of our economic policy - the steady growth of Australian population and output, a high standard of living, full employment, stability of prices and a strong external balance of payments. To these must be added the increased emphasis now given to national security by a much enlarged defence programme. These objectives guide us from year to year in drawing up our Budget proposals. It is no longer a matter of merely considering how to balance the public accounts. Some years it appears right that, to stimulate expansion generally or in some sectors, expenditure ought to be allowed to rise ahead of receipts; in other years, it appears that there ought to be some check on the rate of increase in demand. </para>
        <para>This year the predominant fact is that the Australian economy is already running at full pitch. It is a year in which, for example, we shall see an enlarged demand for {re sources on the part of several great mineral projects now gathering momentum and when some diversion of resources must be made to meet a total defence expenditure of &#163;385,921,000, Last financial year it was &#163;304,491,000. While further resources for production will become available during the year, they are likely to be more limited in extent. Demand has risen strongly and seems likely to continue to rise. </para>
        <para>Our additional expenditure will add considerably to the general demand for goods and services. But the taxation measures we are taking to meet and offset its effects are in no sense designed to slow down expansion in real terms nor, we believe, will they do so. Our aim is to ensure that growth goes on under the conditions of a steady balance between demand for goods and the supply of goods and of resources for producing them. </para>
        <para>Last financial year, 1964-65, saw a further big rise in national output - despite labour shortages, industrial disputes, sharp falls in some export prices and drought over wide areas of the country. By any reckoning, it was a good performance. But while output thus increased substantially, expenditure increased still more. In the national accounts for the year, gross national product at current prices snowed an increase of 9 per cent. Gross national expenditure, on the other hand, increased by 13 per cent. </para>
        <para>There were two main results of this. The labour situation became still more difficult, with shortages of skilled people - and indeed of many other types of labour - worse than ever, labour turnover high and a vast amount of overtime working. The other result was a large rise in imports - some &#163;250,000,000 or 22 per cent., above the previous year. Concurrently, there was some weakening of our external position. Exports fell some way below the total of 1963-64 and doubts arose as to whether capital inflow would continue on the scale of recent years. Our overseas reserves fell by &#163;158,000.000. </para>

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>The main elements in our proposed expenditure for this year and the reasons for the increases which have come about are as follows. </para>
      <subdebate.1>
        <subdebateinfo>
          <title>Defence</title>
          <page.no>11</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Defence is not the largest item in the Budget but it does this year show the largest increase. We are providing for total expenditure of &#163;335,921,000 which would be &#163;81,430,000 or about 27 per cent, greater than actual expenditure last year. Of this increase, about &#163;58,000,000 will be spent within Australia and &#163;23,000,000 overseas. </para>
        <para>These are large sums but they simply express the fact that we are now engaged in a big and widespread defence effort, both at home and abroad. Apart from the pay and maintenance of increased forces, we are acquiring a great deal of costly new equipment such as submarines, guided missile destroyers, patrol craft, anti-submarine frigates. Mirage fighters, Hercules transports, control and reporting units and a wide range of arms and materiel for the Army. There is also a large amount of construction involved. Expenditure on airfields, barracks and similar works is estimated to be &#163;30,000,000 this year. Last year it was less than &#163;15,000,000. </para>
        <para>Payments to or for the States. </para>
        <para>Payments to or for the States make up the largest item in the Budget. It is estimated that this year they will reach &#163;549,640,000- and this does not include anything for the support we may have to provide for Loan Council borrowing programmes. It amounts to an increase of &#163;61,402,000 or 12.6 per cent, over the payments made last year. </para>
        <para>Within this increase of &#163;61,402,000, about &#163;37,000,000 is due to the rise in financial assistance grants this year under the new arrangements agreed with the States last June to cover the period 1965-1970. </para>
        <para>Following recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, there will also be an increase of &#163;5,025,000 this year in the special grants payable to Western Australia and Tasmania. </para>
        <para>Grants to States for assistance for universities will be &#163;22,714,000, an increase of more than &#163;2,000,000, and we will be providing &#163;9,953,000 for science laboratories and technical training, &#163;750,000 for research grants and &#163;1,000.000 for interim capital grants for Colleges of Advanced </para>
        <para class="block">Education. The two latter items, amounting to &#163;1,750,000, appear in the Budget for the first time this year. </para>
        <para>Grants and advances to the States for developmental projects this year total &#163;11,567.000, which is &#163;2,496,000 above the total for 1964-65. Besides this, &#163;14,238,000 is being provided for rail standardization works in South Australia and Western Australia, an increase of &#163;6,860,000 over last year. </para>

          <page.no>11</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Expenditure from the National Welfare Fund is the second largest item in the Budget. We estimate that, on the present scales of benefits, it would amount to &#163;465,652,000, an increase of &#163;20,469,000 over expenditure in 1964-65. This year, we have it in view to improve certain benefits and to widen eligibility for others. </para>
        <para>We propose that supplementary assistance, which is now payable to single pensioners who are deemed to be dependent solely on their pension and who pay rent, will be increased from 10s. to &#163;1 a week. This will be associated with a means test under which some supplementary assistance will be payable until, a pensioner&#39;s meansasassessed reach the equivalent of &#163;1 10s. a week. Eligibility for supplementary assistance on the new basis will be extended to a married couple where the husband is a pensioner and his wife receives a wife&#39;s allowance. The husband&#39;s pension in these cases will also be increased to the standard rate of &#163;6 a week. These measures will increase the income of eligible married couples by up to &#163;1 10s. a week. </para>
        <para>The wife&#39;s allowance of &#163;3 a week presently payable to the wife of an invalid pensioner or age pensioner who is permanently incapacitated for work will in future be paid to the wife of any age pensioner where she has the care of a child. In addition, payments for dependent children will be extended to all age pensioners. </para>
        <para>At present, payments to pensioners for children undergoing full-time education cease at the end of the year in which these children reach 18 years of age. We propose to continue the payment of these benefits until the student child reaches the age of 21 years. Widows with student children will remain eligible for the Class A widow&#39;s pension until the youngest child, if a student, reaches 21 years. </para>
        <para>Action is proposed to assist a pensioner who is responsible for the funeral costs of a spouse, a child or another pensioner. In these circumstances, a funeral benefit of &#163;20 will be payable. The present funeral benefit of &#163;10 will be maintained where the funeral costs of an age or invalid pensioner are met by a person who is not a pensioner. </para>
        <para>We also intend to introduce a new benefit, to be known as a guardian&#39;s allowance, of &#163;2 a week for widowers and other unmarried persons receiving an age or invalid pension who have the care of one or more children. Where, for example, an eligible age pensioner has, say, one dependent child, his weekly income will be increased by &#163;2 15s., comprising &#163;2 for the new guardian&#39;s allowance and 15s. for the child. Such a pensioner will thus receive each week benefits totalling &#163;8 15s., excluding any supplementary assistance to which he may be entitled. </para>
        <para>These proposals will require amending legislation. The additional and new pension benefits will be payable on the first pension pay day after the legislation comes into operation. </para>
        <para>Soon after assuming office, this Government introduced the Pensioner Medical Service under which free general practitioner medical services, pharmaceutical benefits and public ward hospital treatment are currently made available for certain age, invalid, widow or service pensioners, and for persons in receipt of the tuberculosis allowance. These benefits are also available to dependants of such pensioners and recipients of tuberculosis allowances. We now propose to extend the scope of the Pensioner Medical Service in two important respects. </para>
        <para>First, we propose to remove the existing means test governing eligibility for enrolment in the Pensioner Medical Service. This will mean that all persons who are receiving age, invalid, widow or service pensions or tuberculosis allowances will become eligible. Secondly, the definition of dependant will be extended to include student children. We will approach the States to seek the inclusion of this enlarged group of eligible persons within the present arrangements for free public ward hospital treatment. </para>
        <para>Some 120,000 pensioners and their dependants should benefit from these extensions of the Pensioner Medical Service which will commence on 1st January 1966. The estimated cost of all these decisions is &#163;7,720,000 in a full year and &#163;5,180,000 in 1965-66. The total expenditure from the National Welfare Fund in 1965-66 will be &#163;470,832,000. </para>

          <page.no>12</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>In the field: of repatriation benefits we are putting forward a new intermediate rate of war pension which will fall between the special totally and permanently incapacitated rate and the general 100 per cent. rate. Its purpose will be to provide for the needs of seriously disabled ex-servicemen whose war-caused incapacities render them incapable of working other than part-time or intermittently. </para>
        <para>At present, a sustenance allowance is paid where the nature of the treatment given for a war-caused disablement temporarily prevents an ex-serviceman from working. In the case of such an ex-serviceman receiving out-patient treatment, the sustenance allowance provided is at a rate of up to the 100 per cent, general rate of &#163;6 per week. In future, where out-patient treatment extends over a period of four weeks ot more, sustenance allowance may be paid at up to the special totally and permanently incapacitated rate of &#163;14 5s. per week. </para>
        <para>These payments will be payable on the first pension pay-day after the necessary legislation has been passed. The estimated cost of these benefits, together with adjustments to service pension benefits consequential upon the decisions announced in the social services field, is &#163;1,150,000 in a full year and &#163;860,000 in 1965-66. </para>

        <para>Many requests have been made for further adjustments in existing pensions to ex-Commonwealth employees and members of the Forces under the Superannuation and Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Acts but the Government concluded that, in the context of this year&#39;s Budget, it was not possible to provide a further general increase. However, the rates of children&#39;s pensions under both Acts will be increased from &#163;1 per week to &#163;2 per week if the mother is alive, and from &#163;3 per week to &#163;5 per week if both parents are dead. The age limit for children&#39;s pensions will also be increased, for children undergoing full time education, from 16 years to 21 years. </para>

        <para>Total Commonwealth expenditure on the Territories will amount to &#163;86,588,000, an increase of &#163;9,977,000 on 1964-65. The growth in the grant to the Papua-New Guinea Administration strikingly reveals the major contribution Australia is making to the development of that Territory and the well-being of its people. This year it will be &#163;31,000,000; last year it was &#163;28,000,000, and four years ago it was &#163;17,300,000. Moreover, these particular figures do not take account of quite substantial expenditure in Papua-New Guinea by various Commonwealth departments. These other expenditures are now running at a rate of over &#163;5,000,000 a year. </para>

        <para>Hence, taking our provision for the Territory this year along with estimated expenditure on various other forms of international economic aid, we may say that the total amount we are providing for such aid this year will be of the order of &#163;50,860,000. The comparable figure last year was &#163;47,904,000 and that included a special gift of wheat to India at a cost of &#163;3,801,000. </para>
        <para>Nowadays we are involved in many forms of international economic aid and our contributions to some of them are growing fast; for example, our subscription to the International Development Association will this year rise by &#163;2,067,000 and our subscription to the Indus Waters Scheme by &#163;546,000. We will also increase Colombo Plan Aid by over &#163;783,000 this year, it being our policy to do all we can to promote development in the Colombo Plan area. </para>
        <para>When account is taken of both the quantity and quality of Australian aid, our record compares favourably with that of any other country. We are, for example, virtually the only country in the world which provides aid wholly in the form of grants. Consequently, when Papua-New Guinea reaches independence, none of the assistance which we have provided to date will be treated as a debt requiring servicing or repayment. Even if we enter into no new aid commitments, our aid expenditures will continue to grow rapidly in future years. Nevertheless, although it will be impossible to meet all the requests <inline font-style="italic">t,v</inline> new aid which are now being made to us., we must stand ready to continue to play our part in assisting less developed countries, especially those in our own immediate area. </para>

        <para>Along with aid for economic development, the need to provide defence aid to the Malaysian area and Vietnam is also giving rise to increasing expenditures associated with the deployment of our own forces overseas and with the provision of defence aid of a material kind. </para>
        <para>Following a request by the Malaysian Government for additional aid to help build up its own defence forces, the Government has decided to extend the &#163;3,000,000 programme of equipment and training assistance which was commenced last year. The new programme will involve aid of about &#163;9,500,000 over the next two years and, added to the balance of the initial programme, will require expenditure of &#163;5,871,000 in 1965-66. The Government believes, that, together with the aid being provided by the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, this new programme will be of considerable assistance to Malaysia in the strengthening of her defence capability. The separation of Singapore from Malaysia may require some adjustments in the implementation of the programme. </para>

        <para>The approved programme of new commitments to be entered into for payment of subsidy under the Petroleum  Search Subsidy Act was &#163;5,500,000 for 1964-65. This programme, together with commitments brought forward from previous years, resulted in a cash expenditure in 1964-65 of &#163;4,419,000. Expenditure by petroleum exploration companies continues to rise strongly and a continuation of subsidy payments on the existing basis involves a substantial increase in the Commonwealth&#39;s liabilities. Nevertheless, it has been decided to maintain the present unit rates and standards of eligibility of subsidy payments and, in addition, to remove the limit of &#163;100,000 on subsidy payments for any one drilling operation. As a consequence, the subsidy programme in 1965-66 will be raised to &#163;7,000,000 and it is estimated that cash expenditure this year will be &#163;5,700,000. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para>Last year we had almost everything in our favour in point of revenues. Through 1964-65, employment and earnings rose strongly and that made for high pay as you earn collections and pay-roll tax receipts. The big increase in imports swelled the yield of customs duties. Excise and sales tax revenues rose with increasing sales of goods subject to those taxes. Besides this, income tax assessments based on 1963-64 incomes drew upon the relatively high incomes derived in that year by primary producers, companies and business in general. Then, of course, there were in the Budget certain increases in taxes and charges, estimated to have brought us an additional &#163;80,000,000 or thereabouts of revenue. In all, Commonwealth receipts for the year were &#163;317,311,000 greater than those of 1963-64. </para>
      <para>We could hardly expect to do as well again this year from existing revenue sources. Employment is not likely to rise as much as it did last year because there simply will not be as much additional labour to employ. Average earnings are already high. They will rise to some extent though not, it is thought, as much as in 1964-65. Farm incomes fell quite heavily last year, and that will affect revenues this year from tax assessed on those incomes. Almost certainly, company incomes rose less in 1964- 65 than in 1963-64. Again, in our reckoning there will be a much smaller increase in imports and sales of goods subject to excise and sales tax may not show as big an increase. </para>
      <para>Nevertheless, we can count on obtaining fairly substantial additional revenues from taxation, business undertakings and various other sources. We estimate that, on current rates and charges, there should be an increase of about &#163;183,990,000 in taxation revenue and an increase of about &#163;41,045,000 in other receipts. Thus, total receipts would be approximately &#163;225,035,000 above those of 1964-65. </para>
      <para>Taking overall expenditure commitments, other than for debt redemptions, at &#163;2,667,030,000 and total receipts at &#163;2,538,975,000, the excess of such expenditures over receipts other than loan raisings would be &#163;128,055,000. That amount would have to be recovered by borrowings in one form or another. </para>

          <page.no>15</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The possibilities of raising loan money, either at home  or  abroad, have deteriorated very considerably since the performance of 1963-64 when our total loan proceeds were &#163;317,387,000. Last year, they were &#163;255,602,000, which was a fall of &#163;61,785,000 on the year before, and we also had very heavy redemptions of debt to meet. </para>
        <para>This year, with diminished liquidity, it seems probable that the amount of local loan raisings will be smaller again, while the chances of borrowing any substantial amount abroad are not to be rated highly. So many factors can influence the result that estimates in this field can never be very secure. However, subject to this, we have decided to use for budgetary purposes a figure of &#163;210,000,000 for loan raisings in 1965-66. Redemptions, on the other hand, could be rather less than last year when they totalled &#163;158,350,000; we are putting the amount at &#163;135,000,000. Net loan raisings on this basis would be about &#163;75,000,000, compared with &#163;97,252,000 in 1964-65. </para>
        <para>On our figuring to this stage, therefore, the total of revenue and net loan raisings from the public would fall &#163;53,055,000 short of meeting estimated cash outlays. Unless otherwise removed, this deficiency would have to be financed by temporary borrowings - largely if not wholly from the Reserve Bank. </para>

        <title>THE BUDGET AND THE ECONOMY</title>
        <page.no>16</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>Necessarily, we must consider the budgetary situation and the question of what should be done about it in relation to the broad trend of our economy over the coming year. There are certain features of the situation abroad which could conceivably have an adverse effect on our fortunes. Of direct and immediate concern to us is the political and military situation to the north now centred on the conflict in South Vietnam. On the economic side, there appears to be some tendency for growth to slow down in a number of the major industrial countries and that could mean a slowing down in the growth of world trade. Once again the terms of trade have turned heavily against the primary producing countries. Through measures taken by the United States and United Kingdom Governments to strengthen their currencies, there has been a sharp check to the international flow of capital for investment in many parts of the world. Furthermore, we are not as yet within sight of any solution to the great problem of international liquidity. </para>
      <para>Our home economy has been and still is running at full pitch, with little if any current labour resources to spare. But this does not preclude a further growth of output. It seems most unlikely that employment could rise by as much as it did last year or the year before that, because unemployment is now very low indeed and a considerable part of the so-called fringe labour has already taken up work. The increase in employment could be of the order of 3.5 per cent, as against 4 per cent, last year. </para>
      <para>For this reason, if for no other, it is to be expected that the overall rise in national output will be rather smaller this year. Certain other factors are working in the same direction. For example, drought in New South Wales and southern Queensland is bound to cut back rural output quite significantly. </para>
      <para>With increasing employment and incomes, we can be sure that consumer spending will continue to increase and that, of course, is by far the largest element in total spending. </para>
      <para>In the area of private capital expenditure, dwelling construction and purchases of motor vehicles have levelled off though, of course, at a very high level. Farm investment has undoubtedly fallen to some extent. The indications are, however, that expenditure on industrial and commercial building and construction and on factory plant and equipment will continue to rise. </para>
      <para>Public authority expenditure, on both current and capital accounts, will certainly rise a good deal - mainly in the Commonwealth area but to a significant extent also in the field of State Governments. &#39;Not all of &#39;this additional expenditure will constitute demand for goods and services within Australia - some part of it will be spent overseas. But the direct local effect will be very sizable and, of course, such additional spending adds to incomes and leads to further spending. On the other hand, taxation even on existing scales will take part of the increase in incomes which occurs through the year and this will tend to reduce the expansive effect of higher governmental spending. Since, however, it would take only part of the increase in incomes, it would be only a partial offset. The effect the Commonwealth Budget would have from this standpoint may be seen more clearly when it is analysed on a national accounting basis as has been done in Statement No. 6 attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Speech. </para>
      <para>There can be no certain or precise forecasts on a situation like this and yet, on an overall view of the prospect, it seems probable that there will be a fairly strong lift in expenditure. Proportionately, governmental expendiure will contribute more to this increase than any other class of spending. </para>
      <para>The implications this has for economic policy are plain enough. All through last year the strong tendency was for demand for &#62;goods and services to out-run supplies to be had in Australia. The results were that total productive resources came under heavy pressure and there was a big additional call on imported supplies. </para>
      <para>That is not a situation we would want to go on for too long. Internally, there has been a fairly strong and continuous rise in costs and, although this has not shown up in the final prices of goods as much as might have been expected, the rise in these prices has been greater than we would normally wish to see. </para>
      <para>Nor would we wish to see a further large rise in imports, the level of which is already very high. Indeed, some fallingback in the rate of importing would be welcome. Fortunately, we still have strong overseas reserves but the disturbed state of the international economy must raise doubts as to export possibilities. On present indications, our exports this year will be less than last year - by how much it is not possible to say. What amount of private capital we will receive from abroad is, again, problematical. On the prospect as a whole, however, it seems fairly certain that there will be a further reduction of our overseas reserves, possibly a substantial reduction. </para>
      <para>For these several reasons, then, it seems desirable that there should be some moderation of the rate of increase in overall demand and certainly an avoidance of anything which would make for a stronger increase in demand - as the Commonwealth </para>
      <para class="block">Budget with its exceptionally large addition to expenditures could very well do. We are, of course, not unaware of factors, such as reduced monetary liquidity and the fall in farm incomes, which are likely to have a steadying effect on demand; and we are concerned, as we always are, to ensure that there will be sufficient strength of demand to keep industry running at full capacity and to absorb whatever additional labour comes forward. But we judge that there is sufficient impetus in the economy to provide for this without any strong stimulus from the Budget. </para>
      <para>Accordingly, on both financial and economic grounds, we feel that some further increase in taxation is necessary. </para>

        <para>First as to income taxation: Because of the change-over to decimal currency next year it will be necessary to adjust the existing rates of income tax so that they will be readily convertible from their present form to dollars and cents. This adjustment will be made so that the tax payable under the adjusted scale of rates will not, in any case, differ significantly from that which would be payable under the existing rates. </para>
        <para>We have, however, also decided that income tax payable by individuals should be increased by <inline font-style="italic">2t</inline> per cent. The increase, which will apply to income of the current year 1965-66, will be in the form of an addition of 6d. in the &#163;1 of the tax calculated at the scale rates. </para>
        <para>It is proposed also to revise the tax instalment schedules so that they too will be exactly convertible to dollars and cents when the change-over to decimal currency comes into force. At the same time, the additional levy of <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent, will be included in the amounts of instalments. The new rates of instalment deductions will come into operation on the first pay day on or after 1st October next. The provisional tax for 1965-66 will also be adjusted appropriately. </para>
        <para>It is estimated that the increase in income tax will result in additional revenue of &#163;18,900,000 in a full year and &#163;17,800,000 in 1965-66. f.8225/65.- <inline font-style="italic">-s-&#91;2</inline></para>

The additional revenue from these proposals, which will take effect immediately, is estimated to be &#163;6,420,000 in a full year and &#163;5,390,000 in 1965-66. </para>

      <para>Rates of customs and excise duties on  cigarettes will be increased by 4s.11d.  a  pound, on cigars by 4s. l0d. a pound and on manufactured tobacco by1s. 11. 8d. a pound. The increases, which will have immediate effect, are approximately equivalent to an additional 3d. duty on a packet of 20 larger cigarettes or on a 2-oz. packet of tobacco. The increase in duty is, of course, less than 3d. on a packet of 20 smaller cigarettes. The resultant rates of duty will convert conveniently to dollars and cents. The additional revenue from these proposals is estimated  to  amount to &#163;13,300,000 in a full year and &#163;10,700,000 in 1965-66. </para>

        <para>It has been decided to increase the rate of lighthouse dues payable by ship owners from1s. 3d. to1s. 6d. per net registered ton as a means of obtaining a greater contribution by ship-owners towards the cost of providing and maintaining coastal lights and other aids to navigation. It is estimated that this increase will result in additional revenue of &#163;200,000 in a full year and &#163;150,000 in 1965-66. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The Government has considered again the situation arising from the increasing annual cost of providing, maintaining and operating airport and airways facilities. The assessed cost was &#163;19,600,000 in 1964-65 and could reach &#163;21,000,000 in 1965-66. Recoveries from the users of these facilities by air navigation charges amounted to &#163;2,300,000 in 1964-65 and, at the same rates of charge, would be a little over &#163;2,600,000 in 1965-66. It thus becomes all too evident that the gap between costs and recoveries is increasing year by year. The Government has affirmed as a general line of policy that it will seek to eliminate the gap and as a further step in this direction it has decided to increase by 10 per cent, the rates of air navigation charges payable by all users. These increases, which will take effect from 1st January 1966, are estimated to bring in &#163;60,000 in 1965-66 - because of their application for only six months and an unavoidable lag in accounting - and &#163;240,000 in a full year over and above increased revenue because of greater flying activity. It is proposed to explore the possibility of taking further action towards closing the wide gap between costs and revenues during the course of the year. </para>

        <para>With the growth of Canberra as a city and as a business centre, we think it would be no more than fair and proper that residents of Canberra should bear certain taxes of a nature comparable with those levied on residents of the States. Accordingly, the Government has decided to introduce stamp duty upon a range of instruments and transactions completed or made in the Australian Capital Territory. The new duties, which will apply inter alia to cheques, promissory notes, conveyances, hire purchase transactions and so on, will be introduced next year, thus allowing time for drafting of the necessary legislation and establishment of the administrative machinery that will be necessary. </para>
        <para>Following its review of the general level of charges in Canberra for the equivalent of municipal and other services, the Government has come to the conclusion that some increases, including increased hospital charges, will be necessary. These will be the subject of further examination. </para>

This would be &#163;22,795,000 less than the sum that had to be borrowed in 1964-65. However, net loanraisings are tentatively estimated at &#163;75,000,000. That is to say, they would exceed by &#163;19,415,000 the &#163;55,585,000 by which receipts other than borrowings are expected to fall short of expenditures. This &#163;19,415,000 would represent a cash surplus for the year. The comparable amount in 1964-65 was &#163;18,872,000. </para>

      <para>Current times present an exceptionally  strong challenge to economic and financial management. It is difficult enough under ordinary conditions to preserve a balanced situation. But present conditions are far from ordinary. It happened that our economy had reached virtually full employment when the need arose to step up defence preparations, and the expenditures that go with them, very substantially indeed. It has happened also that various large industrial and mining enterprises are in the full tide of expansion. These further demands have been superimposed on a resources situation already strained. Clearly there are dangers in all this - serious dangers of disruption and instability. But we do not see these as unavoidable dangers. We believe that, with moderate though firm restraint, the economy can be brought through without needless loss of impetus to expansion. </para>

I do not wish at this stage to repeat what I said then, but I believe that I should not let the resignation of our friend and colleague pass without taking advantage of this first opportunity to include in the parliamentary record a further short reference and tribute to his career here and to express the wish that he will enjoy for many years to come the well earned retirement which he has now chosen for himself. The Senate, and particularly the Government parties, have lost a leading figure.

Before I knew of the intention of the Leader of the Government in the Senate to do this I had telephoned <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> to tell him, before I re-entered the fray in this place for a new period, that I would miss him and to wish him well.

            <para>. - On behalf of the Australian Country Party I would like to pay a tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner. From 1959, when I entered this chamber, at a time when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner was Leader of the Government in the Senate, he has given the Country Party at all times a very fair deal. It was not very long after my arrival that I experienced a feeling of strong friendship towards <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William.</inline> That feeling has existed ever since. There have been occasions when I have differed from him very strongly, both in the Senate and in the party room, but those differences have not affected our friendship. I agree that his retirement will be a loss to the Government and to the politics of Australia. He was a very hard working Minister. I always had the impression that he did not spare himself in any way when any work connected with his office was to be done. He drove himself very hard indeed and I am glad, for his sake, that now he has seen fit to take a respite from the arduous work that he performed in his ministerial capacity over the years. I join with previous speakers in wishing him a very happy retirement. </para>

            <para>. - I wish to refer very briefly to the death during the parliamentary recess  of  the honorable Alexander John Fraser, M.C.,  a  former member of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fraser</inline> was a member of the Senate in 1946. He represented the Victorian electorates  of  Grant from 1950 to 1952, Caulfield East from 1955 to 1958, and Caulfield from 1958 to the time of his death.

          <para>Those who knew the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fraser</inline> will agree that he was a man of most generous instincts. I would like to speak of him as  a  man, because the Premier of Victoria, the Honorable H. E. Bolte, has paid a public tribute to him as a Minister, as a parliamentarian and as an administrator. Those of us who knew him when he was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> and also were privileged to know him in the intervening years, are conscious of the fact that no one ever went to him for help without receiving it. He won the Military Cross as a very young man during the First World War and to the time of his death he was one of our finest Victorians. I hope that all members of the Senate will join with me in expressing to his widow and to his family our sincere sympathy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fraser</inline> was a fine Australian gentleman of whom it may well be written in the record: He fought the good fight. He kept the faith. </para>
