Given the largely arid and semi-arid nature of much of the Basin, these flows are critical for the survival of a range of flora and fauna, including a number of nationally and internationally recognised aquatic ecosystems.  These flows are also important for the continued viability of pastoral and other industries within the Basin.  Clearly, the values of the Basin would be significantly put at risk by changes in the volume, duration and frequency of river flows resulting from unsustainable water resource development in these river catchments. </para><para>In recognition of the need to better manage these cross border river systems to protect downstream aquatic and other ecosystems, I joined my Queensland and South Australian counterparts in signing the Lake Eyre Basin Heads of Agreement in May 1997.  The Heads of Agreement was important in that it provided, for the first time, an agreed framework for governments and communities to work towards the sustainable management of the  cross-border river systems and related environmental values.  Importantly, the Heads of Agreement also provided for the development of a formal, inter-governmental Agreement between the Commonwealth, Queensland and South Australia for the integrated management of the Lake Eyre Basin.</para><para>There followed an extended process of community consultation and detailed negotiations between the three Governments, which culminated in the Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement being signed by myself and my Queensland and South Australian counterparts in October last year.</para><para>The Agreement initially applies to the two major catchments within the Basinâthe Cooper Creek and Georgina-Diamantina catchmentsâhowever, it also provides for New South Wales and the Northern Territory to become involved at a later stage should they wish to do so.</para><para>This Bill recognises and approves the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement between the Commonwealth, Queensland and South Australian Governments.  Primary responsibility for implementing the Agreement and associated policies and strategies rests with the Queensland and South Australian Governments.  Both States have committed themselves to enacting legislation to recognise and support the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement.  While not legally required, the Commonwealth has decided to confirm its commitment to the future sustainable management of the Lake Eyre Basin and the protection of dependent environmental and heritage values, by legislative means.  There is strong community support for Commonwealth and State legislation recognising and giving effect to the Agreement and associated institutional arrangements.</para><para>The Agreement is focussed on the management of water and related natural resources within these catchments.  Of particular concern are the cross-border flows in these river systems which support sensitive downstream ecosystems such as the Ramsar-listed Coongie Lakes in South Australia and other water dependent environment and heritage values in the Basin.  The Agreement will provide the formal basis for the respective Governments to develop and/or adopt policies and strategies aimed at improving the management of these cross-border river systems.  A Ministerial Forum established under the Agreement will make relevant decisions.  The Forum, which will meet at least one each year, will comprise Ministers from the Commonwealth, Queensland and South Australia.</para><para>Ensuring that the Basin's values are protected for present and future generations requires an ongoing partnership involving governments, industry and the community.  This Bill and the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement will strengthen and build upon the regional catchment management frame-work already established by the Basin community over the last four years as part of the Lake Eyre Basin Regional Initiative.  The Initiative is being funded under the Government's Natural Heritage Trust.  </para><para>The launch of the Lake Eyre Basin Coordinating Group's Strategic Plan in late 2000, and the Catchment Strategies developed by the Cooper Creek and Georgina-Diamantina Catchment Committees, are a tangible demonstration of what such regional partnerships can achieve.  It is important to note that the Basin community has developed the catchment management framework from the ground up and therefore has full ownership of the process.  The community has not only been involved in identifying and prioritising the problems, but has been directly responsible for developing and implementing the solutions.  </para><para>While the work of the community has been critical to the success of the Lake Eyre Basin Regional Initiative, I am pleased that the Commonwealth Government has also been able to play a key role.  The most obvious way in that the Government has contributed to date has been through the provision of financial support for the Lake Eyre Basin Regional Initiative.  Over the past four years, the Commonwealth Government has provided well over $1M towards the operations of the Coordinating Group and the Catchment Committees and other Basin related projects under the Natural Heritage Trust.  The Queensland and South Australian Governments have matched this funding.  Financial and in-kind contributions have also been provided by other stakeholders across the Basin.</para><para>Many communities in regional and remote ares of Australia are currently facing serious challenges.  An increasing number of these communities are now taking positive steps to tackle the hard issues head on and develop strategies to address their concerns and provide the basis for a sustainable and viable future.  I am confident that the success of community-driven processes such as the Lake Eyre Basin Regional Catchment Initiative will empower other rural communities across Australia who may be facing similar challenges to also take affirmative action.   </para><para>The Lake Eyre Basin Agreement will strengthen the partnership between governments and the community, and provide a mechanism for the community to contribute to decision making processes and associated arrangements for the sustainable management of the Basin. In response to community demands for full consultation on and involvement in decision-making affecting the management of the Lake Eyre Basin, the Agreement provides for the establishment of a Community Advisory Committee.

The Democrats, as has been said earlier this week, circulated a draft motion concerning national missile defence. As the opposition, and the alternative government in an election year, Labor very much prefer to express our policy on this important national security issue through our own motion. The motion reflects the policy position adopted unanimously at Labor's national conference in August last year. Labor consider NMD to be a disproportionate, counterproductive and technically questionable response to the problem of ballistic missile proliferation. It has the potential to undermine international security cooperation and derail progress towards disarmament. NMD may well fuel a new nuclear arms race in the Asia-Pacific region. Meanwhile, rogue states and terrorists will continue to pose threats with weapons of mass destruction delivered by clandestine means.</para></talk.start><para>Australia must always be prepared to make its own independent judgments on strategic issues and its national security interests. In the 1980s the Hawke Labor government was rightly critical of President Reagan's strategic defence initiative. Labor banned Australia's involvement in the SDI research and development. Contrary to claims of the then opposition led by Mr Howard, the ANZUS alliance was unaffected. Indeed, the alliance went from strength to strength. We first highlighted the adverse implications of NMD in March last year. In stark contrast, the Howard government has endorsed NMD. Almost alone among the US allies, they have disregarded the potential implications for nuclear arms control and nonproliferation. The government's view of the ANZUS alliance involves the suspension of Australia's independent strategic judgment. This is contrary to the Labor position.</para><para>As today's motion reaffirms, Labor are committed to review any Australian involvement in NMD, through the early warning satellite relay ground station located at Pine Gap or other arrangements. Our judgment is that Australia should not support or be involved in NMD research development or trials. Labor's approach will be consistent with our past stance, our support of the integrity of the ABM treaty as a keystone for nuclear arms control, and our assessment of contemporary strategic circumstances. It is for those reasons we do not accept the amendment. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>22289</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI support Senator Bourne's amendment.

Secondly, I have the very distinct impressionâI may be incorrect but, if I am incorrect, it will not matter; and if I am correct, then this is importantâthat, if this bill goes through with these very important multichannelling amendments in it, the rest of the bill will probably languish in the House of Representatives and never be seen again. I think it would be most unfortunate if that were to happen because the bill, as it is, even without the multichannelling amendments, is very important to both the ABC and SBS. It contains provisions which allow the SBS to include international news on its multichannel and second channel. It contains provisions which allow the ABC and SBS to handle complaints procedures themselves, by their own boards, as well as other provisions which the ABC and SBS both believe are important for them. </para><para>If this motion goes through, that bill will go back to the House of Representatives. It is the bill that the government has agreed toâin fact, it is mostly the bill that the government has put upâand it would go through. However, I do not want the multichannelling amendments, which I still believe are very important and should be dealt with again, to disappear. So the second bill would also come up separately, as a split bill, and it would be considered by the Senate at a later date. I have circulated a sheet which puts up 6 August 2001 as the later date, so it would come up as an order of the day on 6 August and we would debate it, starting from scratch, as a separate bill. It is important that all parts of this bill are considered by the House of Representatives, but I think it will be better for the ABC and SBS if it is considered by the House in two parts. That is what this is designed to achieve.</para><para>If I am wrong and the government are prepared to let the multichannelling go through because they want the other bit so much, then they will vote for both of them. But I do not think that is going to happen. I am sad to say this but I think cabinet as a whole are not as devoted to the ABC and SBS as one would hope they were. I fear that may be the case; if that is the case, the whole bill will just disappear. It is very important that the whole bill does not just disappear. At the moment we have agreement amongst all of usâeverybody in this chamber and, I imagine, everybody in the other chamberâthat a very substantial part of this bill should go through and that substantial part will advantage the ABC and SBS, they believe quite considerably. So I believe that should go through. I still believe that the multichannelling needs to be debated again and go back to the House of Representatives for another go; but I do not believe, sadly, that there is any chance whatsoever that the imperative is so great on the government that multichannelling would be pulled through in the wake of the other amendments.</para><para>I am sure Senator Alston is not involved in this but, sadly, the cabinet as a whole are not that keen on the ABC and SBS. I am very sad to say that. Cabinet as a whole are not going to die in a ditch over the ABC and SBS being advantaged. I think they will live with this bill if it is in two parts. They will live with the advantages to the ABC and SBS of SBS multichannelling, including international news and current affairs, and they will live with the other things that they have put up themselves. It is important that they go through. It is important that the multichannelling is debated again. It is an absolute, total tragedy that multichannelling was not included last year, when I think it would have gone through; but it was not, so the more debates we have on it the better. I believe that is what this motion will achieve and I recommend it to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>22291</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government support this motion. I want to make sure Senator Bourne understands precisely where we are on these issues. We certainly believe it is important in honouring the commitment we gave last time around to bring the codes of practice and related matters back to the Senate. We, however, take the viewâand this is the view of the government; it is not a view of some members of cabinet and not othersâthat the ABC ought to be and therefore should be allowed to continue as a quality alternative to the commercials. What it is allowed to do and what it expressed happiness with being allowed to do back in June is a whole range of areas where you can be new and innovative and exciting and provide all those sorts of things that people instinctively look to the ABC for rather than to the commercials.</para></talk.start><para>I would very much hope that the ABC will take the opportunity to come up with a lot of material in areas like education, history, science, health, art and culture, finance and business, court and parliamentary proceedings, children's programming, international news, rural news, international documentaries, subtitled programs and occasional drama. There are a whole raft of areas where there is enormous scope for the ABC to demonstrate the difference between it and the commercials. So I hasten to assure Senator Bourne that we are very much committed to the ABC going down that path. We do not believe that its charter needs amendment in the way that the Labor Party does.

Both Senator Bourne and Senator Alston could not contain themselves in their glee as they explained to the chamber and those listening how the Australian Labor Party had misused its position, how it had given away its leverage, how it had behaved poorly and had not thought through its position in terms of what it was going to do on multichannelling last June and July and how, because of the calls that we made at that stage, the world was going to come to an end.</para></talk.start><para>Today, of course, we have exactly the same issue, the same decision and an identical response being put by Senator Bourne for the Democrats and by Senator Alston for the government. Senator Bourne's argument really is that, if the bill as amended goes as a whole bill to the House and is not split, it will remain down there, it will be lost and the government will not bring it back. Hence, the opportunity for the amendments that Senator Bourne's party regards as critical will be lost until the matter is revisited in another bill or another act some time in the future.</para><para>Our response to that is twofold. Firstly, we regard the issue of multichannelling as more important than the other aspects of the bill. We do not say that the other aspects are unimportant or minor but, in terms of the totality of the bill and the things that it seeks to achieve, we regard the multichannelling issue as a priority matter. That being the case, we believe it would be appropriate for the bill to remain intact. Who knows what would have happened if the bill had been passed in the form that we thought it would be passed in on Tuesday and had gone down to the House? Who knows whether the government might revisit its policy position, accept that multichannelling is a wise option, accept the bill and return it to the Senate? We will not know that, Senator Bourne. We are not going to have the opportunity over the next few weeks to see that, because you and the government have made a pre-emptive decision not to allow that option to be given consideration.</para><para>I think it is appropriate to put that on the record in a nice and gentle fashion, Senator Bourne, as you put it on the record in a nice and gentle fashion on Tuesday when you were joined by Senator Alston. I will not pursue that. It is there, and we now understand who has been serious in this game. For the record, the opposition oppose the process that has been put before us by the government and the Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>22292</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âJust to sum up, I think it is probably better not to touch anything that the minister said, which was quite extraordinary. However, I should mention a couple of the things that Senator Bishop mentioned. Senator Bishop says that this is exactly the same situation as we had in June last year. To tell you the truth, I have had absolutely no media representatives knocking on my door about this except the ABC and SBS. I do not recall that there was anybody at all from FACTS, anybody at all from Channel 9, anybody at all from Channel 7, anybody at all from Channel 10, anybody at all from Foxtel or anybody at all from Optus Vision. Nobody has been knocking on my door about this except the ABC and SBS. </para></talk.start><para>There is zero imperative on the government to pass this bill, unlike last June, when the imperative was huge; it was massive. We were on the last day of sitting. There were very powerful, rich and important people knocking on the government's door, knocking on Senator Bishop's doorâor perhaps Mr Smith's door; they were knocking on somebody's door in the oppositionâand knocking on my door, and they wanted that bill passed. They did not care if the ABC and SBS had unrestricted multichannelling. I still do not know how the opposition could possibly have given in, not stuck to that amendment and not given the ABC and SBS unrestricted multichannelling.</para><para>The situation today is so different that it is ridiculous. It is farcical. It is unbelievably different. There is no imperative on the government to pass this billâzero. In fact, the minister has just said that he knowsâand I knowâwhat is going to happen. Senator Bishop, you say that nobody knows. Come off it! You have been around a while. Good gracious! Anybody who has been around the House of Representatives or the Senate knows exactly what would happen to this bill if it went through to the House of Representatives in its current form. You know it as well as I do. The minister knows, I know and everybody knows. It would languish, because there is no pressure to pass this bill. The only people who want this bill passed are the ABC and SBS.</para><para>Despite what the minister just said, I do not think that the greatest fans of the ABC and SBS are in the government. I do not think that is the case, sadly. I wish I did, but that is not the case. It is a huge and most outrageous furphy. When I see it in the press release, I am going to have to tear it into many little pieces and probably tread on it. It is absolutely outrageous. I know your press release is ready to go, and let me tell you, Senator Bishop, so is mine. It is absolutely ridiculous. I cannot believe you even said that. I suppose you have to say thatâfair enough. But it is so patently untrue and so patently a furphy that it is absolutely unbelievable that anyone would say it.</para><para>I should be a little more calm here. I will in fact, as Senator Bishop said, respond in a nice and gentle fashion. I am sorry I lost my nice, gentle fashion there. I am going back to my nice, gentle fashion. To sum up, the reason why we need to pass this motion now is that the situation with regard to this bill could not possibly be more different from the situation with regard to the bill last June. The situation is that, if this bill goes through without being split, the whole bill will go down. It will languish. It will just disappear. It will never be seen again. The ABC and SBS will not have the complaints handling procedures that they want under their own boards, and SBS will not have the restriction on multichannelling for international news and current affairs lifted, as it would be under this bill. It is very important to the ABC and SBS. They know it. They believe this is the right thing to do. It is very important to them that this happens. I am going to stick with itâdespite the vilification that is about to followâbecause it is really important that the ABC and SBS get these small and large advantages, which they otherwise would not have.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âThe question is that the motion moved by Senator Bourne be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bills, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Bills reported.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Adoption of Report</title><page.no>22293</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Rosemary (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Crowley)</inline>âThe Chairman of Committees, Senator West, reports that the committee:</para></talk.start><para>(a)	had considered the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 [2001] and, pursuant to the instruction of the Senate, had divided the bill into two bills, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 [2001] and the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Multi-channelling) Bill 2001; </para><para>(b)	had amended the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 [2001]; and</para><para>(c)	had agreed to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Multi-channelling) Bill 2001 with enacting words and provisions for titles and commencement.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Alston</inline>) proposed:</para><motion><para>That the report of the committee be adopted.</para></motion><para>Amendment (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bourne</inline>) agreed to:</para><quote><para>At the end of the motion, add "and that further consideration of the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Multi-channelling) Bill 2001 be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting".</para></quote><para>Original question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>22294</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Alston</inline>) read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TALLIES AND PICNIC DAYS) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>22294</page.no><id.no>R1104</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>22294</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 28 February.</para><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>22294</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn this matter, I can at this stage foreshadow that the Labor Party have circulated amendments to the amendments we understand the Australian Democrats will be moving. Let me firstly deal with the issue of picnic days. The Labor Party, whilst expressing the opinion that we would have preferred to oppose this bill outright, can accept the intention of the Democrats to excise the picnic days provisions from what ultimately might survive in this bill. We support those Democrat amendments, which have been foreshadowed through their circulation in the chamber, in removing references in the bill that relate to picnic days.

I dealt with this issue at length in my remarks in the second reading debate. Essentially, the position the Australian Democrats came to was that at present the issue of public holidays is present in the act but it is not defined, and picnic days are not mentioned at all. Picnic days intertwine very closely with public holidays, particularly the state determination of them. In a number of states the determination of public holidays not only is the standard 10 days outlined in the Industrial Relations Commission test case but also includes those days designated in certain states as being an appropriate public holiday, such as Canberra Day or Melbourne Cup Day. The consequence is that there are only a small number of awards in which the picnic day is a discretionary day in lieu of a public holiday. If employers or employees want to contest that as a part of awards or agreements, they may in fact do so with the IRC, and the IRC is at liberty to knock them off. Because the vast majority of picnic days are taken as, or are part of, a designated public holiday, they would continue regardless.</para><para>Having tried to go the route of defining public holidaysâwhich was one way of dealing with itâand finding that that probably unnecessarily added to the act, in the end we said to ourselves that this is not an issue apart from in a few awards. Employers concerned with those awards, if they feel strongly about it, can contest them in the Industrial Relations Commission. Accordingly, we have moved to amend the bill and consider only tallies in the bill. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>Amendments agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>22295</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move Democrats amendments (3) and (4) together:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(3)	Clause 2, page 1 (lines 9 and 10), omit "a day to be fixed by Proclamation", substitute "the day on which it receives the Royal Assent".</para><para>(4)	Clause 2, page 1 (line 11) to page 2 (line 2), omit subclause (2), substitute:</para><para>	(2)	Item 1 of Schedule 1 commences 12 months after the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent.</para></quote><para>These amendments give some certainty to the timing of the act and when it should occur.

It gives a very precise time line. The original time line was six months. We had submissions made to us that it should be at least 18 months. The commission had indicated three years. The government itself is trying to accelerate that to six months. We agree with the acceleration concept but unfortunately the resources of the commission are such that we doubt, given all the other pressures, that six months would be enough time and therefore we think that 12 months is more appropriate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>22295</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs I foreshadowed before Senator Murray formally moved the Democrat amendments with respect to picnic days, the amendments have the support of the Labor Party because, in essence, they excise from this bill the government's intentions in relation to picnic days.</para></talk.start><para>Amendments agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>22295</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move Democrat amendment (5) on sheet 2053:</para></talk.start><quote><para> (5)	Schedule 1, page 3 (line 2) to page 10 (line 18), omit the Schedule, substitute:</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Schedule 1âTallies</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Workplace Relations Act 1996</inline></para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">1  Paragraph 89A(2)(d)</inline></para><para>Omit ", tallies".</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">2  At the beginning of paragraph 89A(2)(d)</inline></para><para>Insert "incentive-based payments (other than tallies),".</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">3  After section 89A</inline></para><para>Insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">89B  Review of certain awards</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	Within 12 months after this section commences, the Commission must review all awards containing clauses that provide for, or regulate, tallies and, after considering appropriate alternatives, may vary an award to remove such clauses.</para><para>	(2)	Any clause that provides for, or regulates, tallies that is contained in an award ceases to have effect at the end of 12 months after this section commences.</para><para>	(3)	After the end of the period of time mentioned in subsection (2), the Commission may vary any award to remove any clauses that have ceased to have effect because of subsection (2).</para><para>	(4)	If the Commission varies an award under subsection (1) or (3), it must include in the award provisions that ensure that overall entitlements to pay provided by the award are not reduced by that variation, unless the Commission considers that it would be in the public interest not to include such provisions.</para></quote><para>The Australian Democrats have agreed that the race has been run for tallies in the meat industry.

However, we believe tallies have a narrow definition which attaches itself to the meat industry.

I move amendment (1) on sheet 2132:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 2, paragraph 89A(2)(d), omit "(other than tallies)".</para></quote><para>Our amendment to item 1 and other amendments that have been contemplated by the Labor Party are intended to address what Labor see as fairly significant deficiencies in the original bill and also in the Democrat amendments. Senator Murray alluded to that difficulty in his second reading contribution the other night. It is a problem of definition. The Democrats have at least provided a definition in their amendments for what constitutes a tally, but their definition is potentially as dangerous as the government's lack of definition.</para><para>It is common ground between the Democrats and the government that the aim of the tallies amendments is to reform what is alleged to be an inefficient tally system in the meat industry and that the amendments should apply only to the nine federal meat industry awards. However, there is a real issue here of whether other awards, apart from those dealing with the meat industry, will be affected by this legislation as it was presented by the government. The opposition's amendment to item 1, and those amendments foreshadowed with respect to items 2 and 3, deal with an attempt by the opposition to clarify that this instrument is directed at the meat industry. </para><para>We maintain our principal position, which is that the commission should determine these matters and should also determine the flow-on of its decisions. So, in principle, we still have a concern with the government's bill and with the Democrat amendments. However, if the amendments were to proceed through the parliament, the concession that we had indicated to the Democrats we were prepared to consider if our amendment to item 1 was supportedâthat we would clarify item 2, in terms of the parliament using a very heavy-handed instrument to impose a flow-on process on the commissionâwas to confine it solely to the meat industry. In that sense, the proposal circulated in sheet 2132 by the Labor Party was a package proposal, and we would hope that we would have Democrat support for our amendment to item 1. </para><para>Let me go to the substance in that respect. There is no standard definition of a tally or any other piece rate or incentive based pay system operating in awards. The commission, in its background paper on the federal meat industry decision, described a tally as one form of the more general class of payments by result systems of workâin other words, incentive based payment systemsâbut it provided no guidance on how to differentiate within that general class. The commission said:</para><quote><para>The notion of tally systems in the meat processing industry is built around a daily level of the input for production to be processed within ordinary hours by a specified or calculable number of employees.</para></quote><para>The commission is clear that this is a tally as it is understood within one industry. To quote further:</para><quote><para>They are dealing with a specific industry and specific awards but that notion is not limited to that industry.</para></quote><para>We are dealing with legislation of general application across the entire work force directed at section 89A of the act, and that includes every fruit-picker, every shearer and every manufacturing industry pieceworker. I think some illumination on this matter is required. As I think Senator Ludwig pointed out to me, if you look at the definition of the word `tally'âand the government have already pointed out to the Senate the importance of common meaning usagesâin <inline font-style="italic">The Macquarie Dictionary</inline>, it includes, `The number of sheep shorn'. When we move on a bit further on this issue, I will have questions for the government about their information with respect to how tallies operate within other industries. I am hoping they will have more information than that provided to the committee when we held hearings on this bill. I am aware that there are a number of awards that include the notion of a tally. I am hoping that the government will be able to clarify for the first time in this debate precisely how tallies operate across all industries, given that their current bill is not limited to the meat industry.</para><para>All of the awards for fruit-pickers, shearers and manufacturing industry pieceworkers who have incentive based pay systems are potentially affected by this bill and are potentially affected by the Democrat amendments. In my view, it is impossible to construct a generic definition of a tally that would be limited to the meat industry. Thus our proposed amendments that clarify that the commission has discretion with respect to incentive based payments do not seek to apply some negative definition by referring to other than tallies still not being specific to the meat industry. If we are successful on that point, our amendments then clarify the concession that we had been prepared to make that the commission's decision in relation to tallies in the meat industry flows on in a fairly heavy-handed fashion on this particular occasion and, from our point of view, we would not like to see an established precedent.</para><para>Our amendment provides certainty by expressly limiting the removal of tallies to one industry. The amendment also inserts into the act recognition of the wide class of incentive based pay systems that exist in the real world by specifically including that description used by the commission. The other beauty of this solutionâand I must also give Senator Murray credit for thisâis that the amendments respect and uphold the umpire's decision and the umpire's discretion in relation to that broad class of incentive based pay systems, and they do not seek to exclude as allowable matters anything else that might be referred to as the tally in whatever notion or sense in some other award. It is concerning that this bill is seeking to address section 89A of the act. If we look at the scope of section 89A it states: </para><quote><para>Industrial dispute normally limited to allowable award matters</para><para>(1) For the following purposes, an industrial dispute is taken to include only matters covered by subsections (2) and (3):</para><para>(a) dealing with an industrial dispute by arbitration;</para><para>(b) preventing or settling an industrial dispute by making an award or order;</para><para>(c) maintaining the settlement of an industrial dispute by varying an award or order.</para></quote><para>What is being proposed here is that we remove tallies on the basis of a meat industry decision when the notion of tallies exists in other awards. This has a potentially broad and significant impact on the act, much more broadly than with respect to the meat industry and a specific decision in the meat industry. This case is a little like what the government sought to do with pattern bargaining. They have used a very broad and poorly defined instrument and are purporting to achieve one particular outcome with that instrument but its scope is much broader than intended. I look forward to the department providing the committee with more information about the other usages of tallies in federal awards, because I think it will be the first time that that information has been made fully available, both to the opposition and to the Australian Democrats, and will affirm our case that we need to more clearly defineâmore than the Democrats are proposingâthis instrument in relation to its impact on tallies.</para><para>I think the Australian people agree that we must clarify the commission's role in these areas. I think it is important. For instance, we had a survey released earlier this week in Victoria that indicated a 93 per cent small business level of support for the role of an independent umpire. I do not think it is time for the Democrats, the government or us to be supporting a proposal that further limits the commission's discretion. There is no doubt that there are a couple of points that are very clear here in relation to what the government are seeking to do. The government are seeking to remove the term or notion of tallies from allowable matters. It is clear that tallies do apply in other federal awards. If we do not deal with amendment (1) that I have moved just now and ensure that that reference to `other than tallies' in allowable matters is excluded, the commission's power will be limited in relation to those other awards that refer to tallies.</para><para>Some might argue that that is not going to have a significant impact because there are other provisions through award modification that have allowed those provisions to occur in other awards. But the commission does not have the resources to waste its time with these matters. If this parliament can confirm these issues now, why waste the time of a highly resource limited commission? Why waste the time of the industrial parties? Why give some parties an opportunity through confusion to undermine further industrial conditions in awards when it is so easy to confirm and clarify that the commission has scope to deal with incentive based payments across the board? But the parliament acknowledges the decision that the commission has made in the meat industry and, if our foreshadowed amendments are acceptedâthey are targeted clearly at the meat industryâthe process that the Democrats have suggested for moving along that flow-on can occur. </para><para>If we go ahead with the Democrat amendment, unamended, in relation to 89A(2)(d) of the act, then we will have big problems. We will have the Democrats conceding to the government that tallies, as they exist in other awards other than the meat industry, are compromised. At the very best, it will be a poorly clarified situation and, at the worst, the tallies will be compromised.

I think this is the main point at issue. Item 2, as proposed to be amended, would simply insert into paragraph 89A(2)(d) `incentive-based payments' without any qualification. I think that is the intention of Senator Collins's amendment. Tallies as used in the meat industry are arguably a type of incentive based payment. So this amendment would technically allow the commission to introduce new award provisions for tallies in the meat industry. Regardless of all the rhetoric, I think that is ultimately what the ALP would seek to have. So it entirely contradicts one of the objects of this legislationâthat is, the omission from the list of allowable matters, which is proposed by item 1 of Democrat amendment (5), as amended. We would also contend that it would be contrary to the purpose of the Democrat amendment, and that is why we oppose it.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Collins also asked for qualification in relation to reference to the word `tally' in awards, and I think I can add some further information and illumination to the debate in that regard. I suspect that Senator Collins may already know the answer, but I am happy to put it on the record because it is something the government is quite clear about. We do not think that further clarification should need to be made, but for the record I have been advised that there are some 35 federal awards other than the meat industry awards that use the word `tally' but that these references relate to tallying as a numerical counting process rather than in the meat industry context of a pay system. There is a significant difference. It is simply not credible, particularly for people who have had experience in the industrial systems, to try, for their own reasons, to confuse the two. There is a significant difference between references in relation to numerical counting and references to the use of tallies in pay systems.</para><para>As I said during the second reading debateâand I certainly tried to make it quite clearâthe Industrial Relations Commission has confirmed that the terms in section 89A of the Workplace Relations Act are `to be given their ordinary meaning having regard to industrial usage.' The removal of tallies from paragraph 89A(2)(d) of the actâthat is, from a list of pay systems covering piece rates, tallies and bonusesâis clearly directed at the non-allowability of the tally pay systems used in the meat industry rather than references to the counting type of tally for other purposes.</para><para>As someone without experience in handling industrial relations before the commission or any other place it is quite clear to me and, I am sure, to those who have more experience than Iâand that is virtually everyone in this placeâand the only way you would seek to confuse it is if you are trying to create a political outcome which is totally contrary to the bill. If you disagree with the intent of the bill it is probably more frank and upfront to just vote against it. But if you agree with government's purpose then you would support the bill.

One day a waterside worker who was called got up and saidâand I think properly saidâ`Why should we be selected out like this because of a particular belief, a particular attitude taken by the Crown?' That memory was brought back to me by what is happening here now. Every other worker in every other industry can have their wages decided by a tally except for the meatworkers.

What you are doing, and what everybody else here is thinking, is that you come here on the basis of having had plenty of inquiries and people giving evidence. But that is not what comes before the court. What comes before the court is what is written down. That is what the court will look at if this should be challenged. And the commission is the same. They have to look at what the words areâas they are and as they will continue to be into the futureâand it will be forever fixed in legislation that for some reason everybody can have tallies but the meat industry. People are going to get up and say that we did this inquiry, we got all this evidence, we had a look at it all, and therefore this makes sense. But what has to be looked at by the commission and, more importantly, by the courtâand the High Court if it should ever come to thatâare the words of the statute, and the words of the statute mean that every other worker in every other industry throughout Australia can have their wages assessed on the basis of tally, except the meatworkers. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I have to declare an interest hereânot a financial interest, although I always think financial interests are in some way the least of the interests. I have to declare an emotional interest. I have a son who is the industrial officer for the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. That union came before your inquiry, Senator Murray, and was very peremptorily dealt with. Nobody wanted to ask them questions. Nobody investigated the issue with the union. Mr Graham Bird flew up from Melbourne and my son Justinâa very good industrial officer, may I sayâwas there. Very few questions were asked. Having made this investigation, having asked about two questions of them, the situation now arises where this bill is brought before the parliament and on this very flimsy investigation a provision is stuck in to exclude meatworkers.</para><para>I suppose for the sake of the record I should say that my wife, Lillian, also has an interest in the sense that she is a partner in the firm that acts for this union. So I agree that I may be affected by a matter of interest, but because I have the interest does not mean that what is happening here today is not wrong. It is wrong, because you are saying that if you are a worker on a building site, you are going to be all right; if you are a worker in the electrical trades union, you are all right; if you are a worker in the shops, you are all right; but if you are a worker in the meat industry, your character is such that you are going to be treated in a less decent fashion than every other worker.</para><para>About 2,000 years ago, there was a sort of legislative tribunal that said it is better to sacrifice one person for the good of the nation than for the nation to perish. In a certain way, that is what is happening here today: it is better for the meatworkers to perish than for the rest of the industries that may want to have their wages adjusted by tallies to be unable to do so. It is better for the meatworkers to be sacrificed than for the balance to be. Here we have the sacrificial lamb. It is the lamb to the slaughter. These people are the ones who usually do the slaughtering, but in this case they are being slaughtered. </para><para>In this industry, you cannot point to any official in the union who has had any sort of criminal conviction, but you can point to the employers. You are giving advantage to employers in this industry, an industry where the character of the employers could well be cured, if I can put it in neutral words like that. I do not want to go into that, because people say they know the industry and the sorts of employers in the industry. You are now prepared to sacrifice workers in favour of those sorts of employers who have very doubtful records in many casesânot in all cases, by any means. You say, `It's not the workers; it's the unions.' But it is not the unions that get paid on the tallies system; it is the workers. That is who you are sacrificing: the workers in this industry. </para><para>As I said in my speech during the second reading debate, they are the people who have to get up early in the morning and go out there and kill and slaughter and be splashed with blood; they rip open carcasses with all sorts of innards pouring out; they prepare the meat by dressing, boning and doing all those sorts of things. They are the sorts of people that you say are the only people in Australia who should not be capable of getting an award with a tally in it. So be it. The deal is done and away the process goes, but do not think for one minute that you are doing something that is noble, something that is great, something that is going to cure this industry. You are not. What you are doing is taking away from one class of people, one group of workers, an ability to get an award that you give to every other worker in Australia. If you said, `There should be no tallies at all,' at least you would not be making that distinction. When it is all said and done, tallies are an incentive system. If you want to abolish that system, then so be it, but taking away incentives in the form of tallies or in any other form seems to me to be a very funny way of going around an industrial relations system. But that issue has been argued.</para><para>So, in the noble redness of this house with its grand tradition coming down from the House of Lords in England, we make this legislation which affects the people who are in a red house of a much different sort: a house which is red with blood, a house which has all sorts of stuff which you could not bear to look at. We in this chamber, in this red house, are going to pass for people in another red house laws which prevent them and them only from taking a process which will be available to everybody else.

They may not. He holds strong views, but I do know him to be a fair and just proponent of his views.</para></talk.start><para>The first problem we have got in the billâand it is so with many, many things; and I think it is rightly so with many, many thingsâis that there is no definition attached to the word `tallies'. We are a party, as everyone knows, which believes that it is the job of the Industrial Relations Commission to examine definitions and determine the detail and meaning of industrial relations matters under the law. The argument that everybody else will have tallies but not the meat industry is utterly wrong if you believe that the way in which the word `tallies' is used in other awards is the same as in the meat industry, and the evidence to us is that it is not. I think members on your side, Senator Cooney, have already said that. `Tallies' has many meanings, and the idea that meatworkers, as a result of excluding the word `tallies' as it is currently used in the meat industry, are therefore excluded from incentive based payments is utterly and completely misleading. Of course they will be able to address incentive based payments, and they can call them by whatever name they wish. They can call them incentives, they can call them motivations, you name it, but they cannot call them tallies as determined in the Industrial Relations Commission's test case. That is the point. </para><para>The Industrial Relations Commission's test case has said that tallies, in the form as currently used in the meat industry, will go and they will go within three years. This legislation attempts to speed up that process and regularise it. You can take issue with that; of course you can. But it is not this chamber or the Senate committee process which decided this matter; it was the Industrial Relations Commission. If you disagree with the Industrial Relations Commission's view, then what you should be proposing is to overturn it through legislation. What this chamber is considering is confirming the Industrial Relations Commission's test case viewâthat tallies as currently used in the industry will go within three years. You must know that to then jump from that to say that `everybody else uses tallies in the same sense currently as the meat industry' is a misrepresentation. Perhaps it is an honest mistake, but you must know it is a misrepresentation. To suggest through that that meatworkers will then be excluded from incentive based payments is absolutely wrong. It does not say there `incentive based payments except for the meat industry'. It says:</para><quote><para>"incentive-based payments (other than tallies in the meat industry),".</para></quote><para>That is to say, as currently used and as determined in the Industrial Relations Commission test case.</para><para>Then we move to a further difficulty. I have heard you before, Senator Cooney, criticise Labor policy and then vote with themâwhich is the way with your side, and I respect it. Your very amendments in items (2) and (3) accept the point. I am not going to exaggerate the point. Senator Collins has made it clear to me and I am sure she will make it clear to the Senate that she regards that as a clarifying concession, so I do not want to overexaggerate the point. But the fact is that, instead of saying you will vote against us altogether, the Labor Party was prepared to amend it to say `tallies in the meat industry'. So you are arguing against your colleagues, Senator Cooney. That is terrific; I have no objection to that. But it seems a very strange thing to see amendments here which clarify the very point I am making: that this legislation deals with the Industrial Relations Commission test case and seeks to accelerate a process of regularising and resolving a process which is already under way. I have no objection to those who say, `You should rather just leave it and let that go their way.' That is a point of view. But to jump to that and say that this is a consideration generated by this chamber, by a fairly perfunctory moment in Senate committee hearings, and then that it excludes meatworkers from incentive based payments, is wrong. Therefore, very courteously, I must disagree with you, Senator Cooney, and I make my points accordingly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>22303</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOne thing that I might have some remote skills in is interpreting statutes. It would surprise me if a statute were interpreted by a court in the way that Senator Murray says. The court would look at the plain meaning of the words, and the words are `incentive based payments other than tallies in the meat industry'. The words `as currently interpreted' or `as interpreted five years ago' are not in there. It is just wrong to say that a court would look at this section other than in the clear meaning of the words, which are:</para></talk.start><quote><para>"incentive-based payments (other than tallies in the meat industry),".</para></quote><para>Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I would just say to Senator Murray: there are no words in the section which has been proposed which say `as currently understood'âabsolutely no words at all. To say that it means `as currently understood' is just not right at all. All I am pointing out is that the effect of all this is, as I have said, confined to the meat industry. There is no doubt about that. The very use of your phrase `insert incentive based payments other than tallies in the meat industry', which is your phrase, Senator Murray, indicates that tallies are incentive based payments, otherwise you would not make exceptions. This means that, if this is being interpreted 20 years from now, people will say, `Yes, everybody else can have tallies.' But, if there are tallies in the meat industry, of whatever sort, 20 years from now, they will not be able to form part of the award. The meaning of a statute is the meaning set out in the words. That is fundamental. We learned that in our first year at law school. To simply say that 20 years from now, even five years from now, this will be interpreted on the basis of what your understanding is of tallies in the meat industry now is just not correct. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>22304</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think in this discussion I need to take all of us back to core principles. I want the Democrats to know exactly what they are doing here. Years ago we had the debate on allowable matters. We lost that debate, and we understand that section 89A operates. But what the Democrats are doing here and perhaps do not quite understand at the moment is a far more significant concessionâa far more significant concession. Nowhere else in the act, in section 89A, do we pick or choose industriesânowhere. Nowhere does the parliament seek to intervene in the commission's powers on an industry by industry basis. Nowhere in the act has the parliament sought to interfere with a commission decision and its flow-on in the way we have in this matter.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Murray does not seemâand this concerns me greatlyâto understand or represent the real concession that the Labor Party has made in this matter. The concession is that in our amendment No. 1 we clarify that the commission has broad powers under 89A in relation to all incentive based payments. That is the basis on which we then moved items 2 and 3. The fundamental principle here is the commission's power to deal with these matters. If the Democrats are prepared to go down the path of picking and choosing industries in this area, what will be next? Which industry will we next pick out? Which industry will we highlight next in the act? What will be the issue that we next choose it on? For goodness sake.</para><para>In the current climate, after the impact of the GST, I would have thought that the Democrats were thinking very carefully before just adopting a government proposal on an amendment like this. This is a fundamental principle of industrial relations law. You have meddled once: you introduced the allowable mattersâthe Democrats know our policy thereâand now you are going further. The Democrat and government proposals do not just pick matters that are allowable; they now pick industries. In relation to industry policy, I thought the government actually objected to picking winners and picking industriesâbut not in industrial relations. They picked the wharfies. Who will they pick next? Maritime, meatâwhat were the other sectors? I think construction was next. Construction will be the next one. What commission decision will you now seek to flow on that might have a result in the construction industry? What is next here? What will follow this? If I were a member of the Australian Democrats at the moment, I would be very concerned with this amendment. There is a fundamental principle at stake here: do we pick industries in relation to the commission's powers?</para><para>I want to deal with a misrepresentation made by Senator Ian Campbell in this debate. He purports that our position actually says we will give the commission the power to reinsert tallies. For goodness sake, why on earth would we have made the concession that we have forecasted in relation to our items 2 and 3, were that the case? That is just completely inconsistent, it is completely contradictory, and our position is quite clear on paper. What I am disappointed about is that, in good faith, the Labor Party presented the government and the Democrats with a potential win-win situation here. This is a sorry day for the new minister, because he could not harness it. He could not harness it, and now he has compromised the Democrats as well. He could not harness the potential to facilitate the flow-on of the tallies decision in the meat industry, because he has the opportunity to now pick and choose in industries in relation to what are allowable matters in the commission.</para><para>The Democrats, it appears, have made that fundamental concession: we will not just pick allowable award matters now; we will pick industries. Which industry is next? We have had the maritime workers. We have had the meat workers. We know what the government went through in the processes with respect to the maritime workers. Who is next and what will be the methodsâand will the Democrats continue to collude? This is the matter of fundamental concern. </para><para>But in relation to more detail, I want to pin the minister to some pretty significant issues. Matters of detail: will the minister please advise the committee on what basis he makes a distinction between tallies with respect to numerical counting and tallies with respect to pay systems? The common meaning makes no such distinction. So we would like to know the basis for which he purports to present that distinction today. I know that the department has been working on it late overnight, but I would be very interested to see it. When we had the hearings in this matter, at that stage the department purported to say tallies only applied in the meat industry.</para><para>There is another fundamental flaw in the government's arguments here that they also need to addressâand this is relevant for the Democrats as well. Senator Ian Campbell referred to tallies as currently used in the meat industry. There is nothing before us that indicates that the use of tallies in the meat industry is consistent across all awards. There is nothing before us that indicates that. And that is why it should be the commission that determines the flow-on of decisions like this. That is why the Democrats would not proceed with their amended amendment. Unfortunately I do not think that the Democrats comprehend the consequences of what it appears they have agreed to with the government in this matter. The consequences are on two levels: one is in relation to bargaining in good faith, and the second is in relation to what the government has proposed.</para><para>I understand that the Democrats have really only had overnight to consider the government's proposals and I understand that the government has had quite a lengthy period of time with advice from the department on these issuesâalthough it is astounding that the department has only just become aware of the incidence of tallies across federal awards. The Democrats do not have the level of resource or experience to know the implications of what they are doing. But, for goodness sakeâgo back to basic principles. Go to the act, open the act, look at section 89A and look at what you are doing. What you are doing is inserting in that principle of allowable matters for the first timeâthe very first timeâa particular industry. There are no grounds for doing that; there is no basis for doing that.</para><para>Again, we had an opportunity to present to the government a position which was sensible, reasonable and pragmatic and which at the same time clarified law for the commission and their powers in relation to allowable matters. We do not think we can reinsert tallies in the meat industry; we know the commission will not do it. The concession we were prepared to make was to say that we will agree to the items 2 and 3 that I foreshadowed; and that is a pretty major concession in terms of the principles that the Labor Party supportsâa very major concession. But there is no double dipping here, guys. You cannot make us make one concession and expect us to come back and breach a fundamental principle. In industrial relations law in Australia, we should not pick industries. Let the commission determine, let the commission have that power, and do not compromise the act further.</para><para>I conclude at this stage by going back to my point to the government: please illuminate for us this supposed distinction between tallies that utilise the notion of numeric counting and tallies that utilise the notion you are claiming with respect to pay systems. On this occasion, give usâas I had hoped you would on a previous occasionâsome case examples. Surely the department is up to that. Illuminate us on how you believe this distinction operatesâbecause I am nowhere near convinced and I am surprised that the Democrats are.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>22305</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have listened to this debate and I want to follow Senator Collins, who has raised very serious questions about the allowable matters being subjected to, now, discriminatory treatment for or against one industry as against other industries.

I cannot seeâas, indeed, Senator Collins cannot seeâthat it is appropriate, proper or reasonable to adopt the attitude that seems to have been adopted by the government and the Australian Democrats, that discrimination against a particular industry can take place.

I have to say that I am confused by the ALP's approach. For the first half of this debate in the second reading stage and the committee stage, we have had the ALP basically saying that the flaw in our policy is that removing tallies will affect all industries, and that it will affect shearers and everyone else. We have given assurance after assurance and, in fact, have indicated support for two of their amendments and support for a Democrat amendment, which make it quite specificâas the commission has doneâthat we are addressing tallies in common industrial usage in the meat industry. In fact, as I understand it, Labor's amendments Nos 2 and 3 specifically do that. Now we are being attacked for `picking on'âand they are not my words; they are paraphrasing the words of Senator Cooney and othersâthe meat industry. You cannot actually have it both ways.</para></talk.start><para>You cannot come into this place with credibility after the most recent Labor governmentâthe political wing of the union movement government when Laurie Brereton was the ministerâbrought in the unfair dismissal laws. They made specific provisions in that act. Senator Harradine would remember that better than most because he took a very special interest in that legislation. In that act they used the trade and commerce power under the Constitution to a limited extent to give the commission additional powers in respect of waterside workers, flight crew and maritime employees. With the exception of flight crew, they were almost the exact industries that Senator Collins named.</para><para>The point I am making, Mr Chairman, is that the Labor Party cannot come in here and say that we cannot pick out specific industries, when the last time you time you were in powerâwith that genius Laurie Brereton as the ministerâthe then government in 1994 introduced regulations excluding from some termination remedies particular employees in the meat, building and maritime industries.

Briefly, Senator Harradine did ask an important question as to a better motivation for the reasons for this. At the moment, section 89A(2)(d) of the act sets out the particular area of allowable award matters as dealing with piece rates, tallies and bonuses. That is a narrower range of items than if it included incentive based payments. The acceptance of incentive based payments by the government is a major win for industrial relations matters, in my view. In my view, and the view of my party, it considerably enlarges the opportunity for payments by results areas to be included in awards.</para></talk.start><para>You say that, while the Labor Party have accepted thatâand they view it as attractiveâthey wanted it to be unconstrained. The problem is that this particular bill deals with tallies and is trying to address tallies in the meat industry. Incentive based payments, if left without definition, would or could be construed as to include tallies in the meat industry as currently used. Therefore, we have to ask if that is a problem. The problem is that the Industrial Relations Commission has said that tallies are not consistent with the objectives in the act, particularly objective (a), which promotes higher productivity and a flexible and fair labour market. They say tallies are not in the interests of workers as well as employers and that any replacement incentive based payment scheme must meet the criteria of promoting higher productivity under section 3 and the efficient performance of work under section 88A.</para><para>Tallies, as used in the meat industry currently, are on their way out as a result of the AIRC test case. If we accept the Labor amendment, they will still be able to argue that they fall under the incentive based payments. It leads to considerable uncertainty in the industry. It is not a question of picking on the meat industry; it is a question of clarifying for the meat industry exactly what is open to them and what is not. What is open to them is incentive based payments but not tallies as currently operating in the meat industry.</para><para>We know that courts, if they have to deal with these things, do pay attention to explanatory memoranda and the debates and the motivations. We also know that their primary source is the statute, as Senator Cooney correctly outlined. This is an attempt to have a major win put in the act but to indicate clearly that it does not mean tallies as presently used in the meat industry. That is all. I think the Labor Party is taking a political point quite effectively, and is taking an extreme viewpoint, but that is unfair in terms of the motivation of the amendment and what has been achieved.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>22307</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have been very careful not to reflect on the Democrats' motivation in this matter. I have indicated concern that you have allowed yourselves to be convinced by the government to compromise what is, I genuinely believe, a very serious principle. The point I was trying to take you toâand I know that the Australian Democrats have other things on their minds at the momentâis that section 89A of the act relates to the principle of an allowable matter, which you and the government agreed to insert into the act. At that stage, that is a principle. I do not like it, but I accept that it exists at the moment.</para></talk.start><para>I am trying to explain to you that you are taking things beyond that principle. You are now saying that we will adjust that principle to take away the discretion as it exists at the commission level. You and I both know that the commission has made many decisions with flow-on implications across quite a number of different industries in relation to the application of allowable matters, but I ask you as a point of principle: on this occasion, with respect to meat, why do we need to insert it in the act? It is a bad principle. That was the concession we believed we had reached. That was the concession the government then proposed to undermine, and it is concerning that it seems they have successfully done so. </para><para>I know that your motivations here are genuine. I am not disputing that, and I am disappointed that you thought I might be indicating otherwise. But I think it is more than just a political point; it is a matter of good faith in dealing with these issues and simply accepting overnight, under the circumstances of what is occurring within your party at the moment, the government's good faith on an issue like this. We went through this exercise with pattern bargaining. We know what the government's advice was like on that occasion. Don't rely on their advice on something like this overnight in the circumstances of what is occurring within your party. It leads to bad judgments, and that is what I genuinely believe is occurring here.</para><para>We are not saying that we compromise the commission's decision in any way. If anything, the package of amendments that we proposed reinforced the commission's decision in the meat industry and conceded, against a principle that I support, an accelerated implementation process imposed on the commission. That was a significant concession to achieve what we believe was in principle the right expression to go into 89A. That has now been compromised by the Democrats accepting the government's proposal.</para><para>The government did not seek to discuss this issue with us. The government did not raise this issue with us. The minister here today has twice now avoided my questions on justifying how this distinction can be made. All we have had from the minister so far is that they believe there is a distinction when we are referring to tallies, which I remind you that they only discovered overnight in a number of industries. But now they believe that there is a distinction and that that distinction is based on a distinction between tallies relating to numerical counting and tallies relating to pay systems. For the second time, the minister has refused to answer how he believes that distinction works. I do not know that the government have an answer, and that is the really scary part of it. Equally, he has not answered that they operate consistently even in the meat industry. He has not addressed that matter either.</para><para>There are such huge holes in the government's argument on this basis that it concerns me that the Democrats are prepared to write into a fundamental principle in the act in relation to allowable matters a distinction based on tallies in the meat industry. How on earth are the commission going to differentiate? They are going to say, `Okay, it's the meat industry and it's a tally.' But how is that tally different to, say, a tally that operates exactly the same way in another industry? Do we just automatically exclude that also? The same principle is at stake here. Should we extend that principle? The proper place for this discretion in relation to allowable matters is the commission itself. We are not denying the decision that they made. We are not avoiding the decision that they made. For Christ's sake, we were accepting the decision and joining with you in a flow-on process for it, quite contrary to our principles about how flow-on should occur in industrial relations matters.</para><para>The sad thing that this debate seems to indicate is that the Australian Democrats have simply accepted at face value the government's arguments about tallies. They have convinced you to compromise a fairly fundamental principle in relation to how allowable matters are described in the act. When presented with the issues, it appears they are incapableâSenator Campbell might now startle meâof even justifying the distinctions that they are talking about regarding tallies. Let the commission deal with the incentive based payments they believe are appropriate and benefit the workers. The commission have already told us that they do not believe tallies, as they operate in one award in the meat industry, benefit the industry and the workers. That is fine. Let them decide that in eight other meat industry awards. </para><para>We conceded a process with you so that that would occur in an accelerated fashion. But don't let them compromise the principles associated with allowable matters. Don't start bringing the parliament into situations where we legislate every significant commission decision because the industry wants to come knocking on the door of government, saying, `Hey, we want this sped up.' That is a very bad principle for industrial relations.</para><para>I say to you genuinely, Senator Murray: I did not have a discussion with you on the government's amendment. When I became aware of it, I sought to speak to one of your advisers and time constrained that opportunity. It is unfortunate perhaps that the only opportunity for this discussion has been in the chamber today. But I beseech you to not simply accept at face value what the government are putting to you on this occasion. You know from experience that we have, through the committee process, been able to demonstrate to you the flaws in their arguments. The evidence on this occasion has not been put. The government discovered only overnight the tallies that they have been denying exist in quite a number of awards. Now they put a reasonably limp argument that there are supposed distinctions in how they operate, but they have not demonstrated that. They have not given us one example of how these purported distinctions work. Senator Campbell referred to passion in this debate, but there is basic logic as well, Senator Murray. The government have not demonstrated their case.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>22309</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not think it is right, Senator Collinsâand we have a good relationship, so this is not a strong criticismâto talk about us accepting arguments on face value. Somebody could argue that we accepted on face value your arguments on union picnic days. We have made a consideration. Very briefly, let us recap. The consideration is as follows. If you just use incentive based payments, it could be construed to mean tallies. Therefore, you have to move on and you say `incentive based payments other than tallies'. If you say `other than tallies', it includes more than the meat industry, and the purpose of this is to address the meat industry. Therefore, you have to say `other than tallies in the meat industry'. That is the logic.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>22309</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe debate seems to have slipped into a persuasive argument. Let me add to that persuasive argument in two parts. The debate that has just been put to us from Senator Murray, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, seems to centre on how a tally is going to be defined and how it is then going to be interpreted. The problem that we also have is that this is not going to happen in a vacuum. The commission is not going to consider it on its own. The commission is not going to consider it without parties putting alternative views before it. But adding the words `other than in the meat industry' at section 89A(2)(d) does not provide the safety net that is provided in section 89B and also might not be able to give comfort as to why it could not be put in 89A and why it could exist in 89B. Section 89B(4) states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(4)	If the Commission varies an award under subsection (1) or (3), it must include in the award provisions that ensure that overall entitlements to pay provided by the award are not reduced by that variation ...</para></quote><para>So there is a safety net provision that at least the employee's working pay will not be reduced as a consequence. But in subsection (2) in your amendment, there is no such safety net provision. If we concentrate for a fraction of a second on the employee at the end of the line in a meat processing plantâand, of course, the meat industry is a bit broader than just thatâthere is no argument that they could as a consequence have reduced pay or conditions if they cannot access an incentive based payment system whereas, under 89B, they still could.</para><para>I hope you have had the opportunity of reading the Federal Meat Industry (Processing) Award decision by Justice Giudice, Justice Munro and Commissioner Leary, because it is illuminating in a couple of respects. If you have not already read it, I will not take you to the provisions, but I am certainly open to a correction from the government's side. In summary, they found that tallies, by and large, in that industry were not being adhered to as they should have been in terms of appendix 3 under that award. It ranged into a whole range of differential tally systems and tally systems themselves had got, in some respects, a little out of date. The industry had moved on. It had moved from saws and knives to air operated secateurs and the like. So part of the industry had also recognised that and had introduced different incentive based payment systemsâstill called tallies, because that seems to be traditional within that industry, as it is traditional within other industries as well. </para><para>They recognised that appendix 3 under that award needed change but they found that it was not a case of looking under the 89 exclusory provision, as was argued by the employers. They found that it was perhaps more of a general powerâthey could then say that this was an issue that needed to be dealt with. By that example, the commission has very broad powers to stretch across a whole range of work to find appropriate solutions. But it can do that because it has the latitude to be able to effect that. The problem that I perceive in your amendment's subsection (2), Senator Murray, is that it narrows the commission's power to such an extent that, in that industry, it may not have the latitude to be able to bring about the changes that it has set in train.</para><para>The changes that it has set in train will come back before Commissioner Leary in April this year. This is an industry that started with a very fixed position about tallies. It seems that the employers managed to convince the government of the day to deal with tallies. They had already started to deal with them but things have been very entrenched. They have gone to the extent of going to the full bench of the commissionâto the president, no less. Both sides have been very fixed about how they are going to progress the industry. A lot of other industries, in moving forward under these provisions, moved away from the award proper and went into consent or certified agreements. But not this industry. It has remained a hard fought battle to have change brought about in this industry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âI am glad you admit that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name></talker><para>âI think that is clear. I will take that interjection. If you have conditions that you have held on to and dearly wished to maintain them, you would not let them go. Similarly, the employers have wanted changesâI did not say positive changesâand they have spent, I suspect, a considerable amount of money seeking to have those changes made. What you then open up in your amendment in No. 2 is the ability for employers to open up another front. Employers may find another bucket of money to pour into this industryâwhich is an export industry valued by Australiaâso they can concentrate on industrial relations over a provision that has been amended and placed in 89A(2)(d), rather than getting on with the tasks they have set.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The commission has already come to a concluded view about how to deal with it and the industry is moving on. I suspect if you open up the argument again and allow a chink, you might find either the employers or the unions seeking to leap into it and spending a whole raft of time and money in saying, `We can avoid the direction that we are currently proceeding down.'</para><para>The other issue of course is whether or not it affects other industries. The commission, as I have said, do not determine these things in a vacuum. They go back to principles. They do not necessarily have to go to extrinsic material contained in second reading speeches or in debates if the language is plain. If the act or material before them is plain, they do not need to resort to reading the transcripts of what has transpired here today to determine what it means.</para><para>The issue that Senator Campbell has raisedâand I think that was probably in response to an earlier argument that I putâis that `tallies' has a usual definition or expression in a range of industries which is peculiar to those industries. But, similarly, that can be picked up from industry to industry and carried about. Employers and sometimes employees can agree that a certain method of remuneration, based on both the number and the rate of pay that would attach plus the hours of work, is a tally system. I do not know how Senator Campbell can say that a tally system is a numerical system and differentiate it from a payment system. I am a little bit perplexed at that, as Senator Collins is. I really do await an explanation as to how that would occur. Perhaps an example would be good.

It appears that he has decided not to justify this distinction he purports to make, which I think actually leaves the department in a very embarrassing situation. They have obviously given the government advice on a distinction that they think is relevant. The government is not able to justify the distinction that Senator Campbell referred to. I suppose that not only is this a big vote of no confidence in the department themselvesâif they cannot justify the distinction that they are giving the governmentâbut the problematic part is that the Democrats, in attaching themselves to the advice that has been passed on to them and not to us, seem to become complicit in the vote of no confidence in the commission. That is the principle that is being undermined here.</para></talk.start><para>Let me, for the benefit of the committee, give two employer perspectives on this matter. One is from a major industry group across industries. Essentially, their view is that this is a second order issue. I suppose then you might say that, if it is a second order issue, why start compromising significant principles in dealing with it? That is where their solution is extraordinarily problematic.</para><para>Another employer perspective that I think is very useful came from a participant relevant to the meat industry. When I pointed out to him in discussions that, if the government accepted the original Democrats amendments, he would have a solution to the situation so why was he visiting me, the response was, `Because we want to start operating in a bipartite fashion.' By `bipartite' he meant between the two major parties in industrial relations. That is the saddest component of this exercise. The new minister had that opportunity. The department and the government cannot justify the basic distinctions they have made in the operation of tallies. For perhaps political reasons, the government has been able to convince the Democrats, but it has not convinced us here today. The government has not given us one case in which it thinks it can uphold that distinction. It reflects very poorly on all involved and will probably disappoint the very constituency that the government is trying to work for.</para><para>Yes, employer representatives in the meat industry will get an accelerated flow-on of the decisionâwhich they probably had anywayâbut they have lost the opportunity for a bipartite approach and good faith amongst the parties in dealing with industrial relations. That opportunity was available to the new minister, but he has lost that chance. Unfortunately the DemocratsâI am not commenting on motivation hereâhave become complicit in the process, which is further undermining the act.</para><para>I encourage anybody listening to this debate to go to section 89A and see what the section as a whole does. It does not pick test cases or industries. For heaven's sake, what are we encouraging here? We will have poor government in the future because the act will not reflect principles; it will reflect adhocery. This time it is the NFF. The minister did not purport to achieve his ends in the maritime dispute through the act itself, but maybe he will try it that way next timeâ`What industry or section will we pick next?' The commission has a process. It makes test case decisions, and they flow on. Let nobody be confused. The commission said, `Tallies in the meat industry are part of a broad generic group of incentive based payments. We think that in the meat industry they do not work to the benefit of the workers or the industry, and we have determined the matter.' The Democrats and the government seem to be placing a big vote of no confidence in the commission. </para><para>Labor foreshadows that it will probably lose this debate, but I again beseech the Democrats: I do not think, politically, this is the time to compromise yourselves. I think this is a very bad political choice for you. If on rational grounds you cannot see the error involved here, at least see the error on political grounds. I am astounded that that has not occurred to you. But it may occur to some of you; we do not know. The Democrats have split on issues before. They split on some of the industrial relations issues in the first wave. The Democrats split on the GST. Will they split on this one? Again, it is a fundamental issue about how far you go with the government on industrial relations. I understand that, to some Democrats, allowable award matters are not particularly popular.

The government has not given them any way to rationalise their case. They have compromised fundamental principles in allowable award matters. Politically, I think that will reflect badly on them. They have the problems with the GST at the moment. The situation here is that the government cannot justify its treatment of tallies.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In his contribution, Senator Ian Campbell said that the Labor Party had made distinctions. But we have made distinctions with a principle. The principle was that the legislation would affect industries where the national interest was significantâthe national interest in terms of how industrial matters are managed. That is a longstanding industrial relations principle. It has been in place since the act first came into existence. I agree with Senator McGauran: the future of the meat industry is very important. The productivity in the meat industry is very important and should be a matter of targeted attention by the parliament, but not in this way.</para><para>Equally, you would not want to start dealing with other industries this way either. You cannot argue that legislation of this nature is necessary in the national interest. It is not consistent with the precedent in this area. I have given Senator Ian Campbell the example of why Labor in the past has made distinctions with respect to industries. But the more alarming example is that the distinctions this government have made with respect to industries have been for things like the maritime awardsâthat was obviously very unpopular with the Australian public. Now there is the meat industry. Let us consider some of the other examples. I wish Senator Carr was here to talk about what has been going on in the meat industryâthe extended industrial relations disputes that were encouraged by the previous minister locking workers out of meatworks for months and months on end.

He cannot justify the basis of the distinction so I fail to see how on earth the Democrats have been convinced. You cannot justify any distinction yet you seek to compromise a fundamental principle by going into another level of interference in relation to the commission's powers. How could it get this far wrong? Senator Murray believes that his amendments would actually extend the commission's powers under section 89A. With respect, Senator Murray, your amended amendments do not. They compromise a fundamental principle, something you were not prepared to do in the first round of allowable matters.

Senator Collins was talking about the costs involved with cases and it occurred to me that that is right. There is presently a case going on in Melbourne in relation to meatworkers, which I do not want to go into details about because it is presently before the court, but I can say that the costs are quite astronomical. That leads me to the proposition that there is a presumption that, somehow, if we go away from the award system and go to agreements that will be a fairly cheap way out. Whereas, in fact, the way that these processes are brought before the courts and the way that things are dealt with in the courts involves a lot of money. That becomes a particular problem if one side of the equation has a lot more money than the other side. I am not saying that employer groups are bad. In fact, I am saying they are good, because I think you ought to have organisations. But if one side is loaded up with money and the other is not there will be unfairness. That is something I do not think the Commonwealth department that has been instructing the parliamentary secretary ever takes into account.</para></talk.start><para>These days, industrial relations is conducted in a way that is very expensive unless, of course, you have some industrial strength. In fact, the sorts of groups that do succeed are those that have industrial strength. That has always been so and it is the way today. I was thinking about how successful some campaigns have been that were conducted in Victoria in recent times. The problem with this whole argument is that we are trying to adjust results in the industrial relations area that should be left very much to the parties themselves to proceed, either by way of agreement or by way of awards, or in some other way. One of the great disasters that has occurred in the field of industrial relations is the attempt by this government to interfere in the natural give and take of the workplace. What we are talking about now is a great example. People are talking about tallies. I have spoken to Senator Ludwigâa man who represents, if you like, the system as it ought to workâabout how there ought to be proceedings before the commission and proceedings by way of being taken to the field. I am not saying he took people to the field, but that is the way through. But as soon as this sort of legislation comes forward, as soon as we start getting discrimination and as soon as we start having people who do not know enough about how industrial relations really works doing things, there are real problems. And so you get your Wodongas, your Graftons, your Camperdowns and so on in the meat industry. It just is a terrible pity. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>22314</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI still have not heard a response from Senator Ian Campbell in relation to the matters that I have put.

What concerns me most, amongst the other matters that the Democrats and this government seem to be supporting, is where they say `other than tallies in the meat industry'. Notwithstanding the definitional problem of where the meat industry starts or stops, as I understand it, the argument with respect to tallies is that tallies are bad and should be taken out of the meat industry. But the commission recognised in paragraph 150:</para><quote><para>We were told that some tally provisions have been updated and are not subject to the deficiencies identified in this application. Where it can be demonstrated that this has occurred and that the provisions are in active use, the case for deletion of the provisions might not be compelling, depending upon the circumstances overall. </para></quote><para>So we also have a provision where the commission has identified that tallies in the meat industry may still be relevant, may still be in active use and still being dealt with. In paragraph 149 the commission identified that there were another 19 awards in the meat industry identified as having the word `tally' within them.</para><para>The industry, if they were following the processes of the commission, were aware that at some point the commission would review and bring them to task and account as to whether the tally provision that they have, and which is in active use, is deficient or whether it can be sustainable in a modern meat processing plantâin other words, whether it meets all the relevant tests that the commission has laid down. And of course they would want the opportunity to do that, even the employers within the industry might want the opportunity to do that, if it is a modern, relevant provision. But, by the adoption of Democrat amendment No. 2, they do not get the opportunity to do that. You then force an industry or a company that has a tally system and which is operating effectively within the meat industryâwhich could exist, as we have been led to believe by the commission's decisionâto spend more time and energy, and money, I suspect, to pay for consultants and lawyers, to look for alternatives to the tally system because Senator Murray has decided to knock it out.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âThe question is that opposition amendment No. 1 to Democrat amendment No. 5 be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question put:</para></interjection></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>12:21:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.[ </para></division.header><para>(The ChairmanâSenator S.M.

We had proposed a package of amendments to the Democrats and we had indicated to them that we believed we were making a fairly significant concession in relation to our moving, as I am now doing, items 2 and 3. I want to put very clearly on the record that the concession we were making here was compromising the principle that the commission itself should determine flow-on matters of test case type decisions. But we accepted that the Democrats appeared from their amendments to be accepting the government's position that the parliament itself should intervene and prod along the commission that they have so poorly resourced over time. So the parliament says to the commission, `On the one hand, we want to prod along your processing of matters but, on the other hand, we are not prepared to give you adequate resources in order to deal with industrial matters in our federal system.'</para><para>Senator Murray has himself expressed concerns in the past about the level of resourcing at the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I reiterate and join with him in those concerns. In presenting this package to the Democrats, we conceded and accepted that the Democrats had accepted the government's position that they should prod along the commission and flow matters on. But we also pointed out to the Democrats that there were flaws in their proposal in that it did not seem to contain the matter sufficiently to tallies in the meat industry. So we proposed the amendments we have put here to insert, after tallies, `in the meat industry'. Despite my comments about dealing with these matters in good faith, we still believe that, if this matter is going to proceed, the Democrats amendments need to be targeted solely at the meat industry. In part, I suppose, I was surprised that when the Democrats amended their amendments they did not actually incorporate that criticism because, as I understand, they accepted the argument that these matters do need to be clearly contained to the meat industry.</para><para>Having lost amendment No. 1, which the opposition had presented to the Democrats as part of a package position involving a concession regarding amendments Nos 2 and 3, we are now left in a somewhat strange position where, for the public good and to ensure that a bill we are now likely to lose our position on proceeds in the most efficient manner, we still need to proceed with the matters in the package that we had discussion with the Democrats on.

Part of my work as a senator is to service constituents who work in the industry or would like to work in the industry. The problem is that the employers in this industry are quite often able to inflict the most brutal treatment upon their employees in a manner which disgusts me. The way that some Australians treat other Australians in industrial relations is nothing short of a disgrace. The way this government protects those employersâand I am afraid the Democrats seek to provide comfort and assistance to this government on these mattersâis, frankly, a disgrace. We have had a long series of complaints about employers in the industry which quite literally go to issues of a criminal nature. To suggest that the problems in this industry can be laid solely at the door of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union is just completely wrong. We have had circumstances in my state where workers have been locked out. Some of the longest lockouts in the history of this industry have occurred in recent times. This is the political climate we are now operating in.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Murray, when you are offering support and comfort to this government, perhaps it would be helpful if you were able to talk to people directly involved in this industry. Talk to the workers down at O'Connor and find out what has actually been going on. In recent years, various disputes have occurred at Mt Schank, Portland, Wodonga, Camperdown and in the Western District of Victoria at Ararat. Employers have used scab labour, lockouts and violence and have been supported by the battery of crook lawyers who are prepared to use the courts in a most unAustralian and, as far as I am concerned, quite unconscionable way. They are the same people who are prepared to use the industry as a vehicle for securing ill-gotten gains, through criminal means on occasions, and we have a government which is prepared to defend those people. Then we are told that the problems in the industry come down to a political incentive payments arrangement.</para><para>This discussion today is about trying to minimise the harm that the government is trying to inflict upon Australian workers. Our concern here is that the way the meatworkers are treated is not extended to other workers. I know that the meatworkers are more than capable of defending themselves and have done so for many a generation in this country. They have seen 30 per cent of their number lost from the industry. They have seen quite savage assaults on their wages and conditions. They have seen circumstances arise where governments have done the bidding of crook employers in an attempt to punish the good employers. They are giving aid and comfort to the crook employers who then undermine those good employers who are prepared to engage in proper industrial relations practices and pay decent wages and conditions. Those good employers are being undermined by the crooks who produce product at much cheaper rates because they are using cheap labour, often in circumstances which, as I said, ought to be the subject of serious police action.</para><para>This issue about tallies touches a very raw nerve, because the attempt to portray this industry as having problems caused by organised labour is completely off the beam. Senator Murray, I must say to you that I am disappointed, because you claim to bridge the gap between capital and labour in this country. But you fail miserably in that task because you do not understand the simple facts of economic and social life in this country, where the very powerful, particularly in rural communities, have access to advantages, privileges and resources that the less powerful do not have. In fact, the only strength they have is their capacity to organise industrially and act collectively. They seek support through the labour movement politically, but industrially it is their capacity to deliver on the ground that protects their wages and conditionsâoften against politicians who seek to undermine their livelihood. Senator Murray, I am very disappointed that you have failed to actually go to these people and talk to them; instead you have just taken the views of this government and the employers, who are often the worst employers in the industry, who want to take advantage of their temporarily strengthened position within this industrial relations climate they currently have. </para><para>The tallies issue itself will not be solved by this legislation. The incentive payments system will survive whatever the government seeks to do. It is embedded in the industrial relations agreements, and it will be embedded through the Industrial Relations Commission. The government's attempt to load these various measures onto the commission without providing them resources or the capacity to deal with them is another part of its general strategy, in my opinion, to strip workers in this country of their capacity to seek justice through the legal system; therefore, they will be forced to take up these issues in the field. I am sure that is what this will come down to: who has the strength in the field? You will find that a government that is seeking to destroy labour and destroy conditions under which workers work will in fact produce circumstances where the level of industrial disputation, the level of misery and the level of social suffering will increase through the pig-headed attitude of a few ultraconservatives within this government, aided and abetted, unfortunately, by their allies in the Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>22317</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to add to the very eloquent words of Senator Carr. Senator Carr raised earlier this morning the issue of what will happen in the field. This issue is not going to be confined to this industry; I think the building industry is going to be targeted here. Once strong representation in the building field is lost, then you are going to have people killedâfor example, people working on scaffolding that is not properly put up. People are going to be cheated of their wages. Look at the recent example of people brought out from India who were put to work for years at a wrong wage. Who got onto that? It was the union that got onto that. Another example was in Melbourne, where the building section of the CFMEU, led so well by Martin Kingham, have got proper wages and conditions only through strength. As Senator Carr has said, if this is allowed to go on the lesson is that unless it is done in the field people will not obtain what they are afterâwill not obtain justice.</para></talk.start><para>When you say let us have an umpire, let us have a commission, and then you nobble the commission in such a way that it is not able to make the awards that people might want made, then you are in trouble.

I am pointing out, Acting Deputy President, for your information, why this matter is urgent and should be dealt with expeditiously and certainly should be dealt with today. The news of these 58 crop trials and the fact that they were (a) secret and (b) unsupervised has been a bombshell in Tasmania. It has drawn into question very seriously the inability of the minister for health and his Interim Office of  the Gene Technology Regulator to control the crop experimentation by the multinational corporationsâon this occasion, Aventis and Monsantoâin Tasmania. There are enormous consequences of that. These include the potential spread of the genetically modified component of the canola crops that gives poison resistance to those crops and therefore to the brassica weeds related to those crops in the near environments, and its possible release into the environment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are further consequences: adjacent farmers do not know whether their seed from non-GE crops has been contaminated. The organic industry in Tasmania will not know whether, as a consequence of the spread of these genes, it will not have been contaminatedâbecause it is not a 100-metre buffer zone, as the Gene Technology Regulator says, that is at risk here: it is many kilometres from the spread of pollen that affects the farmlands.</para><para>The minister, Dr Wooldridge, has a lot to answer for here. This proposed motion is to get information as expeditiously as possible back to the Senate by Monday on his role and on the apparent negligence of the Gene Technology Regulator in not being able to prevent the potential spread of gene technology and in her own lack of active concern when she says that `while the breaches are disappointing, they represent negligible risk to human health and the environment'. That is totally unacceptable. The situation is outrageous. It has grave economic as well as potential health consequences for Tasmania, for consumers and farmers alike. It is a major issue and it needs addressing rapidly. I urge the Senate to support this motion as a means of getting this recalcitrant minister into a state of action, even after the damage has occurred through his inaction in the past.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>22319</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âVery briefly, Mr Acting Deputy President: we will be opposing this.

You need Senator Brown to agree, otherwise he can make life very untidy for us: he can keep calling quorums and divisions and not giving us leave to do things.

Whilst it tries to do that, we will support the legislation, and I think it is important to note that for the record.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>22322</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. As has been said, the bill is part of the government's reform of the criminal law. It amends offence provisions in portfolio acts to ensure consistency and compliance with the criminal code. The criminal code establishes the general principles of the criminal responsibility that will apply to all Commonwealth offences from 15 December 2001. The code may alter the way the offences are interpreted by the courts. This bill ensures that when the code commences, the criminal offence provisions in portfolio acts will continue to operate in the same manner as they operated previously. If these amendments are not made, then the criminal code could alter the way the criminal offence provisions currently operate. The bill also makes other minor amendments which are not strictly necessary for harmonisation, the purposes of which are consistent with the code and consistent with general criminal law policy to simplify offence provisions and improve their operation. </para></talk.start><para>With respect to the issue that Senator Ridgeway has raised, the minister did respond to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in a quite lengthy four-page letter. I would table this letter but I do not have a signed copy of it. However, a copy of the four-page letter can be obtained from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. It is presumably a public document. I will also ask Senator Alston to table a signed copy of his response at an appropriate time today. It is not appropriate for me to table something that is not signed, so you will have access to a copy of the response. </para><para>These amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997, subsection 534(3), which relates to the return of inspectors' identity cards, and subsection 548(2), which relates to general powers and inspectors, make them strict liability offences. These offences are very similar to other portfolio offencesânamely, subsection 268(3) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992 and subsection 29(3) of the Protection of Movable and Cultural Heritage Act 1986, which relate to the return of inspectors' identity cards, and subsection 279(2) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992 and subsection 39(2) of the Protection of Moveable and Cultural Heritage Act 1986, which relate to general powers of inspectors and which are strict liability offences. As subsections 534(3) and 548(2) of the Telecommunications Act 1997 are minor offences with a small pecuniary penaltyâthat is, five penalty units and 20 penalty units respectivelyâwhich provide a defence of reasonable excuse which is an indication of strict liability, they have been made strict liability offences to provide consistency with similar offences in other portfolio legislation. </para><para>That is generally a sort of synthesis of some of the arguments that are in the letter. I do not know whether Senator Ridgeway has had access to the letter. He did mention that the minister had responded, but I will ask that the minister table the response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's concerns.

The amendments proposed by the bill are designed to maintain the status quo; namely, to ensure that criminal offences and related provisions continue to operate in the same manner as at present following application of the criminal code. If the amendments proposed by this bill are not made prior to 15 December 2001, then many existing criminal offence provisions in the Attorney-General's portfolio will be constructed in a manner inconsistent with the criminal code's principle and may be interpreted and forced in an unfamiliar manner.

It is important to note that this outsourcing can be achieved by delegation to Indigenous Business Australia, by appointment of an appropriately qualified and suitable person or body to act as ATSIC's agent, or by contracting out to external providers. The Australian Labor Party is not opposed to an organisation such as ATSIC being able to contract out commercial functions as long as this is an option, not a requirement.</para></talk.start><para>These changes are designed to allow greater ease in delivering some of the commercial aspects of ATSIC's programs, including more effective partnerships between the public and private sectors in order to enable effective indigenous participation in the economy, to ensure economic independence and to escape welfare dependency. However, we believe it is not enough to focus just on commercial business and restructuring of the welfare system. There needs to be a broader economic agenda. Achieving economic independence is intrinsically tied up with the equitable allocation of resources and funding. It is achieved through ownership and access to land, it is achieved by ensuring that indigenous people have access to the education and training to achieve jobs in these and other businesses.</para><para>Furthermore, a diversity of indigenous circumstances requires a diversity of program responses. Business aid must take a diversity of forms. It should be recognised that at many times the cutting edge of indigenous business is the result of a mix of the commercial and the cultural. The social and the economic are often interlinked in indigenous enterprises. In fact, in most cases the economic goal of commercial development is tied up with the social policy goal of increasing employment for indigenous people and redressing welfare dependency and disadvantage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>22325</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Australian Democrats, I welcome the passage of the <inline ref="R1185">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2000</inline> and the establishment of Indigenous Business Australia. I have spoken to ATSIC and to members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, who are supportive of the bill. I think Indigenous Business Australia is a very appropriate name for the face of commercial indigenous enterprise in this country, because more and more indigenous Australians do mean business when these opportunities are provided. I think it is important, in the context of a shift in policy from government in this respect and the outsourcing capacity being given to ATSIC to deal with business initiatives, that there is an opportunity to start to imagine that indigenous people can run their own commercial operations and enter into joint ventures with some of the larger corporations operating in this country whether in mining, property, manufacturing, agriculture or tourism. </para></talk.start><para>I think everyone in this chamber would be familiar with the statistics of indigenous disadvantage, but my reason for reminding senators of this point is to highlight the need for full and resolute parliamentary commitment to achieving economic independence for indigenous peoples in this country. I remind not only this chamber but also the House of Representatives and every party that is represented in our democracy. The Australian government, of course, needs to do much more to correct the legacies of the past and to enable indigenous Australians to believe they are equal with all other Australians when it comes to employment opportunities, applying for a bank loan or undertaking a commercial venture itself.</para><para>I guess the shift in policy about seeking to refocus the former Commercial Development Corporation so that it is a lot more commercially oriented and open to partnerships with the private sector and financial organisations is a positive first step. Nonetheless, we need to be reminded that that step does not bring indigenous Australians even close to the starting line. The fact is that these are some of the basic challenges in life that many indigenous Australians do not ever dream of achieving. Whilst I am not here to say that it is all up to the government, there is a great deal of work in the government's in-tray, and it is yet to respond to and provide full answers to many of those issues.</para><para>Many years of research and reports, the fruits of countless consultative workshops in communities across the country and the dedicated resources of the former Council for Reconciliation have produced a raft of suggestions and constructive options for the government to consider and to act upon. The road map in the council's final report on reconciliation is nearly 12 months old, yet we still have no idea what the government is or is not prepared to do with the suggestions it makes.</para><para>It is probably poignant at this point to refer to comments by His Excellency Cardinal Clancy. He stated, with moral authority, his views on the matter in a recent speech by saying that there is one word more than any other that has extended our daily parlance in recent decadesâthe word `reconciliation'. He said that, in the process, it has become much impoverished and has lost some of its significance because it has come to refer to a relationship, bearing in mind that it will never be achieved by mere words but by deeds and a genuine national change of heart. He went on to say that we should not be intimidated by the magnitude of the challenge nor fall victim to the argument that the individual can achieve nothing at all.</para><para>The important thing to remember is that a lot of work has been done. The council has produced a final report, with four strategies, two of which are of importance on this occasion: the national strategy to overcome disadvantage and the national strategy for economic independence. The latter aims for a society where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities can share the same levels of economic independence as the wider community. The essential actions it recommends fall into the following categories: education and training, employment, access to capital, access to markets and trade, being able to address the additional challenges in regional and remote Australia, and partnerships and joint ventures. Every one of these issues requires government involvement and leadership. Some of them also depend on the business and corporate sector opening their doors and being prepared to work with indigenous peoples in partnership. There are real examples of the private sector recognising these kinds of partnerships make good business sense, especially in rural and regional Australia. I mention Moree with the Gwydir Cotton Valley Cooperative in my home state of New South Wales. Certainly, other corporations like Qantas and the Accor Pacific hotel group have come forward recently. </para><para>I think we need to be reminded that, at best, we are left to presume that the government is still considering and digesting the strategies contained in the council's final report, which was presented last May at Corroboree 2000. Similarly, some three months ago we were left to imagine what the government is prepared to do in terms of the six recommendations in the final report. The government has been pretty clear in its response to the suggestion of a formal process of negotiating the political, legal, cultural and economic position of indigenous people in this country. But what is not clear is the government's response to the recommendation to affirm the Australian declaration towards reconciliation and the action roadmap for reconciliation. Perhaps something that needs to be taken on board is the suggestion that the Australian parliament pass a formal motion of support for these documents, enshrine their basic principles in legislation and determine how the key recommendations can best be implemented. These are all pressing questions that warrant a response from government. To simply continue to ignore them and press on with the government's own agenda of practical reconciliation is an affront to everyone who has been involved in that cause over the past 10 years and to the many Australians who have walked for reconciliation.</para><para>These are questions that I intend to take up with the government on behalf of the Democrats to ensure that the potential of Indigenous Business Australia and the goodwill that has been expressed here today and by the corporate sector and the wider community do not flounder because the other essential building blocks are yet to be put in place. On behalf of the Democrats, I would like to take the opportunity to reaffirm our support for the important work that ATSIC and the Commercial Development Corporation have done in the implementation of their functions to promote and advance indigenous commercial enterprise in this country.</para><para>I also want to extend our support to the new Indigenous Business Australia. We wish it every success in its goal of achieving a strong Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander business presence in the national economy and improving indigenous economic self-sufficiency and wellbeing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>22327</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate.

So it is of interest that a senator from Queensland stands up and purportedly complains about the GST when of course the revenues of the GST will be flowing, in her case, to the Beattie government in Queensland. I make that point in case there is a bit of an attempt by the Labor Party to mislead the public about their approaches on various matters. There is a great attempt by the Labor Party to mislead the public, and I think it is important that you understand that the GST is your policy.

Didn't the tax office describe the advertising and promotion needed for the recent panic-stricken backflip as a `significant campaign' and say that it will be required in the run-up to the BAS3 deadline in mid-April?

As well as that, farmers and country people are smiling today because things are starting to look up in country Australia. ABARE, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, has predicted that lamb prices will rise through increasing exports and better opportunities. Although times have been tough for dairying, ABARE forecasts a six per cent increase in exports of cheese and a five per cent increase in the exports of whole milk. Last year, Australia recorded a huge increase in beef exports. Farmers and country people are smiling because the new tax system has helped with these exports, making all exports GST free. That is estimated to give a $4 billion saving to rural and regional Australia as a result of the new tax system.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Country people are also smiling because tomorrow councils in rural and regional Australia will start receiving their cheques for the $1.6 billion Commonwealth government investment in local roads. Those cheques are not a promise. They are not something that might happen; they will actually happen tomorrow when councils start receiving them. It will put the lie to Mr Beazley's claims of boondoggling or pork-barrelling with these very much needed road investments to local councils in rural and regional Australia. </para><para>Country people are smiling because just last week we announced a $150 million subsidy for untimed local calls in remote Australia. Earlier this week, my colleague Senator Alston announced a $25 million program to expand access to mobile phone coverage along the major highways, particularly in rural and regional Australia. This is why people are smiling in the country. This is why Mr Donges is correct when he says that this has been a great week for rural and regional Australians, because the government is listening.

In fact, as I am sure Senator Woodley well knows, the Victorian dairy farmers were the ones who effectively precipitated this action, because they started selling milk into northern Australia. As a result, other farmers in the dairy industry accepted that it was inevitable and therefore sought the dairy industry package to which I refer.

The ATO has been liaising with other agencies, such as Insolvency and Trustee Services Australia, and has been involved in high level discussions with the New South Wales Bar Association about this issue. The advice I have from the commissioner is that the commissioner has noted with approval the proposed new rules in New South Wales regarding applications for practising certificates in New South Wales. The commissioner added that, having recently completed an extensive review of barristers in New South Wales, the ATO will commence audit activity in the near future.

Since the introduction of the child care benefit, the number of children in long day care is up 22 per cent to 367,000 children. The number in family day care has gone up by 14 per centâthat is, to 95,000âand outside school hours care has gone up 16 per centâthat is, 124,000. The average use of long day care has increased by 13 per centâthat is, it has gone up to 87 per cent. Family day care has risen by only two per centâbut it has risenâand so the usage there is up to 52 per cent. The number of hours paid for in long day care has increased by 17 per cent, and in family day care it has risen by five per cent. So the bottom line is that this is good news for users of child care. They will have to pay less, because 95 per cent of them choose to go by way of fee reduction, and they do not have to believe anything Mr Beazley says on child care. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Sport and Tourism</title><page.no>22338</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>22338</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister.

As a result, when they do that, I think it only obvious that those of us sitting on this side will take the opportunity to point out the error of the ways of the ministers doing so.

I further ask: is the minister aware that the Prime Minister said in an interview on 2BL on 31 January that for Mr Brough not to be sworn in as a minister was `the right thing to do'âhis wordsâand that he, the Prime Minister, wants `to be completely satisfied that he'âMr Broughâ`is in no way involved because these people were employed by him'.

We do accept that at times there is disorderly conduct in this chamber and we do acknowledge that at times opposition senators do breach the standing orders and you properly, presiding in the chair in this chamber, call those senators to order. We do not complain, and we accept that at times in fact opposition senators and other senators go too far and are properly asked to apologise for their actions. But I do want to say this about question time today, Madam President: we have had a situation where consistently and, in my view, unfairly and in an unbalanced manner we have had opposition senators, particularly our shadow ministers on this side of the chamber, called to order. I myself made a decision early in question time not to take a point of order, because there were a number of important questions the opposition wanted to ask in this question time today. As it transpired, we have not had an opportunity to do so.</para><para>Each and every question asked by the opposition during this question time has been treated as a joke by the ministers who have been answering them. They have treated this particular question time and this Senate with complete contempt. Question time is an opportunity for opposition senators and non-government senators particularly to hold the executive accountable. An important part of that process is you yourself, Madam President, behaving in a way which allows fair conduct of question time and a fair shake for all concerned. I point out to you, Madam President, that there were continual interjections from government senators, and only after Senator Schacht was suspended from the sitting of the Senate was a government senatorâin this case a minister, setting another bad exampleâasked to withdraw and apologise. That is simply not good enough. If you check the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record, Madam President, you will see that we consistently had a situation where government ministers did not address the Senate through the chair but were chiacking, criticising and shouting at and abusing opposition senators across the chamber. That has been the pattern in this question time, and you were quite right to point out on a number of occasions that there was disorderly conduct on this side of the chamber as well. There was; I acknowledge it. It was disorderly and it was proper for you to call those opposition senators to order. </para><para>But it was equally proper to demand the same standards of behaviour from the government, and I do not believe that occurred in question time today. I do not accuse you of being partisan in the way that you presided over question time today but I do believe it was grossly unfair. I do believe it was unbalanced, and it did seem to me as if a deliberate pattern of behaviour had been determined by the governmentâI do not say it was communicated to you, Madam Presidentâbefore they came into question time today, and that was to abuse opposition senators asking questions, properly trying to hold the executive accountable in this important forum, in this chamber; namely, question time. It is not acceptable, and as far as the opposition is concerned we are going to do what we can to uphold proper standards in this place.</para><para>What we ask for is a fair go. What we ask for in this chamber is nothing other than balance and consistency. If we do the wrong thing we deserve to be criticised. Action should be taken. But if the government does the wrong thing, the same standards should apply to them. Madam President, I say respectfully to you today that that was not the case. It was not acceptable and I believe in presiding in question time today your performance was unbalanced.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>22342</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will ignore that tirade from Senator Faulkner, because I think there are far more important things to discuss in this place. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>âYou have to shuffle your trusts around, haven't you, Winston? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name></talker><para>âI am going to talk about trusts because I want to know what you people are going to do and what your policy is, as does every Australian.

Before I do begin though, I think that I should make two points up front and frankly. The first point is that I think one of the hardest jobs in this place is to be the Presiding Officer in this chamber. The standing orders are a guide, and a sensible means of conducting the standing orders is also a virtue in a Presiding Officer. Like Senator Faulkner, I make no criticism of you, Madam President, and your conduct today. I have to say that from time to time you have pulled me up and asked me to withdraw and I have. I do so out of respect for you as a person but also out of respect for the chair.</para></talk.start><para>The second point is that this is a parliamentary forum. Parliamentary forums in Australia are, by their very nature, robust chambers. I have been a participant in robust debate in this place and I make no apology for being a participant in a robust way. I certainly do not intend to change because that is the nature of this forum. But one does it within the standing orders and one obliges the chair when necessary. None of us should be pretending to be a shrinking violet, and I do not. I do agree absolutely with what Senator Faulkner said earlier: it is quite clear from the way the government conducted themselves today that they were sensitive and that they were on toast as far as perceptions of their own reliability and of keeping their own word with the electorate are concerned. They came in here with a clear plan to be provocative, to disrupt question time, to then provoke the opposition and to try to victimise opposition senators. Unfortunately, they succeeded in that insofar as Senator Schacht is concerned.</para><para>Through question time today there were numerous examples of ministers directly addressing themselves to members of the opposition. Indeed, Madam President, you had occasion to speak to me directly and I acknowledge that. I thank you for bringing me to attention. Prior to your doing that, Senator Hill, who was at the table and who moved the motion to expel Senator Schacht from this chamber, breached standing orders quite explicitly and directed to me personally, in direct terms across the chamber, provocative comments to which I, unfortunately, responded.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>âWhat did I say that was so provocative?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>âI was the one that got named, and not Senator Hill, for the original breach.

One wonders what the meaning of the standing orders is. When you look at the rules for questions, standing order 73(4) says:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>In answering a question, a senator shall not debate it.</para></quote><para>What did Senator Hill do? He got up and debated it. What does Senator Kemp do invariably? He gets up and debates the question. What do the opposition questions call for, in breach of what I think the standing orders set out quite clearly? They call for statements on government policy, and government ministers get up and make statements about government policy. When that type of conduct is permitted, it is easy to see that perhaps the chair has accepted that type of conduct as permissible and that flexibility in the interpretation of the standing orders as reasonable.  </para><para>If we respond to that type of standard in a way in which we are entitled to but then get picked on and suspended, as in the case of Senator Schacht, I think it is quite fair to say that, as happened today, the proceedings of this chamber are being conducted in a manner which unfortunately and regrettably attracts the term `unbalanced' as a description of the management of affairs. I think the responsibility is with the government. This is question time; this is questions of the executive. When they are asked a direct question they should answer it. But all too often what the government do is try and carpet the answer with all sorts of obfuscations and never face up to the question.

There was some quite disgusting behaviour, with ministers standing over committee chairs who would not deal with the committees in the way the ministers wanted.

It is quite shameful, and I call on you, Madam President, to resist their pressures. They are in such a poor state and in such a policy freefall that they have nowhere else to go but to try to shut down this parliament and to cause as much grief in here as they can. Yesterday we saw Senator Kemp forced to withdraw some quite unparliamentary language. It went on all last week, and the reports from other committee members are that the government ministers were quite intimidatory of the government chairs and quite disgraceful in their behaviour.</para><para>This week we have seen an attempt to cover up the government's most shameless backflip, and that is on trusts.

Funnily enough, how many lawyers are there on the front bench of this government? There are 10 or 12 on the front bench.

That is what has gone on in here today.</para><para>We have had Senator Crane on his feet a couple of times wanting to talk about trusts and the rorts that have gone on. `It's okay,' he says, `I agree the Sydney lawyers are a problem,' and yet his entire frontbench are lawyers.

They did not insist that trusts be taxed, when the ANTS package recommended it. The government caved in and the Democrats rolled over, so we got rushed off to Ralph. What did we do with Ralph? We said, `We take you at face value.' You give it to us in writing that you will tax trusts, and we will support the package on a revenue neutral basis. What did we see this week? A cowardly backdown in the face of policy panic from the government. No wonder Jeff Kennett called Peter Costello a dog.

In Auckland in November 1999, APEC Economic Leaders and Ministers reconfirmed their commitment to achieving the Bogor Goals of free and open trade and investment by 2010/2020, a commitment echoed by APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade at their meeting in Darwin in June 2000. </para><para>A range of initiatives has been put in place recently to ensure that APEC remains on track to reach the Bogor targets. A number of these enjoy the active support and cooperation of Japan, including the introduction of an electronic IAP system, a new and expanded program of work for the APEC Market Access Group and seminars on investment and competition policy.  In addition, Japan has played an important role in ensuring continued APEC support for the early launch of a new round of comprehensive WTO negotiations (affirmed by APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade) including preparatory work on industrial tariffs.  The Government will continue, wherever possible, to cooperate with Japan in the APEC forum to achieve these goals. </para><para>In addition to APEC-wide liberalisation measures, Australia is working with Japan to strengthen the operation of markets in the region.  The Government recognises the importance of such measures to delivering the full benefits of trade and investment liberalisation, and will continue to work with Japan, and other APEC economies, to encourage such action.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4 - Chapter 6, page 151</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that the Australian Government urge like-minded countries seeking greater liberalisation in agricultural trade to lobby for the commencement of the new round of WTO trade talks at the earliest possible date.</para><para>The Government welcomes the Committee's recognition of the need for Australia to urge a new round of World Trade Organization (WTO) trade talks.  Although a new round launch is unlikely before 2001, the Government is using all avenues bilaterally, regionally and multilaterally, to rebuild momentum towards a new market-access focused round, concentrating on further liberalisation in agriculture, services and industrials. </para><para>Since Seattle, Australia has been exploring the scope for flexibility between members to achieve greater convergence on unresolved issues.  Building coalitions of support for realistic approaches, particularly among middle ranking economies, seems to offer the best prospect of moving forward.  In agriculture, the Government has been instrumental in securing timely work programs for the mandated negotiations which began in early 2000.

Additionally, the ATC will influence Japanese consumers by using endorsements from influential identities, such as celebrities, opinion leaders and top names in specific fields.  Trade development strategies will focus on influencing and educating appropriate levels of the travel industry that generate business to Australia.</para><para>The Australian Government recognised the need to ensure that standards are continually improved in the inbound sector to provide the best possible tourism experience for international visitors.  To this end, the Federal Government supported the establishment, under the auspice of Tourism Ministers' Council (TMC), of a National Inbound Taskforce comprising representatives from industry, the Commonwealth, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.

Unless registered on CRICOS, a provider will not be permitted to teach students on student visas.</para><para>The National Code sets standards for matters such as educational facilities and resources, marketing, monitoring and assessing student performance, refund policies, grievance procedures, as well as student support services.  It also sets requirements for the registration of providers, including where there are subcontracting or franchising arrangements, in order to ensure consistency across the States and Territories.  When the National Code takes effect, the Commonwealth will continue to work with the States and Territories by referring to them matters requiring investigation (where education providers appear not to be meeting the National Code requirements).  </para><para>ELICOS courses are accredited by the National English Language and Training Accreditation Scheme (NEAS).  This accreditation is used as a basis by all State and Territory governments for their accreditation for CRICOS purposes.  (The NSW Government has delegated authority to NEAS). </para><para>NEAS accreditation requires an institution to conform to minimum quality standards for teaching the English language to overseas students.  NEAS accreditation ensures that courses adhere to set standards, including class size limits, the professional qualifications of teachers - including specialist Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) qualifications -  up-to-date teaching methods and services to assist overseas students with accommodation, orientation and welfare counselling.  </para><para>NEAS also consults with State, Territory and Commonwealth Governments on issues relating to English language teaching and the international student program.  Once the ESOS National Code comes into effect, NEAS will have to assess ELICOS courses in conformance with it, for the purposes of registration of providers on CRICOS. </para><para>The new ESOS legislation, and in particular the National Code, will continue the strong working relationship that exists between the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments.

This work involves a range of activities, including active participation in the WTO's Technical Barriers to Trade Committee and the APEC Sub-Committee on Standards and Conformance, as well as assisting Australian Technical Infrastructure bodies to gain recognition for Australian test reports and certificates in overseas markets.  It also involves considering the potential for bilateral mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) on conformity assessment with some of Australia's key trading partners.  MRAs improve market access for exporters by reducing or eliminating the risks, time delays and costs associated with duplicative product testing and certification to obtain regulatory approvals for entry into foreign markets.  </para><para>The process of investigating the establishment of MRAs is in itself constructive in exposing barriers to trade and encouraging the necessary preparatory work towards their removal.  This is particularly important where the technical and regulatory regimes of the countries involved are substantially different.

These guidelines accord with the recommendations of the Committee regarding potential new members. </para><para>Much of the work done by APEC's Working Groups includes projects with participation of non-member regional economies and of NGOs. </para><para>Economic and technical cooperation (ECOTECH) is one of the three pillars of APEC and all new members benefit from assistance provided through this area of APEC's work. In terms of other assistance to potential new members there is already a focus on this type of capacity building in Australia through the AusAID-administered APEC Support Program. The Support Program is mainly, although not exclusively, targeted towards developing APEC economies. It does not exclude non-member economies which may be potential future members of APEC. By its nature the provision of this type of assistance to potential new members is something which is more in the province of the developed members of APEC. </para><para>Recommendation - Chapter 5, page 111 Social Agenda</para><para>Since the Asian financial crisis APEC has broadened its work programs to address social issues and to develop appropriate responses to prevent similar crises in the region in future. Particular emphasis has been given to Human Resource Development issues such as overcoming the digital divide and the need for social safety nets. Australia has been active in supporting this emphasis including through initiatives such as the Australian sponsored report The Impact of the Asia Crisis on Children: Issues for Social Safety Nets. Australia is also, in partnership with Thailand, developing a $A5million three -year Social Protection Facility to build capacity in social policy and program delivery in the region. </para><para>Current non-member participation guidelines already allow non-business NGOs to participate in APEC activities where they have particular expertise on a case by case consensual basis. The Government believes that these guidelines are appropriate for the inclusion of NGOs and formal status within APEC is not necessary.</para><para>Recommendation - Chapter 7, page 143 Trade Facilitation</para><para>Since the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's submission to the Committee, APEC has published the report APEC Getting Results for Business which provides comprehensive information of trade facilitation measures undertaken in APEC. Australia prepared the publication. APEC also recently launched an Australian designed internet web site, Bizapec.com which provides access to a large volume of information on member economies and includes details on tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade.</para><para>APEC provides information on progress in economic and technical cooperation through the Ecotech Clearing House web site. </para><para>Recommendation - Chapter 7, page 155 Encouraging Initiatives by Business, Institutions and Associations </para><para>The Government will continue to encourage actively initiatives from the private sector, including institutions such as the National Association of Testing Authorities, to identify areas where trade and investment facilitation support is needed. For example, a survey of trade facilitation needs was undertaken in 1999 by DFAT which sought responses from a wide range of businesses, institutions and associations. The results of that survey have contributed to the direction of APEC's work in customs, standards harmonisation and financial and legal infrastructure work.</para><para>Recommendation - Chapter 8, page 179 Development Cooperation Programs</para><para>A large part of APEC's work program involves economic and technical cooperation in support of its trade liberalisation and facilitation goals.

(para 2.12)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the AEC remains an independent, professional and ethical organisation.  AEC personnel recruitment procedures require applicants to state that they have no active political affiliations.  Selection procedures for polling place staff require staff to sign undertakings concerning their conduct.  These procedures are reviewed regularly and necessary improvements made.  A further assessment of staff selection procedures will take place as recommended.</para><para>Recommendation 2</para><para>That the AEC devise a procedure for ensuring that polling for federal elections is not compromised in any way by the AEC's obligations to conduct other elections, and that the AEC ensure there is appropriate liaison between it and State and Territory electoral offices concerning the conduct of overlapping elections, including ensuring that State and Territory officials receive appropriate training and information on the requirements of federal electoral legislation. (para 2.14)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  Section 394 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act) prohibits the conduct of State or Territory elections on the same day as a federal election, without the authority of the Governor-General.  The Electoral Council of Australia (ECA), comprising all federal, State and Territory Electoral Commissioners, is aware of the possibility of overlapping parliamentary elections, and its members are able to advise their respective governments when conflicts might arise.  ECA consultation also ensures that training and information on the conduct of federal, State and Territory elections is provided to electoral officials as required. </para><para>Recommendation 3</para><para>That section 155 of the Electoral Act be amended to provide that for new enrolments, the rolls for an election close on the day the writ is issued, and for existing electors updating address details, the rolls for an election close at 6.00 pm on the third day after the issue of the writ.  (para 2.26)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  Equivalent changes should be made to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 (the Referendum Act).  The Government believes that the potential for enrolment fraud at the time of the close of rolls is sufficiently high to warrant this change.  The costs for the implementation of this recommendation will be approximately $52,000 in an election year, as there will be some offset savings, and approximately $264,000 in a non-election year.</para><para>Recommendation 4</para><para>That the time period for enrolling as an overseas elector be a uniform two years from the date of departure from Australia, regardless of whether the elector was previously enrolled in Australia. (para 2.29)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  Sections 94 and 94A of the Electoral Act presently provide different time periods within which persons may make an application for enrolment from outside Australia (two years) or for treatment as an `eligible overseas elector' for those persons already enrolled (one year).  This is an anomaly that should be corrected.  The time limit should be standardised at two years. </para><para>Recommendation 5</para><para>That the relevant sections of the Electoral Act and the Referendum Act be amended to allow overseas electors to use a photocopy of their passport certified by the elector to confirm their personal details in circumstances where it is not possible to obtain an authorised witness' signature when either enrolling as an overseas elector or making a postal vote from overseas. (para 2.32)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Government believes that the use of a certified photocopy of the relevant page of a passport, instead of an authorised witness, to confirm identity when overseas, should be permitted when difficulties are encountered finding an authorised witness when applying for or casting an overseas postal vote, or in finding an eligible witness when applying for enrolment from overseas. </para><para>Recommendation 6</para><para>That the AEC investigate and report on the potential impact of the proposed changes to the witnessing and enrolment provisions effected by Electoral and Referendum Act (No 1) 1999.   This report should include information on:</para><para>The potential financial impact of these changes on new enrollees;</para><para>The potential impact on enrolment numbers; and</para><para>The potential cost to the AEC of setting up and administering these new systems.</para><para>Where the changes have been implemented, the AEC should provide details of studies it has done on the potential impacts and the actual impacts. (para 2.36) </para><para>Response</para><para>Not supported.  The Government is aware that some concerns have been expressed by the Joint Roll partners in the States about the possible impact of the new federal enrolment identification requirements in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Act 1999.  The Government does not share these concerns and believes that, given the extent of discussions on this issue and amendments made to the draft regulations to accommodate these concerns, a further investigation is unnecessary. Although the proclamation of the relevant provisions of the amending Act and the promulgation of the necessary regulations has not yet taken place, the AEC is well advanced in the development of operational systems to support the new legislative requirements.  Accordingly, the Government continues to urge the States to cooperate in strengthening the enrolment provisions.</para><para>Recommendation 7</para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to make the basis of enrolment the elector's address, and that the objection provisions be amended such that an elector can be removed from the Roll when it can be shown the elector no longer lives at their enrolled address.  </para><para>If an elector moves within their Division, does not re-enrol, and is removed by objection, their provisional vote for their division will be counted, provided their last enrolment was within that Division and was since the last redistribution or general election; and  </para><para>If an elector moves outside their enrolled Division, but remains within the State/Territory, and claims a vote within their old or new Division, their vote in the Senate will count but the House of Representatives vote will not count.  </para><para>Response </para><para>Supported.  The recommendation will convert the basis for enrolment to a more realistic address-based system, replacing the current subdivisional-based enrolment system, which is no longer operating efficiently in maintaining accurate enrolments.  The Government believes that this important change to the enrolment system will contribute to improving the accuracy of the rolls, in conjunction with the Continuous Roll Update (CRU) systems, such as the Address Register, now being developed and implemented on the computerised roll management system, RMANS. </para><para>Recommendation 8</para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to allow the Divisional Returning Officer to exclude from enrolment any name that is invalid, and that the criteria for determining an invalid name be developed by the AEC in consultation with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. (para 2.55)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  Some individuals are changing their names by deed poll into grammatical strings containing a political message, and then enrolling with the intention of nominating as candidates and appearing on the ballot paper with free publicity for their cause.  The Government believes this is a perversion of the enrolment system which should be addressed.  The legislative means by which Divisional Returning Officers (DROs) will be empowered to reject such obviously inappropriate names from enrolment will require special attention in the drafting process so as not to inadvertently preclude the enrolment of genuine but unusual names.  Cooperation with State/Territory Registrars, through the appropriate channels, as indicated in recommendation 9, will be necessary.  Appeal rights with respect to any administrative action on individual enrolment applications are already available in the legislation, and will be further improved in the legislative response to recommendation No 10.</para><para>Recommendation 9</para><para>That the federal Attorney General appeal to his or her respective state and territory counterparts through the Standing Committee of Attorneys' General that there is a need for each state or territory Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages to tighten their criteria in relation to the registration of legal names. (para 2.56)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Government will refer this matter to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General for consideration and action as appropriate.  The occasional decisions made by the State/Territory Registrars of births, deaths and marriages (BDM) in accepting inappropriate name changes are having long-range impacts on federal and State/Territory electoral systems.  DROs are obliged to accept enrolment name changes, which are effectively grammatical strings carrying a political message, if the application is supported by evidence such as a valid deed poll (or other equivalent documentation) from State/Territory BDM Registries, as well as documented community recognition. </para><para>Evidence of community recognition, including documented transactions with government agencies such as local utilities, Centrelink and Medicare, and other correspondence, usually becomes available following the settlement of a valid deed poll.  After securing enrolment, the elector is then at liberty to nominate as a candidate for election, and obtain free publicity for the cause by appearing on the ballot paper, with little prospect of electoral success.  The Government believes this is a perversion of the electoral system which should be addressed.  A consistent and cooperative federal/State/Territory approach to the regulation of inappropriate name changes is worth pursuing.</para><para>Recommendation 10</para><para>That Part X of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to make decisions by a Divisional Returning Officer in relation to the enrolment of names appealable to the Australian Electoral Officer and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. (para 2.58)  </para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  (Although the actual legislative amendment required will depend on the passage of the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2000.)  For a particular class of enrolment decisions made by DROs under section 105(1)(b) of the Electoral Act, relating to the alteration of names on the roll, there are no specific appeal rights available, as there are for all other administrative decisions relating to enrolment.  The Government believes that this is an omission in the legislation that should be corrected so as to allow electors to challenge any administrative decision affecting their enrolment.  It will also provide an additional level of protection for electors with genuine but unusual name changes, as opposed to electors seeking inappropriate name changes, as addressed in recommendations 8 and 9.</para><para>Recommendation 11 </para><para>Subject to the JSCEM acceptance of matters raised in the AEC's internet issues paper, that the publicly available Commonwealth Electoral Roll be provided on the AEC internet site for name and address/locality search purposes, and that the Roll be provided in CD-Rom format with the same search facility to public libraries without internet access.  Both the internet and CD-Rom Roll should be updated monthly subject to search capacity being limited to individual names and addresses on the Roll. (para 2.65)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported in principle.  The Government needs to be assured that electors' privacy will be appropriately protected and needs to look at this issue again after further consideration by the JSCEM following publication of the AEC's review of sections 89-92 of the Electoral Act which will cover the issue of placing the roll on the internet.  The implementation costs of this recommendation are expected to be in the order of $208,000 in the first year and approximately $87,000 in subsequent years.</para><para>Recommendation 12</para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to allow access to an electronic version of the marked Roll and that this right of access should be extended to both candidates and party political organisations. (para 2.72)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported in principle.  Section 189(3) of the Electoral Act and Section 62 of the Referendum Act allow the inspection of postal vote applications from the third day after polling until the election can no longer be questioned.  From paragraph 2.71 of the JSCEM report, it appears that it is this facility that the JSCEM has recommended for electronic access.  Subject to prior consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, the Government agrees that this section should be amended to allow the AEC to provide, on request, electronic lists of the names and addresses of postal vote applicants to registered political parties and candidates, within the time period currently specified.  House of Representatives candidates would be entitled to the list for the Division in which they stood for election and Senate candidates to the lists for all Divisions in the State or Territory in which they stood for election.  Federally registered political parties would be entitled to electronic lists of postal vote applicants for the States and Territories in which they are organised.  The costs for this recommendation would be approximately $56,000 each election year.</para><para>Recommendation 13</para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to include a schedule setting out an alternate layout for the Senate ballot paper and that the AEC consult with the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the alternate design. (para 2.82)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Government is concerned that the increasing numbers of Senate candidates are having a detrimental impact on the size, cost and appearance of the Senate ballot paper.  Later recommendations 49 to 54 will strengthen the party registration process to deter candidates from appearing on the Senate ballot paper when they have no realistic chance of electoral success.</para><para>Schedule 1 of the Electoral Act specifies only one format for the Senate ballot paper and there is no flexibility permitted for adopting a more appropriate layout for large numbers of candidates, within the technical constraints of production and usage.  The Senate ballot paper has already reached the limitations of paper width for efficient production purposes, and has reached the limit of acceptable typeface point size standard for the printing of candidates and group names to be legible at the polling booth.  In order to maintain efficiencies in the production and cost of ballot papers and other election equipment, such as declaration vote envelopes and ballot boxes, it should be possible to extend the depth of the Senate ballot paper to allow for the vertical layering of the candidate names.  This layout alternative for the Senate ballot paper should be fixed in the schedule to the Electoral Act.</para><para>Recommendation 14</para><para>That s211 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to allow for the amendment or withdrawal of Group Voting Ticket statements up to the closing time for the lodgement of such statements; that such amendment or withdrawal may only be made by the person who lodged the original statement; that a further statement may be lodged prior to the closing time following the withdrawal of the original statement by any persons eligible to do so under s211(6); and that should a Group Voting Ticket statement be withdrawn, and a new statement not be lodged for the group prior to the closing time for lodgement, the group will not have a Group Voting Ticket square printed on the ballot paper. (para 2.84)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The original representative of a Senate group should be able to amend or withdraw a group voting ticket (GVT) statement at any time up to the closing time for lodgement, and following a withdrawal, any person eligible to do so under section 211(6) of the Electoral Act should be able to lodge a further GVT statement.  If a new statement is not lodged then the Group will not have a GVT square printed on the ballot paper. </para><para>However, the recommendation should be extended to allow, under the same conditions, a further withdrawal and/or amendment of a GVT statement, subsequent to the first withdrawal and/or amendment.  Further, it should be possible to delegate the responsibility for accepting such amendments and/or withdrawals to GVT statements if the original AEC officer is not available at a later time.</para><para>Recommendation 15</para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to ensure that the return of deposit for Senate candidates is made to the person who paid the deposit. (para 2.86)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The process for the return of deposits for bulk nominations for the House of Representatives works well in practice.  The Government believes that a similar process should be available for Senate groups.  Section 173 of the Electoral Act should be amended to provide that where a candidate is part of a Senate group, and the nomination deposit was paid by a person other than the candidate, the deposit must be returned to the person who paid it, or to a person authorised in writing by the person who paid it.</para><para>Recommendation 16</para><para>That ss 177 and 180 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to allow, up until the close of nominations, for the substitution of another candidate for a Division in a bulk nomination, where a candidate for that Division in a bulk nomination dies or withdraws their consent to act. (para 2.90)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Government believes that the death or withdrawal of a candidate before the close of nominations should not invalidate a bulk nomination for the House of Representatives, and that a substitute candidate should be allowed to be nominated, and the deposit returned, as necessary, within the terms of sections 177 and 180 of the Electoral Act.  This would extend the same candidate replacement rights for bulk nominations as are already available for single nominations. </para><para>Recommendation 17</para><para>That s331 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and s124 of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 be amended to reflect that only electoral advertising in journals needs to be labelled as advertising. (para 2.96)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  Section 331 of the Electoral Act and section 124 of the Referendum Act should be amended to clarify that only electoral advertising must be labelled as advertising in journals, including newspapers.  The previous amendment in relation to the publication of electoral matter in journals was not properly drafted, and the situation now is that, technically, even newspaper editorials and opinion columns commenting on an election should contain the heading "advertisement".  This was clearly not the original intention of the Parliament.  These amendments would not weaken the legislation but simply clarify that only electoral advertisements in journals must be labelled. </para><para>Recommendation 18</para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so the full address clearly identifying a physical location is given for authorisation purposes. (para 2.102)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Government believes a precise definition is required to remove any doubts about the application of the authorisation requirements for electoral advertising. A definition of "address", to include street number, street name, and suburb/locality, as applicable, should be included in the relevant provisions of the Electoral Act and the Referendum Act. </para><para>Recommendation 19</para><para>That the AEC develop an expanded authorisation regime for How To Vote cards which will:</para><para>define How To Vote cards broadly so as to include How To Vote cards that are narrative in nature;</para><para>ensure the authorisation details include the name of the political party of origin or the name of the independent candidate as well as the other authorisation details; and</para><para>include a requirement for the authorisation details to be printed prominently (in 12 point) on each printed side of the How To Vote card.</para><para>The authorisation regime should ultimately be included in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. (para 2.129)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported in principle.  The problem of second and later preference how-to-vote (HTV) cards, that could, in breach of section 329 of the Electoral Act, mislead voters, will not be resolved by an unenforceable authorisation regime, or administrative guidelines, given the recent history of litigation on this subject.  </para><para>The Government does not support the first dot point of the recommendation, because HTV cards, including those of a narrative character, are already encompassed in the definitions of "electoral advertising" containing "electoral matter" set out in sections 328(5) and 4(1) of the Electoral and Referendum Acts respectively.  A definition of HTV cards would only encourage disputes about interpretation, and in any case, the Government believes that the improved authorisation requirements should apply to all electoral advertisements governed by section 328(1) of the Electoral Act, not just HTV cards.  </para><para>Further, the Government does not support the second and third dot points of the recommendation.  They are too prescriptive and unnecessary.  </para><para>Recommendation 20</para><para>The AEC conduct an investigation to determine the reasons for the changes in the pattern of declaration voting. (para 2.156)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  However, such an investigation is unlikely to show any useful analytical outcome because of the lack of baseline comparative data on the factors most likely to have affected changes in the pattern of declaration voting in recent times.  Declaration voting has increased from 12.74% of total votes in 1993, to 13.78% of total votes in 1996, to 17.90% of total votes in 1998. </para><para>The AEC has already reported that absent, postal and pre-poll voting probably increased at the 1998 federal election because polling day was scheduled during school holidays and some major sporting and cultural events.  The AEC has also reported that an increase in postal voting has undoubtedly been stimulated by the mass distribution of postal vote applications by the major political parties.  Other factors affecting voter behaviour, such as changing work patterns, that make it difficult for some to vote on a Saturday, may also have an impact. </para><para>And finally, the AEC has reported that provisional voting can be expected to increase if an election is held soon after an electoral redistribution, or if major objection action to cleanse the roll has been effected before the close of rolls for an election.  However, the impact of these factors on the accuracy of the rolls, and the consequent level of provisional voting, should be progressively neutralised with the development and implementation of continuous roll update (CRU) procedures and systems referred to elsewhere. </para><para>Recommendation 21</para><para>That the AEC modify its pre-poll voting form so that voters are requested to tick off the reason why they require a pre-poll vote from a list of permitted reasons in the legislation. (para 2.158)</para><para>Response</para><para>Not supported.  The Government does not believe that there is any present justification for requiring pre-poll voters to provide a written record of their reasons for casting such a vote, as there is no evidence that the pre-poll voting system is being misused or abused.  The grounds for making a pre-poll vote are the same as for postal voting in Schedule 2 of the Electoral Act, but an application for a pre-poll vote is made in person to the responsible AEC officer under section 200C(2) of the Electoral Act.  The AEC already ensures that the grounds for a pre-poll vote in Schedule 2 of the Electoral Act are clearly displayed in pre-poll voting centres, and drawn to the attention of applicants as necessary. </para></quote><quote><para>Recommendation 22</para><para>That the AEC review its current practices to ensure that the information communicated to the candidates and the public in relation to pre-polling facilities is clear and correct. (para 2.166)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The AEC will review advertising for pre-poll centres and will consider more frequent and less detailed pointer advertisements in newspapers providing the AEC call centre number so that specific information can be relayed directly to voters by telephone.  The AEC already advises candidates individually in writing about the location of relevant pre-poll voting centres.</para><para>Recommendation 23</para><para>That the AEC seek agreement, where appropriate, from the owners of the premises on which a pre-poll is located to ensure that no unreasonable restriction is placed on the right of persons to distribute the customary election material or for voters to receive that material at or in the vicinity of the pre-poll. (para 2.173)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The AEC already seeks the agreement of the owners of private premises, such as shopping malls, to allow canvassing outside pre-poll voting centres to take place without unreasonable restrictions. </para><para>Recommendation 24</para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 be amended to process votes cast in the Antarctic as pre-poll votes. (para 2.175) </para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  On polling day for an election, Antarctic voters place their completed ballot papers in a ballot box, and at the close of polling, the votes on the ballot papers are electronically transmitted to the designated Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) for Tasmania by the Assistant Returning Officer.  The AEO then transcribes the votes onto postal ballot papers, completes the accompanying declaration envelopes on behalf of the Antarctic voters, and despatches the postal vote materials to the appropriate Divisional Returning Officers for processing.  The Government believes it would be more appropriate for Antarctic votes to be processed as pre-poll votes rather than as postal votes.  Antarctic electors do not make a postal vote application, but cast their votes by attending at an Antarctic station, which is a polling booth for the purposes of the election, similar to a pre-poll voting centre. </para><para>Recommendation 25</para><para>That section 209(5) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and section 25(4) of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, requiring the production of separate postal ballot papers, be deleted so as to allow the same ballot paper to be used for all forms of voting.

(para 2.184).</para><para>Response</para><para>Not supported.  The Government opposes this recommendation as it could potentially open a loophole for abuse and believes there are real grounds for doubting that it could work in practice. </para><para>Recommendation 27</para><para>That paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and paragraph 7 of Schedule 4 of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 concerning the postmarking of postal vote envelopes be amended, so that the date of the witness's signature is instead used to determine if a postal vote was cast before the close of polling if there is no post mark or if the post mark is illegible. The witnessing portion of the postal vote envelope should specify all the elector's details being attested to, and should make clear that it is an offence for a witness to make a false declaration. (para 2.191)</para><para>Response</para><para>Not supported.  The Government opposes this recommendation because it may lead to the electoral system being open to manipulation.  The Australian Electoral Commission should investigate the feasibility of Australia Post being required to postmark every piece of electoral matter.  </para><para>Recommendation 28</para><para>That the AEC modify its postal voting form so that voters are requested to tick off the reason why they require a postal vote from a list of permitted reasons in the legislation. (para 2.200)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported in principle.  The AEC will amend the approved postal vote application form so that the grounds permitted for a postal vote, contained in Schedule 2 of the Electoral Act and Schedule 3 of the Referendum Act, are included (in abbreviated form as necessary).  The Government believes it is unnecessary for the electors to indicate under which particular ground they are applying for a postal vote.  </para><para>Recommendation 29</para><para>That the AEC only issue one set of postal ballot papers and discard any second or subsequent application form request except where the second or subsequent request is to replace spoilt, lost or undelivered ballot papers on written request from the elector as set out in Recommendation 26. (para 2.207)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported in principle.  This recommendation is in response to difficulties that have arisen from the mass distribution of postal vote applications by the major political parties. Aged or confused electors who receive unsolicited postal vote applications from more than one political party may fill in and return multiple postal vote applications.  Because DROs must issue postal voting materials if valid applications are received, these electors may then go on to cast multiple postal votes. This problem was addressed administratively at the 1998 federal election by contacting postal vote applicants who had sent in more than one application to confirm that only one set of postal voting materials should be issued.  </para><para>In order to minimise the problem of inadvertent multiple postal votes at the point of application, the Government believes that the AEC should continue to deal administratively with the receipt of multiple postal vote applications.  Upon receipt of any subsequent postal vote application, the AEC will contact the applicant to establish why a second application has been received and whether it is necessary to issue further postal voting material (eg first despatch not received).  The DRO consulting with multiple postal vote applicants, where practicable, should avoid the unnecessary issuance of multiple sets of postal voting materials.  This will assist in preventing inadvertent multiple postal voting at the point of application.  It will have the additional advantage of assisting in identifying fraudulent multiple postal vote applications, before the votes are cast.</para><para>However, the Government believes that, for those inadvertent multiple postal votes that do survive the applicant check (which could occur with overseas voting, for example), there should be a mechanism to prevent their entry into the count.  This should occur at the preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes, where signatures and other information, such as the date of receipt, on the declaration envelope can be used to distinguish and disallow inadvertent multiple postal votes.  Legislative provisions should be made to disallow the admission to the count of multiple pre-poll votes.  Signature checks will determine which of the multiple postal or pre-poll votes was signed by the voter and only the first received of these will be counted.</para><para>Further, there should be a mechanism applied to prevent the entry into the count of fraudulent declaration votes, of any kind, whereby signature checks are carried out on multiple declaration votes for the same voter and only the declaration vote carrying the signature of the voter is admitted to the count.</para><para>Regardless, where (after polling day) further scrutiny has commenced whilst preliminary scrutiny is ongoing, any declaration vote already admitted to the count will be deemed to be the declaration vote that should have been admitted and any subsequent votes will not be able to be admitted to the count.</para><para>An elimination process at the preliminary scrutiny has already been successfully tested at the 1997 Constitutional Convention election, which was conducted entirely by postal voting.  However, in this case further scrutiny did not commence until after the cut off date for the receipt of all votes.</para><para>Any multiple declaration envelopes that are disallowed at the preliminary scrutiny stage, should not be discarded, but should be set aside for later investigation into fraudulent multiple voting as necessary.</para><para>Recommendation 30</para><para>That reply paid envelopes supplied by political parties with postal vote application forms that are addressed to return to the political party, the name of the political party be part of the address on the envelope. (para 2.212)</para><para>Response</para><para>Not supported.  The Government believes that the flexibility, as to whether the party name should appear on the envelope or not, should be retained.  </para><para>Recommendation 31</para><para>That the AEC review its mobile polling arrangements and training to ensure good management of mobile polling teams. (para 2.234)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The AEC will review the training and management of all remote mobile polling teams, particularly those in the Northern Territory, before the next federal election.</para><para>Recommendation 32</para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to allow registered political parties to appeal AEC decisions on the location of polling places. (para 3.4)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported in principle.  The Government believes that there should an ability to appeal against the siting of a booth for an electorate outside that electorate and also against the abolition of small booths - particularly in regional and rural electorates.  The AEC will develop a system for notifying registered political parties of creations and abolitions of polling places.</para><para>Recommendation 33</para><para>That the AEC develop guidelines in relation to the provision of special polling facilities, and that these guidelines be a disallowable instrument. (para 3.17)</para><para>Response</para><para>Not supported.  The recommendation assumes that before the election dates are announced and Parliament is dissolved, any special events likely to occur on polling day can be known and planned for in advance.  Further, it contemplates an operational planning regime for the AEC that would be unworkable given the many contingencies that arise in the weeks leading up to a federal election.  Regulations enabling the provision of a new type of polling place which would be open only to those voters who had paid entry to a particular function would be one of the ramifications of expanding special polling facilities in the manner sought by the JSCEM.  As would the provision of polling places at functions where alcohol is being sold and consumed.  This recommendation needs further development by the JSCEM to include details about the specific polling facilities sought.    </para><para>Recommendation 34</para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to ensure that, where a photocopied ballot paper is issued, the issuing officer must initial the ballot paper in order for it to be considered formal. (para 3.23)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  Subsection 268(2) of the Electoral Act and subsection 93(3) of the Referendum Act already provide that, if a ballot paper does not contain the initials of the polling official, then the DRO is responsible for deciding that it is an authentic ballot paper on which a voter has marked a vote.  This allows photocopied ballot papers to be declared formal at the scrutiny stage, in the presence of scrutineers. It also ensures that voters are not disenfranchised because a polling official has failed to initial a photocopied ballot paper.</para><para>However, section 215 of the Electoral Act and section 26 of the Referendum Act should be amended to make it clear that all ballot papers, including photocopied ballot papers, must be initialled by the proper officer.  The Government believes that this recommendation should be extended to require the authenticating initials to appear on the top right-hand corner of the front of the ballot paper, within a circle that should be printed on the ballot paper during production, and will be apparent after photocopying.  Requiring the ballot paper to be initialled on the front instead of the back, without in any way impinging on the formality of the ballot paper, will ensure that issuing officers are constantly reminded of their duty.  The Schedules to the Electoral Act and the Referendum Act setting out the format of the ballot papers would need to be amended to reflect the new initialling provisions.</para><para>Recommendation 35</para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to allow the AEC to send penalty, enrolment objection and determination notices to the latest known address of the voter at the time of the dispatch of the notice. (para 3.52)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  Section 245(6) of the Electoral Act and section 45(6) of the Referendum Act should be amended to allow the DRO to send, by post or other means, the second penalty notice for failure to vote to the latest known address of the elector at the time of the despatch of that notice.  Section 245(9) of the Electoral Act and section 45(9) of the Referendum Act should be amended similarly.  Finally, Part IX of the Electoral Act should be amended to allow for despatch of enrolment objection notices and enrolment determination notices, by post or other means, to the latest known address of the elector at the time of despatch.</para><para>Recommendation 36</para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to explicitly prevent scrutineers from providing assisted votes. (para 3.64)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Government believes that scrutineers should not be permitted to assist voters at polling booths because of the potential for undue influence on voters by the representatives of candidates and political parties.  Similar amendments should be made to the Referendum Act.</para><para>Recommendation 37</para><para>That the AEC report to the Committee on options for an effective integrated educational and enrolment service for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders before the next federal election. (para 3.80)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The AEC will publish a report on options for the future delivery of electoral information and education services to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, and for the conduct of enrolment reviews in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.  This will involve a one-off cost of $10,260.</para><para>Recommendation 38</para><para>That the nexus between provisional voting and reinstatement be broken by deleting ss 105(4) and 105(5) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. (para 3.93)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Government believes that the nexus between provisional voting and reinstatement should be broken by deleting sections 105(4) and 105(5) of the Electoral Act, in order to improve the accuracy of the rolls.  This recommendation is linked to recommendations 7 and 39.</para><para>Recommendation 39 </para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so that:</para></quote><para>Â·	if an elector has moved within the Division they are enrolled for since the last redistribution or federal election and has not re-enrolled, then the AEC will take action to re-enrol the elector at their current residential address and their provisional vote for the Division and the Senate will be counted;</para><para>Â·	if an elector has moved outside the Division they are enrolled for but within the same State or Territory since the last redistribution or federal election and has not re-enrolled, then the AEC will take action to re-enrol the elector at their current residential address and their provisional vote for the Senate will be counted; and</para><para>Â·	if an elector has moved outside the State or Territory they are enrolled for since the last redistribution or federal election and has not re-enrolled, then the AEC will take action to re-enrol the elector at their current residential address and their provisional vote will not be counted. (para 3.96)</para><quote><para>Response</para><para>Supported in principle.  The Government believes, however, that it is inappropriate to count any vote for a person not correctly enrolled and therefore does not support the counting of votes as indicated in the first and second dot points of the recommendation.  The Government accepts that currently the provisions of Schedule 3 of the Electoral Act require the admission of provisional votes in certain limited circumstances where the voter's name is not on the current electoral roll.  However, the Government believes that these circumstances need to be further restricted so that instead of the AEC checking the roll back to the second previous election or the last redistribution and admitting the votes of those voters who appeared on the roll during that time, the AEC would only be required check back to the last election or the last redistribution, whichever is the latter.  It is also the Government's view, that these voters should not be reinstated to the electoral roll unless the AEC has carried out the necessary investigation to confirm that the voter is, in fact, entitled to be enrolled at the address claimed in the declaration vote.  The Government's support of recommendation 7 is in line with its response to this recommendation.  </para><para>Recommendation 40</para><para>That the AEC review its procedures for updating the Commonwealth Electoral Roll following notification of the death of an elector. (para 3.135)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  To facilitate the automated removal of names of deceased electors from the rolls, the Registrars of Births Deaths and Marriages in the States/Territories have provided the AEC with electronic information on deaths.  This consolidated information, known as the Fact of Death File, is currently being evaluated and new operational procedures will be implemented as soon as the systems for the electronic matching of death data are brought on line.  This will enable the matching of deceased electors across State/Territory boundaries and will allow the identification of deceased electors who are enrolled in a different State/Territory from where their death is registered.</para><para>Recommendation 41</para><para>That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to allow Divisional Returning Officers some discretion as to the location for the declaration of the poll. All candidates should be consulted prior to the selection of the location. (para 4.17)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported in principle.  Section 284 of the Electoral Act should be amended to allow a declaration of the poll for the House of Representatives to take place other than in the Divisional Office where nominations were received.  This would accord with the more flexible provisions for the declaration of the poll for the Senate.  Such decisions should be taken by Divisional Returning Officers in consultation with the Australian Electoral Officer for the State/Territory. </para><para>However, the Government does not believe that candidates should be consulted about the location of the declaration of the poll, as this should remain the prerogative of the AEC in the context of all relevant operational factors.  Candidates are advised in writing of the location for the declaration of the poll, and the convenience of candidates, party workers and the media is always taken into account in determining locations. </para><para>Recommendation 42</para><para>That the AEC conduct targeted public education programs prior to the next federal election, to more fully explain the full preferential voting system for the House of Representatives. (para 4.40)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The AEC will examine and implement improved mechanisms for delivering information and education on the full preferential voting system before the next federal election.  Implementation of this recommendation will involve costs of approximately $685,000 each election year.</para><para>Recommendation 43 </para><para>That section 216 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so that group voting ticket information can be provided in booklet format rather than in poster format. (para 4.68)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  For practical reasons relating to the increasing size of the GVT posters, and consequential difficulties in display in pre-poll voting centres, section 216 of the Electoral Act should be amended so that group voting ticket information can be provided in booklet format or in poster format, depending on which format best suits the polling location.  The GVT booklets will be available in all AEC offices and other relevant polling locations, but will not be provided automatically to postal voters, because of the substantial additional postage costs involved.  Postal voters will only be provided with the GVT information on request, and the booklet will be published on the AEC website.  The implementation cost of this recommendation will be approximately $138,000 per election year.</para><para>Recommendation 44</para><para>That the disclosable sum received from a person or organisation during a financial year be increased from $1,500 to $3,000. (para 5.20)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Government accepts that the minimum disclosure threshold is set at an unrealistically low level.  </para><para>Recommendation 45</para><para>That the minimum donation before a donor is required to lodge a return be increased from $1,500 to $3,000. (para 5.25)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Government accepts that the minimum disclosure threshold is set at an unrealistically low level.  </para><para>Recommendation 46</para><para>That the AEC conduct a feasibility study on moving to a system of electronic lodgement of annual disclosure returns. (para 5.30)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported in principle.  The Government sees many benefits in electronic lodgement of disclosure returns.  The AEC will be looking at options for the electronic lodgement of not only annual disclosure returns but also election disclosure returns.</para><para>Recommendation 47</para><para>That the AEC ensure that technical or minor mistakes are not brought within the provision of s315(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. (para 5.33)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Government understands that the AEC has never sought to prosecute technical or minor mistakes made by persons on disclosure returns and is confident that the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth provides adequate protection in this regard.</para><para>Recommendation 48</para><para>That section 311A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, concerning annual returns by Commonwealth departments, be deleted and inserted in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit guidelines for the production of annual reports. (para 5.36)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Government understands that section 311A of the Electoral Act was inserted by an Opposition amendment to section 20 of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991.  The AEC has no role in administering this provision other than as a reporting agency like any other.  The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA) is responsible, under sections 63 and 70 of the Public Service Act 1999, for approving guidelines for annual reports of departments and agencies.  In the light of this, and in view of the way the provision has operated to date, the Government believes that section 311A should be removed from the Electoral Act and that it would be more appropriate for the JCPAA to review the continuing relevance of and need for any continuing similar requirements as part of its broader responsibility for annual report requirements.</para><para>Recommendation 49</para><para>That eligibility for federal registration by a political party requires that political parties must have either 500 members as defined under section 123(3) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 or have at least one member who is a member of the federal parliament. (para 5.56)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  The Parliament has already passed legislation, in the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Act (No. 1) 2000, implementing this recommendation.  The combined costs for implementation of this recommendation and for related recommendation 54 are expected to be approximately $72,000 in the first year and approximately $58,000 in subsequent years.</para><para>Recommendation 50</para><para>That the definition of a member of a political party at section 123(3) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be expanded to include the requirements that a person must: </para></quote><para>Â·	have been formally accepted as a member according to the party's rules;</para><para>Â·	remain a valid member under party rules;</para><para>Â·	not be a member of more than one registered political party unless the parties themselves have sanctioned it; and</para><para>Â·	have paid an annual membership fee. (para 5.57)</para><quote><para>Response</para><para>Not supported.  The Government disagrees with this recommendation as it is intrusive into the affairs of political parties.  The issue of an annual membership fee may have some "freedom of association" problems in that the only way a person could join a political party would be to pay a fee.  </para><para>Recommendation 51</para><para>That a fee of $5000 be required to accompany an application for the registration of a political party and $500 for an application to change either the registered name or abbreviation of a political party.

The Parliament has already passed legislation, in the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Act (No. 1) 2000, implementing a fee to accompany an application for party registration or a change to either the registered name or the registered abbreviation of a political party.</para><para>Recommendation 52</para><para>That the AEC investigate and report on the effectiveness of the current criteria for the registration of party names and how the AEC might improve the criteria for the registration of party names to disallow inappropriate and unrepresentative names being registered.

The AEC will report on improving the provisions governing the registration of political party names and abbreviations.</para><para>Recommendation 53</para><para>That the registered abbreviation of a political party be restricted to either an acronym, or a shortened version, of the party's registered name and it should be no longer overall than the registered party name.

This amendment would ensure that the original intention of the Electoral Act in providing for the registration of an abbreviated party name was observed.</para><para>Recommendation 54</para><para>That the AEC be authorised to conduct reviews of the continuing eligibility of registered political parties after every federal election.  The AEC should be able to require parties to produce documentation in support of their application for registration and their continued right to remain registered.  The standard of documentation and the verification undertaken by the AEC can be the same as if the party were first applying to register.  The AEC should also have the power to deregister a political party if it fails to produce the documentation requested by the AEC in support of its continuing right to remain registered. (para 5.80)</para><para>Response</para><para>Supported.  These powers are essential if the AEC is to be able to perform its role in ensuring that only those political parties that continue to be eligible for federal registration actually remain registered.  The implementation costs for this recommendation are incorporated with those shown for Recommendation 49.</para><para>Recommendation 55</para><para>That given adequate public support, a referendum be held to amend the constitution so that the act of nomination by a candidate for the House of Representatives or Senate be recognised as immediately extinguishing any allegiance to a foreign country provided the candidate is also an Australian citizen.

The AEC already publishes Electoral Newsfiles in hard copy and on the AEC website on progress in each redistribution of a State or Territory.  The householder leaflet published for each federal election also provides information on the outcomes of redistributions for particular Divisions.

Reflecting the need for closer cooperation with ASEAN countries on IP issues, Australia has recently taken the initiative within the AFTA-CER framework to propose stepped-up cooperation on practical IP management issues.</para><para>As a leading player in the APEC Intellectual Property Rights Experts Group (IPEG), Australia is working towards closer coordination of IP administration and enforcement mechanisms in the region, directly supporting and facilitating the parallel intra-ASEAN program similarly aimed at implementing common practices.  Australia has also provided strong practical support for the development of a coordinated approach to facilitating technical cooperation.  Australia has also played a leading role in three new initiatives of the APEC IPEG, the strengthening of cooperation on enforcement of intellectual property rights, raising public education and awareness of intellectual property issues and promoting a stronger policy dialogue on emerging IP issues.  Australia is an active participant in the work of the IPEG aimed towards greater regional coordination in a number of practical areas, such as paperless filing technologies, electronic commerce, office practice in relation to biotechnology and other emerging technologies, and simplified and harmonised trade mark filing.</para><para>Through bilateral and regional programs, Australia provides considerable technical assistance and training to ASEAN countries to promote the effective and efficient operation of the IP system.  This assistance has included the provision of technical experts to Malaysia and Indonesia, the conduct of bilateral training programs with Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, and the provision of advice and assistance to Singapore, Indonesia and Brunei.  Australia has conducted APEC-wide technical training programs on intellectual property administration (in March 1998) and on management of biotechnology IP (December 1998).  A major training program on IP administration and enforcement for Indonesian officials and academics has been in place for over three years.</para><para>The Australian Government and Australian experts have also participated with the WTO and World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) in the provision of further training, for example, by providing experts for training in the region, including in Singapore and Brunei. In March 2000 Australia hosted a WIPO Regional Symposium, and signed a Memorandum of Understanding with WIPO on technical cooperation in the region.  Australia has already participated in training delivered under this agreement to the Philippines.</para><para>World Bank funding was made available for a six-month project for technical assistance for institutional development at the Directorate General of Intellectual Property Rights of Indonesia in 1999-2000.  IP Australia was part of a consortium which tendered successfully for the project, of which a key component was IP awareness and information dissemination.  Staff from IP Australia, DFAT and the Attorney-General's Department undertook this part of the project.  Australia has also delivered training in specialised areas of IP, such as training courses in biotechnology IP held in Thailand and Vietnam in June 2000, and on IP enforcement training for Thai specialist IP judges in 1999.</para><para>Australia's efforts in support of technical cooperation cannot hope to match the scale of those undertaken by the European Union or Japan, or specialised international organisations such as WIPO.  Such assistance as is given by Australia must be well targeted and focused.  While Australia has strong legal and technical expertise on IP law and administration, the number of experts able to be involved in such programs is quite limited.  Despite these constraints, the assistance provided by Australia has been well received in the region as it has had a strong practical focus, and it is sensitive to serving the specific needs and context of the region in a sustained fashion.  The continued focus of bilateral direct assistance and promotion of regional and international training in the region affords the best opportunity of maximising scarce resources and contributing in a constructive way to the Australia-ASEAN relationship.  Recent proposals concerning more direct cooperation with ASEAN in the context of AFTA-CER relations are at an early stage, but the initial signs are positive.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Recommendation 20:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">The Australian Government provide sufficient financial and human resources to the newly formed Australian International Cultural Council to enable its effective operation in the full range of cultural promotion.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>Agreed. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Comment</inline></para><para>The Government is fully committed to the effective operation of the Australia International Cultural Council (AICC).

For Australia, the ARF's value is as a complement to our bilateral alliances and security relationships.  Australia played a key role in the establishment of the ARF and has been a strong supporter of the ARF process since the first meeting in Bangkok in 1994.  The ARF provides a forum in which members can discuss regional political and security issues of concern and develop cooperative measures to contribute to the maintenance of peace and security in the region and to the avoidance of conflict.  From tentative beginnings, the Forum has made remarkable progress, as an effective multilateral mechanism for dialogue and cooperation.  </para><para>The Government will continue its support for, and involvement in, the ARF. The Australian Foreign Minister has attended every ARF Ministerial level meeting and Defence officials have accompanied senior officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to all ARF Senior Officials Meetings.  Since the ARF's inception, Australia has been an active participant in its first and second track meetings, hosting or co-chairing a number of ARF activities.  In November 1994 Australia hosted the first ARF intersessional meeting.  During the 1997-98 ARF intersessional year Australia co-chaired with Brunei two meetings of the Intersessional Support Group on Confidence Building Measures, the principal ARF intersessional mechanism, one of which was held in Sydney in March 1998.  More recently, Australia has hosted an ARF confidence building Seminar on the Law of Armed Conflict in Newcastle in December 1999, and an ARF Defence Language School Seminar in Melbourne in March 2000.  Australia has also provided financial support for a Thai hosted training seminar on disaster relief in early 2001.</para><para>The Australian Government has also supported the CSCAP process.  CSCAP is an important second track regional security body in the Asia Pacific and plays a valuable role in sounding out new approaches to regional confidence building and testing the acceptability of such approaches. Government involvement has included since 1995 an annual financial contribution, valued at A$20,000, to Australia's national CSCAP committee, Aus-CSCAP.  This has provided support for specific Aus-CSCAP projects and services, including Aus-CSCAP publications on regional security issues.

There is virtually no prospect of its taking in additional members from South East Asia.  The APG was established in February 1997 to take forward anti-money laundering initiatives in a cooperative, regional manner.  It is the regional anti-money laundering body and recognised as such by FATF which supports the APG's operation and that of similar regional groups around the world. The APG has 19 member countries, including the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Hong Kong, China.

The Report offers a thorough account of an increasingly important trade relationship to Australia.</para><para>Australia's trade relationship with India is rapidly developing maturity. With the Coalition victory in March 1996, the development of commercial ties with India has been given new expression and impetus. Strong Ministerial support for, and involvement in, a major integrated country promotion, "New Horizons", provided a particularly noteworthy example of this. Trade figures also reinforce this point. Two way trade between the two countries in 1999-2000 was $2.3 billion, a figure double that of bilateral trade in 1992-93.</para><para>Development of trade ties to their current levels would have been impossible without the instigation of a program of fundamental economic reform in India from the early 1990's. This reform, sustained over the course of a decade, has significantly redefined the architecture and operation of the Indian economy. Now, for the first time since India's independence, India has become exposed to competition from without, and has taken important initial steps towards becoming an important player in the global economic community. Although there is still some way to go, and the reform agenda remains politically difficult, the Australian Government is encouraged by India's efforts to date in strengthening and liberalising its economy.</para><para>Considerable media attention was given to the Australian Government's response to Indian nuclear testing in May 1998, and the possible adverse impact this might have on the trading relationship. The Government responded to the tests by suspending Ministerial and senior official visits, both to and from Australia, and suspending defence ties and non-humanitarian aid. Australian measures did not extend to the imposition of sanctions on trade and investment with India, and there was no clear evidence that the measures adopted by the Australian Government adversely impacted upon the commercial relationship. </para><para>The Hon Nick Dondas AM MP, Chairman of the JSCFADT Trade Sub-Committee, noted in his introduction to the report that although the tests had put a "comma" in the Australia-India relationship, Australia must continue to build on its trade and investment relationship with India. The Government supports this observation.

With its economic reform program opening Indian markets to trade and investment, and with Australia's trade push intensifying, our understanding of India's regional characteristics, cultural sensitivities, and style of governance of various states is becoming increasingly important and sophisticated.</para><para>Many economic powers have been devolved from India's Central Government, allowing greater participation by state governments in developing their own economies. This, together with each state's infrastructure capacity, resource endowments, and varying attitudes towards the process of economic reform need to be closely heeded by the Government in formulating market strategies for India and assessing the differing levels of economic opportunity afforded by various Indian states.</para><para>The Government has taken a number of concrete steps to ensure that it has current information on India's commodity trade needs across the country, and the capacities of various states to absorb foreign investment. Senior officers in the Australian High Commission in New Delhi regularly travel to the range of Indian states to evaluate and discuss prevailing economic conditions, and identify potential trade opportunities for Australian business. </para><para>In addition, Austrade has a network of offices in New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta and Bangalore.

It is quite clear that the increasing price of petrol has meant that Senator Bishop has not been able to proceed to this chamber with the sort of speed that we would normally require. One wonders what fuel he is on. I am apprised of the fact that Senator Bishop is just starting to sort his speech out. I have not had an indication from him yet as to just how long it is going to take him to be ready.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator Mark Bishop</name></talker><para>âFive minutes. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>âHe is saying five minutes, but I have to assure him that I doubt my excellent contribution will go that long. These are very appropriate bills. We debated them at the first general business session a couple of weeks ago. There was no indication of support, only an indication of opposition from the coalition parties. What a difference a couple of opinion polls and a couple of state elections make. They are now on board for doing something about petrol prices. They spent weeks rubbishing the Labor Party for calling for some sort of relief on petrol prices. They trotted out all the old excuses: `It is world prices.' Everyone knows that at least 1Â½c was due to the GST and that the oil companies could not generate the savings to pass on immediately.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We also knew that the GST would cause an inflationary spike that would eventually push up the price of petrol because of excise. At any stage the government could have discounted that price. We have shown on the record that on eight occasions the Labor Party discounted indexation on petrol. Of course it can be done. But do you know what the greatest double standard today was? Senator Hill was proud of the fact that they are going to repeal Labor legislation. What heroes they are! Where was he for the last five years? When did they discover there was indexation put on petrol? They have been in power five years, yet suddenly they discover, `The past horrible Labor government indexed excise on petrol.' They have had five budgets to move on this, but they were happy to collect the revenue.</para><para>Not only did they collect the revenue; they did not discount the GST enough, so they got more. They did not discount for the hike in inflation that came about through the GST. Then their excuse was, `We're going to allocate any extra money to roads.' I have not heard anything about that today or about what is going to happen there. The fact is that we are seeing a government in panic mode. Often, governments in panic mode do a whole range of stupid things and a couple of sensible things, but all we have seen with this government is backflip after backflip. We were assured at the estimates committee that there was nothing wrong with the BAS form, but suddenly it is being revised. </para><para>This is the government that spent $647,000 on freeway signs that said `Tax reform coming soon'. What a great contribution to intellectual debate in Australia that was! Why not spend that $647,000 on designing a simple BAS form? But we were assured that it was very simpleâthat it was actually only a couple of pages. They did not actually go on and say that you had to read 100 to 200 pages of explanation to fill it out. So we have seen the backflip on that. </para><para>We have seen the backflip on trusts. The circumstances were these: they brought in a business tax package, they came to the Labor Party to negotiate it, we sat down in good faith and we ticked off on it. But the things they wanted, they took. They made a commitment on trusts and then they ratted on it. Anyone who thinks that it has just been put off for 12 months is mad. They never intend to tax these trusts properly and control them properly. The reason they do not scrap the package today is that they have the revenue in the forward estimates. They are going to blow $900 million in the next financial year because they put it off, but are they going to take the $900 million off the next three out years? Not on your nelly. They are going to use that to overinflate the fiscal outlook so they can get away with it and through the next election without looking like they are going into deficit. </para><para>The third big backflip is on petrol. You wonder if they have any pride. They can get up and spout the lines, like they did in question time today in both houses. They are so proud of a 1Â½c reduction, when they spent the previous few months bagging the Labor Party for suggesting just that. Time and time again they came into question time here and said, `We can't amend the legislation; the Labor Party put it in several years ago.' All they wanted to do was collect the revenue.</para><para>We are seeing from the government total policy panic. Worse than that, all we can hear coming out of their mouths is what their opinion pollsters are telling them. All we hear is a poll driven Prime Minister who talks about `stable and secure government' and puts it in a speech 11 or 15 times, because that is what the pollster told him to do. They talk about a policy-lazy opposition because that is what the pollster told them to say. Never mind the fact that Mr Howard, when he was opposition leader, did not release any policies until the writs were issued in 1996. Maybe after five years people will forget the position that he propounded on that occasion. All these sorts of phrases, all these catchcries, are driven by the pollster. You should remember this on the other side: you have a lousy pollster. You have an incompetent pollster. You have one who virtually no-one in the commercial sector will touch anymore. We used to often call in this chamber for the government not to send work his way at taxpayers' expense, but we have never called for his sacking, because he is one of the greatest assets that the Labor Party have.</para><para>Here is a challenge to the coalition. They have seen the light. They have had a road to Damascus conversion. They should be in here supporting this particular set of legislation. Instead, they are promising to get the ACCC to crack down. Where have they been for the last few months? What is this government doing? Why haven't they had the ACCC out there checking on their equalisation program? Why haven't they been trying to motivate the ACCC to make sure that savings are passed on? This is the sort of thing you invent. You get the cabinet submission in and you say, `Well, this is a bit lightâ1Â½c is the only thing we can do. So the next thing we will do will be to abolish automatic indexation. It does not stop you doing it in the budget or putting it upâit is just not automatic any more. And then we'll strengthen our approach with the ACCC just for a bit of a dross around.' I can see my colleague is just busting to get into this debate. I was an interloperâthat is trueâso I would like to cede the floor to Senator Bishop.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>22411</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to make a few comments about this remarkable development that has occurred in the last few hours in the context of the private member's billsâthe <inline ref="S293">Excise Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001</inline> and the <inline ref="R1232">Customs Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001</inline><inline ref="R1232">âpresented by Senator Cook on behalf of the opposition.</inline></para></talk.start><para>It is always appropriate at the beginning of a contribution to a debate to put what is to be said in context. The context in which this petrol cut, announced today by the Prime Minister, must be looked at is the significant losses that the coalition parties have faced over the last two or three weeks in Western Australia and Queensland, and the impending rout that will occur in the Ryan by-election in Queensland in the next three or four weeks. It is that context that is putting fear into the hearts of the coalition government. It is that context that is causing them to not be able to give proper, sound and lengthy consideration to policy. It is that context that is now causing them to panic and to make instant decisions involving hundreds of millions of dollars. That is the context we should be looking at in this debate on these bills before the chamber today.</para><para>By way of introduction, it does not really need to be said in any great deal that the decision of the government today has been to adopt, to accept and to put into place all of the elements that the opposition has brought to public attention repeatedly for the last six months on this issue of petrol pricing. The four elements addressed by the Prime Minister in his press conference and press statement, and discussed today by Senator Hill in question time, are the matters that the opposition has been putting out in the public domain for discussion and has been asking the government to commit to for at least the last four to six months. Indeed, in the last fortnight in the House of Representatives the matter has twice gone for debate and resolution. On each of those occasions, the government parties in the House of Representatives voted against the proposal that the Prime Minister announced today.</para><para>What we are talking about today is a total reversal of the policy of this government for the last three yearsâa total run-around, a total backflip. The government announced a key decision to reduce petrol prices by 1Â½c. That is fine. That is something we have been seeking for some months, because the imposition of that 1Â½câthat double taxation measure that directly flows from the GSTâhas been an unfair and inequitable tax imposed upon the Australian people and has resulted in a huge windfall gain to the government, which has been attempting to put those funds aside and to use them to pork-barrel in future months as we come up to the October or November election. </para><para>That raises the question of exactly how much additional revenue has been taken from consumers and business people all around this country by this government since the extra excise came into being following the introduction of the new taxation system, the GST. There has been clear advice from various state treasuries over the last three or four months that the amount of money that is being consumed by this government is to the tune of an extra $1Â½ billion per annum. The sum of $1Â½ billion per annum is being sucked out of the pockets of ordinary mums and dads. It is being sucked out of the cash flow of businesses, large and small, across this nation. That is one of the critical reasons why there is a reduction in business confidence and a reduction in levels of activity out there in the community. It is because ordinary funds that would have gone to the ordinary uses of people in the community are being takenâstolen and put awayâby this government.</para><para>The problem we have is that the state treasuries, which do the modelling and tell us the amount of money involved in this, say it is $1.5 billion or to that order every year, but this government has taken the moneyâreceipted it and banked itâand has refused to disclose the quantum in any discussion in any debate or in any Senate estimates queries. The government has been repeatedly asked by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee and the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee: what is the quantum of extra revenue gained by the Commonwealth government due to the double taxation involved in excise and the GST? Every time the responsible minister has been asked that question, he has refused to answer. He says, `I don't know,' or, `It's not appropriate to discuss,' or `The figures aren't in,' or `You're not entitled to know,' or `It's a work in progress.' The excuses and the reasons come out time and time again, but the Australian people are not told how much is being ripped out of their pockets. Australian businesses are not told how much is being taken out of their cash flowâthey simply have to send a cheque every time they go to the bowser, and the petrol stations remit the money. That is a grossly unfair situation. </para><para>In the context of the Ryan by-election, the losses in Western Australia and Queensland, the improper use of that windfall and the continuing failure to disclose the total quantum to the Australian people, a pattern of government behaviour is starting to emerge. That pattern can be summed up in one word: backflip. In the last few weeks, every core, critical matter that goes to the heart of government, that goes to the heart and soul and policies that this government believe in, has been rejected, has been jettisoned. Look at the matters that have been rejected. They have rejected the BAS, they have rejected trust reform and they have now reduced petrol prices. The only critical matter their polling is telling them that has not yet been rejected is the future privatisation of Telstra, and that is coming now. Last week we asked Senator Alston when they were going to fully privatise Telstra. The answer was, `We're thinking about it but there is no commitment. We'll wait and see when services are improved in the bush.' What does that mean? That is code for: `We're not going to privatise Telstra'. Two weeks ago in the House of Representatives the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, was asked an identical question: `What are your plans concerning the full privatisation of Telstra?' He again dodged the issue; he again refused to commit.</para><para>So the four critical elements that the government have gone back on are: business activity statements are being reformed; trusts have been put off for 12 months, and are unlikely to ever come back on again; petrol prices have been reduced; and Telstra is on the agenda. This leads to the inevitable question: what does this mob stand for? These are the heart and soul issues that they say is their vision for this country, that allow them to be the government and that allow them to show leadership. Taxation, deregulation and privatisation of Commonwealth assetsâthey say these are the issues that make them different from us. On every one of these issues they have gone back on their word and, woe betide us, they will go back on their word in relation to Telstra.</para><para>So that leads to the question: what is regional and rural Australia really seeking? What is the government's polling telling them? It is telling them that all of the issues they have had to address need to be addressed if they want any chance at all of surviving the next six months. Having gone back on those critical elementsâan allegedly new, simpler BAS form, putting off trust reform for at least 12 months, reducing the excise quantum on petrol and really trying to find a way not to proceed with the sale of the other 51 per cent of Telstraâone needs to ask the question: where does that leave the agreement reached between the majority parties, the Liberal and National parties, and their friends down there, the Australian Democrats. Where does that leave the Howard-Lees GST deal? That deal between the major government parties and the Australian Democrats is resulting in the policy paralysis, the policy failures, the policy backflips, the chaos and the lack of organisation that are occurring in this government today.</para><para>So what is the status of that agreement between those two parties? One critical element of the Howard-Lees GST was that petrol prices would go up. The agreement was that you take off the wholesale price, you put on the GST at 10 per cent and you whack on the excise as well. The government fell for the old trick in those negotiations. The Democrats said, `Put up petrol prices. That is an efficiency argument; that'll lead to a more rational use of motor vehicles and trucks by consumers and that'll lead to less pollution in the air.' The government accepted that in those negotiations and brought it into the deal. But what has happened now is that every part of the deal that the government and the Australian Democrats negotiatedâall of the core elementsâis no longer in existence. And who is left holding the bag? Our friends at the other end of the chamber, the Australian Democrats. </para><para>One of the interesting matters that was not addressed in the Prime Minister's statement, in the four parts of his announcementâand I haven't seen any press reports yetâis what will be the impact of the 1Â½c per litre reduction in fuel excise? Does that also apply to diesel and LPG? One of the critical matters raised when Senator Cook's committee of inquiry into petrol prices toured around Australia was the huge growth, the virtual doubling, in the price of LPG, and that was a problem all through the north of Western Australiaâin fact, it is a problem for all of Western Australia north of the Kalgoorlie goldfieldsâand I am told it was a critical problem in other parts of Australia as well. To my knowledge, this package does not advise what is going to happen to LPG. Similarly, I am not aware of any comment on diesel, so perhaps government senators will be able to address that in due course.</para><para>The problem we have in this debate on the matters in the bill is that, if the government had not made their decision and the bill had been passed, petrol prices would have been reduced by 1Â½c. That begs the question: does that really satisfy the dissatisfaction that is manifest in every part of this country outside of the capital cities? The matter I refer to is the city-country divide in petrol prices. It was a critical element in the Western Australian election and one of the reasons why the swing in the seat of Bunbury was so close. In Perth, for example, you have the refinery in Kwinana, and petrol prices on a given day are something in the order of 85c, 87c or 88c a litre. If you go 100 kilometres down the road to Bunbury, the margin is an extra 13c, 15c and 17c per litre. And if you go up to the goldfields, the margin is an extra 13c, 15c, 17c and up to 21c per litre. These are the differences in fuel prices paid in the bush compared with the quantum paid for fuel prices in the city.</para><para>That is one of the critical elements forcing the divide. It is having a clear impact on the conservative side of politics and causing large numbers of people in rural, regional and country Australia, particularly rural and regional Western Australia, to leave their homes and to vote for other parties. Again, the announcement today by the Prime Minister does not address the issue of the divide in city and rural prices.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âAnd Senator Cook's bill does?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>âSenator Cook's bill may or may not.

The opposition has achieved its purpose: the differential in excise has been reduced. The government has come to our point of view after six months, but it has not addressed the critical issue of the difference between city and rural areas. </para></talk.start></continue><para>So one goes right back to the beginning and asks: what is driving this policy change, this series of backflips we have had for the last three weeks? The answer is clear and is known to every person in this chamber. The strong election results and the huge swings that occurred in Western Australia and Queenslandâand some of the swings that might yet occur in the federal seat of Ryanâhave put this government on notice. Over the Christmas break, for whatever reason, the Australian community made a decision. It made a decision that the administration of this country for the last five years has not been what it should be, it has become second rate and the government is out of touch and is not listening. It made that quite clear two Saturdays ago in Western Australia and one Saturday ago in Queensland, and there will probably be the same result in Ryanâand it has resulted in this policy analysis and this panic. </para><para>The Prime Minister announced his decision today to abolish the differential and the excise, to reduce the price of fuel by 1Â½c a litre. We are told that something in the order of $560 million is going to be given back to consumers by the government of this country. But the real problem we have is that there is going to be only a partial payback. Only some of the money that has been taken through the double tax on fuel will come back to Australian consumers and Australian businesses. State treasuries, as I said earlier, have repeatedly said that the extra quantum that is being gained by the government through the higher fuel prices is in the order of $1.5 billion per year. The government wanted to hold that money and use it to pork-barrel, to sweeten and to make electioneering commitments in the lead-up to this year's election in October or November. But the government has been caught out.  </para><para>Government ministers have been asked repeatedly in a range of forums in this place how much extra the government is receiving from consumers and businesses around Australia. Each government minister who has been asked that question has repeatedly refused to give any comment or any advice. They have not disclosed how much the extra amount is. The truth of the matter is that, from the Prime Minister's announcement today, we are getting back something in the order of $560 million for the next 12 months, but the government is still sucking out an extra $1 billion on top of that. The government is still pulling out an extra $1 billion. We are entitled to know the quantum of extra taxation being received by the government and when that full amount is going to be returned. </para><para>That refusal to disclose, that refusal to be accountable, that refusal to be honest in government, is entirely consistent with every major policy decision this government has made over the last three or four weeks. Think about the three of them in total. There was mild panic when caucus resumed, and the net result was that the BAS was withdrawnâsmall businesses only have to pay every 12 months, not every three monthsâand the form was redrafted. The form should never have been there in the first place. The government fell for the con by the Australian Taxation Office and Treasury: they wanted the information for other purposes. So the government backflipped on that and got rid of the BAS. Then in the last 48 hours the government backflipped on trusts. The issue of trusts was going to be an integral part of the deal between Mr Howard and Ms Lees from the Democrats to raise extra revenue. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator Knowles</name></talker><para>âSenator Lees, to you.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESID-ENT</name></talker><para>âIt is Senator Lees, please, Senator Bishop.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>âSenator Leesâthank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. So that has gone by the by as well; the issue of trusts has been put off for 12 months. We have discussed the third issue at lengthâthe fall-back on petrol. As I said earlier in my discussion, there is really only one major policy issue to be addressed by this government when the Liberal and National parties effectively become the Australian Labor Partyâthat is, when they say, `We're not going to go on with the other 51 per cent privatisation of Telstra. That is off the agenda.' Let us not kid ourselves that some time in the next six months there will be a brief committee of inquiry that will find that services in the bush are not adequate or sufficient and that the necessary certificate cannot be issued, and the government is going to say, `If we are re-electedâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>22415</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIsn't the Labor Party in a frenzy today. Their beloved indexation is going to be scrapped and they do not know what to do. But wouldn't you think they would have actually found out what today's announcement was all about? We have just had a tirade from Senator Bishop, but he does not even know whether it includes diesel and he asks whether excise is going to be taken off LPG. It is just absolutely fascinating. Diesel was included. There is no excise on LPG. Poor, old Senator Bishop does not even know that. It is just absolutely breathtaking. This is the way in which they want to run the country. This is their beloved excise that they put in place in 1983 and increased 23 times in the duration of their 13 years in governmentâand they do not want it scrapped. Right up to this very point, Mr Beazley has been out there bleating, but at no stage has he ever said, `We are going to scrap excise'ânever, not once.</para></talk.start><para>So what are the Labor Party on about? It is just breathtaking to think that their policy on petrol was, and still is, that there will be no change to the GST on petrol, no change to excise on petrol, no change to indexation of excise on petrol and no change to February's indexation on petrol. That is the Labor Party policy. We need to look at that policy in connection with this absolute rubbish piece of legislation put up by the opposition, because there is absolutely nothing in it that directs anybody toward Labor Party policy. Is it any wonder that everyone believes that the Labor Party are policy lazy? They are policy lazy. There is not one section of policy. </para><para>The last indexationâwhich is Labor's excise not the coalition's: we did not bring it in; Labor did in their first year of government in 1983âwas a combined effect of the CPI for the September and December quarters and it equalled four per cent. This amounted to an adjustment of excise on unleaded petrol of about 1Â½c per litre. We should look at how that compares to the Labor record. Out of Labor's 23 increases in excise through indexation, seven were equal to or greater than four per cent. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will have to forgive me for saying that this whole debate is exceedingly hypocritical when the opposition's track record demonstrates that they have done something quite contrary to what Mr Beazley and the rest of the rabble out there are trying to say, because they do not have a policy.</para><para>The interesting part about today's announcementâwhich I suppose I should make quite clear at this point in the debate because the previous two opposition speakers have not referred to itâis that the Prime Minister announced that excise will be cut by 1Â½c per litre as of midnight tonight. For Senator Bishop's understandingâbecause he obviously has not heardâthat also applies to diesel, and there is no excise on LPG. So 20 minutes ago he did not understand all that and here he is debating it. This will result in the reduction of the price of petrol and demonstrates, I believe, that we have listened to the concerns of the community.</para><para>The abolition of Labor's automatic half-yearly indexation of fuel excise is the other part of the announcement. The ACCC has been given special powers to monitor the compliance of fuel companies in passing on the 1Â½c per litre to customers. The differences between city and country prices will also be monitored and there will be an examination of whether or not a cap can be placed on price fluctuation. Senator Bishop made no mention of that. He said, `There is no mention in the Prime Minister's statement of the city-country differential.' Wrong: there is. Why didn't Senator Bishop refer to it? More particularly, why didn't Senator Bishop read the statement before he came in and debated this silly piece of legislation? The statement today also announced that an inquiry will be established to address the issue of fuel taxation in Australia.</para><para>These changes recognise that something has had to be done to address what is a very significant issue to many Australians, while at the time remaining economically responsible. Labor has never considered this. The coalition has made a point of running a budget surplus and reducing the debt incurred by the Labor Party. Yet it is the Labor Party that has been running around saying, `What are you going to do about petrol? We are not going to tell you what we are going to do about petrol, but what are you going to do about petrol?' This government has had to do a lot since it came into office in 1996 to turn around the $10 billion, $11 billion or $12 billion deficit that was left to us, thanks to Mr Beazley, and that Senator Cook, who is notoriously now known as `Cook the books', said did not exist. And we are now having to do more and more of the Labor Party's work. </para><para>Another thing is that the price exploitation provisions of the Trade Practices Act give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission sweeping powers to monitor prices, to demand information from businesses in relation to price setting and to name and shame businesses that engage in price exploitation. All the Labor Party should be saying to that is, `Hip, hip, hooray and about time!' No. What are they saying? `Grizzle, grizzle, grizzleâwhy have you done that?' This is what the people out there want. I was at the fuel station the other day and as I moved the car from one position to another, because the bowser where I had originally pulled up was out of use, the price of fuel actually dropped 4c in that time. Okay, I was lucky. But that just demonstrates how quickly the price of fuel can fluctuate.

I will not ignore the comment, because it needs to be clarified. Senator Bishop was once again silly enough to interject that the then Premier's bill made it impossible for them to fluctuate the prices during the day. Well, guess what? This was before Mr Court's bill was passed. Therefore, the then state Liberal government actually did something about it. But the opposition did not want to know about it; and it is the same with this lazy oppositionâthey do not want to know about it. But it is interesting because we still know that here, for example, and in all the other places that you can pass from day to day, prices will inevitably go up at the weekend. So one does not buy fuel, if at all possible, from Friday to Sunday night, because the prices fluctuate. But why cannot the Labor Party come clean on what they would do? Will they maintain this abolition of excise? Or will they, on return to governmentâif that ever happensâever put it up again? And will they just continue to jack it up, as they did? One can only suspect from their past track record that that will be the case.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Another key initiative of today's announcement is that the price exploitation provisions contained in part VB of the TPA provide for fines of up to $10 million for companies and $500,000 for individuals who engage in price exploitation. It is very interesting because, once again, it was never the Labor Party who said, `Maybe we should be looking at all of this and making sure that there is no price exploitation; maybe we should be giving the ACCC some teeth to be able to monitor these prices.' Oh no, no, no, no! They would not want to do thatâbecause this is their beloved excise that they are talking about.</para><para>Equally, I suppose it is well worth noting that the state governments could actually come to the party and sacrifice some of their taxes if they were really, really dinkum about dropping fuel taxes. If they were really dinkum about wanting to drop fuel prices, the states could say, `Okay; we'll sacrifice a couple of our cents of tax, too.' But now we have nearly all Labor states, do you reckon we will have that, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot? I hardly think so. Oh no: big taxing, big spending Labor governments are hardly likely to give the poor old motorist a couple of cents a litre back out of the state taxes.</para><para>We also have to remember that one of the other fallacies that are promoted by the Labor Party consistently and continually is about the amount of money that the federal government is getting from the GST, and the fact that there was a price spike. That is just blatantly dishonest. It is nothing more than dishonest. They know that the price spike was taken out. They know that, if the price exploitation still goes on, that is not so. But they simply keep on saying it. Yet they were the ones who opposed everything.

They opposed the 24c a litre cut when the government introduced the new tax system. They opposed efforts by the coalition to keep the price of fuel down. Without the measures introduced by us, I might add, many motorists would be worse off than they are now. For instance, it is worth noting that farm owners and other small business owners would be paying an extra 10 per cent on diesel and that of course it would be about 24c per litre more expensive for heavy vehicles. And we cannot forget that it was the Labor Party who opposed those measures. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Bishop opposed those measures. Senator Bishop comes from a big state: my state, Western Australia; and your state, Mr Acting Deputy President. Yet he voted to stop a fuel decrease of 24c per litre on heavy vehicles. Isn't that appalling? He should hang his head in shame for not supporting that reduction. But Labor, as I say, has just increased excise over and over again. I might add that their increases in excise have been over and above the rate of inflation. If I were a Labor Party member I would not be wanting to come into this chamber and debate this issue, because the track record is so bad I would be saying, `I think I am sick; I think I will go home; no, I am not able to participate in this debate.' To think that the Labor Party increased it above CPI but, in addition to that, never gave the poor old motorist one cent in compensation. Not one. No tax cuts, none at all.</para><para>Remember, we brought in the tax cuts as well. Isn't it interesting? They raised it above CPI. It is a bit like the lies that we were told this week on pensions. Isn't it interesting? The same principle applies. Under Labor, pensions were increased according to the CPI, but only after the pensioners had had to endure the increase in prices. What the coalition is doing is giving them an increase ahead of the CPIâa very big difference. But oh, no! We cannot tell the truth if we are from the Labor Party. On no occasion has there ever been any compensation for all the tax hikes that the Labor Party introduced in 13 years of government.</para><para>As I say, all the measures in today's announcement are constructive action. But we have not heard one word at all uttered about the promises of where the opposition are going. I would like to really hear that.

I would like Senator West to actually justify why, when Labor came to office in 1983, petrol excise was 6.155c per litre but, when they left office, it was 34.183c a litre. One would imagine, if you had a calculator here, that that is just about a 450 per cent increase. Once again, we could ask the Labor Party to explain their way out of a 450 per cent increase in excise from the motorist without a cent in compensation. But I would dare to say that we would never ever get an answer.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is interesting, because a 450 per cent increase over 13 years is pretty substantial with no compensation; yet we cannot get an answer out of them. It is a policy lazy opposition, after how many years is it nowâfive years in opposition? Five years, I think, tomorrow: five years in opposition, with not one single policy. People could ask, `What's their policy on petrol?' We do not know. That is the one we are debating today. But equally we do not know what their policy is on health, education, small business, telecommunicationsâwe do not know their policy on anything. Here we are, with an important subject like this today, and there is not one single solitary alternative put before us.</para><para>We also need to put this in context. I have talked about the rises in excise that the Labor Party brought in over their 13 years in government constituting a 450 per cent increase, but it is interesting to know what that 450 per cent increase raised. I was staggered when I saw this figure. It raised for the Labor Party, the Labor government, $3.7 million per day for the 13 years they were in officeâ$3.7 million per day. Once again, that should be a source of embarrassment to them. But it is a source of pride, because they are a high-taxing, high-spending government. They do not worry about that. It just seems as though the cap fits: `We know we're high taxing, we know we're high spending, so it doesn't matter that we slug the motorist $3.7 million a day in fuel excise.' Quite clearly, this legislation says nothing and does nothing. This legislation is even more redundant today, if that is possible, than it was three weeks ago when we were last debating it.

This legislation does not offer to reduce excise by 1.5c. This legislation does not offer to cut out excise by the February indexation; it does not do it. Why would you want to vote for this legislation? It is just ridiculous. But here we are; that is the level of debate. That is the level of intellect we have: `Why don't you vote for the legislation?' Fair dinkum! We have to get to a stage where this opposition actually understands the problem and understands what is on offer. No wonder this opposition voted against a 24c a litre cut for heavy vehicle fuel usage, when they say, `Why don't you vote for the legislation?'âlegislation that does nothing.

The Prime Minister has today made an announcement in relation to petrol excise. Unfortunately, I have not many details available on what the government is proposing, except that it involves a 1Â½c per litre reduction in excise, which finally meets the promise that was given, an inquiry into fuel taxation and the abolition of the half-yearly indexation of petrol excise. I shall comment later on the excise issue in that announcement.</para><para>Both the government and the Labor opposition are presently so focused on the narrow issue of the rate of petrol excise that they are not seeing the broader picture. By failing to address other issues in the petroleum industryâsome of which would impact on the price of fuel and some of which may notâthey are failing to address those problems which exist with the industry itself. I would like to canvass a couple of those other issues, and I will begin by talking about the petroleum industry.</para><para>The petroleum industry in totalâexploration, production and manufacturing; wholesaling and retailingâis an industry where there are major barriers to entry and exit. Barriers to entry range from the extraordinary investment and expertise required at the exploration, production and manufacturing end to the planning difficulties surrounding retail siting. Barriers to exit particularly apply at the retail end, where franchise contracts and a shrinking service station sector can often make a profitable exit difficult. It is an industry which has always been characterised by the dominance of the transnational majors, who have always striven to maintain their captaincy of every level of the supply chain to the customer. Consequently, the petroleum industry has not seen the emergence of strong countervailing contenders for captaincy of, for instance, the wholesale channel or the retail channel. </para><para>It is the Australian Democrats' view that the industry exhibits fatal flaws which materially affect investment, profitability, pricing and competition. The issues for the petroleum industry are vertical and horizontal integration, open access to terminals and protection of the rights of individual operators. The correct mix of regulation of each of these areas should result in increased competition and profitability and better pricing practices. It would also result in a beneficial end to the absolute market dominance of the oil majors in the wholesale and retail sectors. The Democrats believe that, specifically, the issue of open access to oil company terminals needs to be addressed so that, from one day to the next, service station operators can shop around for the best wholesale price for the fuel that they are buying. Of course, part of the problem is that those operating franchise petrol stations are obliged to buy 100 per cent from their franchisor. We believe that that needs to be opened up and, indeed, the Senate Economics References Committee is inquiring into that very issue at present.</para><para>What has been missing a little from the debate, although I have heard some talkback radio commentators discussing it, is the extraordinary situation whereby the prices of fuels go up and down throughout a week. There is no other retail sector subject to that, and it is an indication of great manipulation of this industry by the majors concerned. The government's most recent proposed reforms involved the repeal of what had become known as the sites act. That repeal would allow oil companies to directly own and operate more sites and has attached to it a very real risk of increasing vertical integration, as the refiner and the wholesaler of petrol also becomes the controller of the retailing of the product. On no analysis of the industry can the Democrats support the repeal of a bill where it has that possible consequence, because it would permit a scenario which is diametrically opposed to the one which we believe should be being perpetuated. The Democrats advocate a separating of refining, wholesaling and retailing, so that those separations into the different horizontal tiers of the industry would allow real competition at each level and real pressure to maximise efficiencies. The mix of regulation I referred to needs to attend to the needs of each of those horizontal levels of the industry. It appears, unfortunately, that since it became clear to the government in September 1999 that it was not going to get its petrol reforms through the Senate it has simply washed its hands of attempting any structural changes to the industry. The oil code has been dropped and the repeal of the franchise act has been forgotten. The government's inaction on structural and competitive reform in that industry for the 18 months since is very disappointing.</para><para>Another part of the big picture that the government is not seeing at the moment because of its fix on petrol prices is the potential benefit of alternative fuels and the potential ultimate cost savings to Australians if the use of those fuels is proliferated and increased. The government's national greenhouse strategy says that efficient transport and sustainable urban planning is a major priority and that the government seeks to promote an integrated best practice approach to transport. Notwithstanding that, the only transport related moves have all come from the tax reform package as a result of Democrat initiativesâfuel emission standards increases, gas conversion increases, alternative fuel grants increases, and the removal of excise for rail.</para><para> My colleague Senator Allison made some very important comments in an urgency debate on 6 February this year. I will reiterate a few of those comments. The government needs to use its fleet buying power to encourage manufacturers to produce vehicles which, for example, run on compressed natural gas or which are hybrid powered cars. The purchase and subsequent resale of these vehicles would provide Australia with a considerable fleet of vehicles running on half as much fuel and at a lower price. State, federal and local governments change over around 90,000 fleet cars every year. If these were converted to CNG there would be an annual fuel saving to taxpayers of $80 million. If governments pooled this enormous buying power to persuade Holden or Toyota or Ford or Mitsubishi to put hybrid petro-electric technology onto their production line, the rest of the population would be also given the choice to buy cars which run on much less fuel. If you think of it in simple terms, is it better to continue to drive petrol vehicles with the price of fuel 1Â½c per litre cheaper, or is better to drive vehicles of comparable power that simply use less fuel? This is an area in which the government does have the power to take direct action at very little cost to the Commonwealth. </para><para>The problem at present, of course, is that petrol prices are high relative to what Australians will accept. The government has consistently made the point that they are not high relative to the price in many other foreign countries. But from an Australian's perspective that is irrelevant, because they are concerned about what the price means to them. There is no magic in all that. In addition to my electorate car which comes with my package, I have a personal family car which I regularly refuel. Consequently I am very aware of the price of fuel. I am pleased that the Court government, as one of its last acts, introduced a means whereby there are regular reports on the price of fuel around Perth, where I live. The extraordinary thing is the astonishing variance in the fuel price, and the way it goes up and down within the course of a week. Frankly, that practice is one that really does need proper examination. The idea that retailers are price determined by the majors in advance of their actual pricing is contrary to every other retailing practice that exists.</para><para>I personally do not think that the public will be overenthusiastic about getting a 1Â½c per litre reduction. I am sure that they will be grateful, but it is a relatively small percentage, as we all realise. It will help. No-one will knock it back, but the annual saving for an individual is not such that a very significant difference could be noticed. If we were talking 10c or 20c per litre there would be much more interest, but such a reduction would come at a tremendous cost to the Commonwealth, and everyone recognises that the Commonwealth cannot accept that burden. What the Commonwealth does need to be doing is proliferating the use of cars which use less fuel and particularly less petroleum based products. Even ignoring the environmental benefits, I expect the Australian public will be much more appreciative of a government that increases the use and production of vehicles that simply use substantially less fuel than a government that reduces the price of petrol by 1Â½c per litre and which takes off the midyear indexation.</para><para>Turning now to the issue of the excise rate: the government has promised to reduce the excise by 1Â½c per litre, and the Democrats are very pleased with that announcement. The government promised that the price of fuel would not rise on the introduction of the goods and services tax. The 1Â½c excise reduction will mean that their promise has been kept. But of course the price of fuel has now risen for other reasons. You will recall that the GST caused an increase in the price of petrol of 8.2c per litre; the government only reduced the excise rate by 6.7c per litre and claimed there would be a saving of 1Â½c per litre to oil companies as a result of tax reform. That saving was disputed, and motorists did not see 1Â½c per litre coming off the price of fuel from the oil majors.</para><para>As for the abolition of the indexation of excise, we are concerned about the revenue and environmental effects of that decision. However, I have always held the personal view that indexation is an inflationary act in itself, and in regard to areas such as bracket creep with regard to income tax, the eventual effects can be very unfair. There is a strong school of thought that still believes that any increase in taxation should not be automatic and should be justified to the people as a whole. However, I recognise that that view is not a popular or widely held one, so I just mention it for it to be noted. There are revenue effects from this. In the short term, the revenue effects will not be that substantial, but in the longer term the absence of augmentation of recurrent funding will affect expenditure in other areas. It is what economists call `opportunity cost'. If you reduce prices in one area, it means you have not got money to spend in another area, such as roads, hospitals and education. </para><para>The government is proposing an inquiry into petrol taxation. We say: why wasn't the idea of abolishing indexation made a term of reference of that inquiry? That would have allowed the government and the parliament to know the potential revenue effects of that course of action and whether the abolishment of indexation should be looked at with regard to other areas. As we know, indexation applies to cigarettes, alcohol and many other areas. On the issue of the inquiry, the government is again taking too narrow a focus. The inquiry needs to be extended to address transport and energy policy. Issues that should be addressed include reducing Australia's reliance on greenhouse gas producing fuels, public transport and rail and road infrastructure. This country still is far too obsessed with spending money on roads and far too little obsessed with spending money on rail.</para><para>In summary, the Democrats believe that both the government and the Labor Party need to look beyond the narrow issue of fuel pricing. Senator Cook did advise me that he is going to be bringing down a report in March. I urge him to take note of the views I have expressed this afternoon, and I hope he will consider some of these issues in his report. The government and the Labor Party need to look at the wider issue of structural reform in the petroleum industry and the wider issue of alternative fuels. Both of those topics have the potential to bring much lower fuel costs to motorists than any excise reduction. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>22422</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday is rather a momentous day in politics.

One of my staffers from my electorate office was down this week, and this morning he filled up at the BP in Kingston where petrol was 95c a litre. We checked with the electorate office before I came in here, and petrol was 103c a litre there. So there is an 8c difference. He is feeling quite pleased with himself that he was able to fill up at the cheaper price. </para><para>But what does that mean for us in terms of the excise and the GST? Also hidden in the Prime Minister's little announcement and hidden in the GST is the fact that the GST is a percentage of the final price. So my staffer who filled up his car here paid about 8Â½c a litre for the GST component; back home, he would have paid over 9c. It does not matter if you take 1.5c a litre off that; there is still going to be about a 5c difference. So those of us who live in the country areas are always going to be paying more tax on our petrol because of this government's GST. So you can take 1Â½c a litre off it, but in the rural areas we are still going to pay more.  </para><para>There has been talk about the reduction in the price of petrol, and very quietly we have realised that this fuel reduction will affect diesel. I hope that the first thing the ACCC do when they commence their inquiry is look at the price of diesel and what has happened with that. The escalation in the price of diesel over last couple of years has been astronomical. I have a pensioner who lives in the Hargraves district, a remote area out from Mudgee in the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister of this country. He is paying more than $20 a week to keep his home lights burningâhe uses a diesel generator for his TV, his lights, his refrigerator and his washing machine. And when he is on a fortnightly disability pension of $340 a fortnight that is a huge slug.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âHaven't you heard of the diesel tax rebate?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name></talker><para>âSenator, obviously you do not understand the rise in price of diesel irrespective of your wonderful rebates.

But he is now finding it a huge burden on his pension, particularly with prices that keep rising. What does he do? Does he not have a generator? Then what does he do to power his television, his lights, his refrigerator and his washing machine? I have lived with kerosene lights and with a kerosene refrigerator and I have stoked up the copper, but we are talking about somebody who is now getting elderly. These are the sorts of the impacts that this government's policies have had on people. Only now is this government suddenly realising that there is a problem. Why, when we have raised these issues before, hasn't it been a problem? Obviously there was not a by-election in Ryan coming up and there had not been two state elections during the previous two weeks that kicked the pants of the government so hard in the various state constituencies that they will not sit down for a fortnight. Maybe they will not sit down for the whole three-year periodâin Queensland the Liberal Party does not even have party status in the parliament because their numbers are so low. We thought we had done badly up there many years ago when we got to a cricket team size, but it is not good. </para><para>I also have a company that runs medium-size trucks, all eligible for the on-road fuel diesel grant. They are now paying around $11,000 a month for fuel, or $1.03 a litre. The rebate reduces the bill to about $9,000, but it is still several thousand dollars more than when the scheme was announced and the company was paying around 70 cents a litre. The company has been forced to increase its charges by $5 a tonne, or 14.2 per cent, to try to counter the diesel fuel increases. These are the sorts of impacts that this government has caused. We also know that the cost of the last harvest was quite significantly higher for farmers. Even with the rebate the price rose quite markedly. </para><para>If you read the last Sunday's <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> you would have seen that Newspoll did some polling in the Deputy Prime Minister's electorateâvery interesting reading it made. There were four vignettes from four different constituents: one had been a Labor voter and was going to continue to be, the rest were not sure what they were going to be but it certainly did not appear that they were going to be conservative voters. One was a midwife who did not live in Mudgee but outside Mudgee. She had had to stop working as a midwife because they could not afford the cost of her running the car into work. We have a fairly critical shortage of registered nurses, and particularly of midwives, in the country area and this government's additional imposts on fuel have caused this to happen. That is of major concern. It is not uncommon in rural areas for people to live in one community and work in anotherâlive in Bathurst, work in Orange; live in Bathurst, work in Lithgow; live in Lithgow, work in Bathurstâand in those communities they are finding that they are using about two tanks of petrol a week. That becomes quite a significant amount and an impost on their budget, especially if they are low income people. We know that petrol has risen because of world price rises. But the icing on the top of all this has been that on 1 February there was an increase of another 1.5 cents a litre excise. The GST keeps accumulating all the time and we pay more of that particular tax in rural areas because our petrol is more expensive than it is for people who live in the city. So we in the rural areas are being punished. But it does not appear to worry this government. </para><para>They have done a backflip today. They have been pretty impressive with their rate of backflips in the last fortnight or so. You would have to say it was a 360 with pike with a 3.3 degree of difficulty, and I suspect that in the eyes of their constituency it has been nothing more than a bellyflopâand I suspect a very painful one at that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âIt is called listening.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name></talker><para>âListening?

It is a problem that has to be addressed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Last year the opposition identified this problem and wanted to hold an all-party inquiryâwe did not care whether it was joint house or Senate only. What happened? We got beaten on the floor of this chamber. We went and held our own inquiry. We went and listened. Senator McGauran talked about listening before. We went and seriously listened to people in remote and rural areas of this country. That is why, in January this year, as an interim measure the finding of the committee report was that we should not pass on the 1.5c a litre excise increaseâa figure which we anticipatedâthat was going to be passed on on 1 February. What happened? We got lampooned, we got pooh-poohed and we got pilloried by the government high, wide and handsome because it was just not possible. The government have been in power for five years, and they have only now decided to act on the issue. They really are coming very slowly to the point, and they are not comprehending the point.</para><para>I am concerned about what they are doing, because petrol prices are increasing. Fuel is going up all the time and, as I said, it is a precious drop. The government did not seem to twig to that until today. If the government were serious, we would not have had Senator McGauran interjecting on me from across the road and we would not have had Senator Boswell in here interjecting; we would have had Senator Hill in here with amendments to our bill to tidy it up, tighten it up and do some of things they want to do. It could have been through this chamber and over to the House of Representatives as soon as possible on Monday. But what is happening? Nothing. The government are trotting out their members. They are making them speak, and I presume we are going to speak this out. I do not think the government are particularly serious. I really do not think they are serious. I have concerns that this is really not doing anything to address the inherent imbalance that now exists in taxation on petrolâor on anything for that matterâparticularly on fuels in rural areas. People in rural areas pay more.</para><para>I look forward to the ACCC doing an inquiry, and I hope they will look at the vertical integration of the industry. I hope they will also be able to come out and explain why, a week or so ago, petrol was more expensive in Bathurst than it was in Orange. Bathurst is actually closer to the capital cities and the refineries than Orange is. From 12 February to 15 February, it was 101.5c in Bathurst. In Orange, it was 100.5c. There had been a positive price movement in Bathurst of 7.6c. In Orange, it had been 4.3c. If the ACCC can actually explain why some of this is happening, I think they will have done a very good job. They might also like to think about why, a few years ago, petrol was cheaper in White Cliffs than it was in Broken Hill. Somebody is playing ducks and drakes somewhere, and I hope the ACCC can get to the bottom of this. It will be very important for people in rural areas. This is a major issue, but the government have done nothing for LPG. There is no excise on LPG to be removed, Senator Knowles was able to inform us. Perhaps they might like to explain what is going on, why there has been a huge price rise in LPG and what they are going to do about that, because that will have an impact upon fuel costs, particularly in terms of public transport like taxis. Most taxis run on LPG. There goes the price of transport up again. </para><para>This is a major issue. If the government were serious, I would not even have to speak. My whip would come and tap me on the shoulder and say: `Sit down. You don't have to speak. The government have the amendments they want to move to this, they are going to accept our legislation with amendments and, therefore, the problem will be solved.' They are not doing that. I suspect we will have to wait a long time to see some of this and I suspect the details of it are a bit obscure. We do not know how much the government have creamed off as a result of the GST. I suspect they can afford to give this back only because of that huge increase. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>22426</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator West has addressed this chamber now for about 20 minutesâshe did use the full 20 minutesâand all we heard about these bills of the Labor Party's, the <inline ref="S293">Excise Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001</inline> and the <inline ref="S294">Customs Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001</inline>, introduced by Senator Cook, was at the very beginning and at the very end when she said that the government should come in and amend the legislation. Senator West, it is no coincidence that those were the only references you made to the bills, because these bills are quite irrelevant, absolutely flawed and beyond amendment in terms of meeting the intentions in the announcements the government made today. This legislation and the legislation the government will introduce to give effect to the announcements made today are like chalk and cheese.</para></talk.start><para>Senator West talked about the effect of the GST on country petrol prices. Of course, she completely ignored the fact that a lot of travel by country people is undertaken for business purposes. Therefore, a substantial amount of the GST which they pay on fuel is refunded because of that business use. She also talked about the increase in diesel prices. She completely ignored the fact that we have taken 23c a litre off the cost of diesel for road transport purposes and for many other purposes, including on-farm use. Diesel remains completely free of any excise. Senator West also completely ignored the reason why the price of diesel has increased: firstly, the price of crude oil on the international market has increased and therefore, as with petrol, the price of diesel has increased; and, secondly, within the Asia-Pacific region there is a substantial shortage of supply of diesel because of the demand for diesel in Asia, in particular, as a result of its economic recovery following the slump of a couple of years ago. Therefore, in relative terms, compared with petrol, the price of diesel has risen because of that shortage of supply.</para><para>We know that, when it comes to the crunch, Labor's concern for rural people is mere rhetoric. We know that, when they were in government, it was the rural people more than any who suffered from their economic mismanagement. Rural people suffered under 13 years of Labor as a consequence of high inflation, high interest rates, the cost-price squeeze, Labor's tax and spend policy and bracket creep, and so many more of the policies that Labor pursued in government were specifically detrimental to rural people. So it ill behoves them to come in here and behave as though, in relation to fuel issues, they are the saviours of rural people.</para><para>The real problem for the Labor Party is that their policy and the legislation that we are debating this afternoon have been left completely exposed by the Prime Minister's announcement today. The government have announced a reduction in excise of 1.5c per litre. The recent February automatic indexation increase that was applied at the beginning of the month has been abandoned. Even more significant than that is the fact that the automatic indexation of excise has been abandoned. This was the policy introduced by the Labor government under Prime Minister Hawke way back in 1983. It was not ever a Liberal government policy. No previous Liberal-National government ever introduced the automatic indexation of excise, because we consistently believe in transparency and accountability. Therefore, if governments are to increase taxes then taxes ought to be legislated. It was the Labor Party that initiated the automatic indexation of excise on fuel, and that has been abolished as of today. These bills are quite redundant because all they seek to do is limit indexation increases. We have gone much further by removing them. We have provided a solution to the problem; all the Labor Party offer is a bandaid approach. </para><para>There are four essential elements to the announcement made by the Prime Minister today. The first of those is the reduction of 1.5c per litre in excise. The second is the fact that the automatic indexation of fuel excise has been abandoned. Thirdly, we are providing additional powers to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to increase their surveillance of fuel prices to ensure that this reduction in fuel excise is passed on directly to the Australian people, to the consumers. The fourth arm of this is the announcement of an inquiry into the structure of fuel taxation. That will be a very detailed assessment of fuel taxation issues to be undertaken with broad community representation.</para><para>This decision is significant in revenue terms. It is estimated to cost some $555 million in terms of lost revenue to the budget. But, clearly, given the healthy economic position in which this country currently finds itself as a direct result of the reforms initiated by this government over its five years in office and the consistently good economic management provided by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and others in the executive arm responsible for economic management, the government can afford that loss of revenue. It is a very important initiative. It is very important not only as an initiative from the government but also because this reduction in the price of fuel as a result of the abolition of the 1.5c per litre increase of earlier this month is passed on to consumers straightaway. It is no wonder that Labor have come in here today trying to muddy the waters: their lazy way of raising revenueâthe automatic indexation of the fuel exciseâhas been abandoned.</para><para>It is important to understand that high fuel prices, by and large, are a consequence of high crude oil prices. That is not a matter that can be dealt with by the government and it is not a matter that can be dealt with by the Australian people, because those oil prices are largely determined by the machinations of the OPEC oil exporting countries of the Middle East. To the extent that the government do have some responsibility and capacity to alleviate that situation, they have done so with this initiative today. As a result of sound economic management, that will not in any way cause problems for the budget. Despite the significant cost of $555 million, the budget surplus and our capacity to reduce debt will be retained.</para><para>Under the Labor Party, we had these automatic increases in fuel excise every six monthsâthere were 23 of them under the Labor Party, as I recall, which gave them extra revenueâand yet the budget deficit kept rising as well. So on the one hand they were gleaning more revenue from the Australian public and on the other hand it did nothing for their budget management at all, because in essence they were a tax and spend government with no responsible economic management. This announcement goes well beyond anything that Labor are offering in this legislation. It goes well beyond anything that Labor did in government to relieve the impact of fuel prices on the Australian community. </para><para>Under Labor, inflation averaged something in the order of 5.2 per cent. With inflation at that level, those indexation increases were of some significance. Seven of the 23 indexation increases under Labor were in excess of four per cent. To the extent that indexation increases have continued under this government in earlier years, none of them has been of that order. None of them has had the same dramatic effect on petrol prices as the effect they had under the Labor government. Not only were there indexation increases over the last four to five yearsâbecause it is only now that we have abolished this automatic indexationâand not only were they significantly below whatever occurred under Labor, but now they are no more.</para><para>On 1 July, we cut excise by 6.7c a litre in the move to the new taxation systemâthe much needed taxation reform and the implementation of the GST. For business use, that 6.7c a litre that was replaced by the GST is fully refunded. There are a number of other initiatives that this government has taken in relation to fuel related issues to ease the burden of fuel costs on the Australian community and the productive capacity of our nation. As I said earlier, we cut fuel costs for heavy transport by 24c a litre with the on-road grants scheme. We have also introduced the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme for regional and remote areas to reduce the variation in price between city and country areas. </para><para>I also referred earlier to the off-road scheme, whereby diesel for on-farm use, for instance, was completely free of excise. Under our policy, that excise-free diesel has been extended to marine use and rail transport, again to reduce the cost of transport and the cost of producing and delivering goods and services in Australia, to the overall benefit of our economic productivity and consumers. As I said, we also allow the GST component of business use of fuel to be fully refunded.</para><para>Let us have a look Labor's policy. Again, it is no wonder that they ignored that in the debate this afternoon. They are not going to take the GST off petrol. They are not going to reduce the excise on petrol. They will not abolish the indexationâthat very important initiative that we have taken today. So there is a stark contrast between this Liberal-National Party government and the Labor Party opposition in our approaches to issues relating to fuel prices and the taxation of fuel. They have been out there in the community cranking up concern about excise, but when it comes to the crunchâwhen the rubber hits the roadâthey really will do nothing in terms of any long-term solution about it. Sure, this bill we are debating this afternoon that they introduced into the Senate sought one limitation of the excise. Beyond that, they have made it very clear that they would not reduce the excise on petrol and that they would not abandon the automatic six-monthly indexation of fuel excise. In contrast, this government has today reduced that excise by 1Â½c a litre, and it has abandoned the automatic indexation of the fuel excise.</para><para>It is worth noting that Senator Cook, who introduced this bill, criticised our tax reform package because it was going to cut the cost of diesel. I will quote from the report of the committee that Senator Cook chaired, which inquired into the tax reform package. The report was, in essence, drafted by Senator Cook as the chairman of the committee, the Labor Party having the majority on that committee. That report said:</para><quote><para>The government's proposed tax changes will encourage business to use more heavily polluting petroleum fuels at the expense of LPG, LNG and other more environmentally friendly fuels.</para></quote><para>There we see Labor's real attitude to fuel prices. They want higher fuel prices because they mistakenly believe that higher fuel prices will lower the use of what they regard as environmentally damaging fuels. Nothing could be further from the truth. People do not use fuel for the fun of it; they use fuel because they have to. Most fuel is used for business purposes. To the extent that it is used for private purposes, a lot of that use is also not discretionary.</para><para>I recall Senator West saying a few moments ago that country people's use of fuel is not discretionary, so to suggest that because the government has reduced the price of fuel people will use more of it is quite illogical and absolutely crazy. The reduction in the price of fuel means that people will have a little more money to spend on some other goods and services, and that will benefit their own standard of living. It will benefit Australia's economy and productive capacity and ultimately jobs and welfare for the Australian community at large. But cheaper fuel will not encourage people to use more fuel, and it is quite ridiculous to suggest that that would be the case.</para><para>It is also important to understand that the claim by the Labor Party that there is a windfall gain as a consequence of the high petrol prices currently being experienced in Australia is a fallacious claim. Revenue from excise in this current year has actually fallen because the government reduced excise by 6.7c per litre. It will fall further because of the reduction of 1Â½c per litre. On the other hand, it is very clear that the revenue stream from the GST on fuel goes to the states and territoriesâit is a state and territory tax in that senseâso there is no windfall as a result of that. Also, the reduction announced today will have an effect because it has already been built into the forward estimates.</para><para>The decision today is designed to directly assist Australian motorists, both private and business, by giving them some relief from the high fuel prices they have suffered in recent months as a direct consequence of high crude oil prices. There is no doubt that this reduction will help to ease the financial burden on motorists, but importantly the government will also retain a responsible budget position. That is something that the Labor Party never worried about when it held the reins of government. It was high taxing and high spendingâa tax-and-spend government. </para><para>It is also important to reinforce that this excise cut will directly benefit motorists. It will not benefit the oil companies. The government has put in place measures to ensure that the full benefits of this package are passed on to motorists under the price exploitation provisions of the Trade Practices Act. That gives the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission sweeping powers to monitor prices, to demand information from businesses in relation to price setting and to name and shame businesses that engage in price exploitation, just as it was able to with the introduction of tax reform and the GST. It is not only a legal obligation but also a moral obligation of the oil companies and service station operators to pass on this reduction to motorists so they get the full benefit from it.</para><para>In contrast with what the Labor Party said today, let us look at what the community is saying about this very important announcement. None other than the Australian Automobile Associationâwhich, I have to say, has been very critical of this government in recent months over the issue of fuel pricesâhas warmly welcomed this announcement. The Executive Director of the AAA, Mr Lauchlan McIntosh, said that the AAA was very pleased that the government had listened to motorists' concerns. It is especially pleased about the abolition of automatic six-monthly indexation, which is a significant decision today. The 1Â½c a litre reduction is very important, and it will improve the situation of motorists immediately, but the long-term benefit for motorists out of today's decision is from abandoning automatic indexation.</para><para>Mr McIntosh also said that it would have been very easy for the government to take a short-term bandaid approach to this issue but instead it has opted for fundamental reform which should lead to long-term benefits to motorists. He is referring to the abolition of the six-monthly automatic indexation of excise. He said that that and the stronger powers for the ACCC to police petrol pricing are very good outcomes for motorists and other users. There we have itâhigh praise for the government's decision from the chief body representing Australia's motorists. It is praise that is well deserved. It is the result of the government's listening to the community and acting. Importantly, this decision puts greater discipline on governments in the future. If they want to raise additional revenue from fuel excise, they will have to be up-front and transparent about it and will have to introduce specific legislation through the parliament to do that. Those who are policy lazyâthose who adopt a lazy approach to revenueâwill not enjoy this decision, but this government can be really positive about it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>22429</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âYou would think by the way a number of the coalition MPs are crowing this afternoonâin particular those who have stood up and had a sayâthat they had had some personal marvellous victory.

At the last election the Prime Minister made one of those quotes that he likes. He said, `The price of petrol would not rise as a result of the introduction of the GST.' That was obviously a lie, and that has been proven time and time again since that election was held. The price of fuel is now going to be reduced by 1.5c a litre. On the Central Coast of New South Wales, in the electorate of Robertson, currently held by Mr Jim Lloyd, under the government's proposal if you fill up at one of the Woy Woy service stations you will pay a total of $56.64, or 94.4c a litre. The price of petrol will go down from 95.9c a litre to 94.4c a litre. Of that, the tax would be reduced by 1Â½c. So, today or tomorrowâwhenever this proposal will operate fromâif you were to fill up a normal family sedan that holds 60 litres, you would pay $56.64. The break-up of that right now, if not tomorrow when it comes in, will be $28.50 to the fuel company, the service station owner and all those costs, but $28.14 will still come back to the federal government. That means the reduction from what you would have paid yesterday to what you will pay today is 90c. That is all one family will save from yesterday's price when they fill up their sedan today or tomorrow. So today it costs $57.54 to fill up the family sedan; tomorrow it will cost $56.64âthat is a 90c reduction. I do not think you can even buy a Mars Bar with 90c anymore. However, the coalition MPs are out there, singing the praises of this marvellous deal. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I do not see how that is going to have any impact at all on people's disposable income. If you fill up your car twice a week, as people in the outer suburbs of Sydney have to do each week, you will be saving $1.80. That is all you would be saving. I do not know how the government can claim that this is a marvellous deal for motorists, because it is not. They are paying too much money now for fuel. In our legislation we are attempting to make sure that that is handled.</para><para>Even the Minister for Trade, Mr Mark Vaile, who holds the seat of Lyne, at some point last year when pressed on the difference between city and country petrol prices said that it was unacceptable. But what has happened? As Senator West said earlier, the price of fuel in Bathurst is much more expensive than the price of fuel here in Canberra. The price of fuel in Sydney today is 97.9c per litre. Yet at Port Macquarie, it is $1.09; in Taree, 99.9c; and in Wauchope, 99.9c. A lot of people in this region are retirees and are very restricted by the amount of money they have. I have a letter addressed to me from the Manning Valley Branch of the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association. They talked about the impact of the GST on petrol and how it is affecting them. Mr or Ms J said:</para><quote><para>Mr Howard's promise that petrol prices would not rise because of the GST has proven not to be the case.

I do not think this 90c that you save when you fill up a car is going to be enough to make sure that the government gets through the next election. I do not even think those courageous coalition MPs who for some time have publicly been berating the Prime Minister to ensure that he would do something about the price of fuel will be saved at the next election. The people are not going to be fooled. If you believe that they are going to be so happy or relieved by this mean-spirited government and its mean little effort to reduce the price of fuel, I am afraid you are going to be sadly lacking.

But in relation to the people on the Central Coast of New South Wales in the electorate of Lyne and, in particular, in the electorate of Lindsay where Miss Jackie Kelly is the member, it does have a real impact.

This has been an issue in the government's camp for well over 12 months and people have been complaining about it for some time, and it is only now that the Prime Minister has acted. It is too late. You can see the writing on the wall. You can see the nervousness there. Senator West already highlighted today the backflips that are under way in relation to policy positions: the backflips on BAS, the backflips on trusts, and now the backflips on petrol. When are we going to see the backflips on Telstra?</para><para>The government used to try to pride itself on being economic managersâsteady people in a crisis. Would you really let John Howard be a captain of a ship if it was in a stormy area? I would not; not after these actions. This Prime Minister does not have the capacity to lead. He has now been forced to take a series of backflips as a result of the continual pressure on the coalition from the elections over the last few weeks. I imagine that what was really on the Prime Minister's mind was the fact that, in the next few weeks, we are going to see a by-election in one of the safest coalition seats in the country. We are going to see a by-election in Ryan. Of course, the pollsters and all the other people on the ground must have been well and truly telling the Prime Minister that there is a serious reaction out there to him and his government's policies. I do not think the coalition is going to get over the fact that they have been seriously wounded as a result of the Queensland and Western Australian elections. When the rot gets in a political partyâas we know in the Labor Partyâit stays there; there is nothing much you can do. There is not much you can do when the body has been mortally wounded, as has happened to the coalition, particularly the National Party. All you can do for those coalition MPs over the other side is check out their entitlements after they leave parliament, because there will be a healthy swag of Labor MPs here after the next federal election.

As a result, there are insufficient drivers to deliver meals, which means that the elderly and the incapacitated are not helped. </para><para>That is the result of what has been happening with these fuel price increases. Do you really think that 90c a week is going to be enough to make sure that we get these volunteers back there? These are honourable people; they want to make a contribution to their community; they want to help people who need assistance. Can they? No, the volunteers are drying up because they cannot afford to fill up their petrol tanks. Do you really think that 90c a time when they go to the bowser is going to be enough? I do not think so.</para><para>Mr Arthur Galis, who owns a petrol station in Londonderry in the seat of Lindsay, gave us a written submission. He says that he runs one of the few remaining driveway service stations in New South Wales. He reported that high petrol prices are leading to the crippling of his business through increased petrol theft by people who cannot afford to pay. Mr Galis has said that in those areas, particularly the outer suburbs of the major cities, where you have to have a car to get around because public transport is not available and you have to travel because you cannot work in your own municipality, there is increased petrol theft. People are driving into the service station, filling up their car, and driving off. That is what is happening. That is the result of the increased fuel price.</para><para>If you filled up your tank tomorrow in Woy Woy, it would cost you $56.64. If you filled it up the day before, without that 90c saving, you paid $57.54. So 90c has been saved and, of that price, $28.50 goes to the petrol company and the service station, but now $28.14 still goes to the federal government. No wonder people are starting to make themselves unavailable to go and fill up their tanks so they can help out in places like the Nepean Food Services. No wonder they are ripping off poor service station owners like Mr Galis because they cannot afford to pay for the cost of fuel when they go and fill their cars up as they need to.</para><para>We know that this government is in terminal decay now. The backflips that have occurred over the last few weeks are signs of that. Any reading of history will tell you that, once the governing party or the authority in power start to make these sorts of backflips and to turn around and to give the appearance of panic, they are in decline and will be booted out.

We found ourselves in the seat of Lindsay and the Liberal Party club at the university and out in the eastern suburbs and internal processes of the Liberal Party. I was wondering why he really did not spend more time speaking to the matter at hand. The reason probably is that Senator Hutchins is incredibly embarrassed by Labor's record on petrol excise.

I note she is not even on the list. She is probably too embarrassed to get up, given Labor's record on petrol excise since 1993 when we had high taxation at the petrol pump. We had previously a Labor government who believed in high taxation. They are a high tax party. One of the ways that they managed to rip an enormous amount of revenue off the Australian public between 1983 and 1996 was by not just bringing in a major tax at the petrol bowser but also by constantly increasing it. They were such poor economic managers that they generated an enormous inflation rate. That then created another tax bonus for them because they were the ones that brought in indexationâsomething that the government has now abolished. We are the first government since this came in during 1983 to actually reduce the amount of excise. This is most welcome across Australia as this will lead to a very welcome drop in the price of petrol. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The other thing that we have done which Labor should be standing up and praisingâbut of course they will notâis cut the indexation of petrol excise. As a matter of fact, the Labor members are probably quite horrified by that change because this was one of their little cash cows that they would have secretly hoped would be retained for the day that they ever, unfortunately, might return to government. Without that indexation to inflation, they do not have that ever rising tax take at the petrol bowser. But today this government has cut this out.</para><para>We have also instituted an inquiry into fuel taxation. Also, in terms of the application of this 1.5c drop, we will be giving special powers to the ACCC to monitor this process very carefully and make sure it is passed onâand this will be very welcome to the Australian public. The reason for the government doing this is that we have been out there in rural and regional Australia, we have been out there in country Australia. That is something Senator Hutchins would never have done. He sits there in his Phillips Street office, up on the 11th floor; I doubt he has ever got much beyond the Sydney Harbour Bridge. He certainly does not know how people are feeling out there in country Australia and what their reactions are. In the coalition we hold many seats in country Australia, and we have been out there listening to what people have been saying. In the party roomâdespite what Senator Hutchins has saidâcertainly many members brought those concerns back, and that is why you have that change today. This is a government that listens, and this is a government that responds to what people out there have been sayingâand that is something you would never have seen under a Labor government.</para><para>Can you imagine a Labor government actually dropping the amount on excise? They certainly never did that in their 13 years in government. What they did was keep putting it up. You would never ever see a Labor government taking indexation off, because they realise that is taxation by stealth. That is something that they like, because it helps cover their normal range of economic mismanagement. But what we have had here by this government is good economic management. We have come up with a sensible balance between expenditures on certain matters, keeping inflation low, keeping the budget in balance and also giving back, through the reduction in this excise, money to provide excise relief for the people who are buying petrol.</para><para>One would think Labor would welcome this, but we have not seen anything of that today. They would realise of course that, if they did welcome this, it would be rank hypocrisy, given their record since 1983. Let us look a little more closely at that record. They put up petrol taxation in their term by $4.1 billion. That over 13 years is what they took through this systemâ$4.1 billion. So what a hide they have in talking about a tax windfall for our government, given that they were the perpetrators who started it and, indeed, continued it over time. They imposed a tax hike of $4.1 billion. When they left office, the excise was 34c, which is an increase of 450 per cent. It was doing multiple leaps over that time, not only by their jacking up the excise rate but then also by their indexing it up for inflation. That provided a double whammy in costs to motorists at a time when people were struggling with very high inflation rates and very high interest rates. Throughout Labor's time, indexation went up on 23 separate occasions. What we are doing is putting it down; what they did during their years in government was constantly put it up. Because the Labor Party ran this high-inflation economy, it went up a lot faster than it normally would have if they had managed the economy sensibly. </para><para>But what are Labor going to do from this point on? Where are we going to get guidance about what the next Labor government would do? Are they going to do what they did from 1983 to 1996? From listening to the comments of Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition in the lower house, I suspect that is possibly the case. You will find that he fudges and just flip-flops all over the place and does not give a straight answer. When he was on 3AW in Melbourne with Neil Mitchell on 5 February this year, he was asked by Neil Mitchell:</para><quote><para>... is it possible you would look at taking the GST off petrol?</para></quote><para>Kim Beazley's response was:</para><quote><para>I don't think we'd give that contemplation.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Nick (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Sherry)</inline>âSenator Tierney!

Neil Mitchell continued his questions by asking:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>But you might look at taking the excise off?</para></quote><para>Mr Beazley's response was:</para><quote><para>... nor the excise for that matter.</para></quote><para>Neil Mitchell thought he had misheard Mr Beazley, and he said:</para><quote><para>Sorry, you said nor the excise.

That is the sort of policy confusion that we are getting on this matter from this policy-lazy opposition. They complain about petrol prices, and then they say they will not be changing the GST on petrol or removing the excise. But it is just not Mr Beazley who confirms this; it is also members of his frontbench. The shadow treasurer, Simon Crean, was interviewed by Michael Spooner on the ABC's Central Queensland radio on 31 March last year. Michael Spooner asked Mr Crean:</para><quote><para>What sort of commitment can Labor make regarding fuel excise?</para></quote><para>Mr Crean's response was:</para><quote><para>... basically our position has been that there needs to be this mix between indirect taxes and direct taxes. We always had fuel excise in that mix. We were not proposing to make any changes to the fuel excise regime.</para></quote><para>Well, what humbug we have had here today from these people, when their own senior spokesmen are saying that they are not going to change anything and, indeedâread for code, given the history of Labor governmentsâthat when they get back in, they will keep jacking it up to get more tax revenue. Also, let us go to Joel Fitzgibbon from the Hunter, who is also the shadow small business minister. On his local 2NM radio station on 24 July last year, Mr Fitzgibbon said:</para><quote><para>Well my point to the party is this, that petrol prices have been an election issue for decades.

You would have heard Senator Woodley ask a question today of Senator Alston, in his capacity as representing the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, with regard to the very issue of dairy deregulation. Yes, it is true that the report was indeed signed off by Senator Woodley. Indeed, it was signed off, as I understand that, by you and Senator Crane and Senator Ferris, as well as by Senator Forshaw and me. It is a report which, unfortunately, the government has responded to in a 14- or 15-line missive which simply said, `This matter has been dealt with. We have passed legislation through this placeand put the dairy package in place.' What a pathetic response.</para></talk.start><para>Everyone in this place knows that, as far as the industry is concerned, the issues raised in the report and the restructure package that has been passed through this place do not end the issue of dairy deregulation. Indeed, it has been pointed out today by Senator Woodley that one of the recommendationsâwhich was the subject of, in effect, the question by Senator Woodleyâwas that there be a review undertaken in relation to the operation of cooperatives and their accountability requirements and mechanisms. Given the announcement in the media today that the Bonlac Corporation is considering merging with the Murray-Goulburn groupâwhich would mean that the two largest cooperatives in Australia become oneâthat is a matter which I would have thought the minister today would have had a brief on. Apparently, if he had one, he did not know he had one, because he really was all at sea in his answer to the question.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âIt is better than the New Zealanders taking over.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>âSenator McGauran suggest that it is better than the New Zealanders taking over. I am not sure if it is any better or worse. There was, as I understand it, a proposal for Bonlac to merge with one cooperative in New Zealand, and that proposition had been sold to the shareholders of Bonlac on the basis that that would give them a marketing edge. And now, of course, there will be a proposal to try and sell an alternative proposition and maybe get into a bidding war about it. It raises an issue about what dairy farmers are going to face: if there is only one major cooperative operating in Victoria and Tasmania, what options will dairy farmers have in the sale of their milk? We have seen in the last few days dairy farmers producing milk for the white milk marketâthe supermarket milk market, let us call itâpleading for and obtaining a price increase to keep them in the industry.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One matter which I have always been keen to follow up on, following our inquiry, was how the processors would keep dairy farmers in the industry when prices fell, as we all knew that they would, after deregula-tion. None of us knew how far they would fall. It has been established that, in terms of manufacturing milk, ABARE was right and that, in the northern states, ABARE was also right that the price of market milkâwhite milk, the milk we all drinkâwould fall to the same level. But, in Tasmania, what the producers have effectively said in our current climatic conditions is that there is not an incentive to remain in the white milk market with the prices that are being paid; and now the price of milk will rise, as I understand it, by 5c a litre in the supermarketsâ4c at a wholesale levelâand it is proposed that somewhere between 2c and 3Â½c of that increase will go to the producer, to keep them in the industry and justify them incurring the costs that they necessarily incur to produce milk year round for that market. </para><para>These are the sorts of issues that members of the committee expected the government to address in its response to the committee report. This committee, an all-party committee, spent a great deal of time and obviously moneyâusing the resources of the parliamentâto take this issue to dairy farmers around the country, to the companies who were involved in the industry, to the public, to the state government departments involved in the industry, in order to get a feel for what was going on; and it presented a not insubstantial reportâas I say, a unanimous reportâwhich said that deregulation was inevitable. A lot of issues were raised and a lot of recommendations were made but, unfortunately, all the minister could say in response was, essentially, in those 14 or 15 lines, `We passed the package that the industry put before us.'</para><para>As I have said before, that is an indictment of this government. I have said it on a number of occasions and I will say it again. When this government took office in 1996, it knew that the DMS scheme would end on 1 July 2000. It knew that that scheme was all that was keeping the regulated sector together. It knew that, when that ended and, effectively, compensation was paid to dairy farmers in the non-regulated statesâif I can put it that wayâthere would be immense pressure on the milk market from the Victorian producers in particular, who produce about two-thirds of Australia's milk, to enter the other markets. The government knew all of that, and if it did not it would be a real admission of incompetence. But the government, I would say, is not incompetent in that regard. Certainly, the department was not. They knew what was likely to happen. They knew that there would be a challenge to regulation and they knew that the challenge would succeed. So the industry's propositionâand it was the industry's proposition, because the government was sitting on its handsâwas that there be a package. The government spent months and months and months dealing with that package. That package went through, at the last possible instant, with the support of the opposition on the basis that we knew it had to happenânot held up by the opposition but held up by the incompetence of the government in terms of pursuing this matter.</para><para>There were producers out there in the sector who held out hope against all hope that regulation would continue and that somehow they would be protected. What should have happened is that this government should have taken the bit between its teeth early in its term and advised the dairy farmers that that was a pipedream, that one way or the other regulation would end. It should have put in train the sort of package, perhaps, that was ultimately put in train but with a much longer lead time so that dairy farmers could organise their affairs on the understanding that a couple of years hence this would happen, that nothing else would happen and that regulation would end in those states.</para><para>Let us face facts. What the government said to the states was, `You don't get this package if you don't deregulate, and you all have to deregulate.' Let's forget the humbug that this is all a state problem, because the Commonwealth said to the states, `If you don't deregulate, your farmers will not get this package.' But the government did not do that. What the government did was sit on its hands for three years and then, at the begging of the industry, embrace a package on such a timetable that the dairy farmers were in a position where they were not able to organise their affairs. Deregulation came with a rush. We are seeing the impact now, particularly in northern New South Wales and in Queensland, and the anger of dairy farmers is palpable. Let us forget the humbug about blaming the states, because the Commonwealth required the states to deregulate with this package. They required the states to rescind their regulation before their dairy farmers were eligible for the package. So let us forget that humbug and let this government admit the fact that it should have acted a lot earlier. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>22438</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn the same matter, I cannot allow the comments of Senator O'Brien, two weeks in a row now in this Thursday session, to go unanswered, brief as I hope to be on the matter.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>âAre you getting up on this matter, too, Senator Forshaw?

It is rank inconsistency by the opposition. First of all, I want to make the point about Bonlacâwhich Senator O'Brien raised, again just trying to hang something on the government. Let me just say that I happen to think that a merger between Bonlac and Murray-Goulburn is well worth considering. It should be a priority consideration amongst the directors of Bonlac over and above the second option that they may well have, their bid for a merger with the New Zealand company. Their third option is to shed assets. But the situation of Bonlac that they have put their members, their dairy farmers, is quite negligent. We should not even be in this position if it was not for the negligent management of Bonlac in the first place. There has been an attempt for Murray-Goulburn and Bonlac to merge before, and I did not agree with that, but with the pressure that Bonlac is under at the moment I think the merger is worthy of consideration. That will mean that at least in Victoria we really only have one milk cooperative company. But it will still be a cooperative. It will still be owned by the farmers of Victoria. There will still be a huge membership in Tasmania. There will still be a huge membership controlling that company. They will not lose their control. I just wanted to make that point. I do not know what point Senator O'Brien was making, actually. Was it simply that the minister did not have a brief on the matter?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>âIt is a commercial matter, Senator O'Brien. But I just say it is worthy of consideration. We do not like monopolistic activity, least of all this government. But the point is that Bonlac has fallen into such disarray. Its management is in such disarray. Such is its weight in debt that it is now time to consider those options. I repeat: at least the farmers in Victoria and Australia will have control over the company. It will still maintain its cooperative status. I make that point.</para></talk.start></continue><para>My second point about deregulation is that you agreed to it.

We have a three-pronged compensation package; it is an adjustment package, if you like. The Dairy Structural Adjustment Program has funds of $1.78 billion, which I think is the biggest adjustment package for any industryâand so it should be, because this happens to be the largest adjustment of any primary industry. Of course we also have the Dairy Exit Program and the Dairy Regional Assistance Program.

I will be far more disciplined. My third point, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, is that the Senate committee chaired by Senator Woodley, which also had Senator Forshaw and Senator O'Brien as members, reported regrettablyâand I do mean regrettablyâthat dairy regulation was inevitable. It was inevitable for these reasons. First of all, the Victorian industry itself, the United Dairy Farmers, headed by Max Fehring, was determined to see dairy deregulation across the country. The Victorians were going to cross the borders. That was the representative body of the dairy industry in Victoria. They were backed up by both the Kennett government and the Bracks government in Victoria. Both primary industry ministers backed up that deregulation. Then the federal body, with their mouthpiece Pat Rowleyâwho, much to my surprise, is a Queenslander himselfâalso supported dairy deregulation. All of them are running around saying that it was all very inevitable, but they all seem to agree to it, as you do. So when you had the industry bodies seeking deregulation and the state governments seeking deregulation, it was an inevitability, as was reported by the Senate committee and its chairman, Senator Woodley. So do not come in here and say that we forced deregulation upon the industry. I was on the Senate committee inquiry, and the Victorian industry and the federal body, represented by Pat Rowley, came before that committee and were quite strong and vigorous. That federal body needs a good shake up. I remember them coming before the Senate inquiry. </para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjectingâ</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESID-ENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

A Bonlac director, who was also on the federal industry body, came before the Senate inquiry calling for deregulation, which I found to be an incredible conflict of interest. But I digress. Nevertheless, I wanted to make that point. </para></talk.start></continue><para>My fourth point through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, is that not once in Senator O'Brien's speechâand Senator Forshaw will be the same should he seek to get upâdid he lay any blame in regard to the state's milk quotas. The Labor Party have not once called upon their state governments to compensate in regard to milk quotas. That is the real tragedy of this deregulation. In Queensland and New South Wales, the milk quotas have become utterly worthless and there is absolutely no compensation. Those farmers bought those milk quotas from the state; they are state milk quotas. They are now a worthless asset, and they have received no compensation. Why won't Senators O'Brien and Forshaw seek the state governments to be fairer and give the farmers a fairer go in relation to compensating milk quotas? Because they are Labor state governments. They have neither the courage nor the wit to stand up and demand that Premier Carr and Premier Beattie compensate their dairy farmers. That is the real tragedy and that is the real loss for the dairy farmers. That is the hardship they are facing now: the worthlessness of their milk quotas. It is right at the feet of the state government to pay compensation. The blame lies with the state governments for not compensating the milk quotas. Are you getting up, Senator Murphy?

I remind the Senate and those who are listening that this report was a 200-page report of the Senate committee. It followed public hearings across all the states. It was a unanimous report from senators representing the government, the opposition and the Democrats and it contained a number of recommendations. It was a thorough report, as, indeed, senators have come to expect from all Senate committees.</para></talk.start><para>If I can give a plug to the Senate rural and regional affairs legislation and references committeesâwhich I serve on, and Senator McGauran, Senator O'Brien, Senator Murphy, who is also here, and you yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, serve onâthose committees give us an opportunity to get around the country and talk to people regarding issues in rural and regional Australia. I believe we give a lot of thought to the preparation of our reports and recommendations. So when you get a response from a government that amounts to just three paragraphs, and it is tabled in the Senate well over 12 months after the report was handed downâas I said, a 200-page unanimous reportâthen you can only assume that this government does not care about the workings of the Senate. The ministers in this government do not care about the work that Senator Crane and Senator McGauran, from their own coalition parties, do on this committee. To respond with just 2 paragraphs is contemptible and an insult.</para><para>There are a number of issues that I want take up. In particular, I recall that today in question time Senator Alston, representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, was asked a question on the issue of the impact of dairy deregulation. Senator Alston, in his usual fashion, did not bother to answer the question but just parroted out the government's rhetoric on this, that this is all a problem for the states. He also said that this was not even really a federal government problem or a federal government issue but that, rather, they responded to a request from industry to approve this package. That is the line that Senator Alston has been putting out; it is the line that Minister Truss has been putting out. I also recall that I asked a question of Minister Alston when he was present at the estimates hearings last weekâwhich was not all that often because he usually goes for a walk or a wander during the estimates hearings. I asked him a question and he did the same thing: he just blamed the states. </para><para>I want to take the Senate to some of recommendations and comments in the report, because it gives the proper picture of just what has happened with deregulation. Before I do that, the first point I want to make is in response to Senator McGauran's comment that the Labor Party set deregulation in train. I will not deny that and I will not walk away from it. We understood that the industry needed to change. But what we did was to implement that change in a coordinated fashion with the industry and with the states. Everyone remembers the Kerin plan, when John Kerin was the minister, and then the Crean plan, when Simon Crean was the minister. You now see today the results of those plans which produced a situation where the export sector of the dairy industry has gone ahead in leaps and bounds and is now one of our major export earners in the rural sector. Those plans certainly had an impact on the industry because it did need to change, but they were implemented in a coordinated fashion so that dairy farmers did not suffer financially as a result. If they were going to be affectedâeither by having to exit the industry or by changing through structural change and adjustmentâthey would be assisted. That is what this government has not done. I will go now to the report by the committee, which said:</para><quote><para>There seems to be no doubt that the Australian dairy industry will become a fully deregulated industry over time. The real point at issue is the timing of deregulationâwhether there should be full deregulation now, whether it should be delayed completely for several more years or whether some sort of staged deregulation is an option.</para></quote><para>So, sure, I accept thatâas the committee understoodâderegulation was inevitable. But what we were all concerned aboutâas Senator McGauran recalls, and Senator Crane was also on the committeeâwas to ensure that deregulation took place in a coordinated way and that it was done over a period of time so that dairy farmers would not end up in the situation that some of them have ended up in today. The report went on:</para><quote><para>The Committee considers it to be the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government, not the industry or individual state governments, to coordinate the orderly transition of the dairy industry to a deregulated environment.</para></quote><para>That is what the committee said unanimously, Senator McGauran.

The report went on:</para><quote><para>While the Committee notes that a staged approach to deregulation may moderate its immediate effects and allow farmers more time to restructure their businesses, a one off, properly designed, adequately resourced and fully coordinated approach to deregulation is the preferred approach should deregulation occur on 1 July 2000.</para></quote><para>We recommended in recommendation 1:</para><quote><para>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry call, as a matter of urgency, a meeting of state Agriculture and Regional Development Ministers to determine a framework, and a timeframe, for the coordinated deregulation of the Dairy Industry.</para></quote><para>Our committee was calling on the Commonwealth government to get the states together around the table to determine a coordinated national approach, but the government did not do that. They sat on their hands and did nothing. Eventually, as the months ticked by and we got closer to 1 July 2000, they said to the states, `We've got this package that has been developed by the industry. You can take it or leave it. You're going to have deregulation. You can have it with a package, which means some financial support, but if any of you states vote against it then nobody will get the financial support.' That was the gun pointed at each of the state governments and at the dairy farmers in each state. What choice did they have but to accept deregulation with the package? There was no other choice. But nobody was happy about it, particularly in the states of New South Wales and Queensland.</para><para>The government run this line and claims that it has given the industry this package. Let us remember that this package was developed by the industry. It is funded by an 11c per litre levy on all milk that is consumed in this country. The government taxes the payments. Not one cent of government funds has been put into this package. All that happens is that the government collects the levy and then hand it back to the farmers. It takes out its tax share on the way through. When the government says that the states should now pay compensation, I say this: firstly, as Senator McGauran knows, in the states of New South Wales and Queensland, there is no scope to pay compensation because the quotas are not a property right; and, secondly, it is not their responsibility. It is about time the federal government recognised that they ultimately drove the deregulation agenda and that they should be looking at picking up the tab for the farmers who are suffering in those regions. I seek leave to continue my remarks on this report later. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>22442</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>22442</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to committee reports and government responses were considered:</para><quote><para>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References CommitteeâReportâDeregulation of the Australian dairy industryâGovernment response.

In particular, I want to refer to the people who work in the remote, isolated and Aboriginal communities of the Northern Territory and certain other small areas. There is a great contribution under extreme hardship and often personal sacrifice from these people who give a public service in these areas.</para></talk.start><para>In generalâand I would not want to not be inclusive in my remarksâI think of nurses, health workers and doctors. I think of policemen, schoolteachers and other educators. I think of people who work for local government and people who provide other services, such as the important communications and telephone services in remote communities. I think of the various people who work in municipal or local government and in community services. These are onerous tasks that many of us who live in more urban environments, larger towns and cities often tend to take for granted. We see these people in our daily activities and in our social environments, and there is an obvious interaction. The communication and the interaction are often very positive. But, if you think of people who live in remote or special small communities scattered in far-flung places and at great distances with perhaps only a few other colleagues working in similar environments close to them, we need to concentrate on and acknowledge the great work that many of them do. </para><para>When I look carefully at a range of federal government issues that impact on my electorate, the Northern Territory, it is very interesting to identify, either by department or by agency, the sorts of programs where I believe these people are making a great and very valuable contribution. Aboriginal hostels are an example. There are Aboriginal accommodation, education and training requirements, and special accommodation is often needed by people with health conditions. We should think of the many employees and people who are engaged in various ways with ATSIC. We have to be reminded of the CDEP, the very special programs, the joint venture programs and things like the Army infrastructure programs that are implemented in many of these isolated communities. You get an interaction between the ATSIC officials, the Army personnel and the local Aboriginal participants in many of those schemes.</para><para>There are areas such as, in the Northern Territory, a very important organisation called the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education. It is emerging and I hope one day it will be the first Aboriginal university. It reaches between 1,700 and 2,000 students who are now scattered throughout the Northern Territory. Many of the students travel to Batchelor for their education but, at the same time, many of the counsellors and teachers go out to the various communities. It is very pleasing to see, although there is often a funding problem in making sure that these people travelâsometimes for short periods of time and sometimes for longerâand deliver very important education, whether it is in health services, in education or in training people to be efficient in office skills.</para><para>Centrelink administers programs caught up in rural and remote visiting services, supporting the various ATSIC programs and underpinning the very necessary income support in difficult, isolated and small Aboriginal communities. The Centrelink officers need to be recognised and given credit. There are many people caught up, in scattered areas, with the indigenous and Aboriginal art industry which, in itself, is emerging as a very important industry in places like the Northern Territory. But it does require specialist officers and officials from state and Commonwealth agencies visiting these communities and underpinning not only art but also important community development, youth work and areas to do with recreation. This is so often very important in these communitiesâensuring not only that the grants flow but also that there is considerable activity.</para><para>Turning to the Commonwealth Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, there is the important area consultative committee network that now ensures that important employment stimulation projects continue. I give recognition to the field officers, who go out to the communities and ensure that these projects happen. Similarly, with the Indigenous Employment Program and the implementation of the Indigenous Small Business Fund, people go out and put these together.</para><para>We must recognise that, in the Department of Defenceâparticularly in the ADFâthere are many people engaged in exercises right through the outback of Australia and, particularly, in many areas of the Northern Territory. To see thousands of Defence personnel visiting, interacting with and participating in these communities is very important. I mentioned earlier the Army infrastructure initiative, which provides housing and other services in Aboriginal communities. Maybe many of those personnel go bush for short terms, but it is important. The Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs recognises the importance of lifting Aboriginal literacy and numeracy skills in the learning environments of isolated communities and also recognises the challenges faced by teachers, specialists and workers and those communities. Teaching in an urban environment is one thing, but it is not often that you get people that will spend the entire year in a small and isolated community.</para><para>The Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services implements the Stronger Families and Communities program, looks at aged and disability carer support, implements special programs for parenting skills, implements the Regional Solutions Program and looks at the establishment of new child-care centres in urban and remote areas. This involves a lot of hard work from many people and from individuals in remote areas. This morning, I had the opportunity to meet representatives of CRANA, the Council of Remote Area Nurses of Australia, a very important organisation. CRANA brings together so many others in the allied health fields, whether doctors, nurses, health professionals or Aboriginal health workers. </para><para>Aboriginal health workers represent a very large number of people, who perhaps should be more appropriately named Aboriginal health `brokers', because the particular skills that they bring in that area are so important. Conducting medical training and medical practice in remote areas often needs to be recognised, along with the great work that is happening in many new and special areas of coordinated care in remote areasâaged care, children's nutrition, addressing the issues of substance abuse and petrol sniffing and ensuring a healthy environment in which young children can grow. There are so many areas which require much more research for Aboriginal and tropical health, and groups like the Menzies School of Health Research need to be acknowledged.</para><para>We tend to forget people like the workers of Telstra, the providers of telephone services in rural and remote communities. They are often criticised because of a lack of services, but these people are stretched across long and remote distances. At the same time, we must recognise the family inconvenience of relocation, the special needs for security and compensation and the special needs for the security of nurses and health professionals. Their sacrifices in the areas of ease of transport and ease of communication must also be acknowledged. I am very pleased that I have so many constituents caught up in all of these exciting and challenging areas of government administration. In particular, I want to pay credit to their dedication and their service under often tiring conditions.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Sport and Tourism</title><page.no>22444</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>22444</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam President, you may recall that in question time today I asked Senator Hill in his capacity as the Leader of the Government in the Senate, representing the Prime Minister, a question about Miss Jackie Kelly, the Minister for Sport and Tourism. I asked Senator Hill why, given that the Prime Minister delayed the swearing in as a minister of Mr Mal Brough until such a time as he received a clean bill of health from the Federal Police, the Minister for Sport and Tourism should not be stood aside until such time as she received a clean bill of health. It seemed a perfectly reasonable question to ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate. As is so typical of answers offered to opposition questions in question time today, I received no response. Not only did I not receive an answer but there was no attempt made by Senator Hill to answer this very important question.</para></talk.start><para>While I attempted to press the issue when I asked a supplementary question, again there was no information forthcoming from the minister. This is apparently the new pattern that has been established in question time by ministers in this government, but I want to assure the Senate that the opposition will be pressing the sorts of issues that we raised in question time today in all the available forums. I can assure you that we will not be diverted from our role in holding the government accountable by whatever tactic or strategy the government might determine to adopt in question time in the Senate.</para><para>Let us have a look at this issue of Miss Jackie Kelly, the Minister for Sport and Tourism. I can inform the Senateâand I think most senators would know anywayâthat, after the Federal Police started an investigation into the false enrolments of Mr Mal Brough's staff, the Prime Minister accepted it as appropriate that Mr Brough not be sworn in as a minister. The Prime Minister stated on 31 January this year:</para><quote><para>You need a completely clean bill of health to be sworn in as minister.</para></quote><para>They are the Prime Minister's words. The Prime Minister said that for Mr Mal Brough not to be sworn in was `the right thing to do'. Again, they are the Prime Minister's words. He wanted: </para><quote><para>... to be completely satisfied that heâ</para></quote><para>Mr Broughâ</para><quote><para>is in no way involved because these people were employed by him.</para></quote><para>The opposition was attempting to ask Senator Hill in question time today what the Prime Minister's test that was applied to Mr Brough means in the case of the Minister for Sport and Tourism, Miss Jackie Kelly. If you apply the Prime Minister's test to Minister Kelly, it is clear that she should be stood down from the ministry. </para><para>I remind the Senate that when the shadow minister for family and community services, Mr Swan, was investigated for alleged electoral improprieties, Kim Beazley acted immediately and Mr Swan was stood down from the frontbench of the opposition. Last week, the AFP started investigating the disgraceful and probably corrupt scams that have been run out of Minister Kelly's office. According to today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper, AFP officers have interviewed six minor party candidates from the 1999 Penrith City Council election. It is reported that Miss Kelly and her staff will be interviewed. The AFP appears to be following a logical line of questioning. It is moving up the food chain. </para><para>What are the allegations that tie this investigation, this scam, directly to Minister Kelly? Firstly, we know that Miss Kelly actually chaired campaign meetings in her own office, where the dodgy micro-parties were planned. She overrode the concerns of others about the role of these particular bogus parties. Secondly, we know that Minister Kelly knew about the fraudulent enrolments being organised by Steve Simat to make sure that those micro-parties could run in the election. Minister Kelly was recently quoted in her local paper, the <inline font-style="italic">Penrith City Star</inline>, as saying she `knew Simat was dealing with the micro-parties'. She is reported last week as having asked Simat in August 1999 `whether everything was correct and legal' and that Simat assured her it was. How insightful for Minister Kelly to ask these questions! How convenient!</para><para>Thirdly, what also ties this investigation so closely to Miss Kelly is that another of her staffers, Nicholas Berman, was fraudulently enrolled at her own house. Minister Kelly recently gave him up in another local newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Western Weekender</inline>. It reported Minister Kelly as being:</para><quote><para>... surprised and disappointed to learn that former member of her staff, Mr Nick Berman, had remained on the Lindsay electoral rolls months after he moved away from the electorate early in 1998.</para></quote><para>It goes on to directly quote her:</para><quote><para>`Nick should have known better ... It happened, but there are no excuses. Naturally I'm disappointed.'</para></quote><para>Two of Minister Kelly's staff are up to their eyeballs in false enrolments. Their dirty tricks in this case were aimed at influencing the result of an electionâin this case, the Penrith City Council election. Of course, it has an impact in other general elections as well. It just beggars belief, with the information that is now available, that Minister Kelly did not know about these fraudulent activities. I think, given how hands-on this minister was, it is quite likely that she was personally involved. The point is this: Minister Kelly does not have a clean bill of health. The Prime Minister could not be completely satisfied, with an ongoing AFP investigation on these matters, that Miss Jackie Kelly or her staff were not involved in the Liberal Party rorts in Penrith. I say that Miss Jackie Kelly should be stood aside, because that is the test that the Prime Minister himself has set on these issues. We will not be diverted by the tactics that the Liberal Party is employing in question time in the Senate on these sorts of issues. That is a promise I make to everybody in this chamber. We will progress these issues. We demand accountability on these issues. This matter is not closed.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>East Timor</title><page.no>22445</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>22445</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to report to the Senate on East Timor. An all-party delegation of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade returned from a two-day visit to East Timor the week before last. It was on 12 and 13 February. Since our visit to East Timor 14 months ago, just after Australia had led the INTERFET peacekeeping operation, the change within the country is significant. Previously the devastation was almost inexplicable, with systematic destruction leaving the country in ruins. A house with a roof was the exception to the rule. The traumatised population had either fled West Timor, or just fled. The number who had been killed remains unknown. It is estimated that the refugee camps in West Timor still hold more than 100,000 people, and some 150,000 have returned to East Timor. East Timor is slowly being rebuilt, with the United Nations, Australia and 30 other nations contributing a wide range of assistance, from troops to teachers of public administration. While the committee members are concerned with the pace, priorities and perhaps even certain personnel in the UN effort, there is no doubt that a major change has occurred in a short period of time. The aim now is capacity building in East Timor and the requirement to help the East Timorese to help themselves. </para></talk.start><para>I would like to put on record my acknowledgment of the effort the Indonesians made during their 25-year rule. It is convenient to make Indonesia the whipping boy, but not all it did was bad. Many of the destroyed buildings and roadsânow mostly repairedâshow an effort to do good in East Timor. It is all too easily forgotten in demonising the Indonesian effort. Time has moved on. I want to make the point that Indonesia is our close neighbour and traditional friend. East Timor is to be put to one side in rebuilding our long friendship with our very large neighbour. In that regard I look forward to President Wahid's planned visit in April.</para><para>The committee members remain concerned about the threat to peace and long-term stability posed by the militia based in West Timor. Until solutions can be found to the repatriation of those displaced persons in West Timor who wish to return to East Timorâunder conditions acceptable to the East Timorese populationâand the provision of a measure of justice to those who committed criminal acts, the problem will not go away. Action is occurring, but the committee members urge the United Nations to place a higher priority on addressing this issue.</para><para>It was interesting to see the first trials of former militia members taking place while we were there. These are important actions because it is a priority to reassure the local population that their country has changed forever. It was impressive to see the commitment Australia has made in East Timor. The military commitment makes you really feel proud to be Australian. I think that these young men and women are probably the best trained, the best led and the best equipped Australians ever to serve overseas. The original commitment to INTERFET was superb. The present force, which are based with the New Zealanders in Sector West in the west part of East Timor, are doing a very courageous job and winning the hearts and minds of the local population, which is in serious need of reassurance.</para><para>The other Australian contingent to the UNTAET force is well trained and working hard to bring a civil government to East Timor. There is much work to be done to build the infrastructure for nationhood, and there is major work to be completed before elections can be held towards the latter part of this yearâplanned for 31 August at this stage, two years after the independent ballot. Longer term, apart from the essential effort to create a public service, a credible police and military, and schools and justice systems, the question of land ownership will be a difficult issue. The issue of language also remains sensitive, with the Timorese being schooled in Portuguese and the middle-aged in Indonesian. English is the language of the UN and the NGOs. There is a long road to hoe for the East Timorese. Considerable assistance will be required from Australia. Australia has made a commitment of $150 million over the next four years, but the future remains uncertain for the East Timorese.</para><para>I want to finish by bringing to the attention of the Senate a most unsatisfactory circumstance concerning the committee's visit. Despite this being a committee visit, it was treated by the Presiding Officers as an additional official international delegation. Therefore, the Clerk of the House of Representatives decided that the committee secretary should be replaced by another committee secretary, who had neither a knowledge of the visits planned nor a background to East Timor. Mr Ian Harris, the Clerk of the House of Representatives, needs to understand that he is here to serve the parliament, not the other way around. If he needs to be publicly embarrassed, then so be it. The next time a committee of the Australian parliament goes overseas, it should be the committee that decides who they take, not the Clerk of the House of Representatives. I think that all senators would agree with that, and I think we are owed a further explanation of his gratuitous, inappropriate and unacceptable action. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Quarantine: Importation of Apples</title><page.no>22447</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>22447</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to address a few remarks to Australia's import control and quarantine measures and the process for determining those measures. Senators would know that, as a result of an issue relating to the importation of salmon, many significant issues were raised about the processes that were used to determine Australia's quarantine measures. As a result of that, the government took some action and established Biosecurity Australia and also introduced a bill to amend the Quarantine Act 1908. There are two things about the Quarantine Act. It specifically sets down a requirement under section 11C for the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to be advised about any proposed decision involving a significant risk of harm. Subsection 11C (1) says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Before making a decision under this Act, the implementation of which is likely to result in a significant risk of harm to the environment, a Director of Quarantine must comply with the requirements of this section.</para></quote><para>The requirements are that the director give advice to the environment minister and then seek advice from him or her in respect of the assessment process. The reason I raise this is that we are now proceeding through another Senate inquiry into the application from New Zealand for the importation of apples into Australia and the issues around fire blight and the possible introduction of fire blight to this country. Staff from the Department of the Environment and Heritage appeared before the committee this week and gave evidence to the committee that I found astounding. I have raised many concerns about process, and indeed the inquiry into the importation of salmon made a number of recommendations, particularly in reference to the preparation of draft risk analysis. The department of the environment appeared before the committee, and I would like to read a part of their submission. What is very concerning is this: the department of the environment actually sought for this application on the part of New Zealand to be referred to the minister. That was refused by Biosecurity Australia. The submission from the department of the environment says, in part:</para><quote><para>Biosecurity Australiaâ</para></quote><para>after refusing to refer the matter to the ministerâ</para><quote><para>suggested that this Department'sâ</para></quote><para>being the department of the environmentâ</para><quote><para>concerns could be expressed through a public submission on the draft Import Risk Analysis for New Zealand Apples (the draft IRA).</para></quote><para>The submission states further:</para><quote><para>A conclusion of the department's submission on the draft IRA is that, clearly, the proposal raises significant environmental issues that have not been adequately addressed by Biosecurity Australia. It remains this Department's view that this matter should be referred to the Environment Minister as is required by provisions of the QA Act.</para></quote><para>Further on its says that, following an analysis of the draft IRA:</para><quote><para>The risk assessment methodology employed in the draft IRA is flawed.</para><para>Because of both this and other factors, the draft IRA underestimates the risk of importation and establishment of known pests and pathogens. There is evidence to support the view that the measures proposed in the draft IRA would almost inevitably result in the introduction of such pests and pathogens into Australia. Measures proposed to be taken in New Zealand to prevent the export of pests and pathogens are demonstrably inadequate.</para></quote><para>That is from the government department for the environment. It is one of the reasons that I have raised these types of concerns before. I have put the view to Biosecurity Australiaâas I did with AQIS when it was charged with the responsibility of compiling draft risk analysis reportsâthat they should get all of </para><para>the people's views and all of those views should be taken into account in the preparation of a draft risk analysis before it is put out into the public arena. This analysis should also contain recommendations on whether or not existing restrictions ought to be relaxed, whether restrictions for a particular imported product ought to be made or whether restrictions are less than, in this case, they ought be, which is what the department of the environment think. It is not only the department of the environment that think that; every other state department has this same view.  </para><para>I find it utterly amazing that, in an area of such great importance to this country, we have such an ad hoc approach to the importation of products in respect of the quarantine measures we ought to have in place, or that we ought to design and put in place, to ensure that our industries and our natural environment are protected appropriately. It is simply not acceptable from my point of view, nor should it be from the government's point of view, that you would allow a process to be so ad hoc. Criticisms are made, and I was dismayed at the Environment Australia submission where it says:</para><quote><para>It is also understood that Biosecurity Australia has suggested in at least one public meeting that Environment Australia has given in-principle support to the measures contained in the Draft IRA. This represents a significant misrepresentation of the views of Environment Australia, which has not provided any environmental assessment advice on this issue and has only provided a list of indigenous species related to apples.</para></quote><para>That is a very serious allegation by one department against another. If Biosecurity have done that in public meetings, they are misleading the public of this country in respect of this particular matter. I do not think any government should stand for that.</para><para>I assumed, as a result of the salmon inquiry report, that the government would have moved to change the processes whereby we as a country prepare a draft risk analysis that contains recommendations about the importation of certain products and goods and put it out into the public arena. We know that, in the salmon case, the draft risk analysis of 1994-95 went out into the public arena. The Canadians and Americans were provided with copies of it. The recommendations in the draft risk analysis were ultimately changed in the final risk analysis. We also know that the WTO was very critical of AQIS and the approach that they took. That AQIS could prepare a draft risk analysis with recommendations to relax restrictions, in that case, for the importation of salmon into Australia and then subsequently change the recommendations without one scrap of further scientific information or advice was the very thing that caused us to lose a very important case in respect of importation of overseas product into this country. And we are again confronting, almost seven years later, the same problem for the same reasons. I just find it downright amazing that the government has not moved to rectify these problems. </para><para>I just hope that, at the end of this inquiry, the lessons that will now have been learned twice will lead to decisions being taken to give effect to a new process that will ensure that we are never put in this position again. If we do not do something about it, we will continue to pose a threat to not only many of our agricultural industries but also the total environment of this country. I urge the government to give serious consideration to what I have said tonight.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.10 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>22448</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>22448</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Acts Interpretation ActâStatement pursuant to subsection 34C(7) relating to the delay in presentation of a reportâNational Residue Survey Report for 1999-2000.</para><para>Higher Education Funding ActâDetermination under section 19âDetermination No. T12 of 2001. </para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript></hansard>
