In other words, were the commission mindful to adjust their principles in relation to considering these sorts of issues, that option would be open, whereas the government's original amendment would not have allowed that scope through simply reflecting the principles in Brodie-Harris v. MTV Publishing Ltd. I think that is my understanding. If it is the case, it is likely that Senator Murray's amendment provides for a wider discretion, and we would support it. In our view, it is entirely appropriate that the commission's discretion be as wide as practicable in such instances. They hear the evidence from the parties, they are able to judge their veracity and they have the material before them to make an appropriate decision, whether or not we trust them to make the right calls. In our case we do, and we would support an amendment that provides for a broader rather than a tighter discretion.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>25820</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Collins—it is a bit of a stuttering start for me this morning.

The intention, as those senators who recall my minority report way back when<inline font-style="italic">, </inline>was to ensure that both employers and employees recognise that they should enter the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission with regard to these matters only if there was a reasonable prospect of success—in other words, to omit items which, on the balance of probabilities, would be unlikely to succeed at arbitration. The effect of our proposed amendments will be to prevent an applicant from proceeding to arbitration if his or her claim in respect of harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination were to be applied where the commission would find that the application does not have a reasonable prospect of success. Before making its findings the commission would be required to give the applicant the opportunity to provide further material in support of his or her claim in respect of the grounds of harsh, unjust or unreasonable terminations. These really cover the field all the way up to item 22 of the bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>25821</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Currently, with respect to these amendments, the act provides for the commission to assess the merits of a claim and it may, if it thinks fit, recommend that the applicant elect not to proceed. The government, in the bill, wants to get the commission to indicate that in every case, whether or not it thinks on the balance of probabilities that the claim is likely to succeed. The Democrats' amendments would mean that, if the commission believes that the application has no reasonable chance of success, it must advise the parties accordingly. The effect of putting so much import on the conciliation proceedings, in our view, will be to turn them into a mini arbitration. This was the matter I was referring to yesterday when I took up Senator Campbell's reference to the Australian Industry Group as an area where they also had some level of concern. </para></talk.start><para>At this stage I would like to indicate again for the record the Labor Party's concern with what is occurring here in relation to what I think is an abuse of what the conciliation process is meant to be. In doing so, I would like to take the Senate to submissions by Maurice Blackburn and Co. in their submission to the Senate inquiry into the `more jobs, better pay' legislation, where I think they gave a very good explanation as to why this would occur:</para><quote><para>The Commission's assessment of the merits of the applicant's case must be made without the benefit of hearing evidence under oath from the witness box. Clearly the Commission's ability to make such an assessment will depend on the evidence produced. In our experience, the factual positions of the parties at conciliation are often polarised. If applicants stand to lose their entitlements, to elect to go to arbitration, their advisers will have a duty to effectively run a trial at the conciliation conference which will prove the applicant's claim on the balance of probabilities.</para></quote><para>Or, in the Democrats' case, a different test. To continue:</para><quote><para>This approach guarantees that the costs involved for both parties proceeding to conciliation will increase dramatically. The focus will also inevitably move from the current objective of conciliation to settle the matter in a relatively non-legalistic and informal settlement process. In our experience, the accessibility of the current conciliation process provides applicants with an opportunity to confront their grievances with the employer and come to terms with the fact of the termination. We see this process is critical to an effective resolution of the matter.</para><para>The proposed amendment will inevitably result in conciliations becoming more legalistic and adversarial as arguments on the merits of the applicant's case become the central focus of proceedings. This threatens to marginalise the key players in the conciliation process—that is, the employee and the employer themselves. With the focus likely to move away from pragmatic options for settlement of the matter, conciliators in the Commission will take an entirely different role in the process. We anticipate that the proposed amendment will result in fewer claims settling prior to arbitration. Both parties stand to incur significantly increased legal costs.</para></quote><para>This view was in part also mirrored by the Australian Industry Group in relation to the conciliation measures. We think that under either of the tests there will be a poor outcome. However, in this instance, the Democrat amendment is vastly preferable to the government's proposal. In changing the test from `likely to succeed on the balance of probabilities' to `no reasonable chance of success', as I read it, the Democrat amendments, at the very least, will ameliorate the tendency for mini trials to occur and costs to be incurred. However, Senator Murray, some of my colleagues have indicated they are in a quandary over whether your test is really a better test. I am curious to see how you rationalise that particular wording, on the record, with respect to it providing a better test.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>25822</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am of course familiar with the arguments that Senator Collins has put. This is an area of some difficulty for all of us because I believe, on a cross-party basis, we are all of the view that as far as possible the processes of the Industrial Relations Commission should be as cheap and as quick and easy to access as possible. The problem we face is that in the pursuit of fairness or justice that particular objective can get out of reach. The evidence put to us consistently over time has been that there has been an abuse of process which has resulted in employees being stretched out and forced to back off and terminate their claims unreasonably by employers, and there has been a similar attitude of employee representatives doing it to employers. </para></talk.start><para>Our assessment of the issue is, therefore, that an early indication to the parties by the commission as to reasonable prospects of success would be desirable because it would mean that, if subsequently it was found that the issue was without merit, that would be a consideration in the resolution of the issue. I accept that there are always difficulties in tests. We know that. Senator Collins as a practitioner of the art of industrial relations negotiations knows that; hence, her justified hesitancy when a new test is brought up. My difficulty was that I accepted the case that somehow you needed a pre-arbitration determination to alleviate what seemed to be, from the evidence given to us, abuse issues in the process of these things. However, I thought that the government's test was too legalistic and likely to restrain the matter too far. Having accepted the proposition, I therefore had to find a way to express it in a more flexible manner which gave greater discretion to the commission. So that was the consequence of the words. `Reasonable', as you know, is a word which is commonly used in law and has some common law history and understanding; therefore, I thought that `no reasonable prospect of success' was in the end a useful summation of that intent. Quite frankly, as we all know as legislators and as you get more experienced in this business, you design some things with the best of intentions and sometimes the results may not be quite as you would expect. So I accept that you, or some of your colleagues, may be a little wary of this. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>25822</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Murray's wording provides a less containing test in relation to the circumstances. I believe the words `no reasonable chance of success' indicate that, if you have any reasonable chance, you are okay. Whereas, if you look at it on the balance of probabilities that the claim is `likely to succeed', that test provides less scope for people who might still have some, perhaps very slight, reasonable chance of success.

It is a very interesting concept: you have a decision maker making a decision as to whether or not he ought to make a decision of a different nature later on. Will you have different people hearing it or will the same person hear it?

My understanding of law—and I do not have the same experience as Senator Cooney—is that preliminary hearings or meetings of this sort are not uncommon. Personally I think it is a useful addition to the process if the commission is able to assist the parties with an early first summation of the situation. It does not prevent applicants pursuing it further if they wish, but then the commission will have regard to their motives.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>25823</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government will be supporting these amendments.

It adds, at the end of the item, a qualification. This section of the act deals with the nature of the employer's undertaking. We believe that the absence or presence of dedicated human resource management specialists or expertise impacts on the procedures followed in effecting the termination. We think that there is a superficiality in regarding the size of a business as relative to liability or ability in the area of human relations. For instance, somebody may come out of a major company having been the human resources manager and start up a small services business. Frankly, those persons would be equipped at all times to know the proper procedures and how they should have dealt with an employee; whereas somebody who comes from a different environment may not be as cluey, if you like, about how you establish matters of process regarding appointment, warnings and eventual dismissal. This is just a qualification of the government's proposal.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>25824</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government's bill includes the size of a business in the criteria to determine whether a dismissal is unfair by reason of procedural fairness. From our point of view, that is just an alternative means of introducing the exclusion criteria of perhaps the size of the business. It is clear that these amendments, which unfortunately the Democrats support, add a factor to this. The Democrats also want to include the degree to which the absence of dedicated human resource management professionals impacted on procedures followed in effecting a termination. We oppose this. With respect, Senator Murray, we do not believe that ignorance is an excuse. We think there is a pretty clear indication of that principle generally at law. Even with what you propose here, clearly there still will not be a fair go all round. The worker, in effect, is still wearing the cost of the employer's ignorance.</para></talk.start><para>Procedural fairness and natural justice are fairly fundamental human rights, harking back to Senator Murray's speech at the second reading stage of the bill. Employment is a fairly important legal and contractual relationship and deserves the application of these principles to it. We ask: to what other contractual or statutory duty would a government even contemplate applying a similar standard? I do not think it is okay to say that you do not have to pay tax because you do not have an accountant. Natural justice and procedural fairness are not difficult principles. If we start giving people excuses for not applying them, they only start taking them. I think this is a bad proposal in both the government's and the Democrats' form and, therefore, we will not support the amendment. </para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>25825</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I refer to items 25, 27 and 46 of the bill.

The amendments would not allow dismissals that are unfair to be passed off as terminations for operational reasons if the facts show otherwise. However, where an employer establishes that decisions to terminate employment are based solely on the ground of operational requirements, that employer should not have those decisions exposed to review through the unfair dismissal process. However, where a termination decision is based on operational requirements, an employee will retain the right to seek a remedy if he or she was selected for redundancy on discriminatory grounds.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sue (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Knowles)</inline>—The question is that items 25, 27 and 46 stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the negative.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>25825</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Amendment (17) on sheet 2000 refers to government amendments of items 28 and 29.

I think it is perfectly proper, obviously, for people to pay for whatever the advice is.

Regardless of what sort of employment you are talking about, you are dealing with people's lives, so clearly people need representation, and some people will obviously feel a lot happier having a lawyer present. I am sure that Senator Ludwig, who is sitting immediately behind Senator Collins, would think that lawyers could and should be involved in these proceedings on occasion. I do not want to encourage Senator Ludwig to speak, but I am sure that lawyers have a place in these situations. Where there are costs, clearly it is appropriate that the commission be able to make an award of costs. I think the Democrats' amendment is quite reasonable, particularly to the extent that you do need a reasonable deterrent in relation to cases being instituted without reasonable cause.

The reason I rise to speak on this is to highlight one of the problems I believe are endemic in the family law legislation. We only have to go to part A applications, which is what is purported to be a revision process within that act, to find that they are without precedent knocked out, based on the fact that there is no indication that allows an application that was incorrect to be corrected. So we have a parallel situation in the Family Law Act where the section could be clearly defined as the Democrats are clearly defining this one by adding the words `unless the second application corrects an error in the previous application'. The point I am making is that, if a similar amendment had been moved to the Family Law Act, it would have assisted an enormous number of applicants who for some reason or other had made an error in their application. I believe it has merit in this application, and I indicate that Pauline Hanson's One Nation will support the Democrat amendment. </para></talk.start><para>Amendment agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>25830</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move amendments (26) and (27) on sheet 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(26)	Schedule 1, item 40, page 17 (line 26), after “applicant”, insert “or a respondent”.</para><para> (27)	Schedule 1, item 40, page 18 (line 2), after “applicant”, insert “or a respondent”.</para></quote><para>These amendments refer to schedule 1, item 40 of the bill.

Whilst the one amendment that sat within the contingency fee arrangements did not quite deal directly with those issues, these matters do deal quite directly with the government's agenda on unmeritorious and speculative proceedings, although I think this was probably one of the areas where you indicated your thoughts some time ago. All of these amendments, if I am correct, as we go through to the remainder of the bill—or perhaps, from our view of its worth, I should refer to the entrails of the guts of the bill—deal with unmeritorious and speculative proceedings, penalties for advisers and who can make such applications. In our view, the government want to punish worker advocates for encouraging what are in their view unmeritorious or speculative claims by allowing costs to be awarded against them. The Democrat amendments here will extend this regime to apply to employer advocates.</para></talk.start><para>On this point, I want to refer to the submission of the ACTU to the inquiry into this bill, which puts the argument against the government's proposals, I believe, fairly well. For the record, Senator Campbell, you are probably aware that I am not a lawyer, so it is an argument with which I am dealing with some element of distance. The ACTU's submission indicates that the Industrial Relations Commission already has the power to issue costs orders against parties who make applications without reasonable cause and/or act unreasonably in connection with the proceedings. The commission has proved itself prepared to make these orders in roughly equal numbers against applicants and respondents, so the power already exists to some extent.</para><para>The proposal for fines for representatives who encourage unmeritorious or speculative proceedings, with the onus on the representative to prove that this does not occur once a prima facie case has been made out, is an outrageous interference in the relationship between representatives, whether they be lawyers, union officials or other persons, and their clients or members. In no other court or tribunal do advisers face the threat of fines for giving advice, nor are they required to make an independent assessment of the facts of the case other than the instructions received from their client. The proposal can have no other intention than to discourage lawyers and union officials from assisting applicants in proceedings related to alleged unfair dismissals. </para><para>The ACTU submitted that the considerations raised by the Law Council of Australia in its submission should lead the committee to recommend that this proposal not be passed by the Senate. We draw on these issues which, in summary in the ACTU submission, are that, while a case may not appear winnable on law as it currently stands, law is a process of continual development and there should not be a prohibition on suggesting new interpretations to tribunals. Where a client is advised that a case should not proceed but the client wishes to do so, there are costs orders available for vexatious or unreasonable claims. There will be situations where advisers are forced to disclose what ought to be confidential communications with clients, whether or not these are subject to the law of legal professional privilege, and there is no evidence that unmeritorious claims are made in spite of the availability of costs orders against applicants.</para><para>I appreciate that Senator Murray in his amendments is attempting to achieve a balance by extending these provisions to respondent advisers. I think, however, that this approach is wrong. An unfair burden is not made fairer by spreading bad policy more evenly. It still makes bad policy. In our view, this is bad policy. In the committee hearing, there was no evidence that the general process of dealing with legal misconduct is not working, and there are also some quite serious constitutional concerns about proceeding down this path.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>25831</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We support the amendments moved by the Australian Democrats.

It is clear from submissions from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to the Senate inquiry—they provided a number of case studies on that but it is also anecdotally the case—that this seems to be a growing practice in Australia, where some advisers and lawyers are basically encouraging people to make claims under the unfair dismissal provisions. It certainly is a problem that small business have brought to the attention of the government on a number of occasions. Recently in the review of the federal unfair dismissal laws, the government noted:</para><quote><para>... the concern of employers and small business about the increasing likelihood of inappropriate or speculative applications arising from legal practitioners operating on a `pay if you win' basis or lawyers or other service providers inappropriately advertising the ease of access to the unfair dismissal process.</para></quote><para>I will also quote from one of the ACCI's case studies that I understand were provided to the Senate committee:</para><quote><para>In one particular instance, the respondent's human resources manager was told by the applicant, three days prior to conciliation, that he wished to withdraw his application.

I think she was quoting the ACTU, and so it is quite possible that it is wrong and that she has been misled. Senator Collins is wrong when she says— and I think she was quoting the ACTU—that the AIRC can make costs orders. The fact is that it cannot make costs orders against third parties. The AIRC has called for the review of the costs provisions so it can have that power. It should also be made clear that it is not constitutional to give that power to the AIRC, so the bill proposes to give that power to the Federal Court. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>25832</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Perhaps I should clarify a couple of things from the basis of what Senator Campbell said. No, I was not seeking to indicate that the commission could apply costs orders to third parties. I do not think it is appropriate that that occur. The examples that Senator Campbell referred to were very interesting in the committee consideration, because—as I am sure the department representatives here will recall—on questioning about some of those examples and how the victims of such conduct had pursued resolution to matters, we discovered that essentially nothing had been done. There was no example of, for instance, a matter being taken to the Law Council and no action or appropriate redress being applied. It seemed that we had before the committee from organisations—principally ACCI, I think—a list of grievances on which the employers had taken no action. I think that to take such a significant step in our Westminster legal system, a step quite inconsistent with what applies in any other jurisdictions, on a matter that may not be constitutional needs more than just ACCI's complaints, to which they cannot indicate that they have sought redress through the appropriate channels and had no success. The case might have had some merit to us if the government had been able to indicate some examples where redress had been sought and no success had been achieved, but if I am correct in my recollections I cannot think of one case to which that process could be fully applied.</para></talk.start><para>Amendments agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>25832</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Democrat amendment (28) on sheet No. 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(28)	Schedule 1, item 40, page 18 (after line 18), at the end of section 170HE, add:</para><para>	(2)	An adviser must not encourage an employer to continue to oppose an unfair termination application if, on the facts that have been disclosed or that ought reasonably to have been apparent to the adviser, the adviser should have been, or should have become, aware that there was no reasonable prospect of the respondent defending the action.</para></quote><para>This merely has the effect of adding respondents to applicants.</para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>25832</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Democrat amendment (29) on sheet No. 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(29)	Schedule 1, item 40, page 18 (line 26), at the end of subsection (2), add:</para><para>	; or (d)	the Registrar; or</para><para>	(e)	an organisation of employees or employers that represented a party in proceedings at first instance in respect of the unfair termination application.</para></quote><para>This amendment refers to the applications to court as well.

In fact, the bill adopts a number of amendments which were put forward by the opposition on 13 March 2000—over a year ago—in the form of a private member's bill introduced by Mr Duncan Kerr, the shadow minister for justice. At that time, the government could not bring itself to endorse opposition legislation, even though it knew that the legislation was both necessary and appropriate. It is a shame that we now have to revisit this legislation some 12 months later: there has been a 12-month delay in putting into place these reforms.</para></talk.start><para>On this basis, the opposition support the thrust of the bill in seeking to improve the National Crime Authority's efficiency and effectiveness. In particular, we accept the need to amend the National Crime Authority Act so as to remove the defence of reasonable excuse, to remove the derivative use of immunity and to increase penalties. However, the opposition are acutely aware that there is a fine balance to be struck between giving law enforcement agencies effective investigative tools and protecting the rights of individuals. This bill, we believe, goes too far in a number of provisions, and the opposition will not be supporting those. We also think that the overview provisions are not sufficient, and we will be moving amendments to strengthen the oversight and accountability of the National Crime Authority—indeed, the oversight and accountability of Commonwealth law enforcement as a whole. I will come to the detail of those provisions later. </para><para>It is becoming almost a matter of notorious information to those people advising potential witnesses who could come before an NCA hearing that witnesses can effectively avoid the consequences of compelled testimony by using one of two routes: making a frivolous claim for immunity on the basis that an answer might incriminate them or simply refusing to answer such a question at all, knowing that the penalties, if any, that will be imposed when the matter is prosecuted are on the very minor part of the scale of criminal responsibility.</para><para>This has become an almost unsurmountable impediment to the NCA, which is tasked with investigating serious and organised crime. The bill addresses this problem by removing the defence of reasonable excuse, removing the derivative use immunity and increasing the penalties for refusal to answer. In the view of the shadow minister, this is the way to go. At the moment, witnesses at NCA hearings are able to refuse to give evidence if they have a reasonable excuse. If a witness refuses to answer questions on this ground, the only way that the NCA is able to pursue the evidence is to obtain a court order requiring the witness to give the answer. In practice, this is time consuming and a costly process which is rarely pursued by the NCA. As a result, quite often witnesses are exculpated and avoid the obligation to answer reasonable questions by refusing to answer questions at all.</para><para>There have been parliamentary inquiries on the bill. During the joint parliamentary committee hearing on the bill, the ex-chair of the NCA cited a case where a witness before the NCA refused to confirm a family relationship on the grounds that to do so would be self-incriminating. The NCA then had to test whether or not this was a reasonable excuse not to answer a question in the Federal Court. This bill removes the ability of witnesses to refuse to answer a question based on a defence of reasonable excuse. The defence of reasonable excuse will be removed and replaced with the defences set out under the Criminal Code. We will be supporting this direction.</para><para>In respect of selfincrimination, currently a witness before the NCA who raises a reasonable claim that the answer to a question or the production of a document may tend to incriminate him or her is entitled to refuse to answer the question or produce the document or thing unless he or she receives an undertaking from the appropriate DPP that the answer, document or thing, or anything derived from them, will not be used in evidence against the person in any later proceedings. The bill removes derivative use immunity. Immunity was an issue that was negotiated on hard at the time this legislation first appeared in the parliament when the National Crime Authority was set up. Under the amendments in the bill, a witness who raises a claim of selfincrimination will be required to answer the question or present the document, and it will be an offence if he or she fails to do so. The evidence then given will not be admissible in any future proceedings—without the need for the DPP to give such an undertaking. However, evidence derived from the evidence given can be used. So this legislation will bring the NCA legislation and powers into line with ASIC, the ACCC and the New South Wales Crime Commission. There will be increased penalties for refusal to answer, and they are supported.</para><para>This bill also proposes to extend to state and territory magistrates the authority to issue search warrants sought by NCA members and certain staff members under sections 22 and 23 of the NCA Act. These provisions currently apply only to judges of the Federal Court and state and territory judges. At the time when the NCA was set up this was something that would never have got through the parliament. It is getting through now after some 15 years or so of experience of the operation of the National Crime Authority. The opposition's position is that it is not appropriate that state and territory magistrates have the authority to grant warrants for NCA activities. We will move an amendment which will limit the extension to federal magistrates only. If the government will not accept this amendment, the opposition will support the amendment that we believe will be moved by the Democrats which will oppose the extension to all magistrates.</para><para>The proposed extension of the NCA's contempt regime has been the subject of adverse comment in several submissions and extensive discussion at the committee's public hearing. Even the majority report of the committee commendably expressed reticence about this proposal. Unfortunately, government members then took the soft option of agreeing to its implementation for a trial period of five years. In this respect, we share the concerns which have been expressed by people such as the Attorney-General of South Australia, Trevor Griffin, and the former NCA chair, Mr John Broome. Their arguments were essentially twofold: firstly, that as a matter of general principle it is inappropriate to seek to liken an investigatory body such as the NCA to a court and, secondly, that the contempt provisions are unnecessary if the proposals contained in the bill in relation to removing the `reasonable excuse' concept and the substantial increases in penalties are enacted. </para><para>Let us make it clear that the NCA is not a judicial body; it is an investigative agency of the federal executive. In our view it is therefore a seriously flawed breach of the separation of powers concept to imply that hindering or obstructing an investigatory body can be equated to contempt of court. On these grounds we reject the inclusion of a contempt regime for the NCA. We believe that it would be prudent to monitor the success of the other provisions, and if the need is still there in, say, five years time then the parliament can revisit the matter.</para><para>There are also provisions in respect of Australian Public Service employees. The bill proposes new subsections 47(3) and (4) to the NCA Act, giving the chairperson the power to employ persons outside of the Public Service Act. The NCA's justification for seeking these additional powers is that it perceives a need for more flexibility than the act provides. We do not have any quarrel with the need for flexible employment provisions, but they already exist in the National Crime Authority's current legislation and in the Public Service regulations.</para><para>We believe much weight should be given to the opinion of Mr John Broome, who was NCA chair for a period of four years from 1995 to 1999. He told the NCA committee that the reasons advanced in the second reading speech for these proposals were `clearly spurious'. He stressed that he had regularly faced uncertainty about the NCA's budgetary situation but that he was always able to achieve the necessary degree of staffing flexibility within the NCA chairperson's existing statutory powers. The opposition do not believe that the expanded employment powers provided for in the bill are either necessary or desirable. We will move amendments to oppose them.</para><para>I mentioned earlier the need for oversight. The flip side of giving our law enforcement agencies effective tools is ensuring that these tools are used appropriately. At the moment there is no independent overview of the NCA, and the question can fairly be asked: who is policing the police? This is by no means intended to reflect on the integrity of the authority or to suggest that corruption within the authority exists. However, history has shown that it is enormously naive to leave police or investigative organisations to supervise themselves.</para><para>In this respect, we have been working with the government to achieve some sort of compromise in the role of the Ombudsman. The government proposes to amend proposed section 9(3)(e) to remove the last two grounds for denying the Ombudsman access to information. After negotiation, the opposition have agreed that we will support a modified version of this amendment which will provide that the Attorney-General may certify that the Ombudsman may be denied access to NCA information if such actions may endanger the life of a person or create a risk of serious injury to a person. That would be allowable.</para><para>In conclusion, this bill contains a number of provisions which are necessary in order to ensure that the NCA has the capacity to investigate serious organised crime. Labor have always supported the need for and the role of the NCA—in fact, it was Labor that set up the National Crime Authority—and we will continue to do so. However, in the realm of law enforcement there is always a balance to be struck between law enforcement powers, accountability and civil liberties. We believe that the position we are taking with respect to this legislation strikes that balance, and we urge the Senate to accept the amendments that I will be moving in the committee stage. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>25836</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am privileged to be a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority.

In summary, Ms Norberry has said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The National Crime Authority ... describes itself as being conceived as `part royal commission, part police force.' The Australian Law Reform Commission describes it in the following way:</para></quote><para>The NCA is a national law enforcement body whose main role is to counteract organised crime often by working in partnership with other agencies. The NCA's working definition of organised crime is `a systematic conspiracy to commit serious offences.' Generally, the NCA investigates relevant criminal activities and collects, analyses and disseminates information and intelligence relating to those activities. Where appropriate it establishes and co-ordinates task forces with other law enforcement bodies for the investigation of those matters. It may also make recommendations for legal and administrative reforms.</para><para>The NCA uses multi-disciplinary teams of lawyers, police, financial investigators, intelligence analysts and support staff to investigate organised crime. The Act gives the NCA coercive powers to compel people to produce documents and to give sworn evidence. Those powers are not available to traditional police services. The NCA can only exercise its coercive powers in matters which have been formally referred to it for investigation. These characteristics are meant to enable the NCA to co-ordinate national investigations against major organised crime by complementing the efforts of other law enforcement agencies and by working co-operatively with them.</para><quote><para>Section 7 of the Principal Act provides that the Authority consists of a Chairperson and members who are appointed by the Governor-General. The Chairperson must be a judge or a legal practitioner who has been enrolled to practise for at least five years.</para><para>The Principal Act enables the Authority to investigate `relevant criminal activity' an expression which is in turn linked to the concept of a `relevant offence' against Commonwealth, State or Territory law. The term, `relevant offence' is defined as an offence involving two or more persons in substantial planning and organisation using sophisticated techniques. Further, it must involve an offence such as theft, fraud, tax evasion or illegal drug dealing which is punishable by imprisonment for at least three years. This definition attempts to confine the Authority to the investigation of organised criminal activity.</para><para>According to the Authority's <inline font-style="italic">Annual Report 1999-200</inline>0, the most commonly investigated offences include drug importation, cultivation, manufacture and trafficking and associated money laundering, theft, fraud, tax evasion, bribery, extortion and violence.</para><para>Under the Principal Act, the Authority has two types of functions. General functions are set out in subsection 11(1) and can be exercised on the Authority's own initiative. They include collecting, analysing and disseminating criminal information and intelligence, investigating matters of its own choosing, making arrangements for the establishment of task forces and co-ordinating their work. The Authority's coercive powers cannot be exercised in relation to its general functions.</para><para>Subsection 11(2) confers special functions on the Authority enabling it to investigate matters relating to `federally relevant criminal activity' referred to it either by the Commonwealth Minister or the relevant State or Territory Minister or Ministers. These investigations are often called special investigations. Before referring a matter to the Authority the Commonwealth Minister must consult with the Inter-Governmental Committee. The Inter-Governmental Committee consists of the Commonwealth Minister and a Minister from each of the States and Territories. A State or Territory Minister must obtain the approval of the Inter-Governmental Committee before referring a matter to the Authority. Once a matter has been referred to the Authority either by the Commonwealth Minister or a State Minister the Authority can investigate that matter using its special coercive powers. These powers include `hearings, including compulsory appearances and production of documents, imposition of penalties and warrants for search and seizure, for arrest and for interception of communications'. </para><para>Accountability mechanisms were inserted into the Principal Act because of concerns about the powers of the Authority. These mechanisms include the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority (PJC) which is established under section 53 of the Principal Act. Among other things, the Committee monitors and reviews the performance of the Authority.</para><para>Following the passage of the Principal Act and the <inline font-style="italic">National Crime Authority (Consequential Amendments) Act 1984</inline>, the States and Territories passed mirror legislation enabling the Authority to investigate offences against State and Territory laws. The Principal Act has been recently amended on a number of occasions to clarify its framework for inter-jurisdictional cooperation and respond to the High Court's decisions in <inline font-style="italic">Re Wakim </inline>and <inline font-style="italic">R v. Hughe</inline>s.</para></quote><para>That is the basic context in which we find the amendment bill before us today. The bill is offering a number of changes to the current powers of the National Crime Authority. We are supportive of the work of the NCA in combating organised crime and accept that it is a unique law enforcement body confronting a difficult task. It has a number of powers, such as I have outlined, that are not normally available to law enforcement bodies. It can, for example, compel people to produce documents and to give sworn evidence. This bill proposes to further expand the powers of the NCA and, while we Democrats are supportive of efforts to combat crime, we are wary, we are cautious, of conferring excessive powers on any law enforcement body.</para><para>The crucial issue is to ensure that there is a balance struck between the imperatives of dealing with serious criminality on the one hand and protecting basic standards of accountability and civil liberties on the other. While aspects of this bill are appropriate, we do have an ongoing concern about a number of the proposals that it contains. In particular, we oppose the proposals to expand the category of people who may issue search warrants. We are also concerned about the new contempt regime and the selfincrimination provisions contained in the bill. We note that these provisions attracted criticism during the committee inquiry into this bill and, in our view, these criticisms are reasonable and well founded. I want to pursue those issues in greater detail in the committee stage and I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments to address some of those Democrat concerns.</para><para>The government has circulated a range of amendments, some of which offer a compromise in relation to differing views held by the parties in this chamber. Others simply relate to technical drafting matters. We are supportive of a number of government amendments but in some cases feel that they do not adequately deal with the problems raised by the bill. The opposition will be moving several amendments to address a range of matters considered by the committee examining this bill. The ALP amendments reflect a number of concerns shared by the ALP and the Democrats, and I foreshadow Democrat support for some of those amendments. Greater detail can be found in the minority report to the committee inquiry, which the Democrats were in large agreement with Labor on. However, we had one additional comment, and I will speak to that further when we get to the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>25837</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I propose to speak briefly on this important legislation which will greatly strengthen and refine the powers of the NCA. More importantly, it will enable it to more effectively reflect the changing nature of organised crime. Our committee unanimously endorsed the thrust of our government's legislation, and it was acknowledged that these reforms are greatly needed. The <inline ref="S288">National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 [2001] </inline>will reduce the opportunity for individuals to manipulate, frustrate and obstruct NCA investigations. One of the most obvious deficiencies is the low rate of penalties for people who obstruct the NCA's process of investigation. This bill will substantially increase the penalty for refusing to answer a question at a hearing from six months imprisonment and a $1,100 fine to five years imprisonment and a $20,000 fine. This is a long overdue reform, and I am glad we are now so close to seeing it become law. This bill will also help the NCA deal with those seeking to obstruct its investigations by creating a legal contempt regime to enable the NCA to go straight to the Supreme Court of the state or territory in which it is holding its hearing and apply to have the suspect's conduct treated as if it were a contempt of that court.  </para></talk.start><para>To further reduce the opportunity for long and costly legal challenges, the bill ensures that this contempt regime will be exempt from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. NCA agents will now also be able to use the self-incriminatory evidence of a person to find other evidence that verifies the admission already made. So, while evidence from their selfincrimination will not be used directly against them, it will be used to assist the NCA to find other evidence against the suspect. As Senator Ellison said this morning in his press conference, at which he released the NCA's commentary, detailing emerging threats, possible responses and achievements in a range of key organised crime activities, including illicit drug trafficking, people smuggling, fraud and tax evasion and money laundering, this government is doing all it can to ensure that criminals are brought to justice.</para><para>Another advantage that the NCA will gain from this legislation is that the often erroneous defence of `reasonable excuse'—for conduct such as refusing to answer a question—will at last be removed. In its place will be more clearly defined Criminal Code defences, such as a sudden emergency or an intervening event. If the NCA believes that a suspect does not have a reasonable excuse, this legislative amendment will prevent that person under investigation from challenging the NCA's decision and authority in the Federal Court.</para><para>The introduction of staff positions known as `hearing officers' will be another important reform. These people will be appointed by the federal government on the unanimous recommendation of the Intergovernmental Committee of the National Crime Authority. Hearing officers will be able to undertake hearings on behalf of the NCA and, while their numbers will rise, there will be no change to the number of `members'. This will greatly expand and strengthen the NCA's capacity to carry out a greater number of investigations. Other changes include extending the terms of NCA members from four to six years to allow greater continuity and expanding the class of persons who may issue search warrants to include magistrates. </para><para>The committee inquiry heard very convincing evidence in support of the NCA from crime fighting agencies such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission, both of which are operating in a highly effective way. </para><para>Finally, this legislation will deem the NCA to be a prescribed authority for the purposes of the Ombudsman Act to enable the Commonwealth Ombudsman to deal with complaints made against the agency. This will ensure that a greater level of accountability is introduced to complement the strengthening of the National Crime Authority's powers. This legislation will help enormously to equip the NCA with the greater power and accountability it needs to fight increasingly more complex and sophisticated forms of organised crime. Members of the committee have been very concerned that, no matter how quickly the NCA and its colleague bodies in the states are able to deal with organised crime, organised crime seems able to always stay a couple of steps ahead. The NCA has already proven its effectiveness in fighting the drug war, amongst other things, and I hope the additional powers it acquires as a result of the passing of this bill will assist it even further in continuing its commendable work.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"> (Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>25838</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thought I might take the opportunity to pass a few comments on the <inline ref="R1228">National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline> whilst my colleagues come to the chamber. I want to address, at short notice, some of the legal issues raised in the bill. These issues go to reasonable excuse, self-incrimination, increased penalties for refusal to answer, people who may issue warrants, the contempt regime sought to be amended in the bill, the fact that the NCA has non-Australian Public Service employees, and some oversight by the Ombudsman, which is an emerging issue in this debate.</para></talk.start><para>By way of introduction, I point out that the bill presents a number of changes to the NCA Act which will significantly increase the ability of the NCA to conduct investigations into serious and organised crime. In fact, the bill adopts a number of amendments which were put forward by the opposition on 13 March last year in the form of a private member's bill introduced by the then spokesperson, Mr Duncan Kerr, the shadow minister for justice. At that time, the government could not bring itself to endorse opposition legislation, even though it was both necessary and appropriate, as we repeatedly pointed out in the committee stage, in press releases and in public discussions arising from those developments.  </para><para>It is fair to say that it is a shame because it is now more than 12 months later that these reforms will be put into place. On that basis, I am pleased to advise that the opposition supports the thrust of the bill in seeking to improve the NCA's efficiency and effectiveness—worthy objectives, indeed. In particular, we accept the need to amend the NCA Act so as to remove the defence of `reasonable excuse' and the `derivative use immunity' and to increase penalties in this area. However, as always, the opposition is acutely aware that there is a fine balance to be struck between giving law enforcement agencies effective investigation tools and protecting the rights of individuals. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>25839</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not think I will be able to meet the standards just set by Senator Bishop, but I shall endeavour to do so. The <inline ref="R1228">National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline> makes very substantial changes to the National Crime Authority Act 1984. Prior to the National Crime Authority Act there was another act which set off a history, if you like, of law enforcement in this area. The National Crime Authority Act set up an authority which was intended to deal with major crime. It is in that context that this legislation might be looked at. It is said that the National Crime Authority does not look at crime that we would call street crime or minor crime, such as breaking and entering. I do not suggest for one minute that breaking and entering is not a serious crime, but it is not the sort of crime that the National Crime Authority is looking for. The NCA is looking for big drug crimes brought about by syndicates or for big commercial fraud—crime behind which there has to be some organisation in the sense that somebody has to plan it—and then it tries to do something about it. </para></talk.start><para>Because of the nature of the crime involved, this legislation gives law enforcement authorities some exceptional powers. Those exceptional powers are given on the basis that they are directed to the sort of crime I have just been talking about. In other words, the sort of person whom an investigator with the National Crime Authority is going to meet is going to be a person of some intelligence, with an ability to organise and to keep close to himself or herself evidence that might otherwise lead to a conviction of that person. It is now said that the act is not sufficient; that legislation has to be introduced to make the powers given under the National Crime Authority Act even more extensive than they presently are. </para><para>The power given by the National Crime Authority Act that causes most concern is the power to question people. The investigation of crime depends upon the ability of the authority to question people who are accused of crime. But that itself brings problems, because you have an authority that has, if you like, a different ability to ask questions than, say, a policeman. A policeman cannot force a person to answer a question. He can invite the person to answer a question. He can take the person into custody on the suspicion that the person has committed a crime and question him for hours, but he cannot force that person to answer a question. The National Crime Authority can in certain circumstances do that. </para><para>The problem with that is that the balance of power between the person who is asking the question and the person who is answering the question is stark. The person who has to do the answering is in jeopardy of not being able to do for himself or herself justice to the case that he or she wants to put. So that is the first worry about a questioning regime. The questioning regime set up by the National Crime Authority Act can be quite severe. It has been alleged over the years to have been severe, and some notable cases have been fought about that issue.  </para><para>The issues that are central to this legislation are pointed out by the amendments that the government wants to bring to the bill. I want to look in that context at amendment (2) of the amendments that are being suggested to the legislation before us. It sets up a person or a body to examine how this act is to work five years from now. It says: </para><quote><para>The Minister must cause a person (the <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">responsible person</inline>) to review, and to report in writing about, the operation of the <inline font-style="italic">National Crime Authority Act</inline> 1984 as affected by the following provisions of this Act: </para></quote><para>Then it goes on to describe the sorts of things that must be reviewed. The review and report must include an assessment of the effect of the following provisions in facilitating the performance of the functions of the authority: the provision that removes the defence of reasonable excuse; the provision that removes the derivative-use immunity; the provisions that increase the penalties for non-compliance, the contempt provisions and so on. They are all provisions to be put into this act, if this legislation is passed, which will enable the authority to ask questions regardless of whether a person says that he has a reasonable excuse not to answer. So it is legislation that takes this idea of questioning much further than it has been taken hitherto. As the act now stands, if a person feels that he or she has a reasonable excuse not to answer, or there is some legal reason why that person feels that he or she has been badly treated, they can go off to the court in certain circumstances.</para><para>The basis upon which people are to go off to the court is to be much limited by this provision. This is an example of where the courts are to be again denied a jurisdiction that they presently have. This is another piece of legislation in which there is an attempt to reduce even further the jurisdiction of the courts. It has also been reduced in the migration area. In this context I will quote a passage from Sir Winston Churchill who made a statement in a debate in the House of Commons.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator Hutchins</name></talker><para>—A no-good conservative.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—It is said that he was a no-good conservative.

He said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The British Judiciary, with its traditions and record, is one of the greatest living assets of our race and people and the independence of the Judiciary is a part of our message to the ever-growing world which is rising so swiftly around us.</para></quote><para>He then talked about the need for a judiciary that can do justice between the state and the individual. This piece of legislation seeks to modify that position even more than it is presently modified. To be fair to the government, I think that they see the problems that the legislation is going to present and are setting up this review, which is to take place five years from now, to see how the various amendments will operate. It is proper to have a debate about these issues now because I think that once they are in place it will be very hard to undo them. Once these amendments are set into legislation it is going to be very hard to take away the powers later.</para><para>Returning to what I was saying about questioning people, there are two things to be said. Firstly, if you are going to question a person you have to be sure that the question is fair in the sense that the person is able to do justice to himself or herself. Secondly, there are some procedures which are just so bad that you would not use them, whether the person can do justice to himself or not. I might add that a lot of good work has been done on this legislation. I see two people from the Attorney-General's Department present in the chamber. They have worked long and hard on this. It is proper in debates on legislation such as this to pay tribute to the public servants that do such work for the country. Not only that, they also have to withstand some fairly vigorous attacks— proper vigorous attacks—by members of this parliament who test them on the legislation they bring forward. I thank the gentlemen sitting in the box to the left of Minister Abetz—Mr Karl Alderson and Mr Geoff McDonald—for the help that they have given over the course of this legislation coming before the parliament. </para><para>The other problem in the area of increasing powers—when increasing powers are given to authorities—is that there is very much a law and order campaign going on around Australia at the moment. This campaign is occurring for several reasons. Politicians always have to be very careful of the law and order campaigns. These campaigns tend to get people excited and they perhaps vote in a particular way. The media get people interested, tempers start to rise and that encourages things. We have to be very careful in that context that we do justice to the people who become subject to a law and order campaign.</para><para>Perhaps a good illustration of that at the moment is Christopher Skase. He conducted himself in a way that has brought opprobrium upon him, but he is now dead. I was brought up with the old-fashioned idea that, if you cannot say something good of the dead, say nothing. That does not seem to be the situation here. There has to be some dimension to society where people, if they do not forgive, at least do not remember with such harshness as they once did. We all have to go to our deaths and it is hoped that, when we do so, we will not be pursued forever.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator Hutchins</name></talker><para>—Go to confession.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—I would very much recommend that, Senator. The point I want to make is that this legislation must be looked at with a calm mind, a mind that assesses what is needed and what is not needed. It must be assessed in the context of our being a civil society, where we do not let authorities—and I used that word advisedly—use methods that are not civilised. We, of course, as a civil society want crime suppressed, because people should not be able to go around and arbitrarily damage this society. We should not have people who sell drugs on a vast scale when it is against the law. We should not have people perverting, in effect, the corporate world by doing all sorts of things within that corporate world that should not be done. We should not have corruption in public places. All these sorts of things happen and they should be eradicated. That is the balance we are forever seeking in debates such as this—the balance between what is reasonable and what is not reasonable.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We cannot as a civil society use the same sorts of methods that criminals use. Criminals attack the weak, hide their actions so as to obtain results and are oftentimes motivated by greed and ambition, et cetera. They do all sorts of things that we do not like which are destructive to society. But we cannot use those same methods to bring them to task and we cannot use them in ways that go against the dignity of people, because if we are in the sort of society we hope we are in we have to respect the dignity of everyone. We have to bring to task those who have transgressed our laws in a big way but we have got to do that in a way whereby we can, at the end of the day, say, `We've done this in a proper and right fashion.' I think some very interesting discussions will take place in this area during the committee stage, and I am looking forward to that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>25841</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="S288">National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 [2001]</inline>, which is the government's version of Labor's <inline ref="R1021">National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 2000</inline> introduced in the House as a private member's bill in March last year by the Hon. Duncan Kerr. As my colleagues have already outlined, Labor support the thrust of this bill and readily endorse the majority of the changes the bill will make to the National Crime Authority Act. We support the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the National Crime Authority. To that end, we support the measures in this bill that will remove the defence of reasonable excuse, remove the derivative use immunity and increase penalties. Again, as my colleagues have already indicated, Labor will not be supporting provisions in the bill that would appear to breach the separation of powers, or those that allow the NCA to employ persons outside the provisions of the Public Service Act. </para></talk.start><para>As I have already indicated, this bill directly adopts a number of provisions that Labor's shadow minister for justice and customs, the Hon. Duncan Kerr, introduced by way of a private member's bill in the House last year. The National Crime Authority Amendment Bill would have, exactly like this bill before us today, amended the National Crime Authority Act to remove the defence of reasonable excuse, to remove the derivative use immunity and to increase penalties. This is not the first time this government have engaged in this sort of policy stealing trickery. It is not the first time that they have run out of ideas, looked for inspiration or simply lost the initiative and looked through the pages and pages of Labor's policy that have been posted on our web site, picked out one they liked and introduced it as a bill.</para><para>Apart from this policy, which is now well over a year old for Labor, the government has also recently adopted our scheme for the civil confiscation of assets that are the proceeds of crime. Under this plan, which was again put to the House last year by Duncan Kerr in the form of a private member's bill, allowance would be made for the confiscation of assets on the grounds that, on the balance of probabilities, they are the proceeds of crime. This bill would target those who profit from crime, such as the so-called drug lords, and attack organised crime by striking at the heart of what drives the international criminal industry—that is, the massive financial rewards that can be reaped from illegal activity. Sadly, though, the government rejected Labor's <inline ref="R1020">Criminal Assets Recovery Bill 2000.</inline> But then what did we see almost a year later in February this year when Kim Beazley introduced his 10-point plan to tackle Australia's drug problem? We saw Minister Ellison, in an attempt to deflect attention from Labor's drugs policy, announce that he would take a proposal to cabinet for a civil confiscation scheme. Then, on 20 April this year, Minister Ellison announced that cabinet had approved our proposal for a civil confiscation scheme, although I must say that we are yet to see the legislation before the chamber.</para><para>We have also recently seen the government do tremendous backflips and adopt a series of Labor policies and plans on petrol and beer excise and the business activity statement. Under this government, it is a pretty safe bet that, if a member from the Labor Party introduces a private member's bill, or if a Labor shadow minister announces a plan or a new policy, you will inevitably see it pop up again a year later as a government bill in this chamber. After a year of the government neglecting this important issue, the provisions of this bill finally introduce into law a series of necessary reforms to the way the National Crime Authority operates in its vital task of combating organised crime.</para><para>This bill seeks, firstly, to remove the ground of defence of reasonable excuse used by witnesses refusing to answer questions or produce documents in a hearing. This rule can waste the NCA's time and resources, as the NCA is required to obtain a Federal Court order requiring the witness to give an answer when a defence of reasonable excuse is used. The bill replaces the reasonable excuse rule with a series of specific reasonable defence excuses contained within the Criminal Code.</para><para>Witnesses have also been able to frustrate investigations by refusing to answer questions or produce a document, on the grounds of self-incrimination, unless the Director of Public Prosecutions gives an undertaking that the answer given or document produced will not be used in evidence against the person in later proceedings. The bill abolishes this derivative use immunity rule, making it harder for witnesses to frustrate the proceedings of NCA hearings. The bill also substantially increases fines for refusing to answer questions, thus providing a proper deterrent to criminals who frustrate NCA investigations. The bill will also ensure proper accountability of the NCA through the Commonwealth Ombudsman, who will have the right to review complaints about the NCA or its members. </para><para>As my colleagues have already indicated, Labor wholeheartedly endorses and supports these provisions, considering that these provisions have been part of Labor Party policy for over a year now. In some areas, however, the current bill goes further than Labor's original bill. In our opinion, some of the provisions in the current bill go too far and should be opposed.</para><para>In its current form, this bill will enable the NCA to detain persons who interfere with or obstruct a hearing and take them to the Supreme Court to have their conduct dealt with as if it were a contempt of court. Labor will be moving amendments to remove this provision, because we believe it would amount to a serious breach of the separation of powers. Many members of the government, in the conservative tradition of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, have a serious problem getting their head around the constitutionally guaranteed separation of powers. The NCA is not a judicial body. It is an agent of the executive government, and its hearings should not be treated legally like proper judicial hearings.</para><para>Labor will also be moving amendments against provisions in the bill that allow for the NCA to employ persons on a short-term basis outside the requirements of the Public Service Act. These provisions, if implemented, will remove the process of public scrutiny provided for under the Public Service Act and thus create the danger that persons might be employed on the basis of nepotism or favouritism. Apart from these two provisions, which we believe are unnecessary and undesirable, Labor will be supporting this bill.</para><para>According to the National Crime Authority's annual report 1999-2000, the most commonly investigated offences included drug importation, cultivation, manufacture, trafficking and associated money laundering, theft, fraud, tax evasion, bribery, extortion and violence. Following that, a year ago we put up a policy to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of the NCA. That policy is a fundamental tenet of Kim Beazley's overall plan to fight drugs and crime. Senators would know that members of the government have grown very fond of getting up in this and the other chamber and accusing the Labor Party of having no policies. Kim Beazley has, however, released a series of policy initiatives and plans for Australia in the fields of health, education and banking, among others. These policy plans amount to a lot more than John Howard released before the 1996 election and provide to the Australian people a blueprint of what they can expect to happen when Kim Beazley takes the prime ministership later this year. One of the most detailed of these policy initiatives to come from Kim Beazley has been Labor's plan to put forward a national response to crime and drugs in Australia, of which the provisions of this current bill are a part.</para><para>Crime is a huge issue in Australia. It presents a daily threat to our personal and national security. Organised crime at both a national and international level affects our standard of living by threatening the peace and stability of our personal lives and our communities. In terms of the size and extent of organised transnational crime, the United Nations has estimated that organised crime earns $US1.1 trillion per year and that the international drug trade exceeds the value of the international oil trade, which eams about $US500 billion per year.</para><para>In terms of its impact in Australia, the IMF has estimated that international money laundering costs the world $US500 billion, of which Australia would have a significant share. In Australia, over 100,000 people have used heroin. In 1999, 958 people died of heroin overdose. Therefore, a national approach to fighting crime and drugs is urgently needed. As well as providing plans for many of the provisions contained within this bill to strengthen the National Crime Authority, Labor also has, as I have mentioned, detailed plans for a civil confiscation scheme to deny the profiteers of crime access to their assets. We have also released plans for a national coast guard, to improve Australia's coastal security and protect our borders from criminal activity. Kim Beazley has also outlined a program for establishing community safety zones to stop crime at the source and to work with communities to fight crime at the local level, and he has promised to provide the Federal Police with better funding, to put more of them in the field with the community. </para><para>We have also indicated that a Labor government would provide for the national coordination of law enforcement by undertaking a white paper process, similar to the process that is undertaken to determine defence priorities and resources. Labor would also provide national leadership in the fight against drugs by unifying the states and non-government sectors behind a broadly based strategy. The parts of this bill that implement into law the changes proposed last year by Duncan Kerr in his private member's bill are only a small segment of Labor's overall strategy to fight drugs and international crime in Australia. As well as strengthening the NCA, which this bill already does, Labor has, thus, promised to implement a broad strategy against drugs and crime.</para><para>In conclusion, Labor supports the thrust of this bill, on the grounds that what we are seeing before the Senate is a rehashing of good Labor policy. There is a real need to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the NCA, as part of a much needed national approach to the fight against crime and against Australia's drug problem. However, a number of new provisions in this bill are both undesirable and unnecessary, and we will be moving amendments to modify and oppose those provisions. Only Labor will provide this national approach and implement further reforms to fight crime and drugs in Australia. To that end, I support this bill, with amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>25844</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I feel obliged to speak for a very short time on the <inline ref="S288">National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 [2001]</inline> due to the previous speaker's rather biased approach. Like Senator Hutchins and previous speakers, I support this bill. As a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I am well versed in the bill and in the opinions of the Labor members.</para></talk.start><para>As previous speakers have said, the bill implements the full powers that the National Crime Authority needs. For example, it strengthens the fines in regard to not answering questions. The point is that the crime bosses have been able to wheel in their legal representatives and tie up and frustrate so many of the investigations of the National Crime Authority. This is in fact a very legalistic piece of legislation. In a nutshell, that is its purpose. It is a very welcome one, and all on the committee support its thrust. It gives the National Crime Authority the full powers that it needs to investigate in particular the drug trade and organised crime in this country.</para><para>It is significant to know that this body began, established by a Labor government and supported by the parliament, in 1984. It is true to say that at the time it was established with caution, because society is always balancing civil liberties against the legitimate pursuit of organised crime and the illegal drug trade. In 1984 it was probably true to say that the balance was for civil liberties, that in many ways the National Crime Authority was handicapped in its ability to properly investigate organised crime and the drug trade in this country. It was something new in Australia to set up such a single-minded police force, and there were those initial concerns.</para><para>Some 15 years later, I am pleased to be able to say—and I believe it is welcomed by society—that we are now giving the full powers so necessary for such a body to undertake its investigations, powers that are equivalent to the extraordinary powers given to the FBI in America to investigate organised crime. Here, 15 years on, we now have faith in the National Crime Authority, because it has produced. Over those 15 years, it has gained the confidence of society to the point where this parliament is able to give it extra powers to be able to untangle the often legal complications and frustrations visited upon it by the crime bosses and their most expensive lawyers during investigations. That is the nub of this legislation.</para><para>It has always been the case that you have had to balance the civil liberties in society against the legitimate pursuit of organised crime, but those in society who so often defend to the hilt civil liberties must realise that the crime bosses impinge on society's civil liberties by the pushing of their drugs and all the scourge that that brings upon society. As I said, we have reached a point where the National Crime Authority has been successful in being the only real federal body that has been able to pull together the state police authorities, the Customs officers and the Australian Federal Police under one umbrella to investigate organised crime. It has had stunning success in being able to get all those police bodies to cooperate in particular investigations. It has had stunning success in drug busts—heroin busts, cocaine busts—in cooperation, of course, with other authorities. It has had stunning success in being able to get the confidence of the parliament to establish other bodies such as CrimTrac and AUSTRAC that feed into the National Crime Authority's investigations. </para><para>AUSTRAC is another unheralded body that supports our national crime body. AUSTRAC was established with full powers to follow the money trail. Next to surveillance, following the money trail is the most successful way of bringing down these big crime bosses and the drug barons, and there has been enormous success in AUSTRAC being able to follow the money trail all the way through bank accounts, different companies and different Asian or Colombian connections. It is a very centred trail, as much as the hard drug trail itself. This is but one prong of this government's Tough on Drugs approach to be tough on law enforcement. It has had enormous success, as mentioned by the Minister for Justice and Customs yesterday in question time, in drug busts. That has filtered all the way down to the streets.</para><para>I remember that in my state of Victoria the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun </inline>ran a heroin overdose poll, or chart, every day alongside the road toll, and it was phenomenal to think that at one stage a year or two ago there were as many heroin overdoses as there were road deaths. Today, for different reasons—and none less than the drug busts that have been carried out by these enforcement bodies— you can basically count the heroin overdoses on one hand. There has been a phenomenal reduction in this area. They are the successes.</para><para>The previous speaker said that we have pinched some of their policies. To start with, I think this is somewhat of a bipartisan approach. I can tell the previous speaker that Duncan Kerr's private member's bill was far different to the legislation that we have here. In a nutshell, in fact it was far more civil libertarian. He did not actually agree with the tough components of this legislation. He was not willing to go all the way to track those crime bosses down, and that is to be expected—that is Duncan Kerr's politics: to be expected to be respected, but not agreed with. That is what Duncan Kerr's private member's bill has amounted to. In all, it probably is a half measure; in fact, it is a half measure. This is a full measure and it shows the determination of this government to track down those crime bosses, the drug barons, as part of its three-pronged Tough on Drugs approach.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>25845</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank senators for their contributions to this debate on a very important bill dealing with the National Crime Authority. At the outset, I acknowledge the great work done by Peter Nugent, the former member for Aston, who chaired the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. I think all senators here would acknowledge the great work that he did, which was also reflected in the often bipartisan support that he had. I think he carried out his duties in a most dignified and professional manner. I think it is also fair to say that he had a very keen interest in this area, and that was shown by his dedication to the job.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the bill before us and, of course, the comments made by senators, one has to look back to the genesis of the National Crime Authority in 1984 when it was given special powers to investigate organised crime. We needed a national body which could deal with the federal system that we have in Australia, and that is precisely what the National Crime Authority does. Back in 1984, it received across-the-board support. I know that there have been some comments about the special powers that the National Crime Authority has—I think Senator Cooney mentioned that—but, of course, these special powers are there for a very good reason, and that is to assist the National Crime Authority in tackling organised and serious crime in Australia today. </para><para>There were comments by Senator Bolkus and Senator Bishop that we should have endorsed the Kerr bill a year ago, but I would say that there are important measures in this bill which were not put forward in the bill sponsored by the member for Denison. These include the removal of reasonable excuse defences that can be abused, hearing officer provisions to improve the National Crime Authority's flexibility and more detailed provisions to govern oversight by the Ombudsman. The government has also sought in this bill to introduce an important contempt regime to reinforce the National Crime Authority's hearing powers. So we have here a very different bill, a much more strengthened bill, in relation to the NCA fighting organised crime.</para><para>Senator Cooney mentioned that there is always a prospect of law and order campaigns having an undue influence in the passing of this sort of legislation. But I think that when you have had a bill like this looked into by the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority—in fact, I think there were two such inquiries—and it has had this kind of exposure, it has been dealt with in an appropriate manner. In fact, Senator Bolkus said that we should have rushed it through last year, if I understood his comments correctly. The government has given this bill priority, but it is also cognisant of the fact that this is an important piece of legislation dealing with the powers that go to a law enforcement agency and that you have to keep in mind the checks and balances that go with it.</para><para>This government is totally committed to resourcing law enforcement agencies to fight organised and serious crime. Since coming to power, this government has funded the National Crime Authority with an additional $79 million to pursue matters which are of serious concern. Today, we are confronted with such things as money laundering and people smuggling, which were not matters that were previously uppermost in the community's mind, but bodies like the National Crime Authority have to be resourced in relation to that. At the bottom of this, you have the overall problem of the drug situation in Australia. The government, with its Tough on Drugs policy, has demonstrated a clear intent to fight that on the three fronts of law enforcement, education and health.</para><para>In relation to this particular bill, there are some amendments which the government is proposing. I realise that some senators have taken up the opportunity of a briefing on this and I acknowledge their involvement—the Democrats certainly have done that—and I acknowledge the contributions made to this by the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. I think that the comments in relation to the various amendments proposed by the government, opposition and Democrats are best left for the committee stage. Suffice to say that I endorse the comments made by Senator Ferris in relation to increased penalties and accountability and also the comments made by Senator McGauran, who gave a succinct outline of the role of the National Crime Authority and the importance it plays on the national stage. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>25846</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>25846</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill.

The amendment we propose here today seeks to remove the elements of this bill that propose to water down the existing right against self-incrimination of witnesses before the National Crime Authority. </para><para>The historical basis of the existing legal privilege against selfincrimination is the common law's reaction against the use of the ex officio oath by ecclesiastical courts and the Court of Star Chamber and against unjust methods of interrogating accused persons. In 1645 this culminated in a declaration that the use of the oath was unlawful. By the second half of the 17th century, the privilege was well established as common law. In the High Court case of Environment Protection Authority v. Caltex, Chief Justice Mason and Justice Toohey considered the nature of the privilege in great detail. They observed that, historically, the privilege developed to protect individual humans from being compelled to testify, on pain of excommunication or physical punishment, to their own guilt. They went on to say:  </para><quote><para>In one important sense, the modern rationale for the privilege against self-incrimination is substantially the same as the historical justification— protection of the individual from being confronted by the “cruel trilemma” of punishment for refusal to testify, punishment for truthful testimony or perjury (and the consequential possibility of punishment).</para></quote><para>They noted that the privilege is now an internationally recognised human right. As Justice Murphy commented in Rochfort v. Trade Practices Commission:</para><quote><para>The privilege against self-incrimination is a human right, based on the desire to protect personal freedom and human dignity. </para></quote><para>I note that the right not to be compelled to testify against oneself or to confess guilt is also embodied in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The courts take Australia's international human rights obligations into account when making their decisions; so too should we legislators give considerable weight to these obligations in making judgments about the appropriateness of legislation placed before us by the government. At present, witnesses before the NCA have a qualified right against selfincrimination. They may refuse to answer questions if they raise a reasonable possibility of selfincrimination. However, witnesses can be compelled to provide selfincriminatory evidence when they have been given an undertaking that the evidence and anything derived from it will not be used against them. </para><para>The bill proposes to remove derivative use immunity. Essentially, this means that, while selfincriminatory testimony provided by a witness under compulsion is not itself admissible in court, any evidence derived from that testimony would be admissible. We Democrats fear that this has the potential to significantly detract from the right against self-incrimination. In many cases, information or evidence derived from testimony may be as useful in a prosecutorial sense as the testimony itself. Our concerns were echoed in strong submissions to the NCA committee by a number of witnesses, including the Victorian bar, the Law Council of Australia and the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties. </para><para>This Democrat amendment addresses these concerns by removing from the bill the relevant provisions relating to selfincrimination. We have left in place substantially the same procedures as currently exist in relation to selfincrimination. We note that the government has attempted to streamline the existing process. We are quite prepared to support alternative processes so long as the substance of existing rights is not affected. However, in this case the right against selfincrimination is affected in a significant way and, as such, we oppose this change.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>25848</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the second reading debate, I canvassed the issue of the government's new selfincrimination regime and outlined reasons why the opposition was supporting it.

It is based on a procedure that currently operates in the state of Queensland.</para><para>Part 10 of the Queensland Police (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 1997 establishes the position and powers of the Public Interest Monitor. The monitor has a number of functions under the act. Of particular relevance is the requirement that the monitor appear at any hearing of an application to a Supreme Court judge or magistrate for a covert search warrant or surveillance warrant and thereby test the validity of the application by various means. These include, firstly, presenting questions for the applicant to answer; secondly, cross-examining any witness who has sworn an affidavit or given oral evidence in support of the application; and, thirdly, making submissions on the appropriateness of granting the application.</para><para>The monitor's primary role is to represent the public interest where law enforcement agencies seek approval to use search powers and surveillance devices which have the capacity to infringe the rights and civil liberties of citizens. The role is based on the public interest in ensuring that law enforcement agencies meet all the legislative requirements and that their proposed actions do not extend beyond the parameters laid down by parliament. The current process by which warrants are approved is one-sided and unfair. Decisions are made based solely on representations made and evidence presented by the relevant law enforcement agency. The rights, interests and privacy of citizens are deeply affected by these proceedings in which they are not represented. The covert nature of these operations usually precludes direct legal representation of subjects, but it does not mean that their rights and interests cannot be represented by an independent party.</para><para>The design of our legal system reflects the view that justice is best served by proceedings in which all interested parties are represented before an independent arbiter. It concerns the Democrats that there is no procedure by which representations can be made on behalf of prospective subjects of warrants as to the lawfulness of issuing warrants or the soundness of the evidence on which the warrant application is based. The third annual report of the Public Interest Monitor was tabled in the Queensland parliament in November last year. It referred to the establishment of the position of monitor as `a unique and fundamentally significant step forward in the process of accountability of investigative agencies'. In part, it said: </para><quote><para>The recognition which has been accorded by issuers—</para></quote><para>that is, judges—</para><quote><para>to the fundamentally important role of the monitor reflects the potential which the position has for expansion into other aspects of the criminal investigative process where, necessarily, there will be infringement of the public's personal or proprietary rights as a consequence of the imperative of detecting and prosecuting major crime.</para></quote><para>The process of the Public Interest Monitor in Queensland confirms that establishing similar accountability mechanisms for Commonwealth law enforcement bodies would be practical, worth while and cost effective. The number of warrants currently issued is not so great as to require any significant bureaucratic structure. I expect that appointing one or two barristers in each state or territory, appearing as required and remunerated by way of an hourly rate, would enable a monitor to participate in the vast majority of warrant applications. Obviously, where exceptional circumstances require the immediate determination of a warrant application and a monitor is unavailable to participate in the proceedings, it is appropriate that the application proceed, and our amendments provide for that. However, in such cases the monitor will be required to review the case as soon as possible. This proposal is not expensive or resource intensive; it is simply a change to existing procedures that would enhance the integrity of the current process. I commend this amendment to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>25854</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Labor will not be supporting this proposal at this stage, but in saying that we do not reject the proposal outright.

In those circumstances we believe it needs a thorough examination before endorsement by the parliament. We are aware that a public interest monitor exists in Queensland and that in that state it has generally been regarded as a success. It is our view, however, that this is a relatively new initiative and that we should look at how it operates in Queensland. We also note that the concept was discussed and considered by the NCA committee in the Street legal report, which was concerned with controlled operations, and that that committee—quite a relevant committee—did not support the introduction of a public interest monitor. On the one hand we have the Queensland experience and on the other hand we have an NCA committee considering this concept but not proposing it to the parliament.

Setting up a public interest monitor scheme in every state and territory would be costly and its benefit is questionable.

This would remove the government's proposal that the NCA be empowered to deal quickly and efficiently with persons whose conduct is designed to defeat the authority in the performance of its functions. The authority has come across this on a number of occasions. The proposed government amendments would not mean that the NCA itself would deal with a contempt but enable the authority to apply to a court for that court to determine the issue. You still have that aspect of the court dealing with a contempt, so it would not be necessarily an appeal from Caesar unto Caesar.</para></talk.start><para>Contempt style provisions are not novel, as some people have suggested. Under section 219 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001, the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board can certify to a court that a person has failed to attend before the board. The court can punish that person for non-attendance as if it were a contempt. Similarly, there are many provisions in Commonwealth law under which a court can order a person to comply with a statutory requirement—for example, to produce documents or answer questions—and I refer to section 119 of the Retirement Savings Accounts Act, section 289 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and section 70 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. So there is a precedent for this, and I draw that to the committee's attention.</para><para>If the contempt provisions are removed by the opposition's proposal, I will shortly have to circulate revised versions of the government's proposed review and commencement provisions, government amendments (1) and (2).

In accordance with our opposition to the government's endeavour to give power to employ non-APS staff, we will of course oppose government amendment No. 21.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>25856</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This amendment would ensure that the proposed new category of staff of the NCA are able to exercise the same powers, perform the same functions and be subject to the same responsibilities as other members of staff of the NCA.

I did touch on that in relation to the previous debate, but the opposition's proposal will remove the administrative and operational flexibility that the government seeks to achieve by empowering the chair of the authority to employ staff outside the Public Service Act. The NCA has at least as much need for flexibility as the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, both of which have this flexibility which was given to them under the previous Labor government. I think that is important to remember. </para></talk.start><para>The National Crime Authority is called upon to respond to a rapidly changing criminal environment in terms of the types of crimes involved, the location of crimes and the techniques and technologies involved.

He was highly critical of the government's proposal, arguing in part that the law as it stands provides for the necessary flexibility and adequately allows the NCA to take advantage of specialist expertise. He said, in part:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The reasons for these proposals in the Second Reading Speech—</para></quote><para>that is, the second reading speech of the minister—</para><quote><para>are clearly spurious. It is said to be based on a need for specialist expertise `from time to time in a particular location'. The Act allows the Chairperson adequate capacity to engage persons for limited periods at any location. The flexibility of the current public sector employment rules are such as to enable the engagement of staff on terms and conditions which are in line with public sector remuneration in Australia. If private sector remuneration is necessary this can be achieved through the use of consultancies. Sections 47 to 50 are in my experience, adequate.</para></quote><para>He went on:</para><quote><para>This then raises the issue of why these changes are now being proposed. Is it intended that over time the majority of the staff would be engaged under these provisions? What specific problems have been encountered which would give rise to the proposal? Over the years members of the authority, including Chairmen who have come from the Bar, appear uncomfortable and unfamiliar with the need for the procedures which necessarily and appropriately apply to the engagement of staff for public purposes. These requirements include the need to advertise, select on merit and the need to ensure work of similar value is remunerated similarly. The proposals will allow a future Chairperson to engage in personnel practices inimical to the best interests of the NCA and the Commonwealth.</para></quote><para>I am inclined to agree with that and I also feel that the message we might send—rightly or wrongly—to the broader Public Service members if we were to go down this path would be one of uncertainty and insecurity in terms of the current arrangements.

This was the second part of a two-part reform program to deliver growth and integrity to the overseas student market. As both Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I am doubly aware of the importance of getting the export education industry right. It is a question of getting the balance between the commercial aspects of the industry and the need for immigration integrity. The export education industry is estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to be worth $3,717 million to Australia. This means that it is now our 10th ranked export after tourism, petroleum, gold and minerals. </para></talk.start><para>Before I explain exactly what the reforms mean, I think it is important for the record that I put the reforms in their proper historical context. In order to understand the magnitude of the effort required by the Howard government to reform the overseas education industry in this country, it needs to be remembered that the industry is only now recovering from the situation created when the greed for numbers drove Labor government policy against all expert advice from its own immigration department. At the end of the eighties, then education minister John Dawkins was one of those who saw education as a potential multibillion dollar milch cow. All Australia had to do was free up the immigration system to admit large numbers of students and the economy would go `gang busters', to use a memorable Keating phrase. But as T.S. Eliot wrote, `Betwixt the idea and the reality falls the Shadow'. Some parts of Labor have failed to learn any lessons from what has proved to be an enormously costly mistake. It is obvious from Senator Peter Cook's statements only last week that he has not learned the lesson. </para><para>The unpalatable truth for Senator Cook is that, under the Howard government's skilful husbanding of the overseas education industry, student numbers are at record levels. In the year to 30 June, Australia attracted 146,577 new overseas students—a 23 per cent increase in total visa grant numbers over the previous year, 1999-2000, which showed a nine per cent increase over the 1998-99 year. Offshore grants for the undergraduate sector were particularly strong, showing a 47 per cent rise to 38,555. The irony was that Labor's `get rich quick' approach to the industry nearly killed it off altogether and left a shemozzle that required between $60 million and $100 million of taxpayers' money to fix up, and that was for only a small part of the mess. Other unfortunate decisions by the last Labor government concerning overseas students have cost this country hundreds of millions of dollars, but that is a story for another time. Fortunately, most reputable education providers understand that Labor's `get them in at any cost' mentality does not work in the long run, although I have to admit that there is a small number who are still dazzled by visions of gold at the end of the student rainbow.</para><para>The results of the Labor Party's policy became horribly apparent at the end of the 1980s when the chickens came home to roost. Encouraged by Labor's lax, open door policy, large numbers of intending students came here, and shonky colleges sprang up overnight to service them, with many offering completely non-existent courses. Not uncommonly, they would register with the state education authorities—I must say that some of them also had dollar signs in their eyes—for, say, 400 students but provide only 10 desks. Rolls would be marked, even though the students were not in attendance because they were out working full-time in many positions, some of them in brothels, on construction sites, or wherever they could find work. So, unofficially, Australia's student visas were seen to be a soft target for those wanting a backdoor entry to working in Australia or becoming a permanent resident, and extremely cheap at the price. This was hardly likely to promote Australia's reputation as a quality education destination for genuine overseas students.</para><para>While this backdoor entry suited most pseudo students, there were other student visa holders who actually wanted to study in Australia , who were distressed to find that they had no teachers, little equipment and Mickey Mouse classes, if they got any, and went home badmouthing Australian education. Bob Hawke's response to Tiananmen Square, when we saw him crying in the Great Hall, led to his unilateral decision to allow all People's Republic of China students, including those already in the pipeline—over 40,000 of them—to become permanent residents. This skewed Australia's immigration program towards one country, and the effects, financial and otherwise, of that are still there today. But, with regard to student policy, it was all over by the time Bob Hawke cried. His decision merely brought to a head a situation that was already out of control. Labor had to move from doing nothing to manage student entry responsibly to attacking problems created by their mismanagement with a sledgehammer. Overnight, the Labor government shut down the English language education market for China by introducing a special visa requirement for the PRC, which only ended on 1 July this year. The English language education providers had to be compensated with millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, and overseas students, whose providers had gone to the wall because the Labor Government had shut up their market like a telescope, had to have their education costs subsidised by the Australian taxpayer. </para><para>In the first part of our two-pronged reform program for the overseas student education industry, and after years of inaction by state governments, the Howard government introduced a code of practice to force out the shonky providers still in business by, for example, setting strict parameters for registration, such as having adequate facilities— which is not an unreasonable request—for the numbers registered, and being obliged to inform the immigration department of student non-attendance. The second part of the reform process put into operation on 1 July this year has been the product of many months of working closely with the peak education bodies from every sector of the industry. We have made the overseas student visa system more transparent and objective by publishing, for the first time, our requirements for the granting of student visas. This is now available on the departmental web site: www.immi.gov.au in `What's New'. This also makes the process of assessment, in its turn, more objective and less susceptible to the use of discretion by departmental officers.</para><para>The categorisation of gazetted and non-gazetted countries was a very blunt instrument introduced by the last Labor government in its desperate bid to staunch the flow of non-bona fide students. It has been replaced by a much more responsive assessment of risk. Countries are now divided into four levels and into education industry sectors based on statistical data as to the incidence of fraudulent documentation, overstaying, student visas, cancellation of visas for various reasons and students who breach their visa conditions by working more than the allocated time. This means that if compliance is high in one sector—say higher education—although in other sectors compliance with visa conditions is poor, the students of higher education in that country are rewarded with less onerous requirements for obtaining a visa. Where compliance levels improve significantly in any sector, risk also falls and students will benefit. </para><para>The new rating system recognises that the incidence of students becoming unlawful in some markets is still unacceptably high: 17.6 per cent of students from Vietnam had their students visas cancelled in the year to 30 June and 16.8 per cent of students from India had their visas cancelled. This represented a doubling of the visa cancellation rate for India, notwithstanding that over half the student visa applications in this market under the old rules were rejected for fraud, incompletion and failure to satisfy the bona fides test. Rates of cancellation were also high for Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Korea. </para><para>The Howard government is mindful of the need to husband our extraordinary growth in students numbers after the debacle caused by the unmanaged growth during the last Labor government. Here I would like to pay tribute to Senator Kim Carr who, because of his knowledge and interest in this area, has taken a positive and cooperative approach to these reforms. On many occasions it is seen as important to be able to work with others of a different political persuasion to do what is in Australia's long-term interest. </para><para>I have sometimes heard it said that it does not matter if students do not come here to study. It matters a great deal. They take jobs from Australian workers if they work full-time. They often cause grief in their own national communities here by getting up to mischief. Some of those communities report that to us and say that if reflects badly on them. At the end of the day they cause a loss of reputation for Australian education because, when they return to their countries with no improvement in their language skills and no qualification, it is the Australian education system and market that they blame. Over time, this incremental loss of reputation has enormous economic and diplomatic ramifications for this country. </para><para>Australia has many attractions for overseas students which are reflected in the extraordinary growth in numbers. The relatively competitive dollar, the great climate, a laid back culture and quality education are all important factors. On the government side we work hard to facilitate the entry of students with generous working conditions. Students are able to work 20 hours a week and longer during the holiday times and they are not restricted, as elsewhere in the world—for example, the US and Canada—to working only on their own campuses. The Howard government has also been farsighted in allowing overseas students who achieve high level qualifications in this country to become migrants immediately on completion of their courses, without going offshore. They now comprise about 50 per cent of our skilled migrant intake.  </para><para>I would like to end today by referring to a recently released draft OECD study on the mobility of international students. The study points out that student mobility provides a potential flow of qualified workers either in the course of their studies or through subsequent recruitment, allows economies of scale in education systems and brings additional resources to finance them. The immigrants we receive by this means are much more readily absorbed into our work force by dint of their qualifications being obtained in this country. The report points to the ways in which the Australian government has adopted measures to facilitate the entry of foreign students, particularly in information and communications technology. From July they do not have to have professional experience or an employer sponsor in order to apply as skilled migrants. The immigration department is also developing an online immigration application procedure to speed up the process. </para><para>The report notes that Australia is one of a group of countries which stand out for their very high intakes of foreign students—over 110 per 1,000 enrolled. Australia rates third on this measurement, at 125 per 1,000 enrolled, after Luxembourg 304, and Switzerland 159 and before Austria and the UK. The OECD study notes: </para><quote><para>While the effective size and diversification of education provision can explain why the large industrialised countries are most often host countries to foreign students, the presence at the top of the list of smaller, industrialised countries like Australia, Switzerland and Austria suggests that high levels of economic prosperity are reflected in per capita educational resources and high levels of technology which attract foreign students in certain areas of excellence. </para></quote><para>In the reception of non-OECD students, Australia, France, the UK, Denmark and Switzerland are the leading OECD countries in that order: 80 per cent of foreign students overall go to only five countries—Australia, France, Germany, the UK and the US. In Australia, three-quarters of foreign students come from Asia or the Pacific—that is, our major trading partners—and most are enrolled in commercial disciplines. The study goes on: </para><quote><para>Concerning the dynamics of the student mobility phenomenon, a comparison at the interval of three years shows that the proportion of foreign students in the OECD countries rose by 4.6 per cent between 1995 and 1998. This trend reflects a process of internationalisation of education which is growing in the OECD countries. This overall rise, however, masks some significant divergencies between countries: among the major host countries, Australia comes top with almost a 40 per cent rise over the period concerned, followed by Switzerland, the UK, Denmark and, a long way behind, Germany and the US. </para></quote><para>An article in <inline font-style="italic">Forbes </inline>magazine last year lamented that Australia, with less than one tenth of America's population, is beating the US at attracting foreign students, and that it is countries like Australia that will be reaping the next crop of entrepreneurs. </para><para>The overseas education industry brings us huge benefits in terms of international goodwill and influence when the students we educate go on to become the next generation of leaders in their countries, but it is also a fragile market which needs to be managed well. We will continue to listen to industry and to make changes where necessary to finetune the process. Unlike the last Labor government, this government will not stand idly by while problems become so overwhelming that a sledgehammer approach becomes the only one available. The student visa changes will assist the Howard government to continue to manage overseas student growth prudently and to enhance the value of the Australian education industry.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Visas: Students</title><page.no>25862</page.no></subdebateinfo></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business</title><page.no>25862</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>25862</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I commence the remarks I planned to make today, I thank Senator Patterson for a very interesting contribution on overseas students.

In my comments today I want to address a number of matters relating to the not quite so new Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. In March of this year, the federal Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Tony Abbott, gave a speech on industrial relations titled, `Reflections of a new boy'. Leaving aside the endearing public schoolboy effect, the title successfully conveys, I think, his immature understanding of industrial relations in this country. Unfortunately for us, the passing of April, May, June and July does not appear to have improved his knowledge of his portfolio area at all. This was amply demonstrated in his most recent contribution to public debate, which was titled `Why workers are saying no to unions' and published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 26 July. The reasons for union membership decline are many and complex. A thoughtful debate on the matter has been conducted over the last few years within the union movement and also amongst academia and the media. In fact, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>'s recent `Perspective' series, I thought, gave a more useful and measured contribution on the issue. This was published around the same time as the article by the minister. But not so the minister's piece. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Mr Abbott asserts three reasons for the decline in union membership since 1980. Marxist thinking on the part of unions was the first. Please! The union movement's total involvement with one side of politics was the second, and a tendency to see members as numbers rather than individuals with needs to be met was the third. That third reason I find particularly offensive from my own involvement as a union official.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—Yes— not validated by the first point. In fact, the whole system seems to be somewhat inconsistent. You are right, Senator Ludwig. However, Minister Abbott's self-serving views on the decline of the union movement—for instance, the Howard government's virulent anti-union policies do not rate a mention—are not worth serious contemplation, let alone rebuttal. They are nothing more than political bile masquerading as argument. If he or anyone else is interested in reading something useful on the subject, I suggest they look at the New South Wales Labour Council's webpage where you can find the results of a nationwide poll of 1,100 people commissioned by the council but carried out by Sydney University's Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training in early July. This survey shows that the majority—52 per cent—of people agree with the proposition, `I'd rather be in a union.' This is up from 44 per cent two years ago. Although I doubt it will ever occur, I look forward to the day when the Employment Advocate actually investigates why people feel that they are blocked from joining unions—a clear trend.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—Wasn't it ACCIRT research?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—And ACCIRT research as well, demonstrating this trend. But, unfortunately, it is something that our champion of freedom of association continues time and time again to ignore. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Far more disturbing than his comments on union decline is the minister's agenda for industrial relations reform which was set out by him in his `confessions of a new boy' speech. The minister delivered the speech to a meeting of the H.R. Nicholls Society— shock, horror!—and then disseminated it a little more widely in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 27 March this year. That agenda for industrial relations reform was so full of so much analytical error and distortion that I am informed that department officials took up its serious flaws privately with the minister shortly after the article was published, with the suggestion that he do the intellectually honourable thing and correct the record. He has chosen not to, so today I am happy to take up that task.</para><para>Mr Abbott's assertion No. 1 was that Australia's workplace relations system assumes that workers and bosses are incapable of managing differences, that workers are always weak and gullible, that bosses are always greedy and manipulative, that relations need to be governed by complex rules and that inevitable disagreements must be resolved by someone else. This is wrong in terms of the legislative policy of the Howard government and historically it is untrue. For example, the Howard government's 1996 workplace relations legislation included as one of its fundamental objectives ensuring that the primary responsibility for determining matters affecting the relationship between employers and employees rests with the employer and the employee at the workplace level—the minister's own legislation. As far as history is concerned, employers and employees have traditionally been able to sort out the vast majority of matters among themselves, with these often being given legal force by so-called `consent awards' without recourse to conciliation or arbitration. To take a random example: in the Commonwealth Public Service in the financial year 1969-70, some 425 adjustments were made to pay and conditions. Only 26 or six per cent involved arbitration or, in Mr Abbott's words, `having disagreements resolved by someone else'.</para><para>Mr Abbott's assertion No. 2 was that, because the system gives unions the built-in advantage of taking the first move through initiating a dispute, it is like ensuring that one side always wins the toss. This is nonsense, as is what the minister has said about establishment processes. In the federal Workplace Relations Act, certified agreements prevail over and are rapidly displacing awards. Section 170MG(1) of that act enables either an employer or other parties to terminate an agreement and section 170MI enables either party to initiate a bargaining period. There is no question of one side always winning the toss. I can only assume that the minister had spent too much time during the summer at the cricket.</para><para>Let us move to Mr Abbott's assertion No. 3, which was that workers, managers and owners should be talking to one another at the first hint of disagreement rather than to unions, employer organisations, commissioners, judges and courts. In fact, workers and managers talk to one another all of the time. It can safely be assumed that most communication at most workplaces on most disagreements is directly between managers and workers in the first instance, with unions and commissioners, et cetera, getting in on the act if the matter becomes intractable or where it might be more convenient to deal with the unions—on nationwide issues, for example—in large and geographically dispersed organisations. I and probably Senator Mackay can recall a number of employer organisations saying, `We don't like this 1996 legislation because it contains our ability to access commissioners, for instance, when disputes are intractable. Also we like to be able to deal with issues on a nationwide basis in some instances.'</para><para>Industrial commissions are virtually never spoken to at the first hint of disagreement, and they would typically send any parties away if they attempted to do so. Indeed, there are many provisions in the Howard government's Workplace Relations Act requiring the Industrial Relations Commission to do just that. For example, section 170N precludes the commission from arbitrating during a formal bargaining period. </para><para>Let me move to Mr Abbott's assertion No. 4, which was that around the country there are 4,500 industrial awards regulating everything from the temperature of water in tea urns to the number of beds on building sites to the hours allowed for trade union training. I really am starting to wonder whether Mr Abbott picked up a speech that was perhaps five years old here. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Tierney</name></talker><para>—Beds on building sites?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—Yes. Here the minister tries to colour and distort the overall picture with an extreme example, a debating tactic as old as it is dishonourable and also inaccurate. If he is not prepared to count up and tell us the number of awards regulating the water temperature of tea urns, at the very least he could say that such matters do not fall within allowable matters in federal awards.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me move to Mr Abbott's assertion No. 5, which is that the number of pages of industrial legislation—Senator Mackay will like this one—certified agreements and awards is a serious problem. In some ways, it may well be. However, he fails to own up to the fact that the Howard government's Workplace Relations Act and its associated policies have vastly increased the amount of industrial relations regulatory documentation.</para><para>Again, to take a convenient example of the Commonwealth Public Service, there are now some 100 separate individual agency certified agreements that could each be around 100 pages long in place of a single Public Service-wide agreement. Further, there are some 5,500 Australian workplace agreements that could each be 15 pages long. That is to say, in addition to some hundreds of pages of legislation and associated documentation, the policies of the Howard government have bequeathed around 100,000 pages of regulatory workplace relations documentation to the Commonwealth Public Service, a figure far in excess of anything that organisation has known in its 100-year history. It is no surprise that the Victorian government chose to move to another means.</para><para>One could go on, but enough is enough to make the point that, while the Howard government alleges policy laziness on the part of the opposition, that does not apparently make up for one of its senior ministers who is not in the least bit bashful about his own sloppy, lazy and distorted analysis of vital areas of policy for which he is responsible. Weak analysis is of course a recipe for weak policy, and it is therefore hard to be optimistic about Mr Abbott being able to bring forth much in his avowed intention to push for further incremental legislative improvement. He needs to catch up on the legislative reform his own government has done first. One can only wonder what those discerning industrial relations specialists and enthusiasts at the H.R. Nicholls Society thought of the minister's performance. Perhaps that august society does not expect much more than a goodly serving of ideological fodder for its members. If it wanted more from Mr Abbott, it did not get it. It got a cheap caricature of industrial relations in Australia, something it might have obtained from the minister's filmic namesake if he were still available.</para><para>Finally, I have to ask: how long does it take for the line still recently used by the minister—`I'm a new minister'—to lose its value as an excuse for ignorance and incompetence? Surely, the use-by date on it has passed for Minister Abbott. The minister is either incapable of getting on top of his new portfolio or uninterested, and the Australian public deserve to know which one it is. I have covered today the industrial relations side of Mr Abbott's portfolio, and I look forward to the general business debate on Thursday, when we will cover employment services and Mr Abbott's contribution there.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Whistleblowers: Heiner Case</title><page.no>25864</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>25864</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I raise as a matter of public interest the grievance of Mr Kevin Lindeberg.

Friday, the 13th will be remembered as the Halloween nightmare for local business and community leaders. On a day when Newcastle was highlighting its potential for further defence investment, union protestors who can only be described as thugs did a most childish and dangerous thing. The Minister for Defence was invited to meet with local people including the defence task force from the Hunter business chamber, who were outlining to the minister the defence industry investment potential in the Hunter Valley. </para></talk.start><para>It is certainly no secret that the Hunter has a very proud tradition in regard to defence. We have a major inventory Army base, which is responsible for most of the inventory training. We have RAAF at Williamtown, which not only has the major arms of the fighters for Australia but also has a number of other facilities such as Eastern Command and the Warfare Centre and most recently from this government the addition of the AEWAC early warning aircraft. </para><para>On top of this, the defence industries around Newcastle provide a considerable amount of work and in the past have been involved in building a number of significant naval projects. Some of these projects include naval ships but most recently the Minehunter Project. In addition to that, these industries have supplied parts and sections of other major contracts that have recently been awarded such as the submarine contract and the Anzac frigates. What the business community was pointing out to the Minister Reith was that Newcastle has a natural advantage in terms of defence industries. Not only does it have a cluster of defence bases; it also has a most extensive defence industry that has a very proud tradition. </para><para>There is coming up very soon a range of contracts which this government has outlined in its defence plan. Indeed, over the next 10 years there will be up to $50 billion worth of defence work available in Australia. So, given that situation and given the minister was in town, one would have thought that the people of Newcastle and the Hunter would want to put forward the best image possible. This was all destroyed by the attack on the minister's car. Following the briefing, the minister did leave the site and also a number of other business leaders in the community left as well. I was driving the car out of the Forgacs dockyard at the time and there was a group of unionists numbering about 60 who were holding up banners and protesting. A car came and cut across our path but, having been a former Sydney taxi driver, that was not too difficult to get around. But 60 people on the road forming a blockade was incredibly difficult to get through.  </para><para>The crowd was very aggressive. They threw things over the car—and this was all recorded on the footage and in the photographs in the media. They threw chocolate milk over the windscreen. This was incredibly dangerous because it made it very difficult to see. This was removed by windscreen wipers and washers so that I could see. I kept proceeding at about two to three kilometres an hour wondering what would have happened if I had stopped the car, because this bunch of union thugs had totally lost it at this point. They were belting the car with the wooden poles they had been using to hold up the banner. The biggest dent in the car was reserved for next to the seat where Peter Reith's head was. The amount of damage done to the car came to over $6,000. There are 50 parts that need to be replaced and one month later I still have not got the car back. They attacked not only my vehicle but also three others, including a Commonwealth car. One of the employees of Forgacs had his car damaged and a private citizen had the windscreen broken on his car.</para><para>What is absolutely amazing is that the minister was there for good news for the Hunter. This minister was there with his chequebook and the possibility of $50 billion of contracts over the next 10 years. Wouldn't you think that you would want to show the region in its best light, the industries in their best light and the work force in its best light? But these were mainly union members that were carrying on like this. When asked why they had done this, they just said, `We wanted to give the minister a send off.' How childish, and how damaging to the region, particularly as the reports of the incident appeared on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and right across the country. The TV footage of violent union protests were shot right around Australia.</para><para>I would like to canvass a number of issues that have come out of this incident and the negative effect that it has had on the area. Firstly, it is the issue of trying to attract investment to regional Australia—and I notice we have the shadow minister for regional services opposite, so she would be very interested in any investment going into regional Australia. We had a major problem a few years ago in the Hunter Valley when the industrial icon BHP shut down its steel smelting operation in Newcastle. Thousands of jobs were lost and people thought the region would go into major decline. What happened was the reverse. Newcastle's unemployment dropped dramatically in the year following the shutting down of BHP's steel smelting. A whole range of other industries took up the slack very quickly. Not only was there a lot of private investment; there was also public investment from the state government Hunter Advantage Fund and the federal government's structural adjustment package where strategic projects were targeted to help develop new industries in the region. </para><para>That has been developing very well. We have industries such as communications, tourism, higher education, IT and engineering—these are all booming in the post BHP era. Unemployment was down last year to seven per cent—levels we have not seen since the 1960s and considerably under those levels seen during the last Labor government, which were around 15 per cent. It had come down to seven per cent—it had actually halved during that time, despite the shutdown of BHP. Why did that happen? Because we were able to attract, with the natural advantages of the Hunter economy, a very wide range of industries to the region. The whole future of the region depends on investors putting this further money in. </para><para>So what is the effect when investors see flashed around Australia—and possibly the world—the violent footage that came out of this union protest? We know what happened to one investor who had seen footage of a nonviolent protest that had occurred a few weeks earlier—not this violent footage. They saw that union protest and decided not to invest in the region. What was the effect of the violent protest? How many watched that and decided they would not invest in the region? That sort of disturbing footage has been a setback for the Hunter.  </para><para>We have a real chance with further defence industries, despite what these irresponsible union thugs have done. One of the contracts that the minister was there to discuss was the new patrol boat contract, replacing our 15 ageing Fremantle class patrol boats with 25 new boats. A total of $450 million is involved in that project. There are two leading contenders from the Hunter to pick up that work: Australian Defence Industries and Forgacs. We were right there—we were at Forgacs and ADI is next door. This was the centrepiece area for the construction of this new naval work, and it is exactly where this irresponsible protest took place. It is a pity, because the unions have over the last 20 years built a better image for themselves. They had shown in the past that they were more responsible, and that is probably why we have attracted so much investment to the area in recent years.</para><para>Indeed, five weeks earlier the Prime Minister was in the Hunter Valley. There were no union thugs hitting Commonwealth cars on that occasion; there was no bad publicity going around the country. A few weeks earlier Stephen Martin, the shadow minister for defence, was also in the area and they welcomed him with open arms; there were no violent protests on that occasion. But, as Graham Gilbert pointed out when he interviewed me on 2SM after the protest, Labor are not in a position to make the decision where defence contracts go and you would think people would be on their best behaviour when bids like this are up in the air, looking as if they could fulfil the contract, particularly when a responsible minister was in the region. This is from one of the major radio commentators. He could not understand why in that situation the unions would not be trying to put their best foot forward.</para><para>The unions have said it is an unusual situation, it just all of sudden got out of control and they would have an inquiry into the incident. We say to the unions: where is the inquiry up to? Who are the people responsible that caused over $6,000 worth of damage? Is it going to be left to the taxpayer to pay for it? This is the outcome and this is where the situation is up to at this time.</para><para>The main issue is not just damage to property and the endangering of lives. The other main issue is the potential loss to industry in the region. The violence of the protest takes us back to what used to happen in the 1940s. This is the sort of behaviour that belongs back in the 20th century, not in the 21st century. The unions have an obligation to help and work with the business community in the area to attract more employment opportunities, but they have instead undermined the hard work of the local people, such as the Hunter Business Chamber, the Hunter Economic Development Corporation, the Lord Mayor, Newcastle council and the Hunter Area Consultative Committee.</para><para>Since BHP announced the shutdown of smelting in 1997, all levels of government in the city—state, local and federal—all political parties and community groups have worked very hard and in a cooperative way to reshape the Hunter economy, and with great success to date. The cooperative spirit has now been severely undermined by this union thuggery. If we are going to rebuild the Hunter economy and offer our children a real future, all levels of the community must continue to work together and rogue unions must come back into the fold. Friday the 13th will go down as a Halloween nightmare for Newcastle when the unions sabotaged attempts to bring new life to the Hunter region. Shame on the union thugs.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Human Cloning</title><page.no>25869</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>25869</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The announcement earlier this week that Professor Severino Antinori of Rome University plans to produce a human clone by impregnating up to 200 women with cloned embryos makes the current debate about stem cell research even more compelling and urgent.

At a time when the potential for development of technology for benign purposes is eagerly anticipated, the potential for abuse is all too real. We must define the parameters and set the boundaries to separate out good eugenics from bad eugenics, to separate legitimate science from abuse. How can we do this in the absence of a moral compass? </para><para>The approaches taken in the United States by the Bush administration and in Britain by the Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, only serve to illustrate the ethical, political and scientific divide—their approaches are divergent.

The decision has been criticised by commentators in Germany, France and Holland, and by the Pope, as in effect legitimising reproductive cloning to produce children. The House of Lords Ad Hoc Committee on Stem Cell Research has heard evidence from eminent researchers and organisations calling for nothing short of a worldwide ban on cloning.</para><para>In Australia, the need for a nationally consistent approach to legislation regulating assisted reproductive technology and banning the cloning of whole human beings has been recognised in the prohibition of cloning incorporated in the Gene Technology Act 2000. On 8 June 2001, the Council of Australian Governments made a commitment to achieving nationally consistent provisions to prohibit human cloning, whilst acknowledging that this field of regulation is primarily one for each state and federal jurisdiction. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is due to hand down a report on human cloning next month.</para><para>With all this attention being given to embryonic stem cell research, it might be thought that as a society we would have resolved some of the more fundamental moral dilemmas—that we would be more settled in our thinking about what is the very essence of humanity. However, this is far from the case. News earlier this year that scientists in the United States have created human embryos for the sole purpose of stem cell research and scientific manipulation should also be ringing alarm bells.</para><para>The use of excess embryos, created for reproduction as part of in-vitro fertilisation processes, for stem cell research has, however, gained a level of public acceptance. These embryos will eventually be destroyed, and the potential to help others through stem cell research and therapy is seen as benign and beneficial—although there is not much evidence yet of the successful application of cell therapy to prevent or treat categories of inherited diseases and disabilities, diabetes, cancer or arteriosclerosis.</para><para>I think it is fair to say that many of us have been mesmerised by the potential for humankind to benefit from stem cell research. Not wishing to stand in the way of progress, we have tended to uncritically accept scientific claims and have not given sufficient thought to dubious means to not easily attained ends. It is time to reassess the means to the end and to intensify research efforts to find cells from other sources. For example, the use of adult stem cells for cell therapies would reduce or avoid the need to use human embryos or human foetal tissue as a source of stem cells. </para><para>Those who object to this research do so on the basis that these pluripotent stem cells are typically taken from the inner cell mass of human embryos at the blastocyst stage. Many hold profound moral and religious objections to the manipulation of a human embryo and do not buy the argument that it is an acceptable means to a collective good. There is some force in this position—although if human life, however microscopic, is to be respected, it is difficult to distinguish between the wrongs inflicted on an unwanted embryo by the extraction of stem cells and its destruction as surplus to IVF requirements in any event. This is not a distinction of kind, but one of degree.</para><para>At a basic level, pluripotent stem cells could build a better understanding of human development, abnormal cell specialisation and cell division. Human pluripotent stem cell research could also have a dramatic effect on the development and testing of drugs using human cell lines. There are other potential applications of pluripotent stem cells that, all things being equal, may justify the research. But the glittering prize is undoubtedly the potential to offer a renewable source of replacement cells and tissue to relieve the pain and suffering of disabling diseases and disabilities.</para><para>Although adult stem cells may not be the very best source of these cells for all applications, research on adult stem cells suggest that such cells may have similar potential to pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells can give rise to any kind of cell in the body. Multipotent adult cells are more flexible than first thought and can produce many, but not all, cell types. In an intriguing article titled `Can adult stem cells suffice?' the June issue of <inline font-style="italic">Science</inline> magazine reports the findings of surgeon Marc Hedrick of the University of California. Fat cells isolated after liposuction could become cells resembling cartilage, bone and muscle. His paper has apparently prompted some politicians to volunteer to give up some of their excess fat in the cause of science. It would be a plentiful source. Other research suggests stem cells may be isolated from cadavers. </para><para>While researchers maintain that they need to access both embryonic and adult stem cells to search for the best source of cells, it must be acknowledged that actual applications to human conditions are a long way off. What is disconcerting is that the long-term consequences of stem cell therapies on humans are completely unknown. This is because few results from animal studies are followed up longer than a year or so after transplants. Before we go hurtling into this brave new world of cell removal and bring on the clones there is time to reflect, to debate and to get the regulatory framework right for future research. The antics of Professor Antinori and his team and his obvious willingness to shop around for a country that will allow his experiments and apparently an unending source of people prepared to submit to these experiments suggest that there needs to be a global response to the prohibition of baby cloning. It would be a delicate balance to ensure that the development of new treatments is not jeopardised whilst effectively banning human reproductive cloning.  </para><para>Assuming the techniques of cell therapy can be developed within acceptable boundaries to provide real benefits to humankind, we will face the familiar problem of who can access the new technologies and who can benefit. Oxford philosopher Professor Michael Dummett hit the nail on the head when he identified one of the strongest objections to cloning. It would see the commercialisation of the technology available only to the rich who can access it with impunity in any compliant jurisdiction. He warns against a genetically perfected elite lording it over the rest of humanity. As if this is not enough food for thought, Jurgen Habermas, adviser to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, has asked for scientists to treat the embryo as if it were looking over one's shoulder. Could you justify your research to the victim? It is, I think, an appropriate question for members and senators as we will be asked to make these judgments for ourselves and for our constituents in the not too distant future.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.53 p.m. to 2 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>25872</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cabinet Documents</title><page.no>25872</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>25872</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister.

It is an important question. I think I have drawn to the attention of this chamber many times before the attempts of the Labor Party to talk down the Australian economy—the constant carping and attacks that have been launched on the Labor Party about the economic performance of the government. Have I got some good news for the Labor Party! The Australian economy is one of the world's best performing economies. It is one of the world's best performing economies because of the major reforms that this government has put in place, including tax reform.</para></talk.start><para>Let me share with the senator some important statistics. Since we were elected to government Australia has had an enviable record. It has enjoyed an annual growth in the economy of well over four per cent, compared with an annual average of around three per cent for the OECD. Australia, as I have said, is one of the fastest growing economies in the industrialised world. What does this mean for Australian families? It means more jobs, matched with higher wages. It means lower interest rates, and it follows that there will be higher living standards for Australian workers. Let me mention some statistics which demonstrate this point. During the long dark years of Labor's time in office, the average Australian worker experienced a real growth in wages of about 0.4 per cent per year. In some years real wages fell. What an appalling record for a party that goes under the name of the Australian Labor Party. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—Taxes also went down and prices were contained.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—Senator Cook chips in. The fact of the matter is that the Australian Labor Party is not a labour party, a workers party or an employees party; it is a trade union party and, more particularly, it is a trade union bosses party. The fact of the matter is that virtually 100 per cent of members of the Labor Party in this Senate are trade union bosses. One in five Australian workers belongs to a trade union, but in this Senate virtually 100 per cent of Labor senators are trade union bosses. How this party can hold itself out to represent the Australian worker beggars belief. It had a shocking record on growth of real wages while in office. While it was shovelling trade union boss after trade union boss into this chamber, real wages in this country were performing appallingly. The Labor Party was looking after the unions, but it certainly was not looking after the Australian worker.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me contrast the pathetic performance in real wages under the Labor Party with what has happened under the coalition. Real wages under the coalition for the average worker have grown by around 2.5 per cent a year—vastly in excess of the pathetic performance that we saw under the Labor Party. We have delivered lower interest rates, major tax cuts and very strong growth in jobs for Australian workers. This is the party that delivers for the worker. We are not a trade union party, unlike the Labor Party. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Seyffer, Mr John </title><page.no>25873</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>25873</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Hill, the Minister representing the Prime Minister.

Of course, this is possible only because the coalition, rather than talking about extra funding for the ABC, is actually providing in the budget an additional $71.2 million—real money, Senator Carr—for the ABC. Today's announcement, of course, comes hot on the heels of the news that the ABC is also receiving an additional $90 million over five years to provide an Australian Asia TV service. Compare that with the miserable $7½ million they got from Labor for ATV. Yesterday, a number of us were there when the ABC launched <inline font-style="italic">ABC Kids</inline>—Australia's first digital television channel. It was also announced by the managing director that they would soon have another four digital channels.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So a lot is happening with the ABC. All those present at that last Senate hearing saw the despicable performance of the Australian parliament's in-house bully, Senator Faulkner, when he ridiculed, humiliated and embarrassed the ABC as best he could by suggesting that they had no new programs and that they were not interested in quality. Of course, now we have had the ABC announcing nine new Australian television programs. As a result, its level of prime time Australian content will now be nearly 70 per cent.</para><para>So the ABC is actually getting in excess of $2 billion in federal government funding in this triennium. In real dollars, total ABC funding is over $100 million more than it was in 1995-96, under Labor, and the same goes for discretionary funding. So all the myths spread by Labor, by its union masters and by the union affiliated so-called Friends of the ABC, which has now been comprehensively exposed as a union front, are absolutely wrong. Labor run around saying they will increase ABC funding but, of course, their record in government was that they cut funding by some 30 per cent. The commitment they gave at the last election was entirely for tied funding. In other words, they are very much into the business of interfering, telling the ABC how to run its business and threatening and intimidating journalists they do not like.</para><para>Mr Stephen Smith has achieved an absolute world first. Not only did he get Brian Johns to criticise him for interference, but he also managed to get criticism from the Chairman and from the Managing Director of the ABC recently over that disgraceful interference on the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> program. As the Chairman said, the only political pressure relating to the issue came from Mr Beazley himself, from the shadow minister for communications, from the Friends of the ABC and from the unions, all commenting on a non-industrial matter. Here we have the stark contrast: we are in favour of a quality alternative to the commercials; what Labor wants is a government controlled, compliant lap-dog. We are committed to a strong and independent ABC. We are providing real funds, not tied funds. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Commonwealth Property Holdings: Divestment</title><page.no>25875</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>25875</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Abetz, representing the Minister for Finance and Administration.

The government's property sales program for both Defence and non-Defence properties has been highly successful to date, and the Auditor-General has not presented a case for it to be suspended. I might add that the vast majority of the Defence properties planned for sale are surplus to Defence requirements. Undoubtedly, the Labor Party would want us to keep them, despite the fact that they have no defence utility. Sale of these properties will allow the Commonwealth's resources to be redirected to better social and economic objectives, rather than being tied up in empty buildings or unused land.</para></talk.start><para>So I can confirm to the honourable senator that we, as a government, will continue to pursue the line that, especially in the area of Defence, where there are buildings and there is land that is not required for Defence purposes, those properties will be sold. What we will do with that money is retire Labor's debt. The same principles will apply: we will pay off Labor's debt. Of the $96 billion debt left to us when we came into government, we have repaid $58 billion. As a result, the people of Australia have had their tax burden reduced, because the money wasted on interest is no longer required. As a result, we can spend that money on social opportunity benefits.</para><para>Those matters are policy matters for the government. With great respect to the Auditor-General's report, he did not consider what the social benefits would be to young Australians, older Australians and the indigenous community of being able to redirect the moneys we were previously paying on interest into those important social areas. We, as a government, will continue to manage the economy wisely when we undertake property sales. I hope we are as successful as we were with this last lot, with $131 million—a price, indeed, 15 per cent above market value. That was a great outcome for the Australian people which has enabled them to have their debt burden removed. As a result, their tax burden has been lightened, and that seems to be the reason why the Australian Labor Party is so upset. But we make no apologies: we do want to reduce the tax burden on the Australian people and so, when we manage the Australian economy, we factor in situations such as reducing Australia's debt and the interest bill, so that we can focus attention on those important social needs I have previously mentioned.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25875</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I have a supplementary question.

Will the government move to urgently improve transparency, increase simplicity and initiate better administration on entitlements, where that is inadequate?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25876</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The honourable senator asks whether I have had time to read the report. The answer to that is yes, but in the four minutes allocated to me, quite frankly, I do not have time to answer the multiplicity of questions that the honourable senator has asked. I believe that there will be a number of election themes. The most important one is going to be the management of the Australian economy. Taxation will be another theme and industrial relations will be another theme, and I hope that within that context the Australian Democrats can sort themselves out in relation to where they stand on industrial relation reform and tax reform.</para></talk.start><para>But in relation to this particular report I believe that some issues of concern have been raised. It is important for us to digest this report. Might I suggest with respect to Senator Murray and to Senator Faulkner that it was a 250-page report, not a simple 40- or 50-page summary which some senators and members read and then thought that was the report and as a result inappropriately condemned Finance. Sure, Finance as a department disagreed with 25 out of the 28 recommendations, but in the body of the report the reason and rationale for that disagreement was set out. With recommendation No. 1, for example, they had `Disagree—already implemented' in effect. What they could have said was: `Agree because it's already done.' So the belligerent attitude taken by some people on the cursory reading of the report I thought was unfair to the department of finance.</para><para>Let me say that the department of finance does not run the government: we are the elected officials, we will make the policy decisions and we will determine what the response to this report is. But it is interesting to note that the Minister for Finance in the previous Keating government who was responsible for this area as a senior minister was, of course, none other than Mr Beazley. He was the same man that said the budget was in surplus, and left us with a $10.3 billion deficit. If he as the Minister for Finance at the time would have wanted to, he could have made a whole host of reforms.</para><para>I pay tribute to some of my predecessors in the portfolio, especially Senator Christopher Ellison, who undertook great reforms of transparency. Where were the six-monthly tablings of the travel allowance, charter allowance, Comcar accounts, et cetera under the previous Labor government? Never existed—nonexistent! We introduced that sort of transparency, that sort of accountability, and if we can improve further on that to justify the Australian people's faith in the parliamentary system and in the way that we spend our entitlements, then we as a government will pursue any reasonable suggestion and we will consider that. The Prime Minister has already indicated some areas and we will consider them in great detail to ensure that the right thing is done by the Australian people, who at the end of the day fund these entitlements. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25877</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

If I can give you an indication of my current thought patterns without necessarily committing myself to this, I think it would make sense that we fast-track our response in relation to certain of the recommendations but delay and consider in more detail some of the other recommendations, so I do not think we will be fast-tracking the totality of our response. Having said that, with some of the entitlements that have been shown to have been used in a fairly small `l' liberal way, can I suggest that the idea of capping is one that is potentially appropriate, and I am giving serious consideration to that.

We did produce some 11,000 tonnes of salmon last year. In the six months to June, New Zealand exported only about 156 tonnes. The quarantine authorities have assured the government that all product marked as New Zealand product is produced in New Zealand. Each consignment is accompanied by an official New Zealand government certificate confirming this origin. So we have no reason to doubt the accuracy and validity of those certificates. Certainly, as far as salmon diseases are concerned, New Zealand has the same disease free status as Australia, and New Zealand salmon is not infected by the significant diseases found in the Northern Hemisphere. So we are aware of the concerns expressed by some salmon fishermen and, quite clearly, those concerns and those of anglers in general are ones that the government takes very seriously. </para></talk.start><para>At this stage, we will obviously be expecting AQIS to conduct regular reviews and to be involved in ongoing discussions with their New Zealand counterparts, but the provision of those certificates does provide the necessary degree of assurance and comfort that ought to be required.

We are committed to having world's best practice in quarantine procedures. That will certainly apply to salmon from wherever it comes.

There is an ABC program called the <inline font-style="italic">Insiders</inline>, which is meant to be informative. Last Sunday's program was clearly not a last-minute job. It included a prerecorded interview with a woman who complained about our policy of removing operating grants from community based child-care centres and instead funding those centres on the basis of paying the parents. We continue to support this policy. We think that giving the funds to parents is a good thing. It encourages choice. Yes, some centres have closed, but other centres have opened. There are now over 1,900 more child-care services than there were in 1996.</para></talk.start><para>If the ABC had wanted to provide light, comic relief last Sunday, then it would not have mattered that they did not bother to check the facts. But if they want to pretend to be serious journalists then they should have checked the facts. If they had done so, they would have found quite a different story. We do not know the full details of the woman who was interviewed. She simply identified herself as having two children: one about nine years old and the other 2½ years old. However, we do know what has happened to people in those sorts of groups. For example, a sole parent in a similar position— that is, on the minimum award and therefore getting the full tax and child-care assistance—is much better off under this government than they would have been under Labor.</para><para>Let me explain why. If that woman—using the example to which I have just referred—had both of her children in full-time child care, then she would have paid 12.7 per cent of her disposable income on child care under Labor but would pay only 9.1 per cent of disposable income on child care under us. That is more affordable. If both children were in part-time child care, which could be the case—because if she is a single mum she could be working part time—then she would have paid 8.9 per cent of her disposable income under Labor but only 5.4 per cent now. The program also provided a venue for some simply outrageous comments from Christine Wallace:</para><quote><para>Kids who need places in child-care centres are collateral damage in the Howard government's drive to send women back to the kitchen.</para></quote><para>This is political prejudice masked as informed comment. The real facts are these: women's employment is at record levels and the number of women in jobs is 12.5 per cent higher than when Labor left office. Women's labour force participation is up. They are not being driven back to the kitchen. They are flooding into the work force and they are getting jobs.</para><para>The total number of child-care places has increased from 306,500 in 1996 to 457,000 in 2001, which is an increase of 50 per cent in just over four years. There are nearly 30,000 more child-care places in long day care than there were in 1996, which represents a 13 per cent increase. Our spending on child care is at record levels. Over the last four years we spent $4.3 billion on child care, which is 30 per cent higher in real terms than the amount spent in the last four years of Labor's time in office. Further, we have a commitment to reaching $6 billion in the upcoming year. There is a lot of good information here. Child care is now more affordable for many low income and middle income families. Some families, typically those on higher incomes, use slightly more of their disposable income on child care now than they have done in the past—but I would have thought that Labor senators would have been happy with that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25882</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

At the Press Club last week, the Prime Minister said, `There is no more pressing issue than tackling water quality and salinity issues.' He went on to say, `Our priority is that, as surpluses are available, we give them back through lower income tax.' If salinity is the most pressing issue, why are tax cuts, particularly for high income earners, to be the first call on the surplus? Why, when the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation say that $3 billion a year is needed to fight salinity, has this government allocated just a 10th of that in its national action plan? Is this a case, as the Democrat leader said today at the Press Club, of going for a short-term political fix at the cost of Australia's long-term economic and environmental needs?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25883</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—No, it certainly is not. It is the view of this government, and I would have thought it was obvious, that we are best able to meet these major challenges of natural resource management through a strong economy. Basically we need the wealth base in order to be able to make the investment we as a nation need to make in water quality and dryland salinity issues.</para></talk.start><para>I remind the honourable senator—and I congratulate him on asking his first question—that the government have sponsored a National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, to which we have committed $700 million and which the states, I am pleased to say, have been prepared to equally support. So we now have a fund of $1.4 billion—the largest sum of money ever to be invested in matters of water quality and dryland salinity in this country. Of course, it will be implemented through regional organisations, which will have a responsibility to deliver programs and will be paid on performance. The first ministerial meeting of the new ministerial council set up under that project will take place at the end of this month.</para><para>So this government is tackling the issue of salinity and water quality in a way that no other government in the past has done. This program complements the Natural Heritage Trust, to which this government has now committed an extra $1 billion as well. So that is $1 billion from NHT which will go into the restoration of natural resources in Australia and into sustainable primary production, complementing the $1.4 billion, as I said, that is specifically going into water quality and salinity projects. What that demonstrates is that it is possible to run an economic policy that enables economic growth; in other words, one that keeps taxes down, keeps interest rates down, keeps inflation down, keeps expenditure down and enables the economy to thrive in the way that it is— possibly the strongest economy at the moment in the whole of the developed world— to create the wealth that we can then reinvest in major national projects of importance, such as those I have just mentioned. I am sorry if that is not understood by the Australian Democrats, but that is the way in which we have been so successful for the last 5½ years and the way in which we intend to continue.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25883</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

Does the minister agree with the Prime Minister's assessment on ABC radio last week that funding of the salinity action plan is adequate, that the claims by the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation for 10 times that amount were exaggerated and that tax cuts should still take priority? How does the government respond to criticism by the Queensland Farmers Federation last week that, 10 months into the action plan, it is still unclear how Commonwealth-state funding will be allocated and whether it will apply to coastal river catchments, which in my state of Queensland also face serious salinity problems?  </para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25884</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Queensland signed up to the plan—Queensland has signed the framework agreement. The Queensland government has agreed to specified regions within Queensland being the subject of the investment within Queensland.

So it remains our view that the cornerstone to sound natural resource management is a strong economy, and we are going to continue with that priority.</para></talk.start><para>On the issue as to whether it is enough money, I suspect it will never be enough money. But what I can say is that it is the largest investment ever in these issues by an Australian government—more of a commitment to tackling these issues than ever occurred in the past and a concentration on outcomes rather than just process.

The question, as I mentioned yesterday, was wide ranging and called for the collation of large amounts of material into a format not normally used within the department.</para></talk.start><para>I indicated yesterday that the answer would be tabled today, and it will be. But, in relation to the issues raised by Senator O'Brien yesterday, I am informed by Mr Anderson's office that his office did speak to Senator O'Brien's office on three occasions regarding this question. On the first occasion the office undertook to speak with the department and seek further information on timing, on the second occasion the office informed Senator O'Brien's office that the department was putting the finishing touches to the question on notice and noted that, as the question was wide ranging and required a large amount of detailed information, the question had taken some time to complete and on the third occasion—and this really is the point of this more lengthy than normal response—Senator O'Brien's office was informed that the question had not arrived yet at Mr Anderson's office.</para><para>The department had indicated that the question on notice had been sent to the office; however, Mr Anderson's office had not at that time yet received it. On this basis, Senator O'Brien's office was informed that the office had requested the department to find out exactly where it was in the system. The question on notice arrived in Mr Anderson's office yesterday afternoon and the answer is to be tabled later today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>25887</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the statement.</para></motion><para>It is interesting to note that we have an explanation put on the record today which was not available to the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government yesterday and some comments which seek to respond to the comments which I made in the debate on the motion to take note of the minister's response yesterday. I, again, appreciate that Senator Ian Macdonald is presenting to the Senate the comments that he has been asked by Minister Anderson to present. I was very interested to see the comments in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> today about complaints about Mr Anderson's office from members of the Liberal Party, and I was not surprised about the way my comments were received yesterday.</para><para>In the time between when Senator Macdonald made the comments on behalf of the minister today and now, I have obviously not had the chance to check with my office on the precise words of the communication, but very clearly the indication was given to my office that neither the department nor the minister's office could find the answer to the question which it had previously indicated had been prepared and was with the minister's office. There seems to me to be a discrepancy between what is now being said and the understanding that we were given through the minister's office. I will check further to satisfy myself as to the extent of that discrepancy and how it might be explained. I appreciate that the answers are now available. The comments I made yesterday stand as to the inadequacy of the processes which led to the circumstance we find ourselves in.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>25887</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— In speaking to Senator O'Brien's motion, the reason I went on at some length to indicate the facts was the way in which Senator O'Brien intimated that the matter had been dealt with and had been responded to by Mr Anderson's office. It was not, I am informed, lost. Nor was Senator O'Brien's office—I do not think it was Senator O'Brien but his office—told it was lost. The facts are as I have related them today. It had been sent from the department and when Senator O'Brien's office spoke to Mr Anderson's office it had not yet arrived. They made inquiries and said they would find out where it was in the system. So I emphasise again that that comment about it being lost was not correct. </para></talk.start><para>Can I just go further. I would say to Senator O'Brien that he should not believe everything he reads in the paper. Mr Anderson is the Deputy Prime Minister. He is the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. He has a very busy portfolio. He has an excellent staff, an excellent chief of staff and a very busy office. Unfortunately—and fortunately—at all times with the number of questions we get in estimates and elsewhere our department answers more questions than practically all other departments put together. The opposition are entitled to do that, and we are required to respond and we do. But an enormous demand for resources is put on our department because of the inordinate number of questions asked by the opposition of, principally, the department of transport.</para><para>I have related to the Senate before that simply answering the opposition's questions at one estimates committee cost the department almost $90,000—$90,000 just to answer questions! If they were the sorts of questions that were going to bring down the government tomorrow, as a political professional you would almost grudgingly say, `Well, that's fine,' but the questions seek an interminable amount of detail that is available, in some instances, elsewhere—a lot of it is in reports—and collating it is enormously difficult for a very busy department which has a lot of issues on the go. That was the situation. Mr Anderson runs the portfolio extremely well and extremely efficiently.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>25888</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was going to raise this tomorrow and still will, but I am not going to let the opportunity go by to indicate Senator Ian Macdonald's own record in relation to questions on notice. As of today, we have 97 questions on notice outstanding from his direct portfolio area from estimates. We have, as of today, received only two from the regional services, local government and territories area of the Department of Transport and Regional Services. There are 97 outstanding. These questions on notice were due on 13 July and 19 July, respectively. This is an absolute disgrace. The coalition chair of the legislation committee has written to Senator Macdonald indicating that the legislation committee is not happy with his record. This was the subject of comment, unanimously, by the estimates committee report itself, including all of Senator Macdonald's coalition colleagues.</para></talk.start><para>It is okay for Senator Macdonald to stand up and talk about inane questions. The reality is that, in the last estimates, Senator Macdonald refused to allow the departmental officials to appear on issues like Roads to Recovery—he refused to allow them to come to the table and answer questions—so we were forced to put a number of questions on notice. I would also like to make the point that Senator Macdonald actually sent an AFFA official to the back of the room when asking questions on flood mitigation—probably the most embarrassing experience I have had in my five years in estimates. So I take this opportunity to ask Senator Macdonald, this most recidivist of ministers: where are the 97 outstanding questions on notice? I indicate that I will be raising this again tomorrow.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>25888</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Business Tax Reform: Small Business</title><page.no>25888</page.no></subdebateinfo></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Small Business</title><page.no>25888</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>25888</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston) to questions without notice asked by Senators Schacht and Crowley today relating to taxation and small business. </para></motion><para>Again we had a very poor performance in question time today by the government on the sensitive subject of the GST and the business activity statement—the albatross around the government's neck or, more particularly, the albatross that the government has placed around the neck of small business in Australia by burying them under paperwork and forcing them to take time out of their business to be tax collectors. </para><para>I would like to do a little comparing and contrasting. The Howard government has brought down a new and allegedly simplified business activity statement. TMP Worldwide Surveys surveyed 6,500 Australian businesses on the question of the new form and 73 per cent of the respondents to that survey found that the new form was as complex and difficult as the old form. Those are the facts of the matter established by an independent survey. Contrast that with this: Labor has explained its roll-back and simplification program to the small business community and, after doing so, Robert Bastian, the Chief Executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia and the recognised spokesperson on behalf of small business in Australia, said of Labor's simplified proposals on the business activity statement:</para><quote><para>I say with absolute clarity that the members of the association who were in the room were very impressed with the idea because it was so simple. </para></quote><para>On one hand, the government's business activity statement is as complex—according to 73 per cent of small business—as the old one. On the other hand, the small business community is saying through their spokesman that Labor has got a better plan. Let us make that comparison and contrast clear.</para><para>Secondly, the Yellow Pages Business Index shows that, of the seven most important reasons cited by critics of the government's policy, six were related to the GST and the business activity statement. We know that to be true because I have here a leaked government cabinet submission from the Minister for Small Business himself in which he says to his colleagues in the secrecy of the cabinet room: `The strong message delivered by small business is that much more needs to be done.' The government knows that it has got it wrong. It does not say this publicly; it says in the confidentiality of its cabinet room that much more needs to be done. </para><para>Let me compare that to what Mr Bastian said in response to Ian Macfarlane, the Minister for Small Business, who was saying publicly that the small business sector was happy with existing arrangements—note the difference in what he says privately—and that they did not want Labor's roll-back. Macfarlane says, on behalf of this government, that small business does not want Labor's roll-back. What does Bastian, on behalf of Australian small business, say of that? He says:</para><quote><para>I don't believe that. The main concern as reported to me is the paperwork itself.</para></quote><para>On the one hand, in secrecy, the government is admitting its mistakes but on the other hand, in public, it is claiming there are not any. That is the government's position. The small business community is rejecting what the government is saying. They say that Labor has got its roll-back, in terms of simplifying the GST and the business activity statement, right. They do not believe the government.</para><para>Let me go to another compare and contrast. Today we had the usual diatribe from Senator Alston and the one that we have come to recognise from him and Senator Kemp about `All's well; small business never had it so good.' In the June quarter, business bankruptcies in Australia were up by 78 per cent over the same period last year. What was notable about the period last year? We did not have the GST. What is notable about the period now? We do. Bankruptcies in small businesses are up 78 per cent. Senator Alston says, dismissing the concerns of small business, `Well, it is the fault of many of the small business managers.' I put to him—despite the fact that the senator is not in the chamber and is hiding from this debate, and he should be here to answer—if an increase of 78 per cent is of no concern to him, and if it is his contention that it is not because of the GST, where else in the economy has the government got it wrong? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>25890</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I find it hard to get into these debates because they seem to escape reality.

What has become public in the last 24 hours is a cabinet document prepared by the Minister for Small Business and the Office of Small Business, which outlines a so-called new agenda for this government to try to restore its popularity in the small business community. The document is reported on in many newspapers today. I note that the minister, Senator Alston, is saying that the Federal Police are investigating how this leak took place. One of the things we all know in Australian politics is that, once the leaking of cabinet documents starts, the government is on the slippery dip to political oblivion. Senator Alston called it a cabinet `working paper' today. He did not actually call it a submission but he acknowledged that it existed and called it a `working paper'. When these things happen—when there is a leak and the content becomes public—and when we see what the government is desperately trying to do, we know the government is on that slippery dip to political oblivion. </para></talk.start><para>This working paper, as Senator Alston called it—and I will use that phrase because he is the minister representing the small business minister—puts page after page of new proposals on industrial relations as they could affect small business. Most of the proposals have been previously rejected by this Senate as not necessary, as unworkable, as not required or as not called for by the small business community. Apparently, what the document does not do in all its endless pages is deal with the issue of further simplification of the business activity statement and the impact of the administration of the GST on small business. That is given a big miss. </para><para>One of the newspapers today reports that this working document says that, despite the previous changes made a couple of months ago to the BAS, small business is still overwhelmingly upset about it. Despite what the government has done under political pressure, small business is still overwhelmingly troubled by the paperwork required for the GST. In this parliament over the last three years we have seen the tax act go from about 2,500 or 3,000 pages to 8,000 pages. There have been 5,000 new pages to the tax act, all to introduce the new, `reformed' tax system—the GST and all its measures. How can it be tax reform and simplification when the tax act increases by 5,000 pages? This all requires small business to fill in more forms. You can imagine what would happen if a Labor government had introduced a measure that required only 10 per cent of extra pages. The opposition, the Liberal Party, would have screamed its head off.  </para><para>So we have the extraordinary position that the only way the government thinks it can get some popularity back is to drag up the hoary old chestnut of industrial relations as it affects small business. For most small businesses—and all the surveys show it—it is not the issue they are concerned about. One of the proposals in this working document, as Senator Alston calls it, is to ban or limit trade union representatives from having access to the workplace. It is pointed out in the document that this is contrary to Australia's signature to the ILO convention which guarantees in a democracy free access to the workplace. The government has even had to admit that what it wants to do is contrary to our signature to an ILO convention. That is how desperate this government is getting. </para><para>Small business has been made the sucker, the fall guy, for this government. When I look at all the newspaper clippings that have come in today what best sums up this government's attitude to and interest in looking after people is what a Mr Peek, an employee of Tristar, said about his entitlements. The newspaper article states:</para><quote><para>Mr Peek notes that the only time when employees got all their entitlements when a company dudded them was in the National Textiles case, where Mr Howard's brother, Stan, was chairman of the company.</para><para>“It's one law for John Howard's family and one law for everyone else.” </para></quote><para>That sums up this government's policy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>25892</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is always a perversion when the Australian Labor Party seeks to preach to this government about small business. The Labor Party has never understood small business. It has never understood the nature of risk. It has never understood entrepreneurship. It has never understood that behind every successful small business man or business woman lies someone prepared to mortgage their home. A party which primarily comprises union leaders has never understood small business. Every now and then truth breaks out among the ranks of the Labor Party. Recently it was Senator Conroy but last year it was Mr Beazley. On Perth radio, on 7 August last year, he said: </para></talk.start><quote><para>We have never pretended to be a small business party. </para></quote><para>That is right—all the Labor Party is concerned about with respect to small business is scare tactics. As my friend Senator Boswell said in a very eloquent fashion, one of the primary difficulties for small business is the fact that Labor supported, and still supports, the job destroying unfair dismissal laws. According to the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, the abolition of this law could create up to 50,000 jobs per year—jobs for the people whom the Australian Labor Party says it represents. The Labor Party has never represented the workers of Australia; it simply seeks to represent the trade unionists of Australia. That is a very different thing.</para><para>Labor has also removed the flexibility in the industrial relations system by promoting union interest and operating centralised awards. Just this year in the Senate Labor blocked an amendment to the Trade Practices Act which would have given the ACCC more power to take action on behalf of small business, protecting them from secondary boycotts. I have to admit that Labor was initially in favour of the bill. The Democrats will remember that it was in favour of it, but what happened? The trade union movement put pressure on the Labor Party, the Labor Party buckled and then was against the bill.</para><para>Senator Schacht and Senator Cook spoke about the business activity statement. The Howard government has listened to the concerns of small business about the BAS and has simplified the system. This will benefit businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million annually, and that is about 90 per cent of all businesses. These changes include simpler quarterly remittance forms with minimal information requirements, the choice of letting the tax office calculate an estimate of a small business quarterly GST liability, the fact that half a million people are no longer required to lodge instalment activity statements, and a new PAYG option for almost two million taxpayers who need no longer calculate their own tax liability every quarter.

It is because none of them have actually worked in business. They have spent their entire lives working for the trade union movement.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—You're all lawyers.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84M</name.id><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name></talker><para>—They have never taken a risk in their life.

The question by Senator Schacht in relation to the business activity statement and the question by Senator Crowley regarding the GST were very specific but, as usual, we did not get a specific answer from the minister. What we did get was a tirade of nonsense about what he believed in his own small mind to be an issue that prevents small business from progressing in this country. He dismissed the question and went on with a tirade of nonsense about the effects of unfair dismissal laws, enterprise bargaining, patent bargaining and industrial laws on small business. We were not asking about that. The fact is that he was wrong.</para></talk.start><para>It is very clear when we look at the Yellow Pages business index that industrial relations did not rate a mention. What is concerning small business is the lack of work and sales, the GST and cash flow. The index shows that the GST has had a negative impact on the capacity of consumers and businesses to spend, thus the declining level of business activity for small business. The weakest industry sectors for this quarter were manufacturing, at minus 31 per cent; wholesale trade, minus 31 per cent; and building and construction, minus 23 per cent.</para><para>There was no mention at all about the effects of the industrial relations law. The truth is that small business do not rate this very highly at all. What they rate highly as causing them the most concern are the complexities of the BAS and the impact of the GST on their businesses. One has only to walk down any street in any business community and ask the operators, the owners, of the businesses or go to the small manufacturing operators and ask them what is the biggest concern they have. They will continually tell you that it is the impact of the GST on their business and the complexities and the time they are spending filling out their BAS forms. That is what is affecting them. Taxation Institute director, Michael Dirkis, was of the opinion that:</para><quote><para>One telling feature of the new tax system is that prior to tax reform Australia was moving towards a paperless tax system, with more than 70 per cent of returns lodged electronically.

Dunn and Bradstreet economist Duncan Ironmonger said that the expectations for growth in profits, employment and capital investment showed only a weak recovery and that the economy could experience two more quarters of negative growth in these areas. The Managing Director of Dunn and Bradstreet Australia and New Zealand, Christine Christian, said that the rise in expectations was a small step towards recovery but that questions remained about whether it would last. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parliamentarians: Entitlements</title><page.no>25895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>25895</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Abetz) to a question without notice asked by Senator Murray today relating to Audit Report No. 5 of 2001-2002 on parliamentarians' entitlements.</para></motion><para>This relates to the issue of the ANAO's report into parliamentarians' entitlements, which was tabled yesterday. The minister's response was useful today because he indicated two major things. Firstly, he indicated that the government would indeed fast-track a response to a number of essential and urgent issues in that report—these are my words, not his, but that is the summation of them. Secondly, he indicated that the government would move to end the excessive use of entitlements by a minority. As an example of that excessive use, I refer senators to figure 5.2 on page 181 and figure 5.3 on page 182 of the report. There is a reference to the average cost, the lowest cost and the highest cost of the use of personalised stationery, newsletters and other printing. For members of the House of Representatives, the lowest cost was $1,294, the average cost was $37,287 and the highest cost was $219,004. The average cost for senators was $7,103.</para><para>It is not well enough understood in the community how appreciably different a senator's role is from a member's role, and it is perfectly in order for members of the House of Representatives to have a higher expenditure in this area than senators because of a very different publicity requirement. That is not the issue; what is at issue is excessive use. This is not a capped area. If you look at the 148 members of the House of Representatives, you will find that a large majority of them in fact have relatively modest use, despite the very high calls on them to publicise material within their constituencies. For instance, 55—which would be a third— members are in the expenditure range of $0 to $25,000. A further 58—another third—are in the expenditure range of $25,000 to $50,000. Another 20 are in the expenditure range of $50,000 to $75,000. In other words, 120 out of the nearly 150 members of the House of Representatives are below $75,000, with most of them below $50,000. However, right at the top there is one person with an expenditure of $219,000 and four persons with an expenditure of between $100,000 and $125,000. Frankly, that is just not on. It is excessive. It is a pity that it has taken this long for that kind of excessive use to be drawn to our attention. I would hope that the government would move urgently to cap that area and to introduce far better auditing situations and, if there has been abuse—as opposed to excessive use—to notify the parliament of the results of any inquiry into it.</para><para>The other point about the inquiry is that it was initiated by the Australian Democrats— by me—and it had the support of the Labor Party and of the cross-benches. It was not enough remarked in the media that in the end the Senate acted to help clean this up. The Senate took that initiative, and I think that as a Senate we need to get some credit for doing this. There was very little mention of it in the media and I thought that was a pity because in the last 5½ years this parliament has seen quite drastically improved accountability in this area, and I believe this report will initiate even greater accountability and much improved systems. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>25895</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—A petition has been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Occupational Health and Safety Legislation</title><page.no>25895</page.no><no.signed>157</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>3M6</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Murray</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Federal Parliament:</para><para>The petition of certain employees of the Commonwealth draws the attention of the Senate to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 and the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2000.</para><para>The Bills contain proposals that would:</para><para>·	disadvantage injured and ill employees; and</para><para>·	unravel current workplace health and safety consultative arrangements and committees.

Senator Murray and others involved in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment Bill earlier this year will recall how this motion came about. As I recall, the amendments that were discussed which were supported by Labor at the time were not supported by the government. However, the government took the view at that time that it was desirable to see the legislation as a whole go through because the positive benefits of it outweighed the negative aspects of the amendments. At the time, as I recall, I indicated that the government would be happy to see this matter referred to the committee.</para></talk.start><para>The government still regards these amendments as undesirable. As a matter of policy, we do not support the proposals that are under consideration but, by standing by my commitment to the senator at the time, the government does not stand in the way of these matters being considered further by the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. As they said in the old Newcastle song, never let a chance go by, so I would plead with the Democrats: while they are considering these matters that relate in a serious way to corporate law matters and the legal environment in which companies work, this would be a tremendous opportunity for Senator Murray, after the passage of more than a year in relation to takeovers reform in Australia, to now review the potential for economic benefit to Australia in bringing in the follow-on rule in relation to mergers and acquisitions. We know that would create significant benefits particularly in the information, communications and technology area in Australia, an area in which Australia is doing so well. If only you could get rid of our archaic takeover laws and bring in a modern, forward looking mergers and acquisitions regime which would allow smaller ICT companies to merge and to build international strength.</para><para>I again appeal to Senator Murray: it is not too late; we could put the legislation through in this session and build so many tens of thousands of new jobs with that one brilliant reform proposed by the government. Senator Murray is willing, I think, to look at the necessity of that. This would be a tremendous opportunity to see these matters considered at the same time, so we look forward to Senator Murray bringing forward a review of takeovers reform at the earliest possibility.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>25900</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—On behalf of the opposition, particularly my colleague the shadow minister for small business, Mr Fitzgibbon, we are not opposing this motion. We believe that it may well have been better to have waited till the three years ran out on the sunset arrangement for reinstituting the select committee on retail, which sat and reported a couple of years ago. There was a recommendation there that, if concentration in the grocery market in particular was still considered to be a problem, the parliament reserved the right to reinstitute that select committee of both houses to look at some of the issues that are in Senator Murray's motion. We would have probably favoured waiting until that period had expired so that there was a select committee of both houses together dealing with the issue, as there was on the retail matter, which committee I, Senator Murray, I think, and others served on. The issues in his motion were all discussed directly and indirectly as we discussed the issue of the retail market. </para></talk.start><para>The opposition has no objection to the quality and content of the two terms of reference (a) and (b) in themselves. I cannot object to that because, if one goes back over my record when I was a member of the legal committee of the Senate, back 10 years, you will find me on the record as signing a minority report, with then Senator Spindler, wanting to have the power to divest as a standing power in the Trade Practices Act of Australia. I am still of that view. I know that is a controversial view, but it is in term of reference (b) and, as I say, was in the retail inquiry when we found that about three companies had around 70 per cent of the dry grocery business of Australia—and it is probably getting even more concentrated. These issues are of concern.</para><para>As for the reversal of the onus of proof, I cannot criticise that. I have expressed views similar to this and, as a former minister for small business, I think these are worthwhile measures to be considered. Nevertheless, the motion is now before us. I still think that the retail committee may have to be reinstituted as a joint select committee in the next year or so. I think there will still be major issues of concentration in that industry which do affect the running of our national economy. I am not a member of the Legal and Constitutional Committee, but as I can be a participating member at some of the hearings I look forward to the inquiry. The opposition are therefore not opposing this.

However, the bill also allows the Attorney-General to exempt certain material from disclosure to the Ombudsman. The Democrats' concern is that this provision is too broadly drafted and would allow the Attorney-General to require the non-disclosure of almost any information relating to the National Crime Authority. People are entitled to have recourse to an effective complaints mechanism in respect of the NCA. We are wary of curtailing the Ombudsman's ability to obtain information to the extent that the complaints mechanism is rendered ineffective. Under this amendment, the Attorney-General will be able to exempt information from disclosure where its disclosure would endanger the life of a person or would create a risk of serious injury to that person. This is a reasonable limitation, but the Democrats are mindful of the need to monitor the use of this provision to ensure that it is not abused.

This is to be a committee that will subsume and replace the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority. Our proposed Commonwealth law enforcement committee would exercise scrutiny across the whole ambit of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. It would include the AFP, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Customs Service, the National Crime Authority, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, AUSTRAC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and other Commonwealth agencies having a law enforcement function which exists or may be established. </para><para>We are driven by a deep understanding that Commonwealth law enforcement is of vital importance. Criminal activity poses serious threats to the stability of our society and its institutions, so we need a sophisticated, cooperative, integrated national and international approach to law enforcement. We believe that this approach needs to exist in our law enforcement agencies, in law enforcement itself, in its policies and in parliamentary processes. The proposed parliamentary joint committee will, we propose, be tasked to oversight all law enforcement agencies. It will inform the national parliament, it should build on an extensive store of knowledge and it should play a vital role in the development of an integrated structure of law enforcement, with integrated tactical and planning strategies and processes. Establishing this committee is a real attempt to put mechanisms in place which will provide for national oversight and a parliamentary process which enables and provides the basis for good strategic planning. </para><para>This is the third time that the opposition have attempted to have such a committee established. We believe that it is in the national interest to do so, and we will continue to pursue this objective. A single committee with a good understanding of the totality of our law enforcement needs should ensure that no political party is caught up just in short-term political debate about where funding ought to be directed. It will also strengthen the oversight role of the parliament and will help guard against improper use of power by any Commonwealth law enforcement agency. We believe that we need parliamentary scrutiny of all law enforcement agencies, not just the NCA. There is currently no committee which has jurisdiction to scrutinise the AFP in the way that the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority can oversee NCA budgetary, employment, legislative and operational matters. The AFP, for instance, conducts controlled operations. It uses listening devices and other surveillance mechanisms and it has powers of arrest, detention and questioning. It is a police agency and we believe that it should have parliamentary oversight. I have moved these amendments in the belief that such oversight is quite desirable for our national system and would also provide a good mechanism for policy formulation for the national parliament. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>25905</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We Democrats acknowledge the value in establishing a committee to monitor Commonwealth law enforcement bodies.

Effectively, the amendments would do as Senator Greig said: diminish any scrutiny of the National Crime Authority. The parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority was set up for a very good reason: because of the powers given to the NCA and the special place that the NCA enjoys. The government is of a firm view that there should be a joint parliamentary committee which is devoted to scrutiny of the NCA. </para></talk.start><para>This proposal would result in looking at other aspects of law enforcement and would give the new committee an extraordinarily wide application and, in broadening that application, would no doubt diminish its ability to pay due scrutiny to those aspects that require it.

It will improve the integrity and fairness of Australia's taxation system. </para><para>The new thin capitalisation regime will be more effective in preventing an excessive allocation of debt for tax purposes to the Australian operations of multinationals and will help make sure that Australia obtains a fair share of tax from those who operate internationally. </para><para>In relation to operations in Australia, the bill denies tax deductions for debt expenses (mainly interest) in cases where the debt funding of the operations exceeds certain levels. For banks, the tests are framed as a minimum equity capital requirement. </para><para>This bill also amends the current income tax law to change the rules on the deductibility of interest expenses for Australians investing offshore. </para><para>To reduce compliance costs for small and medium enterprises, the new regime will not apply to taxpayers or groups of taxpayers claiming annual debt deductions (eg, interest expenses) of $250,000 or less.</para><para>In addition, the bill will allow Australian branches of foreign companies to borrow internationally without having to pay withholding tax on the subsequent interest payments. </para><para>The current thin capitalisation measures, the existing provisions dealing with the capitalisation of foreign bank branches and the existing debt creation regime will be repealed.</para><para>The new thin capitalisation regime will apply from the start of a taxpayer's first year of income beginning on or after 1 July 2001. This will accommodate taxpayers with substituted accounting periods and, together with other transitional measures in the bill, gives all taxpayers more time to comply with the new regime. </para><para>As a further transitional measure, companies can elect that the current rules apply until 30 June 2004 for interests that were issued before 21 February 2001. This election is in the New Business Tax System (Debt and Equity) Bill 2001. Where that election is made, the instruments will be afforded transitional treatment in the new thin capitalisation regime.</para><para>The Government released exposure draft legislation in February 2001 and has consulted extensively with business in the development of these measures, and is confident that the new measures strike an appropriate balance between revenue protection and facilitating commercial arrangements.</para><para>Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the presented explanatory memorandum.</para><para>I commend the bill and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>—————</para><para>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (DEBT AND EQUITY) BILL 2001</para><para>The New Business Tax System (Debt and Equity) Bill 2001 introduces a new approach for determining what constitutes equity in a company and what constitutes debt in an entity. The new rules implement the general approach recommended by the Ralph Review of Business Taxation for distinguishing debt from equity. </para><para>The debt/equity rules provide greater certainty and coherence than is attainable under the current law. </para><para>Importantly, the Bill explains how the debt/equity borderline is drawn for tax purposes. The rules determine whether returns on an interest may be frankable or may be deductible. </para><para>The test for distinguishing debt interests from equity interests focuses on a single organising principle - the effective obligation of an issuer to return to the investor an amount at least equal to the amount invested. This test seeks to minimise uncertainty and provide a more coherent, economic substance based test that is less reliant on the legal form of a particular arrangement. </para><para>There is an extended definition of equity based on economic substance (broadly speaking, interests that raise finance and provide returns contingent on the economic performance of a company constitute equity, subject to the debt test).</para><para>The definition of debt interest also constitutes a key component of the proposed thin capitalisation regime (contained in the New Business Tax System (Thin Capitalisation) Bill 2001) since it is used to determine what deductions may be disallowed. </para><para>This bill amends the dividend and interest withholding tax provisions so that the borderline between the provisions is consistent with the new debt/equity borderline.

It makes permanent the transitional provisions that have applied since 20 August 1996. These are measures which were announced in the budget on 22 May this year. We should also note that this particular piece of legislation is the 16th bill that has been presented to the Senate that deals with issues relating to the so-called surcharge.</para></talk.start><para>The bill will ensure that only the post-20 August 1996 amount of an employer eligible termination payment taken as cash will be taken into account for the purposes of the surcharge tax. This reverses the current situation that makes all of the retained amount of an employer eligible termination payment, including amounts relating to pre-20 August 1996 service, accountable for the surcharge tax. This particular provision has been roundly—and, I might say, rightly— criticised as being inequitable. This criticism commenced with the announcement of the so-called surcharge provision in the budget of 1996. I was amongst the many critics of this particular aspect of the legislation.</para><para>The bill also provides that only a notional amount of an employer eligible termination payment is included in the calculation of the employee's adjusted taxable income for surcharge tax purposes. This will benefit employees or former employees who would not normally be subject to the so-called surcharge but could become liable to pay the surcharge in a given year as a consequence of receiving an employer eligible termination payment.  </para><para>The bill will also ensure that employees will not have to pay an effective tax rate higher than the top marginal tax rate plus the Medicare levy when taking their ETP as cash. Currently, some people may face a higher effective tax rate, due to the interaction of the termination payment surcharge and the reasonable benefit limits provision. The estimated cost to government revenue is $14 million in 2001-02, $21 million in 2002-03, $17 million in 2003-04 and $21 million in the next financial year. </para><para>Whilst we are on the issue of revenue— and I would like the duty minister to take this matter back to the Assistant Treasurer—there was a second reading amendment passed to a piece of superannuation legislation earlier in the week requesting that the Senate be provided with the revenue details in the forward estimates from the so-called surcharge. At the moment, they are hidden in general tax revenue collected from superannuation. The Senate has requested that these figures be provided.</para><para>The Labor opposition will be supporting this legislation. Indeed, it takes up—as I referred to earlier—one of the Labor Party's suggestions and original criticisms of this measure. Of course, it is not just Labor opposition members who have been calling for change in this area. This aspect has been criticised by many reputable and respected organisations who have knowledge of superannuation in the general community, including some members of the government. I referred earlier in the week to the very effective role that the Western Australian Liberal senator Senator Lightfoot has been playing in Western Australia. At the recent Liberal Party conference he was successful in ensuring that the conference unanimously condemned the introduction of the surcharge tax. Congratulations, Senator Lightfoot. Keep up the good work.</para><para>The termination payment surcharge came into effect on 20 August 1996. It is imposed on what might be described as golden handshakes paid on termination of employment of so-called high-income earners. Termination payments are the retained amounts—that is amounts not rolled over or transferred into a superannuation fund—of eligible termination payments made by employers on the termination of an employment of an employee. This is generally in circumstances of redundancy. So we had a double whammy here. Not only did many employees go through the harshness of redundancy but then they were being slugged retrospectively with the so-called surcharge. In many cases, they were employees earning less than the surcharge tax minimum threshold level—an absolutely outrageous situation. I will refer to a couple of practical examples a little later.</para><para>The Liberal government announced in the 1996-97 budget that a surcharge would apply to contributions that are subject to a tax deduction, including employer contributions and those made by members, where there is no employer contribution and the deduction had been claimed and where the assessable income and superannuation contributions exceeded $70,000. This $70,000 figure has been indexed and it is now, I believe, approximately $85,242. Since 1999-2000, the so-called reportable fringe benefits of an employee are taken into account in working out superannuation surcharge tax liabilities.</para><para>The government introduced a transition period that was scheduled to expire at the start of July. Following the expiry of the transition period, all of the termination payments accrued after 30 June 1983, even entitlements accrued prior to the introduction of the surcharge tax legislation, were to be subject to the surcharge. Criticisms of the surcharge have been subject to significant debate, particularly here in the Senate. I might refer here to the 23rd report of the former Senate Select Committee on Superannuation titled <inline font-style="italic">Superannuation surcharge legislation</inline>, which sets out in very comprehensive detail many of the concerns that have been raised. I acknowledge in the chair here in the Senate today the chair of that committee. I do not want to embarrass Senator Watson unduly, but I know that he has raised concerns about the adverse impact of this surcharge in the number of ways in which it is applied inequitably to people in the Australian community. </para><para>One of these concerns is the question of inequity in the transitional provisions for the termination payment surcharge. The definition of assessable income includes termination payments or golden handshakes. But inclusion of termination payments can result in lower income persons, not simply high income people, being liable for the surcharge. I referred earlier to someone losing their job as a result of redundancy. In their working life up to the point of redundancy they might earn $50,000 or $60,000, but in the year of redundancy, because of the impact of the surcharge tax, their income may be inflated due to the redundancy payout and that then takes them into surcharge tax territory: they cross the minimum threshold.</para><para>Despite the Liberal government having been made aware of these sorts of problems—not just through me, not just through industry organisations, not just through well-informed government backbenchers but also through the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation—it has taken these past four years for some of these issues to be addressed. We were going to face the situation where the full 15 per cent surcharge would apply to most substantial taxable separation payments so that before the age of 55 the normally unfunded super tax of 31.5 per cent for post-1983 benefits and the 15 per cent surcharge, a total of 46.5 per cent tax, would apply on taxable separation payments. There would have been thousands of Australian employees—or former employees, after redundancy—who would have been caught in the surcharge net, and thousands of these employees would not have been earning anywhere near the minimum commencement income for the application of the surcharge tax.</para><para>The Department of the Parliamentary Library's Information and Research Services, as we know, produce papers and analyses from time to time. I was reading through one of their reports recently, and they referred to the surcharge legislation. I could not put it better myself when they stated:</para><quote><para>... the surcharge legislation remains on the statute books. Many of the witnesses to the 23rd report of the former Senate Select Committee on Superannuation provisions will still be dealing with the complex administration, clumsy assessment procedures and on-going administration costs that are born not just by high income earners, but by all superannuation fund members.</para></quote><para>I am indebted to my colleague in the other place Mr Kelvin Thomson, our shadow minister for superannuation, for outlining the particular problems of a former bus driver who worked for the Brisbane City Council. He was earning a modest $17 an hour. Over the course of 22 years, he had built up in his superannuation account some $70,000. People who know something about superannuation know that $70,000 over 22 years is not such a significant amount in the context of superannuation. On the closure of that defined benefit fund that he was a member of and the establishment of an accumulation fund in its place, he and other members rolled over their money into that new accumulation fund. Bear in mind the closure of the fund: he was not taking his money out at that point in time or not technically taking it out; he was taking his money out of the closed defined benefit fund and transferring it into the accumulation fund. That bus driver earning $17 an hour was presented with a tax bill of $10,000. That sort of anomaly highlights all too well the sorts of problems with this surcharge tax that is claimed to be an equity measure. It has impacted far beyond high income earners. </para><para>My colleague Mr Thomson also outlined some interesting examples of other problems that have emerged with the application of the tax to defined benefit funds. He refers—and I will not have time to go into the detail here—to some interesting examples provided to him by the Australian and International Pilots Association. Regrettably, the government has had its head in the sand on the issue for the last four years, and some of these issues are now only just being dealt with.</para><para>I would also like to refer to another problem drawn to my attention by the Labor member for Charlton, Ms Hoare. This involves shiftworkers at the Eraring power station. They are entitled to the employee's base wage and have superannuation guarantee payments based on that base wage. When they are assessing income, they have the base salary plus 20 per cent allowances, so their income is well below the superannuation surcharge tax levy lower limit. But the Australian Taxation Office applies the superannuation surcharge levy to the state government employee's base wage plus actual allowances of 37.7 per cent plus employer superannuation contributions, which puts the income above the superannuation surcharge levy upper limit for the purposes of the surcharge tax. You could understand that a worker in a situation like that, where their entitlements are calculated on one salary but their taxation liabilities are calculated on a different salary, would be very unimpressed. I have referred in the Senate to another example in my home state of Tasmania in respect of mine workers working at Roseberry on Tasmania's west coast. Having regard to these sorts of anomalies, Labor has indicated that we intend to have a review of superannuation. </para><para>This Liberal-National Party government has no vision whatsoever in relation to superannuation. In fact, all the evidence that has emerged and the stated intention of the Prime Minister in recent weeks indicates there is an ideological problem there. I noted an on-the-public-record comment by one of the Prime Minister's advisers, Mr Morris, at a recent IFSA luncheon where he expressed concerns about the government not agreeing with compulsory superannuation. Not only is the government opposed to superannuation but every action it takes actually cuts the final retirement income outcome for people from their superannuation funds.</para><para>The importance of superannuation is that it is, together with the age pension, the primary income vehicle for our ageing population. The Prime Minister recently discovered that the ageing population is going to be a problem. Superannuation and the interaction with the age pension are the major ways of preparing for this ageing population. This is an extremely important issue. At the moment, just over one in 10 Australians are over the age of 65. By 2025, almost one in four Australians will be over the age of 65. The objective of superannuation is not just to provide an additional income over and above the traditional age pension but to ensure that the moneys needed to pay for that ageing population are put aside and are there ready for retirees to draw down on when they reach that age and that we do not put too much of a burden on the existing taxpayers—our children and our grandchildren—yet the government remains, it seems to me, implacably opposed to superannuation.</para><para>We have only to look at some of the other actions of this government in the last five years. It failed to deliver the three per cent co-contribution into Australian superannuation accounts. It attempted recently to reduce the protections in the event of theft and fraud. If a member's money is stolen—and that is a very rare occurrence in our system, fortunately—the Labor Party ensured that there was a compensation mechanism to pay back 100 per cent of the moneys that were stolen. The Liberal-National Party wanted to reduce that protection to 80 per cent of the moneys. And there is the new surcharge tax, which is the subject of one aspect of this legislation today. The Prime Minister in the 1996 election said `no new taxes; no increase in existing taxes'. Rightly, there has been significant focus on the promise the Prime Minister gave about the GST. But he and the Treasurer and this government introduced a massive new tax on superannuation. To some extent they have succeeded in hiding that. I do not think the community has woken up to the fact that they introduced this new tax on superannuation, although slowly but surely more and more people are waking up to it. They did it so that they could hide the tax, so that people would not immediately notice it. You would notice it only when you got the assessment notices. More and more people are receiving those. You would notice it when you went to collect your retirement income, when you looked at your statement and saw that you had been surcharged and taxed. This is this government's approach to the ageing population.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—You said you would support the superannuation legislation.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—The prime architect of this legislation, and all the errors and problems, has just walked into the chamber—the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. I would like him to acknowledge that I did in fact criticise and point out the problem that we would have to deal with in this legislation today. The bottom line for this government is they have not added one dollar to the superannuation savings of Australians. They have added administrative complexity, added tax, failed to deliver the increased contributions that they promised and attempted to reduce protections in the event of theft and fraud. What a record! The hypocrisy when we had last week the Prime Minister discovering we have an ageing population and we have to be doing something about it—when the very income we need for people who are entering into retirement is being slugged in this way by this government. We will support this legislation. It corrects one of the errors and one of the problems that we pointed out to the government at the time when they introduced this new tax. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>25915</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats also support the <inline ref="R1337">Superannuation Contributions Taxes and Termination Payments Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline>, which is designed to enhance the equity of the treatment of the termination payment surcharge and superannuation contribution surcharge legislation in accordance with the measures announced in this year's budget. The bill has three objectives. It makes the existing transitional mechanisms permanent where they relate to the portion of a termination payment that is subject to surcharge, it changes how a taxpayer's adjusted taxable income is determined under the surcharge legislation in certain circumstances and it exempts the excessive component of an employer eligible termination payment from liability to the termination payment surcharge.</para></talk.start><para>The termination payment surcharge is imposed on golden handshake payments if the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income for the financial year in question is in excess of the surcharge level for 2001-02. The surcharge begins to be levied when assessable income and superannuation contributions for the year exceed $85,242. The maximum surcharge of 15 per cent is payable when assessable income and superannuation contributions reach $103,507. This legislation will improve equity by ensuring that lower income earners who receive termination payments are no longer eligible for the surcharge. At present, redundancy payments are included in the determination of adjusted taxable income for the year. Such a classification can result in a longstanding low income employee being classified in the surcharge category.</para><para>Whilst the Democrats support this legislation because it attempts to increase equity, it is also important to point out that this government continues to refuse to consider the equitable treatment of same sex couples on matters of superannuation. Whilst this individual measure is desirable, it does not seem to flow from an underlying desire to ensure that all Australians are treated equitably.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>25915</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I appreciate the brevity of the last contribution.

Let me just quote the shadow Assistant Treasurer, who said, `We are going to have a review after the election, if the Labor Party happens to win.' After all this long period of thought and debate and concentration, nothing has emerged whatsoever. Senator Sherry is back on the old superannuation surcharge. As Senator Conroy commented once, Senator Sherry spends about 90 per cent of his time thinking about the superannuation surcharge. You would have thought that there would have been some decent proposals coming forward. It is not unreasonable to expect that someone who thinks so hard and so long about this topic could have come up with some proposals. The astonishing thing is that nothing has happened. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Sherry has gone around and consulted with people, and he has got up and made speeches attacking the surcharge—although, just for the record, the Labor Party supports the superannuation surcharge as part of its policy. Senator Sherry goes off on these frolics. He cannot convince the Labor Party, no proposals come forward and the truth of the matter is, as the Treasurer, who has a nice turn of phrase, has said, the ALP stands for the Australian lazy party. I think that is exactly the truth. It is a very sad reflection on this chamber and on Senator Sherry directly. As a person who is a self-proclaimed expert on super, he has produced so little policy over such a long period of time. It is a very ordinary performance. </para><para>Let me return to the <inline ref="R1337">Superannuation Contributions Taxes and Termination Payments Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline>. The measures in this bill have been widely welcomed because they will improve the overall equity and operation of the surcharge legislation in relation to employer eligible termination payments such as redundancies. I note that the opposition recognise the benefits provided to terminating employees by the bill and will support it. We welcome that support, Senator Sherry.</para><para>The three measures contained in this bill were announced by the government on 22 May 2001 as part of the 2001-02 federal budget. The first measure ensures that only a proportion of a termination payment received that relates to service after 20 August 1996 will be subject to the surcharge. Without this change, transitional provisions covering surcharge on retained termination payments would end on 20 August this year and the full amount of such payment would be subject to the surcharge.

Senator Sherry, you are a singularly ungracious senator.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The issue that was raised is, I understand, in respect of a Brisbane City Council bus driver. The advice that I have received on this matter is that, when benefits are transferred from a defined benefits scheme to an accumulation scheme, the value of the benefit entitlements of the member is determined at that point of time. Where the trustee calculates a member's benefits using a different method from that required for surcharge reporting purposes, any amounts in excess of the previously reported contributions are assessable in the year that they are transferred.</para><para>Frequently when a member converts from defined benefits to accumulation benefits—I think this is very important—there will be an offer of an increase in the member's entitlements to be transferred to the accumulation membership as an incentive to accept the accumulation benefit. In other words, I am putting before the Senate that in this case there is an incentive, an increased benefit, over and above the benefit that would have been offered in the defined benefits scheme as an incentive when you move to an accumulation scheme, and any increased benefits represent contributions in the year that they are received. That may not have been clear in Mr Thomson's comments. I do not know if Senator Sherry has any other information in relation to Mr Thomson that he would like to present to me, but my understanding is that the new schemes, the accumulation schemes, offer increased benefits. This causes the result in Mr Thomson's case that Senator Sherry cited in the debate.</para><para>Senator Sherry raised an issue on behalf of shiftworkers at the Eraring power station relating to the superannuation guarantee earnings phase and the surcharge, and I have some information to lay before the Senate. As is well known, the SG legislation requires employers to make compulsory contributions to a superannuation fund for their eligible employees at a certain level based on the employee's earnings base. In the case of award employees, the contributions are generally determined by reference to the award earnings base; that is, the ordinary time earnings. The earnings base for employees not covered under award arrangements would be the SG default earnings base. My advice is that in most cases this is simply the employee's salary or wages, excluding overtime. The surcharge applies if a person's adjustable taxable income exceeds $85,242 in the current financial year. Employees whose adjusted taxable income exceeds $85,242—that is, they are regarded in this legislation as higher income earners—because of a variety of allowances may be subject to the superannuation surcharge even though the earnings base on which their compulsory superannuation contributions is determined is relatively low.</para><para>I do not know whether Senator Sherry can shed any light on the Labor Party position. There will always be an argument as to the level at which the superannuation surcharge cuts in. The level that the government has determined is reflected in this year's figure of $85,242 as the level which is marked out for higher income earners. We are saying that in calculating this income there may be a variety of allowances that may be subject to superannuation surcharge even though the earnings base on which the compulsory contributions are determined is relatively low. </para><para>I commend this bill to the Senate. The bill reflects a very important aspect of this government: this is a consultative government, a government which goes around listening to people. Some issues were raised with this government; as a result, some changes were made in the legislation. I think this reflects the fact that this bill has—as I understand it—the support of all members in the chamber, which I welcome.

This legislation is about the deregulation of the retail distribution of superannuation. It is about providing greater opportunities for the banks. It is about wrecking existing corporate and industry funds.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Union funds.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—I will take that interjection—and I will come back to that later—that you have made in your total ignorance, Senator McGauran, on this issue. It is about increasing fees, charges and commissions paid to the people who distribute superannuation products. It is about lessening the protections that, currently, members of superannuation funds enjoy in Australia. Labor supports informed choice and in particular its preferred option of investment choice. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me briefly outline the existing superannuation structure, particularly for Senator McGauran's edification. Australia has a number of different types of superannuation funds: so-called do-it-yourself, DIY; corporate funds, mainly big business—Senator McGauran, this impacts on them—industry funds, multi-employer funds, as they are commonly known; public sector funds; and retail funds. All except for the latter are governed by nonprofit trustee structures, and these nonprofit trustees generally tender for the administration, investment and insurance provided.</para><para>Industry funds are multiemployer funds. They have joint employer and employee trustees. Some of the employee trustees are union officials, just as some of the employer trustees are officials of various industry organisations, just as some of them are executives in the business structure of those organisations. So there is joint trustee membership. And, more importantly, for Senator McGauran's information, it requires a two-thirds vote of the trustees to make any decision. So they have effectively a joint veto over each other.</para><para>We saw the extensive spread of industry funds in the late 1980s following what is known as the three per cent productivity award superannuation case. This case required employers, in lieu of a wage increase for employees, to contribute three per cent of ordinary time earnings into what emerged as largely industry funds. At the same time, corporate funds were allowed to continue to exist. I acknowledge that, and I acknowledge generally the very good work they have done over many years.</para><para>The fund to which superannuation moneys are contributed is generally determined by industrial awards and agreements. This was for a very good reason, Senator McGauran, because at the time there was a call from business, particularly small business, that they did not want to have to pay into more than one fund. I think even Senator McGauran can understand that an employer—who might have 20, maybe 100, employees— does not want to have to pay contributions, because of the administrative cost, into separate funds. If you think that the backlash from the business activity statement was significant, you wait and see—we are not going to see this, because I understand this legislation will be defeated—what happens if this legislation is passed and small business have to start contributing superannuation contributions into many different superannuation funds. </para><para>There is a more important reason for the continuation of the current system. A feature of Australia's system is that there is extensive regulation of the retail distribution through the mechanism that I have just outlined. This is important because, generally, the administrative fees decrease as the size of a fund increases. Through the massive size of some of these funds—including corporate funds—they are able to negotiate very effective administrative charges as well as funds management fees and insurance rates, certainly far better rates for administration than we see in the traditional retail product.</para><para>There are still quite a few of these traditional retail products around. They are the real dinosaurs of the industry. These products were characterised by an individual purchasing a superannuation product and often paying the first year's contributions in commission and then often paying one, two or three per cent of future contributions as commission, supposedly to cover administration costs. That is the system that this government wants us to return to—the individual will have to go and purchase a superannuation product—and this is in the name of choice.</para><para>This system has been introduced in two countries: Chile and the United Kingdom. A former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher, deregulated the existing superannuation industry in the United Kingdom. Individuals had to go out and make a choice about where their superannuation contributions were to go. They had to go and buy a product. What occurred was—even amongst people who are educated, and I include in that teachers, for example, and public servants—that people were required to do this and when they went out to buy the individual products following the deregulation of the system, frankly, they got ripped off.</para><para>There was an extensive study done about this, and many of the big insurance companies in the United Kingdom were ordered to repay moneys to people who invested. Unfortunately, a very significant proportion of people do not have sufficient financial literacy to make these decisions. They pulled out of existing funds; they were convinced, often by agents on commission, to go and join an alternative product at a very significant—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—How are you going to keep administration costs down?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—I have touched on administration costs and I might return to the issue for the benefit of Senator McGauran. The highest costs occur where you have a transient work force such as in the hospitality industry or casual employees—employees of that type. The cost of multiemployer funds in this country, including corporate funds, is generally about a dollar a week or $50 a year. You cannot get cheaper—it is a very effective system. Indeed, the United States with, I acknowledge, a very right-wing President Bush is examining the Australian system because the right-wing Republicans are impressed by the efficiency of the delivery of superannuation vehicles in Australia, particularly when you are dealing with compulsory superannuation applying to just about the entire Australian work force.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Deregulation was a catastrophe in the United Kingdom. And likewise in Chile. Chile introduced compulsory private retirement savings accounts under the Pinochet regime. These are characterised, again, by the requirement for an individual to go and purchase their own retirement product. There have been surveys of fees, charges and commissions which have been found to generally take 10 per cent of the contributions flowing in to these particular funds. Indeed, it is a common feature of the Chilean system that incentives are provided for employees to switch from one fund to another: free bikes, free mobile phones and the like are offered to people to switch from one fund to another. This is the outcome that this government would want to see in Australia through this legislation. </para><para>The government has stated that this so-called choice legislation will deal with the proliferation of accounts. This is a legitimate problem in Australia: we have eight million members of superannuation funds with 22 million accounts. Most Australians do not know that they can transfer and consolidate their accounts. But this government legislation does not solve that problem. The theory is that you have an individual account and you take it from workplace to workplace, but this legislation confers the power on the employer and, as an employee moves from one workplace to another, their account may not be acceptable to the employer—so it does not solve the problem.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—It is choice for the employer, not the employee.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—It is choice for the employer, as my colleague Senator O'Brien has remarked. The employer is going to resist genuine choice where an individual wants to place their money in their own fund because of the administrative costs. My personal suggestion for dealing with the proliferation of accounts is automatic consolidation at the end of each financial year, and this is achievable. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Why are fees, charges and commissions important? Why is it important to contain the cost of a private superannuation retirement system? It is very important because superannuation is not an employment generator for the agents and the retail distribution system. Its objective is to maximise the retirement income of the individuals who are part of the system. The government obviously has an important interest in maximising the retirement income of Australians, particularly given the ageing of our population. </para><para>Let me touch on that. Up until the late 1980s, superannuation was mainly the preserve of higher income earners, public servants and the like. The majority of Australians had no superannuation whatsoever. It was the Labor Party that introduced universal superannuation in the late 1980s. We are proud of having introduced universal superannuation, because it showed a vision to deal with the problems of the ageing population that are starting to emerge now and will fully emerge by the year 2020. There will be one in four people over the age of 65 by the year 2025; at the moment it is one in 10. How is this to be paid for? To a significant degree, it will be paid for by universal superannuation introduced by a Labor government in the late 1980s and the subsequent introduction of the superannuation guarantee and the extensive revision and rewrite of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 which, among a variety of measures, included 100 per cent protection in the event of theft and fraud, which this government sought to water down recently and was fortunately defeated. </para><para>The interesting dichotomy of the Australian system is that retail distribution is heavily regulated but that investment takes the most liberal, if I can use that term, free market approach in the entire world. Again, that is of great interest to the American government because, under the Australian system, the trustees, subject to what is called the `prudent man' principle—excuse the sexist terminology but that is the industry terminology—have to spread the investment to ensure that risk is minimised. Subject to that, the moneys are not just invested through the Australian economy—I think about 20 per cent of the investment is overseas—but also through various categories of the Australian economy. That has served Australia well, because under that system we have seen average returns over the last 13 years that have been very impressive. This is not just in one or two funds; right across the industry with only a few exceptions we have seen extremely impressive long-term average returns. It was the Labor Party's superannuation guarantee policy and the Labor's Party's regulatory structure that have seen superannuation grow from about $40 billion in the late 1980s to $497 billion, according to the last APRA superannuation funds trend survey.  </para><para>This is all about an ideological campaign to deregulate the superannuation industry. There is a common misconception, and I do believe a genuine misconception on the part of Senator McGauran—not in the case of his colleagues but in his case—that they are union funds. They are not. I heard allegations in the last election being made by the former director of the Liberal Party that these funds contributed to the Labor Party. This was checked and it was found that a big fat zero was contributed by industry superannuation funds to the Labor Party's election coffers. It was a false allegation.</para><para>The trustee system has served Australia well. The investment approach has served Australia well. We need to not be distracted by false issues that the government raises in this legislation but look at how we are going to improve on the superannuation system, how we are going to add to superannuation savings, to prepare for the ageing population. It would be very unfair to spread the cost of retirees in 20 or 25 years back to our children and our grandchildren. The requirement to increase taxes to fund this would be enormous without the superannuation. Labor have an alternative option. The option we put forward—and I am glad to see it has spread through many of the superannuation funds— is investment choice. You have a menu of investment options: you can pick equities, you can pick overseas investment, you can pick ethical investment. There are a whole range of investments, some riskier than others, some returning higher or lower. The fund member can tick a box and indicate where they want their money to go. </para><para>Interestingly, when we get to the issue of choice, very few people in funds to date have actually exercised an investment choice. The superannuation system that we have is admired by most overseas countries. They wish they could have done the same. They are facing increasing economic, social and political consequences as a result of the ageing population. I do not think Australia will be free of some of that conflict, but at least we have a firm starting base with our pension system funded from budget and our now universal superannuation system. </para><para>It is often argued in the context of choice that we should just leave it to the individual. The argument is that the individual can decide what the complex financial options are for their future. The argument put forward by Senator Kemp and others is that we will educate people to make these decisions if they do not have sufficient knowledge at the present time. Even if you could educate people, it would require a massive education campaign, and any education campaign run by this government would be in the form of a propaganda campaign, telling us how great choice is rather than actually educating people to make sophisticated financial decisions. I put a lot of faith in my pub test. I go down to the local Forth pub and people raise these issues with me.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—I thought it was your local hairdresser.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—My hairdresser has raised it with me, too, Senator Kemp.

All the evidence shows that is the public attitude. I would concede that you can turn some of that around. You can educate some people, but I would submit the majority of people in our community simply do not have those skills at the present time. There is a simple practical problem, too: how do you educate people who are functionally illiterate in our society? The population of employees who are functionally illiterate is about 15 per cent. That means they cannot read a road map; they cannot follow a phone book. How on earth are they going to follow the sophisticated financial prospectuses that are being offered under the government model of choice?  </para></talk.start></continue><para>I would predict a total disaster with this. In some ways, if you wanted to play the devil's advocate and create mayhem, you would allow the government to pass this legislation, and we would see a very similar outcome to the one in Chile and the United Kingdom. The Labor Party are not going to do that. Our primary concern is to protect Australian superannuation savings, a well-designed system that has served this country well, and we will be voting against the second reading of the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>25922</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to oppose the <inline ref="R541">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998,</inline> along with my colleague Senator Sherry. I think this is a very important issue. Whilst I understand that it is most likely that this bill will fail at the second reading, I believe it is important to get a few issues on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record in respect of the issue of choice of funds. As Senator Sherry said, this is an ideologically driven issue and one that we are completely at odds with. If one looks at the issue of superannuation, you realise that superannuation is there to give people security in retirement. On a number of occasions here, I have outlined the three things: security in youth, security at work and security in retirement.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—What was the first one?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—It was security in youth: when you are young. People are entitled to feel reasonably safe and secure in those three phases of their life. Of course, one of the burgeoning areas is security in retirement, which cannot be afforded by the age pension, as Senator Sherry quite rightly said, with our ageing population. The advent of superannuation on a broader basis than what it was originally operating was welcomed indeed. Historically, superannuation was the preserve of executives and people in the corporate sector. It was also extended to public servants. Outside of those people, very few others enjoyed the benefit of superannuation. They had no assurance whatsoever that there would be security in their retirement other than by receipt of the age pension. Those who were excluded included skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers— white-collar and blue-collar workers alike— and full-time, part-time and casual employees. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Historically, these people had been denied, or did not have made available to them, access to superannuation and security in retirement. So their only prospect was to receive the age pension. Of itself, that was never a bright prospect. In the case of my parents, my father was a blue-collar worker. My father did not have access to superannuation. My father did not have access to a secure income retirement benefit when he retired. Today, we are on the threshold of seeing the younger generation gaining the benefits of lifelong superannuation through a compulsory superannuation scheme that will give them at least some prospect of having security in their retirement. As my colleague Senator Sherry quite rightly points out, that is still with a compulsory superannuation system which is short of the mark. Even when it moves to nine per cent next year, it will be well and truly short of the mark when one considers that, to get a reasonable benefit for retirement, one would need to contribute in the order of 15 per cent. Of course, that will not be achieved by choice of fund. It will only be achieved through an extension of the requirements under the superannuation guarantee. </para><para>As Senator Sherry rightly pointed out, we do have an ageing population. We do have this stress on the public purse. We do have this need for security in retirement, for a policy that guarantees people that the payment they will receive will ensure their safety and wellbeing throughout their retirement years. This gets to the very heart of the issue of choice of funds. Under this proposed bill, in my view, people would be subject to a deal of pressure to choose which fund they were to belong to. That pressure could come from high-pressure salespersons; it could come from the employer; it could come from a number of sources. People may feel under adverse pressure to transfer into products that are marketed in a slick and very flash manner—products which might look appealing to the eye in the first instance but which, at the end of the day, offer a hollow return, with those who promote the schemes being the real beneficiaries of those schemes. That is the difficulty that lies ahead with this issue of choice of fund. </para><para>If you go back and look at how we ended up with a retirement policy at all in this nation, you will see that it was certainly no thanks to this government and that it was certainly no thanks to the employers. Whilst I said that they were prepared to look after those who were in a privileged position within employment, they were certainly never of a mind to look after those who were not in a privileged position. In the 1980s the trade union movement's push for award superannuation was the initial breakthrough for workers in this country to get superannuation on a broader basis. </para><para>As a trade union secretary at that time, I was heavily involved in the gaining of superannuation for my members, many of whom were women, many of whom were part-time and casual employees, who had never had any access during their working life to superannuation. So this was a major achievement indeed. But there was monumental resistance from employers to employees gaining access to that superannuation. We spent countless hours in the industrial commission arguing the pros and cons of superannuation, arguing what sort of fund it should be. My union, the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association, was not the only union that was involved in a loggerhead battle with the employers to achieve that minimal breakthrough of three per cent. The three per cent that we were seeking at that stage was nothing more than a deferred wage increase. </para><para>We were not seeking that the money be put into a union fund, because none of these funds were union funds. They have been quite wrongly tagged and labelled over a long period of time as union funds. They were industry funds where there were equal representations of employers and employees. The reason for that was that the employees— whose contributions were being paid not voluntarily but in a compulsory scheme, because it was an award provision and later on was covered by the SG—had some confidence that their investment was being protected such that they could reap the benefits of that in their retirement. I recall the rigorous argument that went on as to the merits and demerits of different funds in the state industrial commission in which I was involved at that stage. It got down to not one single fund but a number of funds. But, at the end of the day, the commission in its wisdom, even in Queensland, recognised and limited the number of funds that people could have access to. That was an important thing indeed. </para><para>The next step that became of paramount importance was that the representatives appointed by both the employers and the employees were there to represent the interests not of the employer and the employee but of the person whose contribution had been made to that fund, to maximise the return for that person and to ensure, at the end of the day, that there was a reasonable retirement fund and benefit for these people. Part of this argy-bargy at the time was the clamouring by the major superannuation firms to try to claw back and get their greasy fingers into the cut of the superannuation cake and, of course, they were excluded. They whinged and whined about that forever and a day because they knew that there was an ageing population. They knew that the superannuation pot would grow and they wanted to get into the action. They wanted a slice of the action. We have already seen a reasonable attempt by the government to appease the banks, which also wanted a slice of that action, by including retirement savings accounts in previous legislation before this chamber. This really boils down to choice of fund, trying to let the snake oil salesmen and saleswomen out there, who over a long period have preyed off other people's prospective benefits, pocket it themselves, line their own pockets and make a killing. Of course, they have been basically excluded by the operation of industry funds. This is an attempt to claw back. Claw-back in this case has a lot of connotations for employees.</para><para>When we look at some of the difficulties to which Senator Sherry alluded—and I will deal with a couple of those in a moment—we need look no further than at the educational issue. Senator Sherry referred to the fact that somewhere in the order of 15 per cent of people are basically illiterate. They are not able to read these much-vaunted key feature statements which are supposed to enable a person to take a considered view as to which fund they should or should not belong to. Mr Silk from the Industry Funds Forum gave evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services. He said, at page 70 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>: </para><quote><para>The Australian Bureau of Statistics' last survey on this—</para></quote><para>and this is on functional illiteracy—</para><quote><para>was released in 1997. They surveyed 9,000 adult Australians, aged between 15 and 74. Forty-six per cent of the Australian population within that age ranked at level 1 or level 2 on a five-level scale of numeracy and literacy. Level 5 is very good, level 4 is pretty good, level 3 is satisfactory. Levels 1 and 2 are unsatisfactory. Forty-six per cent of adult Australians ranked at level 1 or 2. The percentage of people in the work force would be less than that, but it is still very great indeed.</para></quote><para>It is not the people who are able to cope with the system who will have the difficulties under this legislation, it will be those who are vulnerable. These are the people that are vulnerable—the people who do not have the reading skills, the mathematical skills, the business skills. It is not going to affect the corporate end of town. The corporate end of town have at their disposal the technology, the advice, to assist them to make a value choice—and a proper choice—and they have the ability to pay for it. If a couple of dollars go missing in some speculative investment, they are not put on their backside for the rest of their lives. What we have here is the sort of experience that Senator Sherry referred to. He referred to the UK and Chile. When people had the access, they were exposed. They blew everything and found themselves not prospectively in receipt of a benefit on which they could retire with any security.</para><para>So we have a difficulty with this piece of legislation. It is going to make a large group of people who are vulnerable more vulnerable. Currently these people have the right and have the access to choice of investment but, through their own choice, they do not go down that path. One only has to look at the evidence that came before the committee to find that choice of investment has not been taken up in any serious way in the community. This may well be a reflection that account balances have not reached a sufficiently high enough level for people to be stirred into action, but it may be that many people do not feel confident or competent enough, or do not understand the system or the information that is put before them, to enable them to make a value judgment as to what would constitute a reasonable investment for them. I quote from page 75 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard, </inline>reporting the roundtable of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services on Tuesday, 14 December. A witness before the committee, Ms Rubinstein from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, told us, and this refers in part to a witness who had appeared earlier in the day:</para><quote><para>... I think Peter reported some figures from JMI—</para></quote><para>that is, Jacques Martin—</para><quote><para>15,000 members out of two million members had exercised choice. In a large fund that I have something to do with, I think over 1,000 people have exercised choice out of 350,000 members, or 150,000 to 200,000 active members.</para></quote><para>I am not being selective here but, given the time for the second reader, one can find other examples of where there is no clamouring because people do not have the skills, the education, the capacity or the desire to make a choice about their investment. Yet we have the government going down the path of putting this bill before the Senate. They want to open up the field; they want to deregulate the retail superannuation market and open it up to God only knows who. We do not know their credentials, we do not know the push selling that would take place. We do not know what would happen. The consequences, of course, would be borne by those people who are most vulnerable and who would suffer the greatest effects.</para><para>Part of the discussion that we had before the Senate committee was in respect of the key feature statements, which are supposed to be the guiding light for people to make the choice. Having sat through that hearing on 14 December, I cannot recall there being any agreement as to what would constitute a reasonable key feature statement that would allow people to make an informed choice. At the end of the day, we have something that is completely useless to the populace at large. The government should be focusing on ensuring that there is security in retirement for people, and that we do not have people appearing before the Senate select committee telling us how their superannuation retirement benefit had been invested in a scheme that collapsed. We want to see a decent superannuation scheme for Australian people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>25925</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats have always been somewhat ambivalent about providing choice of superannuation funds to employees. For many reasons, some of which have already been raised in this debate, we opposed the government's <inline ref="R625">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998</inline> almost three years ago now. However, it is hard to oppose the principle that all workers should choose where their superannuation goes, especially when some workers are already making quite sophisticated choices and financial decisions. In many instances the choice is being made for them by their employer who, I would argue, in many cases has no more understanding of how our superannuation system works than employees.</para></talk.start><para>Regrettably, after considerable discussion with the government and considerable effort to turn this legislation into an acceptable form, I must advise that we cannot support the bill, even with the government amendments that have been circulated. An argument supporting choice is that employees offered choice will be much more interested in the adequacy of their superannuation retirement income if they have greater control over those funds. This greater level of interest should also encourage higher levels of superannuation savings. We have always said that we believe most workers are better off in corporate and industry superannuation funds, and a choice regime would need to reflect that.</para><para>Industry funds in this country have served Australian workers extremely well. Over recent years industry funds have delivered an averaged 9.6 per cent return; corporate funds, even higher at 10.7 per cent return. That has been with the consistency of 97.5 per cent of funds paying returns of over nine per cent. By contrast, a wide range of private sector commercial funds have not delivered such high returns and have done so with higher fees. In short, the vast majority of workers would, in our judgment, receive better retirement incomes by being members of industry funds than by being pushed into public office schemes. That has been our judgment and that has been at the forefront of our discussions with government over the last period of time. It is very obvious that the majority of workers are not currently equipped to make decisions about where their superannuation should go, and certainly very few workers are in a better position of knowledge than their trustees about the way to invest money.</para><para>The Democrats do not share the pessimism of the ALP about whether in the future this will be the case. We do have faith—I guess you could say—in the opportunities to communicate to workers what superannuation is all about. In fact, the industry, governments and all players in the superannuation sector have failed to get across a very important message to employees about superannuation. It has been my experience that the information provided to employees has been couched in jargon impossible to relate to individuals. It is only in very recent times that the industry has turned this around and is now making great progress. I know there are a number of funds now where members can look on the Internet to find out what their savings are and really engage in that process. We need reform and we need to inform members of superannuation funds about what savings they have and about adequacy. As we all realise, even SG is not likely to deliver the sorts of retirement incomes which most people imagine they will receive.</para><para>As I said, we have been engaged on and off for more than a year in discussions with the government, and we had reached an accommodation on the framework of the choice regime. In order that people understand what we think is necessary for an acceptable choice regime, I want to go through the key principles that were discussed, many of which are reflected in the amendments that have been circulated. The industry was very concerned that choice would be imposed on them, on top of a whole range of other amendments to our superannuation scheme over the past two years, and so the start-up date for this scheme would need to have been well after the financial services reform legislation had been bedded down. The scheme would have encouraged collective agreements, and this certainly was not part of the scope of the original legislation. We would have insisted on a very strong disclosure regime, with long and short form statements which would have been accurate, simple and devoid of jargon and which would have allowed employees to properly compare schemes one with another, looking at fees and charges, exit and entry charges, commissions, death and disability insurance, rates of return and estimated payout figures, together with investment choices available. </para><para>I was very pleased to hear Senator Sherry's remarks about investment choice because, as people in this place will know, the Democrats have been arguing for a long time for employees to have investment choice. We think there are a lot of great advantages in providing investment choice. This is not just about whether the scheme is a managed growth scheme or another type of scheme; it is also about allowing people to make choices about ethical investment, about environmentally sound investment and about putting into place the three stools—the economy, the environment and social good. We think that superannuation offers a great opportunity for us not just to see that retirement savings are there but also to act for good in our community. Investment choice would have allowed people some involvement in the way that money is invested in this country. So, as I said, I was very pleased to hear those remarks from Senator Sherry. It was not the case when the Democrats initiated an inquiry back in 1996, as I remember, into superannuation investment. At that stage, both major parties said that providing choice would be too complex and unnecessary. I am glad to hear that there is a change of heart with regard to the opposition.</para><para>A disclosure regime would have been developed by what was called a `choice consultative committee'. That would have been made up of those with the very best expertise in this field. It is a very complex field indeed, and I certainly do not have the necessary knowledge and expertise to determine what exactly a disclosure regime should look like. There were a lot of different views about this in the industry, but we acknowledge that there were people much better equipped to do that. However, key features statements would have fully disclosed all the fees, charges and commissions, the funds' rates of return, the levels and types of insurance cover and the general risk profiles of the funds, and the statements would have had to be clear and understandable. To promote a more transparent disclosure regime on the impact of fees and charges on earnings, the use of a management expenses ratio or some better alternative, calculated using a clearly stated and compulsory standard, would have been considered.</para><para>The states would have been encouraged to put in place consistent regimes as well. Disclosure in some states is not adequate, in our view, and so it would have been desirable for each state to have a consistent regime and one which provided a safety net for employees. The default fund would have been the fund that the majority of employees were in, or the award fund. A notice to new employees would have clearly spelt out all the options. No third line forcing would have been allowed. There would have been a code of conduct for selling superannuation in the workplace. Quarterly payments would have been required, instead of the current annual payments. As we know, the huge fund of so-called `lost accounts' is to a large degree created by the fact that no employer is required to make payments more often than annually. Many do pay quarterly, and some pay monthly, but the payments of the vast majority of workers out there are made annually and, of course, if a business is having financial difficulties, it very often happens that workers' entitlements are not paid for a whole 12 months, if the company goes bust.</para><para>The education campaign that the government originally proposed would have been significantly increased. As has already been said, there is a need not only for much more education for people but also, I think, for support for employees. To this end, a consumer education centre, seed funded by government, could have provided continuing education for members, as well as advice on the use of the key features statements and on other matters to be taken into account by employees in choosing a fund. It could have assisted consumers in taking complaints to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and it could have provided independent analysis of choice and other superannuation issues. I think that is a big gap in our current system. Certainly, the inquiry that we are currently conducting in the superannuation committee is demonstrating that it is not clear to those who have got problems with superannuation where they should go and how they should get advice. A consumer centre specifically set up to deal with superannuation issues is very necessary, we think. </para><para>It would have been necessary to limit churning and to make greater efforts to solve the issue of members' lost accounts. This is an urgent matter that should be addressed, with or without a choice regime. We would urge the government to pick up on that issue and see that this money is redistributed.</para><para>At the end of the day, in spite of many discussions, a great deal of consultation and a lot of talking, the government was not prepared to accept our condition that such major change to our superannuation system would have to fix the problem of discrimination against same sex couples. That was a fundamentally important condition for the Democrats, and it was stated at the outset. The Democrats cannot, therefore, support this legislation.</para><para>I understand that the government has great difficulties, and that has been demonstrated time and time again over the last few weeks when we have put up amendments which neither the coalition nor the Labor Party has been prepared to support. To us this is fundamentally a human rights issue and it is not something we are going to give up on. We think it is time that the federal government faced this issue fairly and squarely as a human rights issue. It is about discrimination and it is time the federal government took a lead on it. Instead of that we in this place are behind many states and other organisations that have come to understand why this discrimination is unacceptable. So in conclusion I say it is regrettable that we have reached this point and have not been able to finally reach agreement. At the end of the day I would ask why this group should not have legislative protection and certainty about their entitlements being transferred to their partner when they die.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"> (Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>25927</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to conclude the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R541">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998</inline>. I might say it is a disappointing conclusion to a very important public policy issue which has been brought before this chamber. The Labor Party attitude to choice has been well known. The Labor Party, for reasons which I think we all know, has set its mind against choice, and I think the arguments that Senator Sherry put forward show the utter thinness and poverty of the Labor Party position. The Labor Party position is essentially that workers should not have choice in relation to superannuation: the workers' funds should be directed into particular funds whether those funds are performing well or poorly.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—They are performing.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—Senator Sherry, the reality, as you know, is that there is a variety of performances.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—They're very happy with them.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—No-one complains about a well performing fund, but members whose superannuation is tied up in a poorly performing fund have a lot of reason to complain.

That would be a very valid question, and until this bill goes through the answer will be: because the Senate—and the Labor Party in particular—was opposed to giving them choice. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—No, giving the employer the choice. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—Senator O'Brien shows his complete lack of appreciation of this issue.

What the trade union ALP speaks for is, of course, union interests. The Labor Party's approach to this is extremely unfortunate, to be quite frank. We can apparently allow an individual to choose his employment, to determine where his investments are, whether to purchase a house or not, whether he gets married or not and indeed to determine whether he wishes to have children or not and take on huge commitments. But, according to the Labor Party, we cannot allow that employee to choose where his superannuation contribution should go. That is the patronising nonsense that the Labor Party puts forward.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This debate will continue for a long period of time, but I point out to the Labor Party that they will be constantly reminded when there are complaints from employees about poorly performing funds and how their contributions continue to be directed to those funds. Letters will be sent to Senator Sherry, who will be kind enough to take particular responsibility for what has happened in this case. Senator Sherry, I point out to you that, in your speech, you showed no understanding of what had been proposed. What you did today will come back to haunt you and the Labor Party.</para><para>Let me now turn to the Democrats' position. It is true that we have had a very long period of discussion with the Democrats. It is true that those discussions were difficult, but we stayed at the table and we kept working at it. I think we came to a very good result— an excellent result—a result which would be welcomed by the industry, employees and, I believe, the Australian community. It is a great shame that, because of an issue which is quite separate from choice of funds, the Democrats find themselves unable to proceed to implement an agreement which they were a party to, which they worked on as hard as we did and which developed, I believe, a very satisfactory model for choice in order to move this debate further forward. I think it is a great pity that this has happened, to be quite frank.</para><para>I receive a lot of letters in relation to superannuation, but I cannot recall a letter that I have received from a same sex couple telling me that an individual, because of the death of his or her partner, has not been able to access dependency arrangements under superannuation. I think Senator Greig should carefully reflect on that. I do not know whether Senator Greig has fully appreciated that. There are a lot of issues in superannuation, Senator Greig, but I have to point out to you that this is an issue of how an individual is affected. As I said, I cannot recall a letter—there may have been one, but I cannot recall a letter. I receive letters about a whole host of issues. Senator Greig, as a result of your own interest in this matter, I have briefed you on it to try to indicate to you how the current arrangements work. It seems to me that you have failed to appreciate how the current arrangements work and you have taken this particular step which has inclined your colleagues to act in this particular manner. It is not a light matter that has occurred.</para><para>This is a very important policy; I believe that this is a very important issue in superannuation. It provides the freedom and the choice that individuals are quite entitled to exercise in relation to where their superannuation contributions go. I believe that you do not understand how the superannuation system currently works, and I think that is a great pity. The fact of the matter is that you have persuaded your colleagues, despite all the efforts and all the work that went into this to produce what I believe is an excellent model which will benefit the workers of Australia—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—Senator Conroy and Senator Sherry are having a little giggle over there. As the debate goes on in the years to come, Senators, and people complain that their contributions were stuck in particular funds—the contributions that they were saving for their retirement—when they did not have the freedom to direct those contributions into the areas that they wanted, we will say that, in this important debate, it was Senator Sherry and Senator Conroy who were laughing and giggling in the front row. It is pathetic. It shows, frankly, the paucity of the Labor Party position. It shows you the authoritarian nature of the Labor Party. The one thing that the Labor Party hates is choice. Whatever public policy you get into, the one thing that the Labor Party cannot take is choice. This is another example where the Labor Party has shown its true colours. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I think it is a great pity that the Democrats have not felt that they are able to proceed with an agreement which we negotiated in good faith. I think the model which we produced, after many tortuous hours, was a good model. It was good for employers, it was good for employees and it was good for the industry. It had a lot of advantages; it set up arrangements for proper consultation and monitoring; it made sure that there was an education program that would properly inform employees. It achieved all those things and it provided time for the scheme to be brought in so that employers, employees and the industry would have time to adjust. But that has not eventuated. I have to say that, to me, that is a great pity, because this was an opportunity for the Senate to grasp an important public policy which could have an important effect on superannuation for the good of this nation. It happened for reasons which I think have been explained and, as I said, it is a great pity.</para><para>I understand that Senator Allison and I negotiated in good faith. I did not doubt the commitment of Senator Allison. It is true that Senator Allison has been unequivocal about this issue. Nonetheless, I think we went to the table in good faith, we negotiated in good faith, we reached an agreement in good faith and, for reasons which have now transpired, this agreement now cannot be put into effect. To me, that is a great pity, to be quite frank. It is a great pity not because of the effort that people might feel is wasted, but it is a great pity for Australian employees.</para><para>I hope that in a comparatively short period of time we will be able to move forward on this issue. I think that the model that has been established is the way to move forward. Every party has to examine its own conscience on this and every senator has to examine his or her own conscience. A very bad decision has been made, in my view—not based on the facts, not based on how superannuation in the vast majority of schemes works, but based on an ideological view that was going to be proceeded with regardless of the facts of the matter. As I said, this model would have provided real choice for employees.</para><para>Senator Sherry got up and said what a dangerous thing this was.

Those senators in the Labor Party were always predictable on this. The Labor Party never came to the table with any sign that they were prepared to think constructively. The Labor Party's position is: `We tell you, the employee, where to put your money, and don't you dare protest.' That is exactly what the Labor Party's position is. That is the contempt with which the Labor Party continue to treat workers. That is your position and it is a disgraceful position, in my view.

The key question that the minister asks is: what have I achieved? Of course, the assumption in that is that I personally, as an individual, am responsible for this bill dying. That is not true. Every single Democrat senator is fully behind the notion that we fully recognise gay and lesbian people as fully human.

There was a chorus of outcry from the coalition. I particularly remember Senator Jeannie Ferris calling out, `That's not true.' Well, hello. A bill valued at $10 trillion over the next few decades is about to die because the coalition will not recognise the humanity of gay and lesbian people and the justice inherent in recognising same sex relationships. All we are talking about here is allowing a lesbian or gay person in a relationship to unambiguously leave their superannuation to their partner, to have the right to a death benefit to their partner or to have the right to a reversionary pension where that applies.

There is a class of employees that has been excluded from the legislation we are considering and that is employees who are in the employment of the military. The military have two currently operating superannuation funds and they have been excluded. No explanation has been given about why the military have been excluded from the current legislation that the government has put forward. Another group of employees—people employed in universities and CAEs, which are substantially funded by the Commonwealth—have also not been included in the legislation we are considering.</para><para>There is one important reason why the Labor Party will not be supporting this legislation. In the lead-up to the 1996 election, the Liberal Party issued a policy manifesto that included a range of commitments, a number of which are quite infamous now. The commitment with respect to the GST is well known. There was also a commitment with respect to the surcharge tax—that there would be no increase in taxes, no increase in existing taxes. That promise disappeared as well.</para><para>Also, the Liberal-National Party made an ironclad commitment that they would not reduce or change existing Public Service superannuation arrangements, including contribution levels. In this case the Prime Minister went one step further: the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, issued a letter, personally signed, to every public servant in Australia. In that personally signed letter, which I have tabled in previous debates in this chamber, the Prime Minister said that he would not change and reduce the contribution levels into public sector superannuation not just for existing employees but also for prospective employees, for future employees. There could be no clearer commitment given by the Prime Minister of the country than to send a personally signed letter to every public servant in the country giving them that assurance. That is a very significant step further than a published election policy manifesto.</para><para>So the Prime Minister entered into that commitment—very clear—and we intend to hold the Prime Minister to that promise that he made in that personally signed letter that he circulated that he would not seek to change the prospective superannuation arrangements of federal public servants in this country. He signed the letter. I suppose that if the Labor Party wanted to create a level of political mayhem we could let the legislation pass and draw the attention of the public servants to this correspondence from Mr Howard. What happens to the standing of a Prime Minister when he personally signs a letter giving an undertaking to public servants and then seeks to break it? Of course, he did not seek to break it this year; he sought to break it back in 1998. This legislation we are dealing with is almost three years old and the government has refused to bring it to a concluding vote.</para><para>We were warned—it touched on a threat—by Senator Kemp earlier about our attitude to so-called choice in respect of superannuation. If the Prime Minister wants to make an issue of this in the election, let him. We will produce the personally signed letter by Mr Howard promising not to do it. So if he wants to make it an issue, let him do that, because there can be no greater reduction of the credibility of the political leader of the country when he has personally signed a letter to public servants and then attempts to break that commitment two years later, and here we are three years after the original introduction of the legislation finally bringing it to a vote. The Labor Party's position on this is very simple: we will hold the Prime Minister to that personally signed commitment not to reduce the contributions into superannuation for public servants. We are going to hold him to that commitment. As far as I can recall, this is the only occasion in recent Australian political history when the Prime Minister of the day has sent a personally signed letter to such a significant number of Australians. We intend to hold him to that promise and we will be voting against the second reading of the package of four bills that go to this issue. </para><para>The bills also relate to the debate we have just had in relation to so-called choice. Effectively, with the ending of the current public sector superannuation funds for new entrants, the market would then be totally deregulated and new public servants would have a choice, so-called, imposed on them. The Labor Party makes no apologies for having indicated three years ago that we would vote against that legislation then. We have held it up for three years—we make no apologies for that—and the government has finally decided to bring it to a vote. I might say that I believe the bills will be defeated, but certainly those new entrants to the Public Service in the last three years do enjoy superannuation entitlements that were promised by the Prime Minister, and the Labor Party has held him to that promise.</para><para>What is it about this government with respect to superannuation? Why do they dislike superannuation so much? We had an indication from one of the Prime Minister's advisers, a Mr Morris, in a public forum that was reported in this week's <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> that the government object to the compulsory nature of superannuation. In Australia up until the late 1980s we had a superannuation system that was largely for privileged or wealthier Australians. Australians who were on lower and middle incomes, who worked in industries such as hospitality, retail and other sectors of the economy, had no superannuation whatsoever. The Labor Party is rightly proud of its extension of superannuation to all employees.</para><para>What is it about this government that continually wants to reduce superannuation in a whole range of areas? We have had a long debate on two occasions this week fixing up the surcharge mess. We have had two bills, Nos 15 and 16, in respect of the so-called surcharge, fixing up problems, problems that not just the Labor Party—not just I—warned the government about time and time again over the last four years. The impact of the surcharge tax is to reduce the final account balance of many Australians' superannuation. In the last financial year it reduced the account balances by $570 million. That is another $570 million taken by this government out of the retirement savings of Australians. That is the impact of it. The Liberal-National Party failed to contribute the co-contribution savings to superannuation. It repackaged it as a savings rebate and that lasted for approximately six months. That was supposedly to encourage savings. Again, that should have gone to the superannuation system.</para><para>This government presented a bill last year, which was fortunately defeated, to reduce compensation in the event of theft and fraud in respect of superannuation from 100 per cent to 80 per cent. They wanted to reduce superannuation protections! We have just had a debate about so-called choice and all the problems that that would have led to. What is it about this government when it comes to superannuation? I can only reasonably conclude that they have an ideological objection to compulsorily preparing for the ageing population. It is not as though the current age pension is not compulsorily funded through the tax system. This is very necessary because history has shown that, throughout the entire world, people will not save voluntarily for their retirement. They just will not do it and, if they do do it, they start too late and they do not save sufficiently.</para><para>This is the importance of Australia's approach to preparing for the ageing population: a decent age pension funded from the budget with superannuation built on top of that. This is a model widely admired throughout the world. We have delegations coming regularly to Australia—I have met some of them—from Europe, from China recently and from the United States, for example, who come to look at what we have done. What we have done is not perfect—there are still areas and issues that need to be resolved—but we have put in place a system that is far better developed than that of any comparable advanced economy. It is a system to provide a decent, secure retirement income for all Australians. At the moment, one in 10 Australians is over the age of 65; by the year 2025, one in four Australians will be over the age of 65. It is not fair and reasonable to put a question mark over the retirement income of Australians. It is only a government with true vision that can actually start to prepare Australia for the ageing population, as the Labor Party did in the late 1980s with the introduction of compulsory superannuation. </para><para>The Prime Minister discovered the issue of the ageing population in a speech a week or two ago. He has since tried to argue that the GST was necessary. Interestingly, countries around the world with VATs or GSTs have increased the rate considerably to help pay for the ageing population. They are being hit with this problem now. Australia will be hit with this problem in 20 to 25 years. Yet the Prime Minister denies that they are going to increase the rate of the GST. Well, we will see. </para><para>There is also clear evidence that the Prime Minister has no interest in building superannuation savings. How are we going to deal with the ageing population? I would suggest that the Liberal-National Party has only one other way of dealing with this issue, and that will be to increase the pension age. Some countries have already started doing that. That is what you have to do if you have insufficient superannuation savings—the inadequate private provision of retirement income. That is not fair or reasonable either, but inevitably that is where this government is leading us. </para><para>These bills represent yet another attack on the accumulation of superannuation savings in this country. It is yet another attempt to reduce these savings. For those reasons, and for the reasons outlined earlier in relation to the personal commitment and the signed letter given by the Prime Minister, the Labor Party will not be supporting these bills and we will be voting against the second reading.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>25934</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not on the list to speak—Senator Allison, I think, is the next one—but rather than having to call a quorum I will take this opportunity to raise a matter which should be discussed and no doubt will be discussed tomorrow.

There is no provision in the Democrat proposal for her sister, who is doing an enormous amount of good in the community. No, there is nothing for her—unless she is having sex with her sister!

Similarly, the ABA may investigate a sample of the content on a World Wide Web site about which a person has complained, and each page would be counted as an item in the statistics.

In this context the Government chose to apply the existing classification system for films and computer games.</para><para>The Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Videotapes and the Guidelines for the Classification of Computer Games are developed by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) in consultation with the community and are approved by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers with Censorship responsibilities. The guidelines, which are reviewed regularly, are readily available from the OFLC and set out in detail the nature of the content in each of the classification categories (eg R, X).</para><para>Unlike traditional media, where Australia can largely control the import and distribution of material refused classification or subject to legal restrictions, the Internet presents a more complicated medium. Publishing information about the classification of prohibited online content may entail the provision of information that would enable members of the public to access that prohibited content, thereby undermining the policy intent of the scheme.</para><para>(1)	(a) The ABA initiated 33 investigations during the period 1 January - 31 December 2000. All 33 investigations were initiated following receipt of information which could not be formally considered to be a complaint (because the person was not entitled to make a complaint or the complaint did not contain all the required information), but which the ABA considered warranted investigation due to the apparent serious nature of the content concerned. </para><para>Thirteen investigations were initiated as a result of information received from persons who were not Australian residents, mainly from overseas complaint hotlines.  The remaining 20 investigations were initiated after receipt of anonymous complaints. The ABA requires complainants to provide their name and contact details when lodging a complaint and it is the ABA's policy to investigate an anonymous complaint only where the complaint appears to relate to child pornography or similarly serious content. </para><para>(b) No complainants identified themselves as government agencies.</para><para>(c) Seven complainants identified themselves as members of Parliament.</para><para>(d) Twenty-nine complaints were received from persons who identified themselves as not being Australian residents. As noted above, the ABA initiated investigations in relation to 13 of these complaints, due to the apparent serious nature of the content concerned. No further action was taken in relation to the remaining 16 complaints, as they appeared to be outside the scope of the co-regulatory scheme.</para><para>(11)	The ABA received complaints from a broad range of members of the community who encountered online content about which they had concerns.
