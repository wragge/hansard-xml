This important piece of legislation continues a trend, in respect of a range of rural industries, of privatisation of statutory corporations, particularly research and development corporations. The Senate will recall that over the last couple of years we have dealt with legislation in the wheat industry, in the wool industry, in the red meat industry and, more recently, in the horticulture industry. This legislation is in a similar vein.</para></talk.start><para>I mention those earlier bills because later on the opposition will be moving amendments that we believe will strengthen this legislation, particularly in the area of accountability and parliamentary scrutiny. Those are not new issues. The opposition have raised them on each and every occasion when similar legislation on other agricultural industries has come before the parliament. The opposition had hoped that, by now, the government—in particular, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry—would have got the message and would not be relying on us to continually improve the legislation with respect to accountability and parliamentary scrutiny. Once again we will be doing that, and I look forward to the situation after November this year when we will be able to get things right from the outset.</para><para>The Pig Industry Bill 2000 provides for the establishment of a new industry owned company to replace the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation. This new company will be responsible for the activities of marketing, promotion, research and development. Up until now, those functions have been carried out by the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation. The new company will also have responsibility for strategic planning and policy development. Until now, those activities have been carried out by the Pork Council of Australia, which is the industry body that represents growers in the pork industry.</para><para>This new company will be a not-for-profit corporation established under the appropriate Corporations Law. Accordingly, it will take over all of the assets and the liabilities of the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation. The staff of those corporations will be transferred to the new company. All their entitlements will be fully protected and will transfer with them. That is a matter that we are particularly concerned about and is one that we have raised in earlier debates on other legislation. The new company will be established as a corporation. Accordingly, all of the statutory levy payers in the industry will be eligible to register as members and will be afforded full voting rights in the new company. </para><para>The new arrangements that will be established by virtue of this legislation are the result of lengthy negotiations and consultations with the industry. The opposition have been briefed on an ongoing basis by the industry and very recently by the government on the outcomes of those negotiations and consultations. We are aware that there is strong industry support for the new arrangements that will be established by virtue of this legislation and for the new company that will be formed. Indeed, I understand that the new company, known as Australian Pork Ltd, has already been established. It is intended by virtue of this legislation that it will be appointed as the industry services body.</para><para>The main thrust of the Pig Industry Bill 2000 is to bring those new arrangements into place and to provide a mechanism whereby the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry can declare the new company—that is, Australian Pork Ltd—as the industry services body. That terminology is important. It is the term that is used within the legislation whereby the minister declares a particular company—in this case APL—to carry out all of those administrative functions and other functions such as promotion, marketing and research and development that were previously carried out by the statutory corporations.</para><para>Under the legislation the government will continue to collect levies, as it has done over many years. In turn, they will be expended by the new company for the purposes intended. The arrangements—as I think all honourable senators are aware—are that industry members, the growers, pay certain levies, the government acts as the collection body for those levies and passes them on to the company to be expended for the purposes outlined. Similarly, the additional contribution by way of matching contributions up to a defined figure will continue to be provided by government. That has been the case under previous arrangements and under the current arrangements, and that will continue into the future. I am advised that the amount of public funds that are contributed as matching contributions are of the order $3.6 million per year. It is not an insignificant amount. </para><para>Therefore, it is crucial that any new company declared to be the industry services body with that responsibility of properly managing these funds, be accountable both to the levy payers in the industry and, also, to the parliament. Under the current arrangements—that is, under the operations of the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation—because those bodies are statutory corporations, there is a transparent process whereby parliament is able to peruse the operations of the corporations. The details of the expenditure of those corporations are set out in the portfolio budget statements each year and in the annual reports and, accordingly, the Senate has been able to scrutinise the expenditure of funds and the operations of those corporations through the estimates process. </para><para>That process will no longer be available to the parliament once a new private company comes into operation. Australian Pork Ltd will be a private company. However, it will be expending government contributions. It will be, therefore, expending and be accountable for public moneys. We have raised this issue on previous occasions and we do so again. There is a clear requirement for accountability to the parliament as well as to the industry for these new arrangements. Our concerns have been raised before in respect of legislation in other rural industries and they have also been raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I refer to <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest No. 18 of 2000</inline>, which had this to say: </para><quote><para>Subclause 9(1) of this bill—</para></quote><para>that is the Pig Industry Bill 2000—</para><quote><para>authorises the Minister (on behalf of the Commonwealth) to enter into a contract with an eligible body (or with an eligible body and other persons) that provides for the Commonwealth to make marketing, R&amp;D and matching payments to that body. An eligible body is defined simply as a `body that is registered under the Corporations Law as the company limited by guarantee'. `Other persons' is not defined, and the bill does not specify any qualifications or attributes which those persons should or should not possess.</para><para>Once a funding contract with a body is entered into, the Minister may then declare that body to be the pig industry services body.</para><para>The bill makes no provision for Parliamentary scrutiny of these Ministerial decisions. In its <inline font-style="italic">Seventeenth Report of 2000</inline> the Committee drew attention to a similar Ministerial discretion to enter into a deed of agreement with, and to determine, an industry services body for the horticulture industry. Notably, the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2000 also authorised the Minister to declare that a body should cease to be the relevant industry services body—something apparently not contemplated by this bill.</para><para>The Committee, therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">seeks the Minister's advice</inline> as to why the exercise of the discretion to contract with, and declare, an eligible body should not be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny or some form of review. The Committee also <inline font-weight="bold">seeks the Minister's advice</inline> as to the persons contemplated by the term `other persons' and whether these persons should be limited in some way by reference to appropriate qualifications or attributes.</para><para>Finally, the Committee notes that Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2000 was subsequently amended in the Senate to take account of issues raised by the Committee. The Committee <inline font-weight="bold">seeks the Minister's advice</inline> as to whether this Bill might be amended in similar terms.</para></quote><para>The minister did reply to the committee on that issue and on other issues that they raised. We in the opposition are of the view that, just as a course was taken in respect of the horticulture bill, this bill should also be amended to ensure that there is proper parliamentary scrutiny of the operations of the company and the expenditure particularly of public moneys. Accordingly, we will be moving amendments to give effect to such a requirement. I understand those amendments have been made available to the government and to other parties, and we anxiously await an indication from the government particularly as to whether or not they will agree to our amendments.</para><para>We will also be moving similar amendments which relate to the issue of the minister giving directions. Our amendments in that regard will pick up the same types of concerns that were raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and previously raised by the opposition—that is, that such directions, if they are given by the minister, should be ones which, in turn, are required to be reported to the parliament and consequently tested within the parliament.</para><para>There is a range of other issues which we intend to take up in the committee stage of the bill. These issues are ones which we have just recently drawn to the attention of the government, once we had an opportunity late last week to see the final drafts of the constitution and of the contract that is proposed to be entered into between the government and the company. Some of those issues, for instance, go to the definitions contained in the contract. One particular issue relates to a definition in the contract of `agripolitical activity'—that is found in clause 5.3. The contract provides for a prohibition on the company spending funds on agripolitical activity. However, I also note in clause 5.4 that, where an issue arises at the board level of the company as to whether some proposed expenditure is or is not agripolitical activity, there is a requirement for that issue to be referred to the minister. Certainly, it appears that the minister can have a major say in determining what might or might not fit within the definition of `agripolitical activity'. We can all think of potential problems that might arise in that area. It is something that we wish to pursue and to get some clarification on from the government in the committee stage.</para><para>I also note that, in their report, the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee—and I do not have time to read the specific references—sought clarification from the minister on the definitions and scope of the terms `national interest' and `exceptional and urgent circumstances' used in clause 12. Clause 12 of the bill provides that the minister can issue directions, and I refer particularly to clause 12(3):</para><quote><para>The Minister must cause a copy of a direction to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the direction is given, unless the Minister makes a written determination that doing so would be likely to prejudice:</para><para>(a) the national interest of Australia;</para></quote><para>We will be seeking some clarification from the government, as the Scrutiny of Bills Committee did, as to just what might come within the definition of `national interest' and also on the use of `exceptional and urgent circumstances', with respect to clause 12 of the bill.</para><para>In summary, there are, firstly, some amendments that we intend to move which will strengthen the legislation by providing for the appropriate parliamentary scrutiny and accountability that we have argued in the past should be provided for in the establishment of these private companies to replace the statutory corporations in these agricultural industries. Secondly, there are some issues that we wish to have clarified during the committee stage debate. With those remarks, I indicate that the opposition supports the legislation and hopes—we look forward to it—that the government and other senators will support our amendments, which will significantly improve the legislation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>22911</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1189">Pig Industry Bill 2000</inline>. This bill provides for the winding up of the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation, so that an industry owned company will undertake the industry marketing and promotion and the research and development functions, which were previously the province of those two bodies. I note also that the industry company will be responsible for strategic planning and industry policy development functions, which were previously the province of the Pork Council of Australia. I note that the new company is to be called Australian Pork Ltd. The Democrats certainly welcome the end of what has been a long process of consultation in the industry over these matters. The minister said in his second reading speech:</para></talk.start><quote><para>These new arrangements will allow a more co-ordinated and commercial approach to the development of industry policy and delivery of services. Importantly it will ensure for the first time that industry levy payers have direct influence and involvement in their industry body ensuring their levies are applied to best effect.</para></quote><para>I want to pay tribute today to at least one person. The problem in naming persons is the people you leave out, but I want to pay tribute to officers of the Pork Council who have worked very hard to bring about this legislation and I particularly want to pay tribute to Ron Pollard, a pork grower from Young in New South Wales. I understand he has had to give up a lot of the work that he has been doing in this area because of illness. I am very disappointed about that because he did a tremendous job in bringing the industry together after it had become split during the 1998 election campaign. I remind senators that during that election the Pork Council was very critical of the government and the government was very unhappy about that. I was certainly on the side of the Pork Council and would have delivered the same criticisms—in fact, I did—to the government at that time. The Pork Council paid with some pain for itself during that campaign and, subsequently, the Pork Committee of the New South Wales Farmers Federation split from the Pork Council and we had a divided industry. But the work that officers of the Pork Council and, in particular, Ron Pollard did over the intervening years ought to get the highest possible commendation that this Senate can deliver. Ron is a very quiet man, but someone who just worked away until he brought the industry back together again. Hence, this bill today is a culmination of his efforts over those intervening years.</para><para>Part of the impetus for this, not directly but certainly indirectly, was the threat some years ago that imports of Canadian pork posed for the pork industry in Australia. Pig farmers were in dire straits. That was certainly the case with many I talked to in Queensland; but throughout Australia pig farmers were facing a disaster because of Canadian imports. The government—as senators will remember—placed the issue before the Productivity Commission, which found very clearly that subsidised Canadian pork imports were having an adverse effect on the Australian pork industry. The commission pointed out that the World Trade Organisation guidelines which would have imposed some restriction on Canadian imports could have been applied, although, being as dry as it is in economic terms, it did not recommend that we should go down the road. The Democrats hoped that the government might have done that because we believed that, in applying those WTO guideline restrictions, we would have been acting very much in support of the industry. I think we should have done it.</para><para>The government decided instead to put in place a financial rescue package, which was of significant help to the industry. But I find it interesting that neither the coalition nor the Labor Party were prepared to use the temporary restrictions which were available under the WTO. I notice now that everyone wants to get on the national competition policy bandwagon, as though nobody voted for it. It was, after all, Labor Party legislation and policy, supported by the coalition at the time. I note that the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine were the only people to vote against it. All of a sudden, national competition policy is probably one of the dirtiest words we can find in the Australian vocabulary, and everyone now wants to bag it. But I note that not many people were bagging it when the legislation was passed in this place.</para><para>However, the pork industry was saved, not necessarily by the government's package—although I am sure that helped. It was saved by the fact that in Malaysia and some other South-East Asian countries certain diseases of pigs meant the collapse of the industry in those places and the ability of our pork industry to move into South-East Asian markets. I suppose one could say it was a fortuitous circumstance, although it certainly was not fortuitous for the Malaysians, but at least it helped our industry. We were able to move into those markets and, as a result, the pork industry has certainly seen much better times in the last couple of years. That is part of the background to this legislation, which comes as the culmination of a number of things that have taken place. The Democrats are very happy to support the legislation and we are very pleased to see it in this chamber.</para><para>In relation to the Labor Party amendments, I got those at around 20 past 12, just as I was about to come into the chamber. I do not think they have been circulated in the chamber. I believe the amendments have some merit, but I cannot vote for them until I have checked with a number of people as to whether or not they are as helpful as Senator Forshaw says. I always take Senator Forshaw's word, and I am sure he has described them accurately, but until I have a chance to check those amendments with other people I am not prepared to support them. They sound to me as though they are worth supporting. I know these kinds of amendments have been raised with other bills, but I believe we should not simply support amendments because one side or the other says—or even we say with our amendments—that they are beneficial. We need a little time at least to check that they do achieve what the opposition is saying they will achieve. If we are given time we will consider them. </para><para>I notice in the minister's second reading speech that he says the Commonwealth will continue to match R&amp;D funds provided by the pork industry, up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production, as applies to other rural industries. In 1999-2000 the Commonwealth's matching contribution for pork industry R&amp;D was $3.6 million. That supports what Senator Forshaw is saying, that there still is Commonwealth government money going into the pork industry and, for that reason, there should be scrutiny by the parliament of these particular matters. There is merit in the amendments which have been foreshadowed, but I will not support them unless we have a chance simply to check with other people whether or not they deliver what the Labor Party says they will deliver.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>22913</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The legislation before us this afternoon provides for the amalgamation of the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation into a single, industry owned body. The company, to be known as Australian Pork Ltd, will undertake both industry marketing and promotion as well as research and development functions.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian pork industry has, as many of us here know, been operating in pretty volatile circumstances over the past couple of years. It was only three years ago that the industry strongly believed that without tariff protection it faced oblivion in this country. However, the then minister, Mr John Anderson, believed that success could only come to this industry as a result of improving competitiveness and moving to an export focus. In November 1997 he launched a $10 million development package for the industry to assist in achieving the export focus the industry so badly needed. In June 1998 we provided an additional $8 million in investment grants to upgrade specialist abattoirs so that they met export standards. One of those abattoirs is sited in Murray Bridge in my home state of South Australia. I have been very closely associated with many of the industry issues that have come up over the last four or five years and I have seen some very strong growth in this industry in recent times. We are now looking at an industry that is worth $825 million a year.</para><para>I cannot let the opportunity pass without commending John Anderson for the very strong stand that he took in the face of significant and considerable opposition in relation to the pork industry three years ago. The figures on the growth and the value of this industry very clearly now vindicate that strong position he took. Over the last 12 months the Australian pork industry has in fact experienced a 73 per cent increase in exports. The industry is doing particularly well in Singapore now that Singapore is unable to import pork from Malaysia as a result of the disease outbreaks that have already been mentioned in this place today. That market alone is now worth over $90 million and accounts for 63 per cent of our total pork exports. The Australian pig industry itself employs between 3,000 and 3,500 people with an additional 3,000 people employed in the processing of pig meat and another 6,000 people employed in the smallgoods manufacturing area. The establishment of the Australian pork industry as a single entity, APL, will go a long way to preserving and in fact enhancing these jobs. I must say it is a far cry from the days of that very unfortunate campaign that the industry ran against this government in the 1998 election. I for one spoke very strongly to the industry against that campaign. I thought it was a very negative and personally offensive campaign and I am delighted to see that the industry now has a far more positive focus.</para><para>The pork industry is also exporting into Japan: 17 per cent of our exports now go to Japan. However, while ABARE forecasts Asian demand for pig meat will remain strong in 2001-02, it noted during the recent Outlook Conference that the pork industry now is facing increasing competition in its main markets from the world's major pork suppliers and exporters; that is, Canada and the United States. However, the foot-and-mouth disease crisis that has now hit the Northern Hemisphere has the potential to greatly change the face of the Australian pork industry and in particular the way it accesses export markets. Already Australia has placed a ban on all imports from one of our biggest competitors, Denmark, and I have no doubt that further opportunities will arise on world markets for our industry if the United Kingdom is unable to access these very important export markets that they also have been supplying. So further opportunities may arise in those third markets as a result of the very unfortunate FMD crisis in Britain and Europe.</para><para>But strong competition has greatly intensified the need to restructure our pork industry. Moving towards an amalgamated industry structure with a very strong commercial focus emerged as the best way to ensure the continued growth of the industry. I am glad to say that the industry itself recognised this new focus and cooperated in preparing this legislation. In fact, delegates to the Pork Council's AGM last year voted unanimously to support a new structure. This legislation delivers exactly that: it replaces the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation with a single industry services body operating under the Corporations Law and known as Australian Pork Ltd. This new unified organisation will further increase our level of international competitiveness in pork products. The company will have a very strong commercial focus. It will be responsible for providing marketing services to undertake research and development projects in the industry's best interests, a very powerful combination in a commercial sense.</para><para>To me, one of the key benefits of this new company is that it will be able to combine industry policy and industry planning for a far greater level of industry efficiency. The board of APL will be required to include members with specialist skills, one of whom will be an independent director with a strong corporate base and strong corporate skills. All pork producers who are registered as statutory levy payers to the APL will be eligible for full voting rights in the new company. Importantly, levy payers will be able to vote on changes to levy rates and to participate in the election of directors to the board. </para><para>Another aspect of this legislation that is very pleasing to me is that the chair of APL will be required to brief the minister at least twice a year on the company's performance and on its research and development priorities. So the key element and effect of this legislation will be to deliver precisely what the pork industry has been asking for: a cost-effective industry body responsive to the demands of world competition and accountable to its shareholding members. The legislation will be a huge boost to our increasingly successful pork industry. What is even more pleasing to me is that the changes we seek to implement today come with an unprecedented level of agreement from the industry and, most importantly, from the 2,500 or so pork producers themselves.</para><para>I was very sorry to hear from Senator Woodley that the President of the Pork Council, Ron Pollard, has been unwell. I recall very clearly the courageous stand that Mr Pollard took in those dark days in the pork industry's crisis of 1997. He was a calm and rational voice at a time when a great deal of emotion was circulating in that industry. I look forward very much to attending the Pork Council's annual dinner tonight to hear of the deliberations that the annual conference has been making during the day today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>22915</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Pig Industry Bill 2000 is designed to allow for the creation of a pig industry services body, Australian Pork Ltd, to oversee the strategic policy development of this important rural industry. It will also be responsible for marketing and research and development services currently provided by the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation. The bill will repeal the enabling legislation for both these bodies and also provide for the transfer of assets, liabilities and staff to the new body. This new not-for-profit body will be limited by guarantee and will operate under the Corporations Law, and all industry levy payers will be eligible to register for membership and have full voting rights. This restructure follows a similar process which was established by other sectors, such as the red meat sector, the wool sector and more recently the horticulture sector.</para></talk.start><para>The restructure of the administration of this important industry has been on the agenda for some time. At the Pork Council of Australia's general meeting held on 12 and 13 May 1999, delegates resolved that a joint industry-government working party be established to develop options for the establishment of a single industry body. This resolution led to the preparation and distribution of an options paper in October 1999. That paper offered three models for amalgamating the three organisations into one body. As this industry has done on all important issues, a very exhaustive consultative process was undertaken with members. This involved direct mail, fax stream broadcasts, media exposure of the options, and direct meetings with producers. I understand that there were meetings in no less than 14 regional centres and also that there was overwhelming support for the option recommended by the working group.</para><para>Pork producers faced a very difficult market conditions situation through the second half of the 1990s with very low prices, rising input costs caused by drought and the hoarding of grain, a stable domestic market for pig meat and an increasingly open Australian economy. But, despite the obvious and increasing hardships facing many producers, requests for help from Canberra were met with little or no interest. The so-called farmers' representatives in the Howard government, the National Party members and senators, proved to be no representatives at all to this industry. In response to requests for action to protect them from a flood of imported products through the application of WTO legal action, Mr Anderson and Mr Fischer told producers to forget it. The National Party leadership said that growers should put the national interest ahead of the interests of their families and their farms.</para><para>The approach of the government to any issue in recent weeks provides an interesting contrast. The national interest is now well and truly off the agenda and has been replaced by raging political self-interest and nothing more. This is a very good time to ask a government for help, when it is in its terminal political decline, as is this government: you are sure to get a positive response. But clearly that is no way to run a country—and I am sure the voters of Australia will agree.</para><para>Since the early 1990s this industry has also experienced profound structural change. It has largely made the transition from a fragmented and domestically focused industry to a cohesive, internationally focused industry. It is now increasingly an export industry with a solid domestic base. But it has been a difficult road to that reform. As I said, its task has been made almost impossible by this government. Rather than work through a comprehensive strategy to help this industry, the government responded—and, I might say, with some considerable reluctance—in a disjointed and ad hoc manner.</para><para>In November 1997 the then minister announced assistance worth $10 million. He said it was designed to boost the competitiveness of the industry. But clearly that response from the government was inadequate. Then on 10 June 1998 Mr Anderson and Mr Fischer had a second attempt, announcing what was described as an `enhanced' assistance package for the pork industry. This package was also designed to enhance the competitiveness of the industry. It was more a response to the difficult political situation than to the needs of the industry—and that not only is my view but also was the view of the then Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer. On the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program on 10 June 1998 Mr Fischer was asked whether or not the second government pig meat assistance package was an electioneering handout. He said:</para><quote><para>Well, I think it is more to do, to be blunt and honest, with the fact that people are voting next Saturday in one State of the island and, soon enough across the whole of the land, and there is a sense of urgency attached to this industry. </para></quote><para>I do not think I need to say any more on that point. This second package provided an additional $9 million to go with the already committed $10 million. But the package was still clearly inadequate and in January 1999 we saw yet another package announced. This one was worth $6 million and was designed to assist people to exit the industry—not a coordinated strategy to address all the key issues facing the industry and delivered in a timely manner, but a disjointed approach driven by political pressure.</para><para>Much of that political pressure emanated from this chamber. On 7 April 1998, the Senate supported a motion calling on the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, to take immediate action to assist the Australian pork industry. Specifically, the Senate called on the Howard government to launch an immediate inquiry to determine whether the level of imported pig meat was the primary cause of the industry's current difficulties. If that proved to be the case, then the Senate called on the government to look to the `emergency protection of an industry' provisions of the World Trade Organisation rules to limit the volume of imports. The motion also called on the government to review the current level of financial assistance available to the industry, and to put in place proper labelling arrangements.</para><para>Following the Senate's resolution, two things happened: prices deteriorated further, and imports surged. The front page of the May issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Pig Producer</inline> said it all: `Farmers shoot pigs—they can't sell them'. Rather than deal properly with what was clearly a crisis, the then minister, Mr Anderson, decided to play politics. In an interview on the ABC <inline font-style="italic">Country Hour</inline>, he claimed that there had not been a rise in imports. He said:</para><quote><para>My honest assessment of that is that at the moment it is likely to be found that there's been no particular rise in what is coming in.</para></quote><para>He continued:</para><quote><para>In fact, what's coming in now is what was allowed in under the 1992 protocol set up by Labor.</para></quote><para>I thought at the time that the minister was surprisingly out of touch with the circumstances of this important industry. But, having observed Mr Anderson since that time, particularly as the minister responsible for aviation, I should not have been in the least bit surprised.</para><para>The reason I raised this matter in the first place was that it was obvious to me—and apparently to everyone else except Mr Anderson—that the pork industry was in trouble and needed help from the government. That is what governments are elected to do, and that is the reason we have a minister for primary industries. I did not say that it was the minister's fault, because import protocols for imported pig meat were varied in November 1997. I said that there had been a surge in imports and a collapse in the domestic price and that the government needed to look at that as a matter of urgency. I said that, if imports were the major problem, there were things that the government could do to assist the industry. I called on the government to look at what action could be taken within the terms of our GATT arrangements. That was the view of 75 other senators in this place. The motion was supported by National Party senators, Liberal Party senators, my colleagues, the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents—but not by Mr Anderson and not by Mr Fisher.</para><para>The Senate, it seems, saw it as an apolitical issue, but the minister was not of the same view. He did not say, `Yes, there is a problem and, yes, we will do what we can.' He said, `There has not been an increase in imports and, anyway, it is all Labor's fault.' There were, in fact, record imports in 1997. Over 11,000 tonnes were imported, resulting in a fall in pig prices in the lead-up to Christmas of that year for the first time in history. The prices being received by growers reached their lowest level for 30 years. The records show historically that the pork industry supports trade that is fair and free, but the industry is quite rightly opposed to competition from countries that subsidise and protect their own industries. At that time, with this government saying to pork producers, `We must support free trade,' Denmark granted unimpeded access for Australian pork but only as long as local producers—that is, Australian producers—paid a tariff of $3,145 a tonne, and Canada was providing its domestic industry with production subsidies of around 16 per cent—a figure disputed at that time by the Canadian High Commission, which claimed the subsidy was only 11 per cent.</para><para>As a result of the failure of the Howard government to help this industry in its hour of need, pork producers were forced to resort to direct political action. Again, rather than address the legitimate needs of pork producers, the government chose to issue a few political threats of its own. During the 1998 election campaign, the then Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, wrote to Mr Mazzanti, a member of the South Queensland Pork Action Group. Mr Fischer was responding to a letter, dated 10 September, from Mr Mazzanti to Senator Brownhill. Mr Mazzanti raised a number of concerns about how the Howard government policies were adversely affecting rural and regional Australia. Mr Fischer said that he was responding to the letter to Senator Brownhill because he `has asked me to respond on his behalf'. It is highly unusual for the Deputy Prime Minister to reply to a letter on behalf of a parliamentary secretary, but we did have a highly unusual Deputy Prime Minister and so nothing should come as a surprise. </para><para>The letter ran through the usual lines about getting macro-economic settings right, how important a free trade regime is to the overall wellbeing of the rural community, and how there are now effective antidumping and safeguard procedures to deal with instances where Australian producers for the domestic market are being injured by unfair competition from imports. He claimed, quite inaccurately, that the opposition's call for action to protect the interests of the pork industry by limiting imports was in contravention of the World Trade Organisation rules. He referred to the alleged transport cost savings to rural and regional Australia in the Howard tax plan—which I might say has turned out to be little more than a sick joke. At the bottom of the letter the Deputy Prime Minister added a postscript. It said: </para><quote><para>The pork industry's continuing advertising campaign is very carefully noted, including those elements of the industry pushing it.</para></quote><para>Despite a denial from his office on the matter, that postscript was nothing less than a threat. The government did not properly consider the difficult circumstances the industry faced. It did not look at all the possible policy remedies. It ignored the fact that there had been a massive surge in imports. It ignored the fact that the importers had targeted the peak season for the product on the domestic market. It ignored the fact that the importers had focused on the premium cuts of the product. It ignored the fact that there had been a collapse in the price received by Australian producers—a price well below the cost of production. It dismissed any short-term assistance through the provision of exceptional circumstances programs. It also chose to ignore possible trade remedies, such as legal remedies through the World Trade Organisation—measures that a number of our trading partners regularly use, including against Australia.</para><para>The crisis that confronted Australian pork producers and the complete failure of the government to respond to that crisis in a constructive, comprehensive, timely and sympathetic manner is one of the sorry tales of public administration under Mr Anderson and Mr John Howard. This government well and truly dudded the Australian pork industry. This industry was not seeking a One Nation style `blanket ban on imports' response from the government. It was looking for a comprehensive and legal response to the personal and financial crisis confronting many producers. But it did not get it. The industry quite reasonably took its case to the public during the federal campaign, as it was entitled to do. The way in which the government dealt with this matter gave the industry no option but to take the action that it did.</para><para>There are very few sectors in the rural economy that have experienced such significant change. The pork industry in 2001 now produces more meat of a better quality and at a lower production cost than ever before. Such a radical change has not been without its difficulties, but this sector accepted that it had no choice. This change has been underpinned by considerable producer investment in research and development and marketing programs. This change has come about without the support of the price stabilisation schemes, floor prices, single desk arrangements, or import tariffs and quotas enjoyed by sectors such as the wool sector, the wheat sector, the sugar sector and dairy producers. Australian pork producers are committed to the development of a sustainable, export orientated and jobs generating industry. Unlike the government generally and the Deputy Prime Minister in particular, we on this side of the chamber are committed to working constructively with them to achieve that goal. The passing of this bill, and the reforms that will flow from it, is an important step in that process. But there is absolutely no basis on which this government can claim any credit for these reforms. They have been achieved by the pork producers in spite of the government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>22918</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The objective of the <inline ref="R1189">Pig Industry Bill 2000</inline> is to streamline the current industry's management through merging and privatising the three pork industry bodies into one controlled organisation. That in itself is a sign of maturity and goodwill on the part of the industry in general and should be applauded. In August 2000 the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Warren Truss, announced that the government had given approval for a new company, Australian Pork Limited, to join together the three industry and statutory bodies: the Pork Council of Australia, the Pig Research and Development Corporation and the Australian Pork Corporation. It was envisaged that a new single organisation would remove inefficient duplication in servicing industry needs and provide a single point of contact for pork producers as well as our domestic and international trading partners.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian Pork Corporation, established under the Pig Industry Act 1986, is the statutory marketing authority for pork produced in Australia. It is funded by a promotion levy of $1.65 per pig slaughtered, payable by the producers. The revenue raised in 1999-2000 amounted to $8.24 million. Using `new fashioned Australian pork' as a vehicle for marketing and sales programs for the pork industry in Australia and overseas, the corporation is better positioned to provide other services to the industry, such as a central information resource in the form of a library and a statistical service that analyses international and domestic trends in pork production and marketing. It also provides a defence against unwarranted and unnecessary pig importations.</para><para>The Pig Research and Development Corporation's role is to invest and manage research and development funds on behalf of the Australian pig industry and the Commonwealth government, with the objective of improving the performance and sustainability of the Australian pig industry. It also serves to increase the industry's global competitiveness. We have seen signs that the industry is becoming more and more competitive and more efficient in its costs and production criteria. Support spans over 100 research and development projects that encompass long-term research and breeding and health issues within the pig industry, and the industry is provided with information and training packages on topics such as pig housing, management and animal health handling. The corporation's income is obtained from two sources: a levy rate on pigs slaughtered, which in 1999-2000 was set at 70c; and a Commonwealth government contribution of $1 for each $1 collected by the corporation, up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production.</para><para>The Pork Council of Australia is the third body to be incorporated into the new company and is representative of the Australian pork industry itself. It was founded in 1992 and represents 75 per cent of pork producers across Australia. It was established by producers to represent their interests before governments and industry bodies. The PCA is funded by voluntary membership. The cost of voluntary membership of the PCA is $1.50 per breeding sow. Its statutory obligation is to monitor how pork producers' statutory levy funds are used and to provide advice to government on the expenditure of funds to benefit the industry. The PCA is also a lobby group to government and to other industries on behalf of pork producers. </para><para>The working party of the pork industry restructure was established in 1999, where three alternatives for the industry to achieve a single industry organisation that incorporated policy, research and development and marketing functions were formulated. Like other speakers before me, I have recollections of the trauma that was facing the industry, particularly during 1998 and the lead-up to the last federal election, and the trauma was felt right down through the industry to the smallest of breeders. I believe this initiative will overcome the difficulties that were experienced at that time. The most interesting information to come out of this working party was that pork producers were no longer interested in continuing the current arrangements involving the three national bodies. There was overwhelming support from the industry to streamline these organisations into one body incorporated as a nonprofit company and controlled by the producers themselves. As I said before, I believe that step should be applauded for the maturity shown by the industry.</para><para>Apart from the overwhelming support for change in this industry, there are other factors leading to pressure for these changes to occur—for example, a stable or declining domestic market for pig meat, declining returns to producers, competition from imports and a small export sector. Consumption of pig meat has remained stable since 1994, but at the same time Australian pig prices have been falling in real terms since the early 1970s, as has been the case for other livestock industries. This indicates that there is a marked reduction in the cost of production. Again, that is something that should be applauded, but it does need our support to ensure that it is translated into greater sales and greater development for the pig industry.</para><para>Until recently, the pig industry has focused almost exclusively on the domestic market. The main export markets for Australian pig meat have been Singapore and Japan—and I understand they are expanding. This situation needs to change, and the new body will have a greater opportunity to develop new export markets. It will be a new body with one single head. The government has announced the go-ahead for a new company to take over the functions of the three existing bodies. The new company board will have nine directors, five of whom will be elected by the pig producers. Three of these will be appointed on the basis of their skills and their expertise. There will also be a managing director. I think that is a very important component of this. At least three of the nine-member board will be selected on the basis of their skills and expertise. Unless that was in place, there could be doubts as to the future efficiency of the new company.</para><para>The constitution of the APL was not available to me, but I see today that there are drafts, and I do intend to go through those and make comments if I feel that comments are necessary. But I think it is vital for us to examine those documents prior to doing more than giving tacit support at this stage. I have heard and noted previous speakers in relation to this but, not having had an opportunity to look at those before coming into the chamber today, I can make no real comment on the drafts.</para><para>The final report of the working party on the pig industry restructure has recommended that there be two classes of membership in the new company. There are producers who choose to pay only the statutory levies for research and development and marketing activities, and who do not pay the voluntary levy used to fund political lobbying activities. That is one area where I think we do need to examine the contract and the constitution to ensure that these people will not, in an overall sense, be disadvantaged. Small producers may find that the cost of additional levies is prohibitive to them, and I would shudder at the thought that, in some form, they could be disadvantaged by this. No doubt the industry have examined it themselves and feel comfortable with it. If that is the case, it deserves our support. The entitlements of the voluntary levy paying members would be: to have a say in future proposals to vary the statutory levy rates, to have the right to ask questions and be heard by the APL in general meetings, and to receive certain company information contained in financial reports and the director's annual report.</para><para>Producers who pay both the statutory and voluntary levies would have additional rights, including the right to participate in the appointment of delegates to represent them and vote at general meetings of the APL, voting rights to remove directors, and the right to call special meetings to amend the APL constitution. As one who has been around when meetings are held to monitor people's performance, I would be out there encouraging everyone to pay the voluntary payment as well as the statutory payment to ensure that their voice is heard and their will is acted upon. It is the voluntary and non-voluntary aspect of the new company's constitution that really does cause me concern. I think those concerns will be put to bed when I have the opportunity to read through the constitution. I would hate to think that there is a fear for any members within the producing group that, because they are not paying that voluntary levy, they may not be getting the same services and their concerns may not be addressed equally with others.</para><para>This bill follows two acts passed in 2000—the wool act and the horticulture act—which sought to transfer control over marketing and research and development activities from government to industry participants. Those acts provide for private control in relation to levies whilst retaining the element of public control in relation to the use of government subsidies. This bill extends to all the external territories and will also extend to acts, omissions and other things outside Australia. The bill provides for the minister, by written declaration, to transfer assets, contractual rights and obligations, liabilities, rights and titles or interests in land held by a statutory authority. </para><para>The main issue regarding this bill is accountability. The APL will receive the bulk of its income from the compulsory levy and public funding—hence the need for accountability. It will perform a public function for the pork industry and the wider community. The issue of accountability apparently will be detailed in the constitution. As I said earlier, since coming into the chamber I have now received a copy of the constitution, and I look forward to reading through it. Indeed, this issue was addressed by the minister in his second reading speech. </para><para>It is significant that we can give consideration to what is in the constitution, because it demonstrates a transformation in the vehicles of accountability. It is clear that the statutory authorities are accountable to the executive and to parliament. The APL will be accountable to the general public via the Corporations Law, to the stakeholder group via the constitution and to the executive via the funding contract, but it will not in itself be accountable to the parliament. This is not unusual, of course, in the context of privatisation. It does, however, reflect a compromise that resolves the tension between a private sector structure and public sector accountability.</para><para>Voting rights of members will not be direct but will be attenuated by the voluntary levy. In addition, assuming that the cell system is retained, voting rights will be further attenuated by the need for members to combine their herds into a cell of 7,000 sows. It could be argued that these features undermine the accountability of the APL. While producers make a direct contribution to the APL's marketing and research and development functions, they may not have the right to participate in setting directions and priorities. Small to medium sized producers will be reliant on external representative groups who pay the voluntary levy, and they will only be able to exercise that right indirectly. It is also important to note the connection between the voluntary levy and the political lobbying function. The right may inadvertently be lost if there is a split among the representative members, and their interest in commercial issues may also be vulnerable to political considerations. I trust that that will not be the case.</para><para>In conclusion, subject to the examination of the new company constitution and the contract with the Commonwealth, and finding no difficulties with those, I believe the bill should be supported. So I join with my colleagues in supporting the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>22921</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators for their contribution to this debate. I would now like to sum up the debate. I understand that the opposition have some amendments to be moved. As we have not yet seen the final draft of those amendments, I would welcome their circulation as soon as possible so that the government and other interested parties have an opportunity to look at them in their final form.</para></talk.start><para>The purpose of the <inline ref="R1189">Pig Industry Bill 2000</inline>, as we have all agreed, is to create a new pig industry services body that will provide for the integrated delivery of industry marketing, promotion and R&amp;D functions as well as strategic planning and industry policy development functions. There is no doubt that the Australian pig industry is a rapidly growing and changing industry. The gross value of production for the pig industry is expected to reach some $850 million this financial year. Around 2,500 people are pig producers, with a further 9,000 people employed in pork processing and the manufacturing of smallgoods. The industry is very important to rural and regional Australia and, as everyone has remarked, it has undergone significant change in the last few years.</para><para>Rather than go down the path marked out by Senator O'Brien, who regarded this as a particularly political development, I would like to emphasise that the government over 1997-98 put some $24 million into the pig industry. There is no doubt that, amongst other things, this provided the infrastructure for the export surge that we have seen since. Negotiations were already proceeding quite strongly with agencies in Singapore before the unfortunate Malaysian pig virus, which put a stop to that country's trade in pork with Singapore. But the important fact for this chamber to note is that the opportunity was then provided for the expansion of efforts on the export front not only to Singapore but also to other countries, and that was in part provided by the willingness of both producers and processors to take up the opportunities offered by the government's provision of some $24 million.</para><para>Since then, we have seen many of the excellent abattoirs in Australia rise to export standard and improve their infrastructure, producers rise to the challenge of providing what the customer wants and, indeed, a general lifting of the game on all fronts so that the pig industry can now look forward to the future with renewed confidence. That is partly because of export development opportunities, but there is no doubt that it is also because of pressures on the domestic market from imported product. Both Australian pork producers and supply chain participants have been required to adjust to effectively compete with overseas producers. Consequently, the pork industry has created and seized its own opportunities to target high value export markets. That is where we should be in the future, and I am confident that that is where the industry is going.</para><para>In the last two years, for example, we have built exports of high quality chilled pork to Singapore from next to nothing two years ago to over $90 million today. We have also built high quality pork exports to Japan from $22 million two years ago to $43 million today. That is a remarkable effort by any industry, and I do applaud the participants in the pig industry for the efforts that they have put into that. It is a remarkable achievement and it matches the export gains of our best performing agricultural industries of recent years. Those have been pressures and they have been opportunities, but they have also caused the industry to re-evaluate its priorities and to reassess its approach to the management of industry issues and the delivery of services. The new industry services body, which will be known as Australian Pork Ltd, is a result of recognising that new industry environment. </para><para>The Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation have been performing their designated functions to an excellent standard, but the industry has also recognised that industry services must be provided in a different way to more effectively and efficiently meet future opportunities and pressures to be faced by the industry. As a result of this legislation, the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation will be wound up. I feel that it is appropriate at this point to talk about how well those two organisations have served the industry to date and the good work they have in train. It is a credit to the board and staff of those organisations. Through my role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, I have been particularly involved with the work of the Pig Research and Development Corporation and, in attending many excellent seminars throughout Australia, I have noticed how well they are educating pig producers and other people associated with the industry to perform their role in the future. It is very reassuring to know that most of the staff of those two organisations will be continuing to work with the new industry services body.</para><para>There is also no doubt that the restructure provided by this legislation and the formation of the new company has widespread and unanimous industry support. The creation of Australian Pork Ltd is the culmination of extensive consultation and more than 12 months planning by the industry in partnership with the government. Under the arrangements, all levy payers will be eligible to become registered members of APL and, therefore, will be able to have direct input into the management of the industry services body. Industry levy payers will have, for the first time, direct influence and involvement in their industry service provider.</para><para>In the preceding speeches, a great deal of emphasis has been put on the word `accountability'. Perhaps I could reassure senators that the proposed approach has three strong levels of accountability built in to ensure that this new body is responsible in its use of both industry and Commonwealth funds. Never before have pork producers had the opportunity for such a direct say in the management of industry affairs and the provision of industry services. The company will be required to prepare annual strategic and operational plans and will be required to report back to members on its ability to meet planned objectives and outcomes. The annual report will also be underpinned by an annual audit and by regular independent performance reviews. Members will have the opportunity to directly question the board about the achievements and the conduct of the company and to make recommendations about the business of the company. Members will also have a direct say in any proposals to change levy rates and influence the selection of directors as well as voting rights on a range of governance and industry issues.</para><para>Because Commonwealth funds are involved through levy payers' contributions and matching research and development funds, there must also, of course, be a level of accountability to government. The framework for the arrangements recognises this. That expenditure—that is, expenditure of industry levies and eligible R&amp;D expenditure—currently amounts to more than $3.5 million each year. Accountability to government is therefore provided through the signing of a contract with the government. I expect that we will be exploring this in the committee stage. This will ensure that the board fulfils its industry and its public accountability obligations. The contract includes provisions for the company to prepare its strategic and operational plans, meeting specified requirements within four months after transition time. It also requires the company to have in place fraud control, intellectual property and risk management plans. </para><para>The contract also defines the purposes to which the marketing levy, the research and development levy and Commonwealth matching funds for research and development can be put. It specifies that an annual audit is required, that an independent performance review be conducted every three years and that copies of these reports be given to the Commonwealth. In addition, provision has been made for the chair of the company to meet regularly with the minister to discuss overall industry issues.</para><para>Finally, the company will be required to conform to the standards and requirements provided by the controls under Corporations Law. The board will be required to meet Corporations Law requirements for financial and fiduciary responsibility, and the company directors will be accountable in the normal manner as for any commercial company. If the company changes its constitution in a manner considered unacceptable to the government, if it becomes insolvent or if it fails to comply with the legislation or the contractual arrangements, the company may have its declaration as the industry services body revoked. All of these safeguards have been provided in the legislation to ensure that the company delivers what is expected of it by its members—the levy payers—and by government.</para><para>In conclusion, I strongly support the legislation, because it will deliver a new and more integrated and commercial approach to the delivery of marketing and research and development services. It will also deliver strategic policy and the management of pork industry issues. There is no doubt that there has been an extremely cohesive industry approach on these matters. Certainly, if there are any matters which require the attention of government, either the minister's office or my office would have heard about it. I emphasise that there has been a very well integrated and concerted approach by industry to deal with these matters, and that has come through in the way in which the legislation has been developed. This is an integrated and commercial approach and it will be driven and controlled by levy payers more directly than ever before. At the same time, there is strong accountability for performance built in as well as accountability to both levy payers and government. I commend the legislation to the Senate. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that consideration of this bill in committee of the whole be made an order of the day for a later hour.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NEW ZEALAND PARLIAMENT: GIFT TO THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>22923</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>22923</page.no><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to inform the Senate of a gift to the parliament by the New Zealand parliament.

It is a very significant gesture. When Mr Hunt made the presentation he made plain that it was because of the close association between our parliaments and the affection that is felt between Australian and New Zealand parliamentarians.

He was looking for new things to paint and new things to see. He had met a New Zealand student when he had been studying in London. During that time, he was commissioned by the new New Zealand Tourist Commission to do two paintings. It was the year New Zealand became a dominion. This is one of those paintings. Subsequently, it was used by the Tourist Commission.

The painting will be hung in the public area of the parliament near the Presiding Officers exhibition area. I hope that many people will see it during this year and into the future.

Firstly, Senator Cook will be aware that I am always somewhat loath to take quotes from the Labor Party because they are often quoted completely out of context. The record will show that on numerous occasions in this chamber exact and full quotes have not been given and the context of those quotes has not been appropriately shown. Let me make a couple of observations in relation to the first quote. When the Australian dollar falls quite clearly it does affect the price of imports, as Senator Cook said. Equally, the falling dollar can have the effect of boosting the export sector. As Senator Minchin has said on a couple of occasions, there are issues you have to put on the negative side and there are issues that you have to put on the positive side, and that is correct.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the second quote by Senator Cook, the performance of the government in delivering higher living standards to Australians is virtually without parallel in the last 30 years. The government have delivered a prolonged period of growth. Equally, we have delivered rising real wages, which the former government failed to deliver. Let me also make the observation that we have been able to increase the real level of pensions and benefits. Those points have been made on many occasions by my colleague Senator Amanda Vanstone. The Prime Minister has quite rightly drawn attention to the fact that the government have lifted the real level of pensions. Equally, he pointed to the fact that, because of the performance of the economy, we have delivered real rises in wages and salaries, the likes of which were not parallelled by the previous government.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22924</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is as if Ryan never happened!

It is quite true that every time Senator Cook and his colleagues get up in this parliament they attempt to talk down the Australian economy. That is the Labor Party's approach—to talk down the Australian economy. The reasons for the changes in the value of the Australian dollar have been explained on many occasions. It is quite clear that we have seen a surge of support towards the US dollar, which has affected the level of currencies valued in American dollars.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drugs: Tough on Drugs Strategy</title><page.no>22924</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>22924</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison.

Yesterday the Prime Minister launched the latest initiative of the government in the Tough on Drugs strategy. It is our strongest defence against the drug problem. Recent research shows that more than 70 per cent of young people aged between 15 and 17 are influenced by the advice of their parents, especially in relation to illicit drug usage. So it is very important that we target families and parents in Australia in our fight against drugs. The first phase of the campaign will run over the next two months. Just over $27 million has been allocated for this very important information campaign. An information booklet will go to all households, containing very important information on how parents can talk to their children about drug usage, how they can understand the problem and how they can pick up those warning signs that are so important when dealing with children, particularly of teenage years, in relation to drug abuse.</para></talk.start><para>There will also be a television campaign and an information and support network involved where families can get further advice and assistance including a free information line 1800 250 015. This will provide information and point parents, and others who are interested, to counselling services that are available and will work through alcohol and drug information services in each state and territory. This is a very important initiative in relation to the Tough on Drugs strategy, one which has involved more than $500 million of expenditure by this government. </para><para>We also have other aspects to the strategy and, as mentioned by Senator Coonan, there is the law enforcement aspect, and that is very important indeed. Last year we saw a 300 per cent increase in the interception of illegal drugs. Since this Tough on Drugs strategy we have seen $1.24 billion worth of illicit drugs seized by our law enforcement agencies and we have the highest level of cooperation by our law enforcement agencies to date. Yet we still have the Leader of the Opposition talking about a coastguard, something which in 1984 he said in a report would be too inefficient and too costly. This is an example of someone who has not thought through policy in relation to this very important area. We have in place a coastal surveillance strategy—over $120 million there. We have our National Illicit Drug Strategy, which ties in law enforcement agencies across this country and deals with not only working at the border and Customs interception of illicit drugs but also the AFP and the excellent work it has been doing with the NCA, the National Crime Authority, and state police forces across this country.</para><para>This initiative that the Prime Minister launched deals with education. What did Labor have it in its position on drugs which was released just two weeks ago? What did it say about education? Out of 28 pages, less than one page was on education. We have the Leader of the Opposition going beyond in principle support for heroin trials when he says, `Labor will provide funds to assist in the proper and independent assessment of heroin trials'—a lot of rhetoric, a lot of talk about heroin trials but nothing concrete on things such as law enforcement and education. We have a concrete, practical approach to helping families and particularly Australian parents in dealing with their children and educating them against the scourge of drug abuse. This will go a long way to helping families across the board in dealing with the drug problem, which all Australians know is one of the biggest problems facing society today.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economy: Performance</title><page.no>22925</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>22925</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer.

I am also pleased to record that the Treasurer went on to say that the economic fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong, backed by low inflation, low interest rates and a strong budget position.

We have done an enormous amount to stimulate innovation and investment in this country, and it is reflected very starkly in the figures. Ever since we established the Innovation Investment Fund scheme back in 1997, we have put some $200 million into ensuring, on a match basis, that there are a number of projects that are now able to access funding that simply was not there before. Similarly, the BIT scheme with the new incubators in each state and territory will lead to a very significant expansion of activity that does require venture capital funding, or pre-seed funding, as will be available from the innovation action plan. Of course that was a very major statement. I think it is probably the single most important statement that has ever been made in the area of innovation, and it is something that was greatly welcomed by the community in general and the scientific and other communities in particular who have been crying out for this sort of assistance—$2.9 billion is a very substantial sum of money.</para></talk.start><para>What had been the Labor Party's response to date? We got that mickey mouse online university, which turned out to have been around already for about six or seven years and which has now been pretty much discredited overseas, and the Labor Party were telling us that it was somehow going to blow the innovation action plan out of the water. We have a long way to go. We now read that all their policies have been completed. Madam President, did you know that? They are now out there boasting that they are all in the bottom drawer. So what are they afraid of? It is all a bit confusing, isn't it? As recently as last week, on the Monday after the Ryan by-election, Mr Beazley was saying that, if they did not have any policies, the issue of how they can afford them does not come up. So, in other words, on the one hand he is out there saying, `Don't expect us to cost anything;' but now he is out there blithely telling people that they are all in the bottom drawer. Of course, they are based on estimates that were some months old and which have nothing to do with the current situation and which, he now says, because of the Charter of Budget Honesty, means that they will not be able to do anything until the second week of the election campaign. So they really are all over the shop.</para><para>In terms of venture capital, the amount raised annually has increased by a factor of 10 since this lot were thrown out of office. In the last year of Labor, in 1996, there was a trickle of $103 million of new capital raised; in 2000 it was $1.2 billion. In the last year of Labor there were four venture capital funds—in other words, count them on the fingers of one hand—averaging $43 million; last year there were 42 and the amount was in fact doubled. Industry had come to a dead stop, but it has been very substantially revived by the current government, and we have introduced policies that are very much appreciated.</para><para>As we get closer to the end of the year, it is going to be a very stark contrast. People will not have forgotten readily the Toorak tractors, nor will they have forgotten the capital gains tax Labor introduced, which they were retrospectively going to freeze and use as an asset base, so all those pensioners and others who had modest assets were going to have to have them valued. What a success story that was! It was simply indicative of what Senator Kemp has said on a number of occasions: a high tax and spend party has to keep finding new taxes. So of course Labor over 13 years came up with a resource rent tax, Medicare levies, capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, tax on super funds, broadening the company income tax base, the gold industry tax—dudding every consumer in Australia. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—But you did not have the courage to that, did you?

Talk about dodgy practices! I recall in November 1995 a senior frontbencher of the Labor Party stood up and indicated that the budget was in surplus. Senator Cook, I am sorry to say, stood up in this parliament when the budget was running into a deficit of $10 billion and claimed that the budget was in surplus. Correct me if I am wrong, Madam President, but I do not recall Senator Cook ever getting up and saying sorry, apologising or correcting his statement.</para></talk.start><para>I now turn to the question that Senator Bishop raised. The auction for the third-generation spectrum concluded on Thursday, 22 March, following six days of bidding, raising $1.17 billion. The amount raised in the auction was nearly $90 million above the reserve price set by the Australian Communications Authority. The outcome of the auction is a good result for Australian consumers, given the variety of telecommunication companies that were successful in securing a licence to provide 3G services.</para><para>There was a reference to the budget estimates. I make the point, Senator Bishop, that, as responsible governments do in these matters where a different range of factors present themselves, the budget estimates for the 3G auction were revised downwards. The Treasurer also made a comment on this matter and, time permitting, I might share it with the Senate. Failing that, Senator Bishop, if you would be kind enough to ask me a supplementary question I could complete it. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, was asked a very similar question on this matter and this is what he said:</para><quote><para>The spectrum proceeds are in relation to this financial year, not in relation to the next financial year. I notice that the spectrum auction tipped the reserve. The government has been constantly monitoring values and adjusting its estimates accordingly and the price that was achieved today was a little above what we thought it would be and that is why we set the reserve price where we did. The valuation in relation to spectrum has been revisited, and revisited on a couple of occasions. </para></quote><para>That is the point I made earlier in my remarks, Senator. So there is not an issue of dodgy figures. It is not surprising that the Labor Party itself would refer to dodgy figures because the truth of the matter is that the former government—the Keating government and, before that, the Hawke government—was notorious for its dodgy figures. I know that was before your time and you presumably do not hold yourself responsible; but the pity is, Senator, as we run towards the next election, people are going to remember the performance of the former Labor government. They will remember, as I said in my earlier remarks, the very high interest rates which prevailed under the previous government.

It has received significant media attention both in Australia and overseas. The government has enacted legislation at the Commonwealth level, and is encouraging states and territories to also do so, to ban the cloning of human beings. The government has stated that the ban on the cloning of whole human beings in the Gene Technology Act 2000 is an interim measure until each state and territory has implemented appropriate legislation in this area. The term `genetically identical', as used in the Gene Technology Act 2000, is the same as that used in Western Australian, South Australian and Victorian assisted reproductive technology legislation. This works adequately in those states, since it is underpinned and clarified through additional, more specific, prohibitions. </para></talk.start><para>The wording in the Gene Technology Act is a strong statement of the government's intention that the cloning of whole human beings will not be carried out in Australia. It is expected that further clarification of this intent will be provided. At the health ministers' conference in July last year, ministers agreed to ban cloning of human beings; and this is being pursued by each state and territory in a manner that complements the bans in other jurisdictions. The term `genetically identical' has been deemed to be sufficient from a legal perspective. However, it has been criticised on some scientific grounds. For instance, the procedure that led to the cloning of Dolly the sheep and that is considered most likely to be used to clone a human being involves the nucleation of an ovum, which effectively removes most—that is, approximately 99 per cent—of the DNA or genetic material from the ovum.

I will give it to him now, if he is happy. I just was not sure exactly how much detail the senator wanted at this point in time. The organelles known as mitochondria, a component part of the ovum but not within the nucleus, contain extranuclear DNA which contributes to the total genetic material of the ovum approximately one per cent. The mitochondrial genetic information remains common to the ovum donor and not to the nucleus donor. As all of the genetic material present in the embryo resulting from the procedure is not common to one individual, this procedure will not create a genetically identical individual. Secondly, during each cycle of cell division, the DNA contained within a cell, including both nuclear and extranuclear DNA, is replicated. Errors in this process, more commonly called mutations, mean that the copy of the DNA produced from this process is not an exact duplicate of the original. Hence, the product of cell division is not genetically identical to the cell from which it was produced.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The National Health and Medical Research Council has taken these and other issues into account and has facilitated a process to develop a framework through which each state and territory can implement complementary legislation to ban cloning of human beings, and will report back by the end of this month: that is the advice that I have, Senator. The broader issues relating to the use of cloning technologies are being addressed in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which has undertaken extensive consultation. Both the Andrews committee and the NHMRC, on its consultation with the states and territories, are expected to report by the end of this month.

On 9 March, the Prime Minister announced that the size of that grant would be doubled, to $14,000, for those first home buyers who signed a contract to build a new home on or before 9 March 2001. The initiative will remain in place until 31 December 2001. It is expected that this temporary measure will help the housing construction industry, which is now showing signs of recovery after the significant bring-forward of construction activity in the first half of 2000. I think it is worth noting the response from various industry bodies.

Home owners can now save up to $270 a month on a $100,000 loan as a result of the interest rate reductions which have occurred under the Howard government. As has been referred to a couple of times in question time today, one of the things the former Labor government was remembered for was its very high interest rate policy and the fact that home loan rates did go as high, at one stage, as 17 per cent. Again, there has never been any apology from one of the former Keating ministers for that appalling mismanagement of the economy.</para><para>This effectively represents a direct dividend as a result of the sound management of this government.

Secondly, if you adopt a more flexible industrial relations system there is a chance for both employers and employees to benefit. That has been demonstrated by the government as well, because not only are more Australians in work but more of them have done better.

The Falcon 900 aircraft will be progressively withdrawn and replaced with the new fleet of two International Special Purpose Aircraft (Boeing 737) in mid-2002 and three Domestic Special Purpose Aircraft (Challenger 604) in mid to late 2002. With the introduction of the new International Special Purpose Aircraft, the Boeing 707 will no longer be used for VIP operations, and the fleet reduced from five to four aircraft. The remaining Boeing 707 aircraft were to be retained in RAAF service and operated as air-to-air refuelling and transport aircraft until the introduction of new generation tanker/transport aircraft under Project Air 5402 in 2006. However, due to the increasing cost and length of major servicings being experienced by the Boeing 707 fleet, the RAAF is currently examining other options that would provide a level of interim tanker/transport capability. Funding for this interim capability is included in the Defence White Paper funding parameters announced by the government. This may allow for an earlier retirement of the Boeing 707s.</para><para>(3)	As I indicated in my response on 8 March, the government would not want or allow its personnel to fly or operate equipment or aircraft regarded as dangerous.</para><para>(4)	The fleet of Falcon 900 aircraft will be withdrawn and replaced by the new VIP fleet as planned.

There are currently no air-to-air refuelling aircraft in production, but tanker aircraft are being developed based on the latest commercial passenger aircraft such as the Boeing 767 and Airbus 310/330.</para><para>(5)	The Prime Minister was making the point that the increasing age of the aircraft is related to the safety of the Boeing 707 aircraft.

Forget, too, about the changes to the economy, where the GST has pushed prices well above what the government forecast and the so-called compensation package of tax cuts has delivered well below what it promised. Remember the famous words: no Australian will be worse off because of the GST. You get a hollow laugh at any business gathering in Australia when you talk about the GST and who is worse off. Every Australian businessman knows that the BAS, the business activity statement, has bound them head and foot in red tape, made life harder for them and turned them into collectors for the tax office when all they want to do is conduct their own business.

We need to put this in context, of course. We need to understand what happened when Labor was last in government some years ago and contrast that situation with the economy under the present government.</para></talk.start><para>It is important to remind the chamber that under the Howard Liberal-National Party government Australia enjoyed 14 consecutive quarters of annualised growth of greater than four per cent before the most recent December quarter, which showed a mild decline. This is a remarkable economic performance, directly attributable to the sound management of Prime Minister Howard, Treasurer Costello and this government. It is something that the Labor Party has never achieved in government: not in its 13 years in office did it achieve a growth rate of that level over that extended a period.</para><para>As a consequence of that strong economic growth over that extended period, 800,000 new jobs have been created. Eight hundred thousand people are in work who would not otherwise have been in work had those policies not been pursued and that record not been achieved by the present federal government. That has resulted in unemployment falling from 11.2 per cent, as it was under the Labor government, to a current rate of 6.7 per cent. This is a dramatic improvement in the level of unemployment.</para><para>Let us not forget the situation of interest rates when Labor were in office. They peaked at 17 per cent under Labor. No wonder the economy was in the dire situation it was when Labor were in office. No small business—no business of any type—and no farm operation can survive effectively when they have to pay interest rates of 17 per cent. Those interest rates are now down to 7.3 per cent under the present government.</para><para>Another very important benefit of the Howard government's policies has been the increase in productivity. Productivity growth has remained high throughout the period of the Howard government. That has allowed strong real wages growth, so in real terms people are better off than they were under Labor, when there were real wage reductions. The so-called `party of the workers' actually presided over an extended period of real wage reductions, with high inflation accompanying that. We have managed to develop and implement policies which have insured strong growth in productivity. That productivity has allowed real wages to increase so that employees are much better off. Real wages growth was of the order of 4.3 per cent over the year to December last year. As I said, a consequence of that productivity growth has been low inflation: a CPI growth of about 0.3 per cent for the December quarter.</para><para>That is the contrast between the present Howard Liberal-National government's record and that which transpired when Labor was in office. But let us also remember the legacy that Labor left, which this government has turned around. A $10 billion budget deficit was inherited. That has now been turned into a sustainable surplus—and a surplus that has been evident in every year the Howard government has been in office, because of our prudent economic management and our good housekeeping.</para><para>When this government came to office, government debt was of the order of $90 billion. It increased by some $70 billion to $80 billion in just a few years of Labor government. The Howard government has repaid more than $50 billion of that net government debt in our five years in office, compared with that massive increase in government debt under Labor. That is recognised by the international financial community and it is another reason why the economy has performed so well over this five-year period and why interest rates have remained low. The ratio of public net debt to gross domestic product will have fallen from around 20 per cent of gross domestic product when Labor left office to 6.4 per cent in the current financial year. On top of all that, we have delivered the biggest tax cuts in Australian history: $12 billion of tax cuts. This government's management stands tall against that of the previous Labor government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>22939</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We can all reflect on the legacies and records of past governments.

The Prime Minister promised that the GST would not increase the price of petrol. He clawed back 1.5c in GST revenue from higher petrol prices. Higher petrol prices are in part brought about by a lower dollar. The Prime Minister promised that the price of a glass of beer would not increase by more than 1.9c. It went up by 8c—again, because of the GST. We have had pensioners rightly very angry at the clawback of half the pension increase.

For the first time since Federation, literally millions of small businesses are unpaid tax collectors on behalf of the Commonwealth government. An out of touch government has foisted an unintelligible bureaucratic business tax collection system on millions of small businesses and hundreds of thousands of self-funded retirees around Australia. For the first time in living memory, large numbers of small businesses have had to borrow—to go to the banks and arrange additional credit—to pay their quarterly tax bill to their supposed friend, their own party, the Commonwealth government. </para><para>So the direct result of the GST is damage, closure and non-expansion of thousands of small businesses around Australia. Repeatedly, we are told that small business is the engine of growth of the Australian economy. Repeatedly, this government tells us that small business is the generator of additional employment in the Australian economy. Yet the tax monster of the government, the GST, is responsible for negative growth in gross domestic product; record high levels of foreign debt; a record low level Australian dollar; a collapse in the housing economy, in the building and construction industry, over the last six months; the largest revenue take by the Commonwealth government in the history since Federation; and, as I said at the outset, the first quarter of negative growth in 10 years.</para><para>And what is the government response to all of this damage? Does it promise to make the GST fair and equitable? Does it lay out policies to lift the tax burden from small business? Does it lay out policies to lift the dead hand of bureaucracy from thousands and thousands of small businesses around Australia? The answer to each of those questions is no, no and no. The only effort being made by the Commonwealth government is to dodge the issue, to avoid the issue and to attempt to blame someone else—anyone else—for the policies they have imposed on this country and for the damage they are causing to the Australian economy. Look at the list of culprits over the last six months: the Reserve Bank, Treasury, the Australian Taxation Office, the United States and Japan. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Gene Technology</title><page.no>22942</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>22942</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Vanstone) to a question without notice asked by Senator Harradine today relating to human cloning.</para></motion><para>I do not know when I last took note of an answer to a question without notice, but I do so now because the matter of cloning human beings is extremely serious. There is also the issue of this chamber being misled. I make this point that I did not wish to reflect on Senator Vanstone personally when I said, `You misled the parliament.' By `you' I meant the government, on advice from the National Health and Medical Research Council. I was frustrated, and I apologise for that. </para><para>In the debate last December, I pointed out that to define a clone as being 100 per cent identical to the original is scientifically false. How could the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia not know that? Of course they must have known that. It worries me that they have given advice to the government that was false and that they have given the state governments and the territory governments a view of the Australian Health Ethics Committee that was also false, so much so that the Chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee had to repudiate what the National Health and Medical Research Council said. Bear in mind that, under section 8 of the National Health and Medical Research Council Act, there is a requirement for that body to observe the ethical guidelines that are presented by the Australian Health Ethics Committee. Far from doing that, the National Health and Medical Research Council are deliberately on a path of distinguishing between so-called reproductive cloning and so-called therapeutic cloning. They said that the Australian Health Ethics Committee had made that distinction. Let me read what the Chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, Dr Breen, said:</para><quote><para>In fact, in the Cloning Report AHEC specifically rejected the distinction between so-called `therapeutic' and so-called `reproductive' cloning.</para></quote><para>The government must tell the National Health and Medical Research Council to observe its functions under the act. There are some science technologists who want this distinction so they can clone embryonic human beings, keep them in existence for some time and experiment on them. Those human beings will not have a father and a mother. They will be at the sole discretion of the science technologists, who will own those embryonic human beings. That is a real tragedy. At least in the IVF area there are parents who have to give permission; with cloning it will be the science technologists who will own the embryo. The National Health and Medical Research Council is working behind the scenes to assist these science technologists instead of observing what the Australian Health Ethics Committee has declared in its guidelines. I will mention, too, that one of the excuses given for so-called therapeutic cloning is for stem cells to be extracted from—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>22942</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>22942</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I wish to make a personal explanation as I claim to have been misrepresented.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—The honourable senator may proceed.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name></talker><para>—Firstly, this would have been a very easy mistake to make.

The Committee has sought advice as to why these Regulations reduce the amount of the Uranium Producers Charge.</para><para>These Regulations are made pursuant to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 and the Nuclear Safeguards (Producers of Uranium Ore Concentrates) Charge Act 1993, both of which are matters of my portfolio responsibility, and the Explanatory Memorandum for the Regulations clearly indicated that the Regulations were introduced on my behalf. The delay in responding is due to the fact that your letter was directed to Senator Hill, and I have only just become aware of the Committee's enquiry.</para><para>The Uranium Producers Charge was introduced as a cost recovery measure, to recover a proportion of the costs of the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office (ASNO) for activities which the Government considered were of significant benefit to industry. The charge is exacted on a per kilogram of production basis. The intention is that the charge will be adjusted each year, taking account of changes in production levels, to ensure that the revenue collected corresponds to these costs. Further background to the charge is given in ASNO's Annual Report.</para><para>Where the level of production increases, but there has been no commensurate increase in ASNO's costs, unless an adjustment is made there would be a windfall gain to revenue. Conversely, if there is a fall in production the charge would be increased to maintain revenue at the appropriate level. This is what was meant by the reference in the Explanatory Memorandum to taking “account of the level of production for 1999/2000 relative to the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office's operating costs.”</para><para>The charge payable in 1999/2000, 8.6456 cents per kilogram of uranium, was based on a total production of 5,413 tonnes. This resulted in revenue of $468,000. For the charge payable in 2000/2001 the applicable production level is 6,954 tonnes. ASNO's costs for the relevant activities remained largely the same. If the charge were not adjusted, the revenue. collected would be $601,000, representing a windfall gain of 28% relative to costs, an outcome clearly inconsistent with the principle of cost recovery. This Regulation, adjusting the charge to 6.7463 cents per kilogram, is intended to avoid this outcome.</para><para>In circumstances where the Committee's request for clarification had not been directed to me as responsible Minister, I am concerned that you have moved to disallow these Regulations. I trust that the information I have provided will enable the Committee to reconsider the matter.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Alexander Downer</para></quote><para>—————</para><quote><para>Senator Helen Coonan</para><para>Chair</para><para>Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA ACT 2600</para><para>15 January 2001</para><para>Dear Senator Coonan</para><para>I refer to your letter of 30 November 2000 regarding the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Amendment Regulations 2000 and Statutory Rules 2000 No. 305 which relates to the amount of charge payable by a producer of uranium ore concentrates.</para><para>I am advised by the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office (ASNO) that the decreased charge payable on 1 December 2000 relates to differences in annual production levels of uranium ore concentrates and the cost recovery mechanism utilised by ASNO. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1993 provides for producers to pay an annual charge, prescribed by regulation, up to a combined maximum of $500 000. The current charge is a “safeguards fee” per kilogram of production. In November 1999 the fee was set at 8.6456 Cents per kilogram of contained uranium produced during 1998-99. Based on increased production levels for 1999-2000, the charge has been amended to 6.7463 cents per kilogram to cover ASNO's operating costs in relation to both the export of produced uranium ore concentrates and subsequent movements through the international nuclear fuel cycle.

</para><para>3.	by improving controls over cargo and its movement; and</para><para>4.	through creation of new cost recovery arrangements to support the changes to cargo processing.</para><para>Over the last five years, the volume of air cargo in Australia has grown by 59% and sea cargo by 48%.</para><para>This growth is forecast to continue.</para><para>In fact, industry predicts air cargo will increase by 37% and sea cargo by 18% over the next three years.</para><para>Accompanying this growth are new developments in cargo shipping and handling techniques to complement sophisticated supply chain management, including just-in-time processing demands.</para><para>International trade is harnessing the benefits of developments in information technology and so must Customs.</para><para>But, in facilitating the movement of international cargo, Customs cannot compromise its law enforcement role in relation to prohibited imports such as drugs and firearms, intellectual property rights and links with the role of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS).</para><para>The Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Bill is the principal bill in this package and will amend the <inline font-style="italic">Customs Act 1901</inline> to allow for more contemporary methods of communication between Customs and the international trading community.  </para><para>Use of open internet-based systems of communication with choice of interactive or EDI communication channels will be a feature of Customs new technology giving effect to this Government's commitment to the Information Economy.  </para><para>For many traders, internet communication will be more cost-effective than using traditional EDI methods.</para><para>As I implied earlier, Customs will be employing a range of compliance management techniques.   </para><para>The amount of information required, and the timing of receipt of the information, may be varied depending on the level of risk that a particular import or export consignment poses and a company's history of compliance in providing accurate information to Customs.</para><para>Such flexibility will save compliant importers and exporters both time and money.</para><para>This is reflected in reduced cost recovery charges that are outlined in the Import Processing Charges Bill 2000 and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Amendment Bill 2000.</para><para>In relation to Customs community protection obligations to which I referred earlier, this package of bills establishes new reporting requirements for carriers bringing cargo into Australia. </para><para>Details of sea cargo must be electronically reported to Customs at least 24 hours prior to arrival in Australia and air cargo at least 2 hours prior to arrival.  </para><para>Electronically reported pre-arrival cargo information provides Customs and AQIS with the ability to clear legitimate cargo quickly and stop high-risk cargo for closer inspection.</para><para>As a further protection against the importation of prohibited goods, those responsible for unloading ships or aircraft will be required to report what they have unloaded. </para><para>This information will be used to identify any surplus or missing cargo.</para><para>I'd now like to focus on new arrangements for the control and verification of export cargo that this bill will bring about. </para><para>Customs now has a greater role to play in the verification of cargo reported for export. </para><para>The reasons for this are three-fold.  </para><para>First, exported goods are exempt from GST.  </para><para>As such, it is necessary for information about exports to be provided accurately to Government so that appropriate input credits can be calculated.</para><para>Second, there is evidence that goods are being unlawfully diverted from export into domestic commerce as part of revenue fraud rackets.</para><para>Third, the export permits requirements of other Government agencies must be effectively administered.</para><para>Inaccurate export information or worse, no information at all, has the potential to encourage illegal activity and affects the accuracy of data being passed to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.   </para><para>Material errors in trade data have consequential impacts on economic forecasting and Australia's international standing.</para><para>It is therefore in everyone's interest to improve the levels of compliance in relation to exports.</para><para>This bill introduces a number of measures that are aimed at achieving just that, including:</para></quote><para>·	prohibiting licensees of Customs warehouses from releasing prescribed goods for export until they confirm with Customs that the goods have been entered for export and export approval has been given; and</para><para>·	a requirement that consolidations of certain goods for export (such as tobacco products and alcohol) must only be done at a prescribed place and that the operator of the prescribed place must confirm with Customs the arrival and departure of the goods.</para><quote><para>To emphasise compliance with the new requirements for both imports and exports the bill introduces strict liability offences for breaches, with the option of issuing an infringement notice for an administrative penalty of 20% of the amount of the proposed maximum penalties.</para><para>The Government does not impose strict liability lightly.  </para><para>Generally speaking, its imposition will involve consideration of whether a public welfare or public interest pertains.  </para><para>In this case, the Government believes that it does for several reasons:</para></quote><para>·	Firstly, there is a significant risk to revenue if imports or exports are inaccurately reported.

Firstly, the amendments that I referred to in my speech on the second reading have now been circulated to the chamber and they are set out on sheet No. 2164. Secondly, I want to respond briefly to the comments made by Senator Woodley and the parliamentary secretary about our amendments. We were not in a position until this morning to provide a draft of our proposed amendments to the parties in the Senate. The reason for that is that we have been waiting for some time—indeed, up until late last week—to have access to important documentation associated with this bill, in particular the draft constitution of Australian Pork Ltd and also the final draft of the proposed contract between the Commonwealth and Australian Pork Ltd. I indicated in my speech on the second reading that we did have the opportunity of discussions with the industry and also some briefing from the government in the lead-up to the bill being introduced, but we did not get a real opportunity to have a briefing on the constitution and the draft until fairly recently.</para></talk.start><para>As the Senate is aware, it has been a concern of ours for some time that this government and particularly this minister often proceed to introduce legislation in parliament and attempt to have it dealt with without all of the documentation being available. I refer in particular to such things as regulations and, in the case of this legislation and similar legislation for other industries, the proposed contracts and constitutions of the new corporations that are to be established. This was a problem we encountered in relation to horticulture and during the wool industry debate; and I believe that, if we went back through the records, there would be a number of others that we could make similar comments about.</para><para>It is important, in considering whether or not one can support the bill before the chamber, to have access to that material. As the minister himself has stated in his correspondence to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the particular and important provisions on how the new company will operate are contained not in the bill but in the contract. After I had the opportunity to come to Canberra last Thursday for a final briefing from the government on the final draft of the contract in particular, we decided to proceed with amendments that we had earlier indicated we were considering moving. Those amendments were really only able to the prepared in a draft form late last week and consequently were only able to be provided to Senator Woodley this morning. I am advised, Senator Woodley, that efforts were made to contact you and also that a copy of the draft amendments was faxed your office at about 11.40 a.m. Similarly, the government had a copy of the draft amendments at an earlier stage, and I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry that the amendments that have now been circulated in the chamber are the same as were provided to the government in draft form earlier.</para><para>I now turn to our amendments.

Amendment No. 1 is to insert into the definitions clause of the bill a definition of `Presiding Officer'. That is necessary because the following two proposed amendments make reference to the presiding officer of each house. So amendment (1) would put in a definition that `Presiding Officer' means, in relation to the House of Representatives, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and, in relation to the Senate, the President of the Senate.</para><para>The two important amendments are (2) and (3), which deal with the powers of the minister to make declarations and to issue directions. Firstly, amendment (2) would vary clause 11 of the bill. As it currently reads, clause 11 is very short and just says:</para><quote><para>If a funding contract has been made that provides for payments to be made to an eligible body, the Minister may, in writing, declare that body to be the industry services body for the purposes of this Act.</para></quote><para>Then there is a note which says:</para><quote><para>Subsection 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Acts 1901 provides for repeal, variation etc. of instruments.</para></quote><para>We are proposing to replace that clause with a more extensive clause, which I will not read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. I will just draw attention to the key points in the amendment. Basically it would require that, where the minister does make a declaration that a body or a company is to be an industry services body for the purposes of the act, the minister must then cause a copy of such declaration to be laid before each house of parliament or, if a house is not sitting, presented to the presiding officer of that house for circulation to members of that house and tabling on the next sitting day within five days after the declaration is made. That would be the first substantial requirement upon the minister: to lay a copy of the declaration before the houses of parliament. The second would be that it also be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> within 14 days after the declaration is made.</para><para>That will, we believe, provide the sort of accountability and opportunities for the parliament which are lacking at the moment and to which the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee has drawn attention. I referred to this in my speech in the second reading debate. Indeed, I think I can say that this proposed amendment is along the lines of that which was agreed to by the Senate to be inserted into the bill dealing with the restructuring of the horticultural industry.</para><para>Amendment No. 3 proposes to amend clause 12, which deals with ministerial directions to industry services bodies. This amendment would insert a new subclause 3, which would provide—and I am summarising again here—that the minister must cause a copy of the direction to be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> as soon as practicable after giving the direction and, secondly, that it be tabled in each house of the parliament within five sitting days after the giving of the direction. Further, the annual reports of the body—in this case, the company—should contain references to the particulars of the direction made by the minister and an assessment of the impact that the direction has had on the operations of the body or the company during that period.</para><para>I covered the arguments in favour of the amendments during my remarks in the second reading debate and I would hope that the government, now that they have had an opportunity to consider them, would agree to them. Hopefully, Senator Woodley can see the merit of what we are doing and agree also. As I have said, this continues a similar approach to that which was adopted in regard to earlier legislation, particularly in regard to the horticulture bills. I also indicated in my speech in the second reading debate that there were some other issues on which we—and I believe other senators also—would seek clarification, but possibly I can leave that to another intervention during the debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>22957</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have considered the amendments that are before us and I have also taken some advice. I certainly am listening very carefully to the debate. The Democrats are inclined to support the amendments, given that they seek to give the parliament more scrutiny over the actions of the minister, and the Democrats always support that. I would point out that the Democrats have not on this occasion moved an amendment that we move in most of these cases to seek greater accountability on the part of these kinds of bodies; an amendment my colleague Senator Murray has moved and spoken to on many occasions. One is almost tempted to say that we should consider that amendment along with these, but I do not think I want to hold the chamber up to that degree. Also, I must say that, having moved that amendment and had it defeated 17 times, it probably would not have succeeded on this occasion. However, it is a much better amendment than the one proposed by the opposition; it is much more comprehensive and goes to the competency of boards and the like. </para></talk.start><para>I think that these particular amendments do have merit. I understand that the industry is happy with them. Therefore, I indicate that the Democrats will support the amendments. However, I do have a question for Senator Forshaw. Senator Forshaw, in your amendment No. 3, subsection (4), it says:</para><quote><para>	Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a particular direction if:</para></quote><para>Then you have two escape clauses. It seems to me that those escape clauses almost neutralise or negate the intention of your amendment, because I cannot think of much that would be outside the `commercial activities of the body' or `contrary to the public interest'. It seems to me that that is a pretty wide escape clause that you could drive a train through, if you wanted to. You have tried to tie the minister down and then you have given him a tunnel through which to escape. You might like to consider that and, if you can convince me otherwise, that would be good. I am not inclined to want to omit that subsection or do anything about it; I just want to draw attention to the fact that it seems to be a pretty wide escape clause for the minister, if he wanted one.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>22958</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator, the existing clause 12 of the bill states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Minister must cause a copy of a direction to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the direction is given, unless the Minister makes a written determination that doing so would be likely to prejudice:</para><para>(a)	the national interest of Australia; or</para><para>(b)	the body's commercial activities.</para></quote><para>Our amendment strengthens the provisions which deal with the requirements on the minister to table the copy of the direction in the parliament, to publish it in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> and to also have it included by the company in their annual reports. But we have retained that proviso that is in the government's bill that, in those limited and exceptional circumstances, the minister may not have to comply with that requirement, clearly, if it were seen to prejudice the commercial activities of the company or was contrary to the public interest.</para><para>I understand the point that you are making, but what we did not want to do was remove totally the proviso that there could well exist certain circumstances—we would see them as very unique, and not circumstances that would arise every day—where it may be against the company's interests or against the national interest for that requirement to have to be met. The parliamentary secretary might wish to comment on this, but one of the situations that was referred to in the correspondence from, I think, the minister to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was that where, for instance, the situation was that our international relations or diplomatic relations with another country were affected by some issue and certain directions were given to the company, it might not be in our own national interest nor in the company's interests to require that to be tabled in the way in which it otherwise would be.</para><para>I do not think I can add anything more to that. But here, Senator, it has to be recognised that, as I understand it, for the minister to be satisfied one would assume that, particularly in regard to, say, the commercial activities test, the company would have to convince the minister that such a request was reasonable. I can well envisage that in those circumstances opportunities would arise for senators of the parliament to test those issues and whether or not the minister had exercised his discretion appropriately, through the processes that are available to the Senate—particularly, say, through the committee procedures, the estimates procedures or whatever.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>22958</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government is disposed to accept these amendments.

One of the issues that we have a concern about is that the bill sets out the procedures—and we have just amended them—whereby the minister can declare the company or a company as the industry services body. The bill does not set out the corresponding procedures whereby the minister might revoke or suspend such a declaration. This is again an issue that senators will recall was touched upon in debates on other legislation. For the contract, clause 2 is the clause that deals with term and operation of the agreement, and you then go to clause 16. Clause 16 deals with termination and recovery. Particularly I would draw attention to 16.2 of the draft contract, which I understand has been provided to parties in the Senate—certainly, it was provided to the opposition. It states—and I will read it into the record:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Subject to this clause 16, if:</para><para>the Company is in breach of any obligation or warranty under this Agreement and the company has not commenced steps reasonably acceptable to the Commonwealth to rectify the breach within 14 days of receiving notice of the breach; </para><para>the Company fails to comply with the direction given to it by the minister under section 12 of the Act; or </para><para>an Insolvency Event occurs;</para><para> the Commonwealth may, by giving notice in writing to the Company, terminate this Agreement from a day specified in the notice, which day must be a day on or after the day on which the notice is given.</para></quote><para>That clause clearly gives the Commonwealth the right to terminate the contract. In his second reading speech, Minister Truss stated:</para><quote><para>If the company changes its constitution in a way considered unacceptable by government, becomes insolvent, or fails to comply with the legislation or contract, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has the ability to temporarily suspend or terminate the payment of statutory levies to the company or rescind his declaration of APL being the industry services body.</para></quote><para>Going back to the bill, the bill actually has a note in clause 11—and I referred to this earlier—which says that subsection 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides for repeal, variation, et cetera, of instruments. Our concern has been that, whilst there is a procedure laid out in the bill as to how the minister can make a declaration that the company is an industry services body, and there are certain requirements placed upon the minister—such as tabling a copy of the declaration in the parliament and publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>—there is no corresponding procedure set out in the bill in circumstances where the declaration is either suspended or revoked: where, in other words, the company ceases to be the industry services body. It would be a very serious situation if the minister decided that he or she had to take that step. It would have a significant impact upon the industry and certainly upon the company. We hope that never occurs, and I am sure that people in the industry also hope that never occurs. Nevertheless, that is a power that the minister has. We were of the view that possibly the procedures to cover those circumstances should be set out in the legislation in the same way as the procedures when the declaration is made are set out.</para><para>However, we have been advised—and I would like the parliamentary secretary to respond to this—that that is not necessary because the Acts Interpretation Act takes care of everything. We have been told that we do not have to worry; that it is all okay under the terms of the Acts Interpretation Act. We want to ensure that, just as the minister is responsible to the parliament when he or she makes the declaration to appoint the company as the industry services body, the same tests and the same responsibility to the parliament would apply if the minister were forced to act to revoke that declaration and take those responsibilities away from the company. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could respond to our concerns and, hopefully, give us some assurances that the procedures will be followed in those circumstances.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>22960</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Clause 16.2 of the contract states, as Senator Forshaw has said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>If the company is in breach of any obligation or warranty under this agreement and the company has not commenced steps reasonably acceptable to the Commonwealth to rectify the breach within 14 days of receiving notice of the breach, or (b) if the company fails to comply with the direction given to it by the minister under section 12 of the act, or (c) if an insolvency event occurs ...</para></quote><para>I do assure Senator Forshaw that there is provision under section 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act that the declaration made by the minister can be revoked in the same manner as it was declared—that is, that the Acts Interpretation Act automatically applies and that a revocation of the declaration would require the same process: tabling and gazettal.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>22960</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just very briefly, a matter has been raised with me which I think appropriate to raise at this stage of the debate. It relates to the final draft of the contract between the Commonwealth and Australian Pork Limited, which has been supplied to the opposition by the government. I understand that the issue, which is of some concern, arises from paragraphs 5.3 and 5.4 and associated parts of the contract—indeed, it ultimately goes to the matter that Senator Forshaw raised. The Senate committee inquiring into the response to the AQIS draft import risk assessment on the importation of New Zealand apples raised an issue of whether activities conducted in that area by the research body appropriate to conduct scientific work on a draft import risk assessment would be defined as `agripolitical activity'.</para></talk.start><para>I note in 5.3 and 5.4 that, notwithstanding the definition in the contract of `agripolitical activity', there is a degree of subjectivity in the interpretation—and I mean by that that, if any director of the company is of the opinion that the activity might constitute agripolitical activity, certain obligations are placed on the company. Firstly, can we be assured that circumstances such as pursuing further scientific advice, for example in response to a draft import risk assessment, would not be `agripolitical activity'? It does not seem to be comprehended in the definition which appears in the final contract at page 2. Can we be assured that that sort of activity would not be `agripolitical activity'? </para><para>Secondly, in the case where there is an activity which does not fall specifically within the definition of agripolitical activity in clause 2 but there is a disagreement between the minister and the company about whether that activity is one which is in connection with agripolitical activity, can the minister initiate action under the provisions of clause 17 of the contract—for example, termination and recovery—because the minister believes it is in connection with agripolitical activity even though the company is not of that view?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>22960</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to say to Senator O'Brien that I make a distinction between the term `agripolitical activity'—which I will define in a moment as it is defined in the contract—and strategic policy development. This company, under the definition in the contract, will be encouraged to pursue, and will be responsible for ensuring that it pursues, the relevant scientific advice and contributes to the process of developing the policy. This company, among its other roles, is responsible for representing the voice of industry to government. That means that it will no doubt collect information from a range of sources, including through consultation within the industry and with other industries, government, other stakeholders or the public. It will also make a balanced analysis of that information in the context of the industry environment. It may well develop a strategic policy position within the industry and it may then proceed to advocate that position within the industry, with other industries, with the government, with other stakeholders or with the public.</para></talk.start><para>There is a distinct difference between that strategic policy development and agripolitical activity. The contract quite properly restricts the company from using public and industry funds for inappropriate political purposes. Within the contract, agripolitical activity is defined as:</para><quote><para>... any activity intended by the company to exert political influence on government, to advantage one political party or political candidate over another, and it includes but it is not limited to the following activities:</para><para>(a)	funding and making donations to a political party, member of parliament or candidate for parliament,</para><para>(b)	advertising or funding advertising that supports or opposes a political party, member of parliament or candidate for parliament,</para><para>(c)	developing, designing, participating in or funding a parliamentary election campaign or other party political campaign, or</para><para>(d)	recommending or advising through whatever media how persons should vote at a parliamentary election.</para></quote><para>If any director is concerned that there may be an overlap between those two areas of activity—in other words, that a particular issue may be agripolitical in nature within that definition—then the chair is required to consult with the minister. In any case, as I said in my second reading speech, the chair is encouraged to seek a consultation with the minister every six months to consider industry issues of significance, and no doubt this would come up during that. Those requirements and limitations on agripolitical activities are not designed to put the minister in a position of interfering with the running of the company, but the arrangements recognise that the minister is responsible within the executive of government for the administration of that contract and the accountable use of the levy and public funds paid under the contract.</para><para>These arrangements give the industry the opportunity to manage its own affairs, as we have already said, but, because the Commonwealth assists in collecting a statutory levy and there are other Commonwealth matching funds, the company recognises through the contract—and this has industry agreement—that it has a responsibility to account for the expenditure of those funds. It also recognises the minister's responsibility to ultimately be accountable to the parliament and to Australian taxpayers. The chair may therefore go to the minister and ask his opinion or put the point of view as to whether this is an agripolitical point, but if the company decides that it does not accept the minister's point of view—as it is entitled to do—then it does so recognising that there may be a breach of the contract and the other consequences would follow.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>22961</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you for that answer. I do not wish to detain the Senate extensively on this matter, but could I just have some clarity about what the phrase `or in connection with the activity' means in 5.4. It is a very broad term, often used in law as some sort of broad net to catch activities not contemplated. I can imagine that this may well still be a matter of contention between Australian Pork Limited and the government, but perhaps it would be of assistance if the parliamentary secretary would give us some insight into how the phrase `or in connection with the activity' might be read. For example, they cannot spend any funds on agripolitical activity by the company or by any other person but, if they were spending funds on something, what sort of connection would have to be established between the activity of another person for it to offend this provision of the contract?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>22961</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am advised that, for instance, paying a third party to do the work on its behalf would be prohibited under the contract.

The bill amends a number of acts: the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, the Insurance Act 1973, the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1991, the Life Insurance Act 1995, the Prices Surveillance Act 1983, the Productivity Commission Act 1998, the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Trade Practices Act 1974.</para></talk.start><para>To the extent that this bill makes it easier for the readers of the laws to determine liability and for regulators to enforce the law, Labor supports this bill. I note this bill does not change any offences; it merely clarifies the nature of the offences. However, this government also needs to support ASIC and APRA so that they can properly enforce the law. In the last week I have been sitting on a Senate committee of inquiry and receiving submissions at my electorate office, and the point was made by a number of constituents that they believed the nature of the law was fine but ASIC's ability to enforce it was questionable. They raised what I think is a plain person's view of the law: what is the point of having good law if there is no-one around to enforce it and the law does not become real and does not actually govern behaviour? I say amen to that. For example, the recent news on HIH is devastating and in part reflects the government's lack of commitment to ensuring that the regulators have the powers and resources to do their job. The level of disclosure—or, more correctly, the lack of disclosure—by directors of HIH over a significant period of time preceding the appointment of a liquidator should have been able to be addressed by the regulators much earlier.</para><para>A secondary objective of this bill is to amend the Corporations Law to correct for changes in the location and format of provisions dealing with the criminal consequences for contraventions of the civil penalty provisions made by the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999. In the House of Representatives, Labor moved an amendment to section 300A of the Corporations Law. The section requires companies to disclose in the annual report details of the way in which executives are remunerated. In our view, the government should have moved much earlier to rectify this obvious typographical error and to assist in achieving the very good objectives of the provision. They should have corrected section 300A at the same time as they made the other corrections to the Corporations Law. The government, however, only reluctantly agreed to the insertion of section 300A when the <inline ref="R405">Company Law Review Bill 1997</inline> was being debated. Since then, we have seen an escalation in the remuneration of chief executive officers of companies and some directors. In too many cases, these remuneration packages have not been properly disclosed, the value of the share options has not been disclosed and the performance criteria have not been specified and disclosed.</para><para>Shareholders are entitled to know by how much and how management are being rewarded. After all, management are only the agents of shareholders and they must be accountable to the shareholders. That some chief executive officers are not mindful of this is exemplified only too clearly in the case of One.Tel. One.Tel directors Mr Keeling and Mr Rich—no pun intended—were each paid $7.5 million last year even though the company lost $291 million. Expounding matters, those remuneration arrangements were not, at least initially, properly disclosed to shareholders.</para><para>In our view, the government is concerned only with the big end town—and most recently the Prime Minister proved that by waving around a survey of what chief executive officers said in approval of him. To require the disclosure of the full cost of remuneration packages and the criteria upon which such packages are justified may be uncomfortable for some CEOs but is essential information for shareholders of companies. This government, rather than offend or disrupt their mates, will ignore the rights of shareholders—many of whom are now everyday, working or retired Australians. I hope that the amendment to section 300A, moved by Labor, will remind management of their duties to shareholders. Some companies are failing to comply with section 300A because they say that the word `broad' makes determining their obligations unclear. That excuse is now gone. I now urge the government to ensure that section 300A is enforced and that shareholders receive the information they need and which they are legitimately entitled to receive. </para><para>That it is not currently being enforced has been made clear to me by ASIC.  At a public hearing of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities last year Senator Conroy asked Mr Alan Cameron, the then chairman of ASIC, whether ASIC was enforcing the provisions. Mr Cameron replied:</para><quote><para>... at the moment the enforcement consists of monitoring it and drawing the attention of individual companies to what we think is non-compliance, but we have not taken on any particular company at this stage.</para></quote><para>That is not good enough, and the lack of compliance with this provision in the law should be unacceptable to the government. In our view, the government is failing to act on the important issue of executive remuneration, and this amendment moved by Labor in the House of Representatives once again shows that it is only Labor which is committed to improving corporate governance and practices in Australia. Many might regard this as a routine piece of legislation, and in many respects it could properly be described that way. But it does deal with important issues of corporate law. With the remarks that I have made, I indicate that we will be supporting it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>22963</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1099">Treasury Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001</inline>. I want to deal with the issues of strict liability which are covered in this bill. The imposition of strict liability in circumstances of total innocence or mere inadvertence absent of blameworthy intent or any real recklessness has to be guarded against. One of the reasons that I am going to make the remarks I am is just to ensure that the government, the bureaucrats who advise them, and the Senate are kept alert to my concerns and those of the Democrats to ensure that the revisions of all the various laws that we have to comply with the new effects of the Criminal Code are properly evaluated in terms of fundamental rights and liberties. </para></talk.start><para>The gradual trend of imposing stricter and stricter penalties and punishments for behaviour can offend the fundamental common law principles that an accused is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The issue of strict liability and the desire for administrative efficiency or bureaucratic ease can motivate the creation of strict liability provisions in defiance of fundamental common law principles. Strict liability involves the imposition of a penalty or punishment for an act or an omission in respect to which the Crown need not establish any recklessness or blameworthy intent. Such provisions, as we know, are common in relation to issues of public health and safety. For example, a dairy producer might be held strictly liable for the presence of certain harmful bacteria in his or her product irrespective of whether its presence was the result of recklessness or an improper intent. So strict liability can be a highly effective means of ensuring that all care is taken in such matters. </para><para>However, it can also create a wide net that could catch otherwise innocent people. Strict liability is inconsistent with the principle that the prosecution must not only establish the relevant act but also what is known as the mens rea, the guilty mind. This can only be justified in circumstances where there is a compelling public interest such as the protection of health and safety and there is no other means of dealing with the problem. The public interest should be so great, and the impossibility of alternative approaches so clear, that we are prepared to countenance summary convictions in a much stricter test which favours those administering the test.</para><para>This particular bill provides for the continued operation of various offences with the coming into effect of the criminal code. If legislation is not enacted to have regard to the code, the code may alter the interpretation of existing offence provisions. The bill provides for the continued operation of strict liability offences but creates no new such offences. The Democrats are supporters of the improved structure of the criminal code, particularly in the fact that it clarifies the traditional distinction between what is known as the physical element and what is known as the fault element. We recognise that legislation is necessary to give effect to the overall reform of the criminal code. All departments administering legislation containing certain offences will have to have legislation enacted to bring their offence creating provisions into line with the criminal code. Many such pieces of legislation have already passed through the parliament as non-controversial legislation.</para><para>We should ensure that, as far as possible, change to legislation does not create new offences without the parliament being alerted to it and understanding the reasons for it. Perhaps we should take the opportunity—and I have not in this instance—to reassess whether former strict liability offences are justified in being continued as strict liability offences. If this parliament is not alert to the downside of strict liability offences then, probably, no-one else is going to be. I would urge those persons with legal training in both the major parties to consider the fact that the minor parties take the view that this is not just administratively efficient and not just bringing things up to date but creating the opportunity for revisiting civil liberties and rights areas. It can create the opportunity to be alert to the potential dangers of creating new offences with insufficient thought as to their consequences for innocent individuals faced with the might of the state. Having said all that, we do not intend to oppose the bill. We merely continue to record a cautionary voice about the sort of offence and to try and ensure that, in the future, the Senate is careful with some of the provisions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>22964</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will add some words to what Senator Cook and Senator Murray have said. There is caution to be observed in applying the criminal code in the way in which it is presently applied. The government is going through a number of acts of parliament and folding in the provisions of the criminal code. There is a need to look at how those amendments impact upon the various offences and the various acts that are alleged to constitute offences in a number of provisions. I do not know whether parliament has been able to keep up with the rate at which these amendments have been made. Being an unreconstructed conservative, I would have left this up to the courts to develop. Nevertheless, it has been developed by parliament, and that is how we go from here. For example, the issue of what is reckless conduct is defined a number of times throughout the <inline ref="R1099">Treasury Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001</inline>. It is defined in the following way:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(5) For the purposes of subsection (4)—</para></quote><para>or whatever a relevant subsection is— </para><quote><para>a person is taken to be reckless if:</para><para>(a) the person is aware of a substantial risk that anything done or not done by the person will constitute a contravention of subsection (3); and</para><para>(b) having regard to the circumstances known to the person, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.</para><para>(6) The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact.</para></quote><para>I would have thought there are some real problems in deciding when a person is aware of a substantial risk, what a substantial risk is and when it is unjustifiable within the meaning of this particular section to take the risk.</para><para>Not only with the sorts of legislation that this particular bill deals with—that is, the Corporations Act and other acts that deal with financial services—and this category of matter but also generally, the only way we can get adherence in the end is to have a code, a climate or a culture whereby people want to do the right thing. If we approach the issue of how we are going to get things done by imposing laws and thinking that somehow the imposition of criminal laws is going to solve the problem, we are mistaken. By `the problem', I mean that we want the corporate world to produce the sorts of things it should produce—to go about its business of making this country financially secure and making it a wealthy country—but, at the same time, not to move into wrongdoing. Oftentimes that is a problem, but it is a problem that is best solved by having the corporate world imbued with an ethic and a culture that sends it in the right direction. It is only as a last resort that you impose penalties of some sort—they might be criminal or civil penalties.</para><para>This piece of legislation is going to go through with the consent of all parties, as I understand it, but it is worth making these points. In applying the criminal code, we ought to check how it is working out in the various acts that it is added to and, in looking to get things done right, we ought to look to the ethics of a particular occupation or profession. The issue of criminal penalties should become a last resort.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>22965</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have listened to the debate and I understand that the contributions are generally supportive of this legislation.

In doing so, I preface it by saying that I take note of the remarks of Senator Murray and particularly the remarks of my learned colleague Senator Barney Cooney, but it is not in the area of their contributions that I wish to raise a question for the government. In addressing this legislation in my speech during the second reading debate, I made in passing on a couple of occasions an observation about the resource base for APRA and ASIC and indicated strongly that we in the opposition think that there is sometimes raised the question as to whether the resource base is inadequate for these bodies to do their work. In the case of ASIC, that is often said.</para></talk.start><para>I will make this point in slightly extended detail. Last week, I attended the hearings of the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into tax effective schemes. The committee sat in both Kalgoorlie and Perth. In Kalgoorlie, it was attended by upwards of 150 people; in Perth, upwards of 200 or 250 people. In my experience, it is unusual in the extreme that Senate committees attract that type of popular audience. Maybe it was something to do with the nature of the inquiry and the sense of injustice that many of the people who attended it believe has been visited on them. There was a continuing refrain from a lot of evidence that was given. On occasions during the day, the chairman of the committee had the wisdom to provide for, in the agenda, what he called a roving microphone. That is to say, people who came off the street to attend the inquiry who believed they had a genuine grievance were given an opportunity to make a very short statement about the nature of that grievance. Often the clear and obvious rejoinder was: `Given what you have said, the changes to the CLERP Act may well cover your problem.' It is a question of resources for ASIC to enforce that, to police that, to investigate that or to follow up on these issues. </para><para>Again, on this legislation, we have made those remarks as well. I wonder whether the government can tell us whether it intends to examine the resources. In my speech in the second reading debate I referred to the chairman of ASIC making the comment that all he could do was monitor rather than enforce. Coming from that authority, it suggests that there is a problem about lack of means. I wonder whether the government can say anything about whether it intends to review this. With the weight of fairly compelling evidence—unsolicited evidence—about a continuous lack of means, will it do something about clothing these essential regulatory authorities with the necessary means to do their jobs?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>22966</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The resourcing of APRA, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, and ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, is a matter that the government holds as incredibly important for the very reasons that Senator Cook has made clear. I had the privilege of assisting the Treasurer in relation to ASIC for the period of November 1996 through to October 1998, a time when the government was developing the legislation that Senator Cook was referring to, which was known then as CLERP6 and which has now changed its name to the Financial Sector Regulatory Reform Bill, which is to come before this place. </para></talk.start><para>For some of the reasons that Senator Cook may have been exposed to at the hearings of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, it is a very important piece of legislation—which this government has been pushing for now for at least three or four years—that will bring together the regulation of similar financial products and services under a single regulatory regime. If he looked closely at the development of that legislation—which, as I said, will come to this place shortly, I hope—he would know that the government's best intentions in this area are often thwarted by a range of different stakeholders in the various industries that we are seeking to regulate. I know, from when I was trying to get those parties to agree to what I regard as a new world's best practice regulatory regime—and certainly my successor in that portfolio, Minister Hockey, has been endeavouring to do that—that there are some people in those industries who have been fighting a subterranean campaign—certainly, it was in my time—and sometimes an above the ground campaign to try and stop those nasty people in Canberra from regulating them.</para><para>I think all of us have seen financial failures, be it aggressively marketed tax schemes or managed investment schemes, that would say to the financial investment, the planning industry and the people who sell schemes, aggressively or otherwise, that there is a very important need in Australia for consumers who are receiving financial advice to feel that they are being given advice by people who are working in an industry that is properly regulated and that people who create or proffer advice or sell products or services in a way that falls outside a proper regulatory regime will feel the full force of the law, be it by losing their licence to operate or by some other financial penalty. Consumers deserve that sort of protection. I look forward to that legislation coming before the chamber, and I hope that we can rely on the Australian Labor Party and other parties in this place to support that effort of Minister Hockey and this government.</para><para>In terms of the resourcing of APRA and ASIC, as I said, those agencies are regarded by this government as being very important. During my period of responsibility for ASIC we had a very close liaison with the commissioners of the securities commission. I think Senator Cook would recall from his own experience as a minister that very rarely does an agency or department readily come to the government at budget time and say, `We're fully resourced and we don't need any more money.' It is generally the case that most departments and agencies would seek to get more money. The government is committed to ensuring that both APRA and ASIC, which fulfil an absolutely crucial role within Australia in the regulation of our financial sector, are properly resourced. We believe at the government level—I know the Treasurer takes a very close personal interest in these issues—that they are properly resourced and that any issue of underresourcing should be brought to the government's attention and be closely monitored.</para><para>The people of Australia need to understand that they have a world's best practice financial sector regulatory regime with the reforms and the new regulatory regime which came into being in July 1998. Generally speaking, most national and international observers of the regulatory regime in Australia would regard the new financial sector regulatory regime as having performed extraordinarily well compared to any other international structure. In fact, I understand—as I do keep an eye on these things even though I have left the portfolio—that many other nations are seeking to copy what Australia has done in breaking up the prudential regulation, the corporate regulation and the other aspects of it. I say to Senator Cook that we regard the resourcing as a vital issue. We would not allow APRA or ASIC to be anything but adequately resourced, and I am happy to recommit the government to that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>22967</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot, I take this opportunity to speak, in part stimulated by your presence in the chair, because just last week you were in company with me sitting on the Senate committee inquiring into tax effective schemes. It is not my intention to embarrass you in the chair—far from that—but because you are in the chair it enables me, through you, to make a point to the government. A number of people spoke from the floor at these meetings, which were quite well attended—much better attended than any other Senate inquiry I have been involved with. They spoke about personal loss and financial hardship visited on them by what were called by many—and I have no way of judging this perfectly—shonky schemes promoted to them by quick buck promoters. They made the point that the only recourse is essentially through the regulations through, in this case, ASIC, and they were concerned about the resources of ASIC.</para></talk.start><para>I relate those remarks to what I said in my speech in the second reading debate. Were Senator Conroy here, I am sure he would endorse those remarks. My question to the government was: are you reviewing it? You assured me that you keep it—as I understood your answer—constantly under review. I understand that in the broad area of tax effective schemes there are some 80,000 Australians caught, representing some $4.8 billion of assessed taxable income—which is not insubstantial whichever way you cut it. Without making any judgment, it seems to me that if there is a claim that there is not the resources it is some sort of encouragement to shonks to get into this field. But I take heart from your remarks and I look forward to seeing what you do about it in the budget.</para><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>22967</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (UNFAIR DISMISSALS) BILL 1998 [NO. 2]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>22967</page.no><id.no>R1180</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>22967</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 7 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Heffernan</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>22967</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Once again—I think it is fourth time round—the Labor Party will be opposing this bill at the second reading stage. This government has habitually treated unfair dismissal legislation as a political football. In the last parliament, this legislation was brought forward twice by the government and rejected twice by the Senate. At the time, Senator Murray commented on the government's moral insensibility about this issue when he said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>It remains my belief that the Coalition introduced this single issue Bill encapsulating gross unfairness, to provoke the Senate to absolute rejection.</para></quote><para>A little further on Senator Murray added:</para><quote><para>... this Bill was conceived to achieve a double dissolution trigger. And in that act of creation is exposed the Coalition's utter heartlessness. It would create job insecurity and arbitrarily discriminate against one to two million employees for a political end.</para></quote><para>Fairly strong language from the usually fairly moderate Senator Murray. Reflecting on these issues caused me to ponder what has happened to Minister Abbott's new image. Tomorrow—we hear—in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> he is going to give us detail of his different agenda for industrial relations. In comments in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> today, Minister Abbott is described as:</para><quote><para>... moving to shed his hard right wing image with speeches proclaiming a new-found soft and fuzzy liberalism and urging Australians to avoid a culture of pessimism.</para></quote><para>But this is not reflected in the government's action today with this legislation. Again—fourth time round—we have the same bill with no change.</para><para>The cynicism that drew the comments I mentioned earlier from Senator Murray is just as apparent now. This will be the fourth time the Senate has been forced to deal with this bill with no change. The previous three defeats should have been enough to consign this bill to the dustbin, so why bring it back again? I will be interested to hear what arguments the government has as to why yet again it is bringing it forward under a new minister with a new regime. Rationally and logically there are only two reasons for its return: firstly, to create a double dissolution trigger; or, secondly, to promote this government's tarnished credentials in the post BAS era as champions of small business. Further on that later. Either way, the hollowness is breathtaking.</para><para>This bill, if passed, would truly result in job insecurity for and arbitrary discrimination against workers—to use Senator Murray's words—for a rather petty and paltry political return. Let me remind the Senate what this bill covers: this bill seeks to require a six-month qualifying period of employment before new employees, other than apprentices and trainees, can access an unfair dismissal remedy under the Workplace Relations Act; and, secondly, it proposes to exclude new employees of small businesses, other than apprentices or trainees, of 15 or fewer employees from the unfair dismissal remedy under the act.</para><para>Let me revisit the case for these proposals. The first and most obvious point to be made in rejecting this bill is that, like much of the legislation initiated by this government in this area, the case for it is remarkably weak. What is certain is this: a group of employees will be subject to being unfairly dismissed at the whim of an employer. Only that is known. The government justifies this draconian and unjust measure by asserting that this will create more jobs. The `evidence' that justifies this proposal is unconvincing.</para><para>The government proffers a number of surveys which it alleges draw a connection between unfair dismissal laws and hiring decisions. The argument goes that if you exempt small businesses and new employees in small businesses from unfair dismissal laws quid pro quo you create jobs. The previous minister expressed this argument as forcibly as was possible in his second reading speech on the bill when he said:</para><quote><para>The Government has been listening to the concerns of small businesses, their experiences of the impact of unfair dismissal claims, and their fears that the simple fact of employing someone makes them vulnerable to unfair dismissal claims. There is extensive evidence of the difficulties that unfair dismissal laws cause for those small businesses who experience a claim ... And the fear of these burdens affects employing intentions, even amongst businesses which may not have themselves experienced a claim. This is the most important reason that this bill should be brought into law, as soon as possible—it will promote jobs growth.</para></quote><para>The minister went into detail about quite a number of surveys. I will not repeat them here because we have covered them many times before.</para><para>His so-called `evidence', as I said, is unconvincing in the extreme for quite a number of reasons. Let me rehash those: some of the surveys had suspect methodologies and motive and they have been conducted by less than impartial industrial relations participants—organisations with form and well-established bias. There is one notable omission to the minister's recitation of the relevant surveys. Notably, it was the least biased, the most comprehensive and the most authoritative and, interestingly enough, in direct conflict with the surveys preferred by the then minister. The most impartial and authoritative survey results come of course from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in their AWIRS for 1995. This found that the reasons small business had not recruited in the previous 12 months were that 66.2 per cent of small business respondents indicated they did not need any more employees and 23 per cent listed insufficient work as the main impediment. Only 0.9 per cent of respondents nominated unfair dismissal laws as their reason for not recruiting.</para><para>Senator Murray comprehensively dealt with this argument in his minority report from the committee's inquiry, saying:</para><quote><para>The relatively small number of unfair dismissal applications, particularly from employees of small business, meant that this could not possibly be a major problem in respect of employment. Surveys showing small business concern about the issue were characterised by loaded questions and confusion between federal and state legislation, and no evidence supported the claim that abolition of unfair dismissal laws would create employment. </para></quote><para>In conclusion, Senator Murray stated:</para><quote><para>Many of the employee relationship problems small business have continue to be those related to owner/manager skills, training and experience in managing people.</para></quote><para>The government would perhaps be better off focusing on those matters rather than rehashing this. However, the final point I want to make about these surveys is that all of these results are old and unreliable. They deal with the old unfair dismissal legislation, not that put through by Minister Reith in 1996. It is a case of comparing apples with oranges. So there is, in fact, no evidence to support a change to the system as the bill proposes. What we do know is that, when the new unfair dismissal laws were put through the parliament by Minister Reith, he was strongly of the view that they then struck the right balance. He said with pride:</para><quote><para>We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round.</para></quote><para>And he proudly told a business gathering in Perth in 1998:</para><quote><para>Unfair dismissal claims against employers, including small businesses, under federal laws have dropped by 49 per cent and have fallen across all jurisdictions by an average of 18 per cent. Under Labor, unfair dismissal claims reached record levels.</para></quote><para>So what went wrong? Thankfully, we are not limited to theories and survey results to determine the potential impact on jobs of this provision. There is a real world experiment we can look to for guidance, and it does not support the government's case. When the coalition government in Queensland did introduce an exemption similar to the one sought here, it had no impact on employment rates—none at all. Yet this bill is premised on the basis that it will create employment. One final point on the job creation furphy—have you noticed that the government never claims that this measure will create a piddling small amount of jobs? It is 50,000 jobs, the government claims. You will always hear that figure being thrown around by the government. For instance, Minister Reith in a 26 July 1998 press release entitled `Arrogant Democrats reject reform mandate' said:</para><quote><para>The Democrats have already cost 50,000 Australians a job by rejecting the unfair dismissal proposals put forward by the government.</para></quote><para>The real world experiment in Queensland gave no credence to that claim. The Prime Minister said in a response to a question without notice on 10 February 1999 entitled `Employment: Job Creation':</para><quote><para>Because, if you do that—</para></quote><para>that is, do not support the unfair dismissal exemption for small business—</para><quote><para>you will destroy the job prospects of 50,000 Australians in small business.</para></quote><para>Looking more closely at the Senate, Senator Tierney, the Chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into the termination of employment bill, said on 31 August 2000:</para><quote><para>There was evidence at earlier hearings ... that we actually lose 50,000 jobs ...</para></quote><para>I suppose it is the old adage: if you say something often enough, eventually somebody will believe you. But what basis exists for that claim? None at all. Yet, in all these years, the government have not come up with one skerrick of evidence to support their mantra. All they do is throw around the figure of 50,000 new jobs, with no basis.</para><para>The story of the 50,000 jobs is a very interesting one. Those who have participated in the inquiry into this bill, particularly on the last occasion, might recall the basis for that claim. The figure comes from Mr Rob Bastian, the head of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia—COSBOA. It was first raised during a Senate hearing, and it has been the subject of some scrutiny by the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee. Under questioning from Senator Murray during one hearing, Mr Bastian admitted that it was a figure he had plucked out of the air and that he had no basis for the figure. It was, in fact, his extrapolated calculation from unsolicited, off-the-cuff comments by businesspeople contacted by COSBOA telemarketers who were conducting a survey but not on this issue. From those comments, Mr Bastian came to the conclusion that, if unfair dismissal requirements were removed from small businesses, one in 20 Australian small businesses would employ an extra worker. One person's extrapolation is another person's guess, and that was all it was: a guess. The simple truth is that Mr Bastian's figure is beyond rubbery; it is actually quite fluid. Unfortunately, though, this government has been relying on Mr Bastian's guessing abilities ever since. </para><para>One final point concerning Mr Bastian is that there is a great irony in this government's continual use of his guessing abilities, because, on the principle of unfair dismissal reform, Mr Bastian has had enough of this government's ideological crusade with unfair dismissals and small businesses. When he appeared before the Senate committee inquiry into this bill, Mr Bastian expressed the view that it was time to move past what he described as `beating from our different positions'. He suggested that it would be a `major step forward' if we, the political participants in this debate, `put forward a quest to identify the middle ground'. It is a shame that this government is so selective in the advice it takes from Mr Bastian, and again it has simply re-presented this bill.</para><para>Let us look at the effect of this bill. I said at the outset that there was only one certainty if this legislation is passed: a person who, through no fault of their own, is unfairly dismissed will be unable to do anything about it. Does the government think this is unfair? Not unfair enough, it would appear. Does this matter to the government? The answer is clearly no. Does it care that a family's capacity to pay their mortgage, plan their holiday, live their lives—all that—can be capriciously taken from them? The answer is clearly no; it does not give a hoot. This bill is about taking away the rights of workers to contest dismissals when they are unfair and unjust and giving unfettered discretion to an employer to dismiss. This legislation is about stacking the decks in favour of employers—and not any employer, but employers who do the wrong thing. The only winners out of this would be the boss who gets rid of an employee for no good reason and the loser of course is the victim. This is bad law and that is why it has been rejected thrice, and it deserves no better this time around. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>22970</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In reference to the <inline ref="R1180">Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998 [No. 2]</inline> I would refer readers and listeners back to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of previous debates on this matter in 1997, 1998 and 1999 and to my minority report of February 1999 to the <inline ref="R599">Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998</inline>, to which Senator Collins referred and which still provides the basis of the Democrats' opinion on this matter.</para></talk.start><para>I have had a look at the minister's second reading speech to the bill, which is the same bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives on 12 November 1998, passed by them, but rejected by the Senate on 14 August 2000. The second reading speech of the government immediately moves to reject the idea that this is a double dissolution trigger. It says:</para><quote><para>The government is not reintroducing this bill because it wants to have an election over it.</para></quote><para>I happen to think that is right, that they would not have an election over this particular bill. However, it will have the effect of giving them a double dissolution election trigger, if that is what they want, and in that sense it is good political housekeeping. The claims within it, though, deserve to be addressed, and Senator Collins has addressed them quite fully. The claim that it would unlock small business access to some 50,000 new jobs is a spurious one; it is a claim that has been fundamentally refuted before and has again been refuted by Senator Collins. When the government accept round figures like that which do not move regardless of the circumstances of the economy or of what else is going on in state jurisdictions, it indicates a lack of substance to the claim.</para><para>It is, of course, an argument that adjustments to some of the deficiencies within the law could have some beneficial effects in terms of small business attitudes about unfair dismissals. That is an argument the Democrats are prepared to acknowledge. In that respect, I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that on page 3 of today's <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, at item 16, there is the <inline ref="R1105">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000</inline>. It is to be regretted that these two bills were not introduced together, because the Australian Democrats have clearly—in the minority report to which I referred—accepted that there are process, time and cost issues which need to be further resolved. Whilst we would not in any event accept the whole of that bill, nevertheless we are prepared to consider amendments to that bill and to suggest to the government ways in which process and cost issues should be addressed. That is more important than getting rid of a fundamental right: the right of people who are in a disadvantaged position to have their unfair dismissal claim assessed by an independent umpire, which is the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>The government argue that their unfair dismissals bill represents or has been the subject of an almost unprecedented degree of political obstructionism. Well, yes, it has; and I am pleased to see the Senate obstructing and rejecting what is regarded by those not on the government benches as a fundamentally unjust proposition—that is, that a fundamental right should be withdrawn. However, one swallow does not make a summer, or an exception does not prove a rule. One bill being obstructed does not indicate Senate obstructionism. I would remind the chamber of what we know but is often not properly represented out there in voter land: that the Senate passes 98 to 99 per cent of all bills before it, some of those with amendment, but there are very few bills subject to the kind of obstructionism that we have given in the past to this bill and that we will give again to this bill.</para><para>The government claim that there is a jobs link to this bill. However, the grounds on which they make that claim are extremely questionable. I am not going to go into great detail on that again, having done so before. But one of the extraordinary things proposed by the bill is that it only applies to new employees. Not only do the government want to distinguish between big business and small business with regard to access to federal unfair dismissal cases, but they actually want to create a different class within small business: new employees will be on a set of conditions different to those for old employees. If anything is a recipe for confusion and trouble, I would suggest that that would be.</para><para>The issue should also be addressed by reference to numbers. I intend tabling only one page of figures—that is, the summary of federal unfair dismissal cases throughout the country—but I would like briefly to encapsulate what has happened with federal unfair dismissal cases in each state. I remind the Senate that the percentage of small business claims that are part of total federal unfair dismissal claims is about one-third and that about two-thirds of all unfair dismissal claims are state, not federal, anyway. If a problem exists at all, it may well be considered to be state, not federal. In the commentary from business groups who advocate and support this kind of bill, I have seldom—and I say seldom because I may have forgotten—if ever heard them distinguish between federal and state jurisdictions, which seems to me quite extraordinary.</para><para>Let us begin with federal unfair dismissal cases in Western Australia, my state. These figures include big business and small business. In 1996, the total number was 1,849. In the year 2000, it was 401. One-third of that is a little over 100; hardly a major issue. Victoria has the largest number of federal unfair dismissal cases. Bear in mind that 1996 was before the enactment of the new act, whereas 2000 was under the new federal act. In Victoria, the figure was 6,169 in 1996; in the year 2000, it was 4,606—a diminution of about 1,500. In Tasmania in 1996, the figure was 369; in the year 2000, it was 127. In South Australia in 1996, the figure was 644; in the year 2000, it was 199. In Queensland in 1996, the figure was 562; in the year 2000, it was 416. In the Northern Territory in 1996, the figure was 407; in the year 2000, it was 307. In New South Wales in 1996, the figure was 4,547; in the year 2000, it was 1,388—a diminution of over 3,000 in those years. In the ACT, the figure was 536 in 1996 and 236 in the year 2000. You can see a major reduction since the 1996 act; those provisions have been extremely effective in limiting the total number of unfair dismissal cases. Therefore, for small business there has been a massive reduction of federal unfair dismissal cases. To go to the figures which I propose to table—the summary of federal unfair dismissal cases across Australia—in the year 1996 there were 15,383 and in the year 2000 there were 7,680, which is a halving. </para><para>What is quite interesting is that the number of unfair dismissal cases has dropped whilst the employment figures have risen. I have not done the direct analysis but that, I would think, would put the lie to the idea that when employment growth is under way it either will be paralleled by exactly the same growth in unfair dismissal cases or be a major restriction on the growth of employment. Bear in mind that I represent a party which recognises that further process and cost issues have to be addressed; not, I repeat, in the form that the government is proposing, but there are some issues that could be addressed. We are in the situation in relation to federal unfair dismissal cases where about one-third of 7,680 cases affect small business; a little over 2,000 across the entire country. I have not got the latest industrial registrar figures on these matters before me, but my memory is that large numbers of those end up being dismissed and large numbers are found to be in favour of small businesses anyway: they do not automatically go to all employees and very few reinstatements occur. As I recall, the number of reinstatements is fewer than 100 over the entire country, but I have not got the up-to-date figures in front of me so I will leave that as a memory issue.</para><para>You have, I think, four real issues to deal with. Firstly, is the problem in a federal sense out of control, escalating, revealing a dangerous and difficult situation? The answer is that on the figures it is not. The second issue is however that we have had clear evidence from both unions and employer organisations that further reform to the law is necessary. So, on the question of whether the law needs to be amended in some cases, from each of those sides there is a view on that. The third issue is: is it a major impediment to jobs? If it were, it would a consequence of state jurisdiction, because that is where most unfair dismissal cases for small business reside. But there is nothing in the research or the data produced to date which provides that direct link which Mr Bastian originally forecast and, as I say, no objective observer, never mind subjective ones, can see any link at all between a figure of 50,000 and removing this provision in the act.</para><para>The fourth issue, of course, is the political issue. This bill does have the effect of giving the government a double dissolution trigger. I am delighted to be able to give it to you on the basis of a civil rights matter—absolutely delighted. As I said to you, it is good political housekeeping, in my view, for you to do it, but I do not give it any great note. I will take you seriously as a government, however, when you do introduce your Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000, because that is an attempt to adjust the law without attacking the principle that every employee should have unfair dismissal provisions available to them when they are up against dismissals which need to be challenged through the Industrial Relations Commission. </para><para>I do not propose to go much further than this. The Democrats still think that this bill is harsh, unnecessary, unjustified. We will vote the bill down. We will keep voting it down. We think it offends a fundamental principle. We think it seeks to differentiate between classes of Australians, even within small business, and we think its motivation is wrong. I have always been surprised that small business, who themselves demand protection from big business in so many areas, cannot equate their feelings about the abuse of power by large organisations with the sense amongst employees that they too deserve some protection. I think the parallel is fairly evident. So with those remarks, I would formally ask if the Senate would grant leave for me to table the sheet I circulated earlier.</para><para>Leave granted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>22973</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is certainly my pleasure to follow a fellow senator whom I have listened to in the short period I have been here. I find that each contribution he has made is one that he makes on principle—and I sometimes wonder whether he is leading his party rather than simply advocating their position.</para></talk.start><para>It is a very interesting situation we find ourselves in. I have spoken on the <inline ref="R599">Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998</inline> before. It was in August last year, and I recall that at that stage I was going back to 1351 and the Statute of Labourers—as far back as we could look to refer to legislation that was governing, in one form or another, the employment rights of people who worked for a living. Of course, you may not recall 1351, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot—there are, I am sure, people in your party who feel that you may!—but there was very little protection for employees in that period. It drew the attention of the House of Commons to take certain action to remedy some minimum protection and rights.</para><para>As I say, I went back to my original speech and looked at it and then at the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>. As Senator Murray and, no doubt, Senator Collins have mentioned, this is one of those areas which is supposedly a trigger for a double dissolution. I see the representative of the minister at the table here tonight, and I know her to be personally brave; but I cannot see that any government, after what we saw on the weekend, will be brave enough to use this as a trigger for a double dissolution. Like a number of my colleagues and like yourself, no doubt, I have experienced double dissolutions in my political and party career, and very seldom does the issue that brought about the double dissolution become the issue in the general election. What will become an issue in the general election is the way that the government has treated small business; the way it has treated employment in this country; the way it has treated pensioners and self-funded retirees; the way it has treated the mining industry; the way it has treated dairy farmers—the way the government has treated all those people, particularly a lot of those people whom it rightly regards, and has rightly regarded for generations, as stalwart supporters of the conservative cause. </para><para>If this bill is defeated this evening, I imagine that members of the coalition, when they have their party meetings tomorrow, will have one of those magic weapons with which to go to a double dissolution, putting us on notice with the Australian people. I suppose that I dare you to do it. I am sure that we would love you to go to the Australian people now. You saw the results in Ryan on the weekend, Mr Acting Deputy President. You would have seen how ready, willing and eager the Australian electorate were to get at the party in government and give it the comeuppance it deserves. It is with that in mind tonight that we have an opportunity to debate this bill again and see where it goes.</para><para>Just to reiterate, I will not go back to that Statute of Labourers in 1351 or 1353 but I will go back to a period when—and I make no bones about my background—I was a full-time official of the Transport Workers Union for 18 years. I started as an official, then became the state secretary in New South Wales and ended up as the federal president. I remember, as I may have reiterated the last time I spoke, that my first introduction to appearing before the federal and state commissions in New South Wales was the advice given to me that, `If you go into the federal commission, you have to stand up; in the state commission, you can sit down.' That was the level of training we were given; and I thought it was good training because I learned to speak on my feet on many occasions.</para><para>One of the first unfair dismissal cases that I took was in the New South Wales commission. I explained, when last I spoke on this, just how difficult it was in those days for people who worked in the federal system to get access to justice and fairness in that system. As I said, my first case was in the state commission. One of the areas I will refer to—and I am not sure whether Senator Collins mentioned this—is a decision by Mr Justice Sheehy in the New South Wales commission, called the Loty and Holloway case. In essence, I believe that case established the term that runs through all unfair dismissal laws: `a fair go all round'. It might surprise you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that unfair dismissal action was taken by two employees of an organisation that probably had over 15 full-time employees. Those two employees had worked there for longer than six months. The organisation—and I am sure my colleagues in the Australian Workers Union will not mind me saying this—that was being taken to the Industrial Commission on unfair dismissal was the Australian Workers Union. Two employees of the union—one John Loty, who is now a barrister; and Necia Holloway, whose whereabouts I am not sure of at the moment—were dismissed by one of the factions that got control of the AWU, as tends to happen on occasions, and their employment was terminated.</para><para>The chap who became a federal member of parliament for Phillip and became a federal minister, Joe Riordan, who was federal secretary of the clerks union at the time, took the matter before Mr Justice Sheehy of the New South Wales commission. It was there—and maybe Senator Cooney, who is a barrister, can correct me if I am wrong—that the issue of `a fair go all round' was established. That has been, in the New South Wales jurisdiction, a thumbnail sketch of how it has been determined whether someone has been unfairly or unjustly dismissed—and that is as it should be. It has not been based on whether they have been six months as a permanent employee or on whether they have been working for a company or an organisation with over 15 full-time employees, but simply on the fact that their rights and privileges as citizens of this country are able to be upheld if they may have been unfairly dismissed. For your information, a number of significant grounds were established in the Loty and Holloway case, where Mr Loty was dismissed—and it was held that he was rightly dismissed—and Ms Holloway was reinstated. As I said, Mr Loty went on to become a barrister. So this was established in the 1950s by Joe Riordan, as the then federal secretary of the clerks union, and it has been a test that has been established for employees in the New South Wales jurisdiction.</para><para>As I said earlier, I remember how difficult it was for men and women who worked in the federal jurisdiction to have access to that fairness and justice. They were being dismissed unfairly and unjustly, and they were entitled to be reinstated. I always felt that that should be the cornerstone of any legislation, and not necessarily compensation. I always felt that, if someone was prepared to go to the commission and argue the case that they indeed wanted to be reinstated with that company, that company had probably erred. In all my years of being involved in the TWU, there were a number of occasions where people were, I believe, correctly dismissed, and their cases were not pursued on the part of the TWU. But it was at that time that we had the sole rights to go before the commission and make those applications.</para><para>After the Greiner government got into power in New South Wales in 1988, they made opportunities for people to go jurisdiction-hopping and to elect whether they wanted to be reinstated or compensated. That is what caused the queues in the New South Wales commission and, undoubtedly, that is what caused the queues in the federal commission as well—because people had the opportunity to say, `I don't want my job back; I just want extra money.' That issue has come and gone, and that is not what we are debating today. We are debating today the fact that this legislation would bar people from having access to the unfair dismissal laws unless their employer has more than 15 staff and unless they have had six months continuous employment. </para><para>As has been mentioned by Senator Murray and by Senator Collins, the most interesting thing about this legislation is that the government is trying to establish some nexus between the fact that, if there is a freeing up of the unfair dismissal laws, that will create 50,000 extra jobs. Apparently this claim comes from Mr Paul Bastian, a spokesman for the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, without any sort of data whatsoever—only that he had been told, I gather, by a number of small businesses that they are being held back from creating extra employment because they fear the situation with unfair dismissals. Translating it into my own state, it would mean that, of those 50,000 extra jobs that Mr Bastian claimed there would be in 1998, in New South Wales we would get 16,000. Once again, statistically, there were only 304 unfair dismissal claims made in New South Wales in 1998; so I cannot see how you could establish that the figure of 304 unfair dismissal claims has dissuaded employers from creating 16,000 jobs.</para><para>In fact, a survey done recently of Victorian small businesses found that the most important thing affecting them was the current business activity statement. I am sure you, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, from your travels throughout your great state of Western Australia, would know how angry small business is about this con by the government over these new tax laws. Small businesses are more interested in that and what the government is going to do about it than they are in unfair dismissal laws. These Victorian small employers were asked where, of 11 issues, they ranked the unfair dismissal laws. Guess where they came? They came 11 out of 11. Eighty-three per cent of them were most concerned about the business activity statement and the fact that it is taking up too much of their time and energy, rather than about the unfair dismissal laws. </para><para>The respected firm Dun and Bradstreet in their latest business expectation survey have said:</para><quote><para>More than 40 per cent of business owners have told us they are struggling with available cash flow in their bid to make quarterly taxation payments. These businesses are now finding it difficult to pay their creditors on time, which creates a domino effect for all businesses along the supply chain.</para></quote><para>That is what is worrying small business, not unfair dismissal laws. I am pretty sure they would be very angry to think that this government is now looking for some sort of parliamentary means to go into a double dissolution, pretty angry that this is some sort of sleight of hand by the government to engineer a potential crisis, and pretty angry that the government should be wasting its time on making sure that these laws to impose the new restrictions and impediments on small business get through the Senate. They would be angry that we are wasting time on something that they did not even prioritise any higher than 11 out of 11—when the government should be presenting to the Senate remedies to make it easier for small businesses to operate. </para><para>I cannot see how any of this will impact on employment. I cannot see how this will provide a remedy for any of the complaints that small business are making. Most small businesses are decent, honourable employers who value full-time staff. It is a fact of life that, if you have full-time staff that are content, well-paid and secure in their employment, they will be far more productive than anybody who is casualised, feeling threatened, or does not work in a safe work environment. That is a clear given; I do not think it could be questioned by anybody. These laws are unnecessary. There are remedies in the workplace now. This is unfair to big business. It is uncalled for by small business, and we need to speedily reject it to see whether or not the government is brave enough to go ahead and call a double dissolution.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>22975</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a privilege to follow Senator Hutchins in this debate. He is a person who, as a member of the Transport Workers Union, would have had experience with small business people. Truck drivers who conduct a small business are a classic example of small business people. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Hutchins can be relied on to give a fair and balanced assessment of the situation here. He has raised the question of whether this <inline ref="R1180">Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998 [No. 2]</inline> has been introduced to provide a trigger for an election. The second reading speech says that that is not so. It says:</para><quote><para>The government is reintroducing this bill to implement its mandate and policy and to unlock small business access to some 50,000 new jobs which would be created in the economy if this bill were passed.</para></quote><para>Senator Hutchins and Senator Collins dealt with that issue. But if this bill is not a bill through which an election might be triggered then we might ask ourselves: why is the rhetoric in the second reading speech of the sort that it is? An example which appears on page 2 of the second reading speech reads:</para><quote><para>The government recognises that passage of this bill now requires the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats to abandon the political obstructionism that has to date characterised their stance. They would be required to balance in a different way competing interests between the purpose of unfair dismissal laws and the negative impact these laws have on small businesses and the rights of unemployed Australians to access new jobs. If they did so, and allowed this bill to pass, they might even be given credit within the broader community.</para></quote><para>That is not the sort of statement that you would expect from somebody analysing the ramifications of this bill in a steady and dispassionate way. This bill is promoted on the grounds of rhetoric; on the grounds of saying that certain things are going to happen without providing any evidence for that. </para><para>Another example of the rhetoric of this second reading speech, which is supposed to promote the passing of this legislation, reads:</para><quote><para>It is an unavoidable fact that the defence of an unfair dismissal claim, however groundless, is especially burdensome for small businesses. In many larger businesses, more expertise and resources can be put into recruitment and termination procedures. Small businesses have no such resources. Even attendance of witnesses at a hearing can bring a small business to a standstill. </para></quote><para>That is put forward as a basis for rejecting this legislation. It is an argument to improve the system by which the law operates in this land. But, really, that statement says this: people do have rights, and perhaps should have rights, but we are going to take those rights away because the legal system is too expensive.</para><para>Once you get to the point of saying that people should not have the benefit of legal process because it is too expensive, you come to a very sorry pass in this society. That is what this second reading speech is saying. It is saying that, because it is expensive to do so, we will not give rights to certain workers whereas we will give rights to other workers. And what demarks the workers who will get the rights and the workers who will not? A number—15. If an enterprise employs 16 people, those 16 people have the right to go to law and to exercise their rights in this community. If they are members of a work force of 14, they do not. That is how whether people are going to get the benefit of the law is decided. Why should we have a legal system at all? Why not just abandon the legal system? Why not just say, `If workers feel that they have been disadvantaged or treated unfairly, forget about it.' Why isn't that approach taken? It is partly taken. The egg is partly bad, it seems. Nevertheless, the government wants to persist with that very tortured distinction between the number 15 and the number 16.</para><para>Of course there are times when a small business is disadvantaged because it has on board an employee who causes all sorts of trouble, an employee who is really not worth the money that is paid to him or her or an employee who causes such trouble that the business itself is put under threat of imploding. That is one side of it, but you do have those sorts of employees around—employees who, no matter how often you talk to them, cannot be made to see that they have a duty to work in accordance with their contract and to do so honestly and enthusiastically. You have that sort of situation. Then, of course, you have employers who oppress their workers, who do not give them proper consideration in terms of safety and wages, who just do not like them for all sorts of reasons, who therefore oppress them and who, in the end, throw them out without any justification. They are the two sides. In any particular case, which is right? If a person is unjustly thrown out of work through the prejudice, unfairness and injustice of his or her employer, why shouldn't the system be that such a person has a right to at least put a case before some tribunal? Anybody who is employed next door, where the work force is over 15, can take that process to the decision maker for a decision. Why shouldn't this person do the same sort of thing?</para><para>What we have here is not an argument to sacrifice people who belong to a work force of a particular number simply because of the expense and worry involved; what we have here is a problem with a legal system which cannot properly accommodate the situation. That is what we should be looking at. We should be looking at how the legal system can be improved so that people can go to court, go to the commission, go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or go anywhere else without that being too expensive. If we do not cure the legal system, we will have a legal system which is literally only for the wealthy. We will have a legal system that satisfies people who are in a particular class—people employed in an enterprise with more than 15 people who have particular grounds for having their issues decided.</para><para>This bill really has no logic and is based on an emotional reaction to what is said to be a cry from small business. As Senator Hutchins has pointed out, this bill tries to cure the problems that rain down on small business by sacrificing the people who small business employ. This bill says that the cure for small business is not to relieve them of the burden of getting documents ready to pay their goods and services tax and it is not to try to give them rights amongst the ever growing big businesses. This bill is saying that this is not what will cure the problems of small business, but that sacrificing the lives of small business workers, people who are employed by small business, will cure the problems of small business and relieve the devastation that small business suffers. This is saying that the small shopkeeper who has to stay open for long hours, who has not got sufficient assistance and who has to do his or her books after the shop has closed at 9 or 10 o'clock at night is going to have his or her problems solved by being able to sack somebody he or she employs, without showing any good cause. When you put that forward, it shows you how ridiculous and pernicious this bill is.</para><para>Another point I want to raise from reading the second reading speech comes from these words in it:</para><quote><para>The proposed small business exemption has been the subject of an almost unprecedented degree of political obstructionism. In less than four years it has been voted down in one form or another on eight occasions by the Labor Party and on five occasions by the Australian Democrats.</para></quote><para>If the government thought about that, they might think there is more than just a political ploy here. But this is all about preserving the citizens of this country. This is all about making sure that people at work do work with some sort of security, conditions that are decent and a fair salary. If we, as a society, cannot produce that, then we are a pretty sick society.</para><para>The reason the Labor Party have voted the bill down so many times—and will continue to vote it down—is that, if they did not vote it down, they would be inflicting a dreadful injustice on many people. If this bill ever comes before this chamber again, it will attract a second reading speech which will be able to say that, in less than so many years, the bill has been voted down in one form or another on eight occasions—and next time it will be the ninth occasion—by the Labor Party and on six occasions by the Australian Democrats. I think that when that record is read in years to come, people will say, `That is a situation where the opposing parties in the Senate did the right thing by Australia, by Australians and by business in Australia.'</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>22977</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1180">Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998 [No. 2]</inline> has been bouncing around the place for some considerable time and certainly for some time before I entered the Senate.

I make no apologies for that. The bill has been bouncing around mysteriously within the industrial relations forum, and no-one in that forum actually knows what the government is seeking to do, apart from making change for change's sake. The bill that we have before us is one that is loaded with unfairness and a lack of equity for those parties and workers who are unfortunate enough to find themselves dismissed. I have to say I am amazed that it is yet again before the Senate, hopefully to be yet again rejected.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the amazing things about this bill is that it provides an exemption for employers from the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act in relation to any person engaged after the commencement of the proposed amendments, where the employee was not an apprentice or a trainee—they are protected by other legislation—and the business employs no more than 15 persons. Senator Cooney addressed that issue. I wish to reinforce what was earlier said. Where do you draw the line? What logic is there in it being 15 employees? Miraculously, an employee who works in a company that employs 15, 17 or 20 employees, which is still considered a small business, has a different level of protection. Where is the equity? Where is the logic? Where is the difference in cost between the one employer and the other? Where is the difference in the cost between the worker who works for an employer with less than 15 employees or the worker who works for an employer with greater than 15 employees? There is absolutely no difference. The costs are the same but the fairness and the way in which the government wishes this to be managed show a great deficiency in fairness and equity for working-class people.</para><para>It is interesting to have a look at the equity question—the fairness of it. The argument going to the fairness of change is that it leaves significant sections of the workforce without basic protection. No worker should go to work without some form of protection against their employer. Workers employed by medium to large businesses have that protection. Go out into the rural areas. It might open your eyes and you might see that there are not a lot of large employers out there. Businesses run with one or two employees or as family businesses with one or two of their friends coming in to help. There is no protection for workers in those situations. But if you work for a larger employer you get that protection, or as much protection as the government—through this bill—wishes to provide.</para><para>A class divide is being developed through legislation. If you work for a small employer, you are one class of person; if you work for a larger employer, you are indeed a different class of employee. So we have a government now building into legislation that great class divide—something that was never there in the past. Similarly, the bill readily accepts that an action for unfair dismissal may harm the employer but it underplays the likely effect on the worker from losing his or her job. They lose their job but, really, what does it matter? They are a worker, and it does not matter, but the employer has to be protected. You will never convince me that there is any equity in the drafting of this bill that is purported to be going to revolutionise the Australian work force. It fails miserably in providing the basic care and basic rights of Australian citizens. I was interested to read the following in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's annual report of 1999-2000:</para><quote><para>There were over 7,000 applications finalised. Only 3 per cent of the applications were finalised by a substantive arbitration on the merits. A very large proportion of applications were finalised at, or prior to, a conciliation conference. Not all of those applications were settled. Many were not pursued, were dismissed on jurisdictional grounds or were filed too late.</para></quote><para>I went through my records of unfair dismissals in the five years prior to coming to this place. I was asked to pursue 57. Nine actually went to arbitration. Some 60 per cent were successful and the remainder were unsuccessful. That is because you apply that fairness. You give it the test. You take it there, you conciliate and you see if you can resolve the matter that is before you. If you cannot then you pursue it at a different level. Surprisingly, the majority are not even registered with the Industrial Relations Commission. You find the resolve: either the worker is grossly wrong or the worker has merit that should be pursued and the employer relents and makes some offer to settle the matter that is amicably accepted by both parties.</para><para>There is practical application. It happens, and there are people out there who will now not have that right to pursue an unfair dismissal application. There are people who work for small businesses such as delicatessens, fish and chip shops and similar enterprises, and some are so bad that—and there is quite substantive evidence of this—for example, when the employer takes a young person on to make fish and chips for the customers the terms are: `You work for the first three weeks without pay at all.' That is one problem that may need addressing in the future. That is the first condition. Eventually, it is found that they are willing to do these unholy things, and they start getting paid. The moment that worker then says: `I don't seem to be getting as much as my friend working in another shop. I don't seem to be getting as much as my mum and dad think I should be'—or, bless them, they may even go to the department of labour and find out they are entitled to an award rate of pay and then raise that with their employer—they find that they are not required the following day. They are simply not required, because they have suggested that they should be getting more than $3.50 an hour for working on a Sunday evening making fish and chips or serving behind the counter of a delicatessen. </para><para>This bill denies those young people—and, indeed, some married women have been caught in the same trap—access to appeal that decision to terminate them. In some situations the employer has actually been brought to the table for conciliation. The employer says, `I didn't know about that.' God bless them, they are no different from the employee. The employee has an absolute obligation to know what the law says, and so does the employer. But it does not deter them. They are trying to sneak away and hide behind a bit of draconian legislation that has not been properly thought out. The annual report of the commission goes on to say:</para><quote><para>This settlement rate is based on the settlements achieved through the conciliation process. In the last six years the settlement rates have ranged from just over 50 per cent to over 70 per cent. The trend is an upward one, giving some cause for concluding that conciliation is increasingly effective.</para></quote><para>Let us have a look at some of the matters that went before the commission. We look at South Australia, my home state. Of the 210 cases that were registered to go before the commission, 14 went to substantive arbitration. One could not say that that is a burden on the employers by any stretch of the imagination. Let us look at a bigger state, New South Wales, which registered 1,128 matters. Out of those 1,128, only 43 went to substantive arbitration. How can the employers in New South Wales say that it is absolutely vital for them to get legislative change? It is a mockery.</para><para>Dear old Victoria no longer have the state Industrial Relations Commission forum. They registered slightly higher: they had 4,691 matters registered, with only 126 of those matters going to the substantive arbitration stage. The others were resolved beforehand. A person who goes to a union, or a person who goes to a decent solicitor who is not just looking for a quick buck, will always be told if there is merit in their case or not. No union in their right mind, and no solicitor who is doing anything but looking after the interests of their client, would ever suggest to an employee who had been terminated that they should pursue unfair dismissal when they had brought their downfall about by their own actions. I can see absolutely no reason why the government should be pursuing such meaningless legislation. That is all you can say about the legislation before us.</para><para>A great deal is being said by the employers about the surveys that are done, supporting the need to do something about unfair dismissals, about the cost on their businesses. One has to ask the question: where are these surveys taken? Who fills out these surveys? Does the managing director give it to the tea lady to fill out while she is pouring a cup of tea and say, `Put something out here'?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—That is sexist.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>009D2</name.id><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name></talker><para>—Or the tea man, as it may be now. Thank you, Senator Abetz, for drawing my attention to that remark. I withdraw any perception I might have given that I was being sexist. But that is the fact. Anyone could be asked to fill out these surveys, because I do not think the managing directors with any perception of what is good management are doing it. It is an absolutely false perception that they have. If you look at the figures in the annual report and if you look at the figures that are shown in state industrial relations commissions' annual reports, you will see the same reflection. You will see that it is not a burden on the employers at all. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is falsely perceived by employees as something to go out and bash the unions on and, of course, to bash the workers on—who, more importantly, are the people we should be looking to protect with this legislation. But protect we are not. This legislation will make it more difficult for those people who are caught up in the tragedies of working life. If they are unfairly dismissed, the cost will be borne by them—if, indeed, they can get to the commission and have their case heard.</para><para>I have had a lot of dealings with many companies of many varying sizes. I have always asked that question: what does the unfair dismissal matter mean to you? In at least—and this is anecdotal, but I do not think my figures would be too wrong—90 per cent of those cases, they do not even see it as an issue. There is no issue with them. They have not sacked anyone and they do not intend to. Those employers who say, `It's going to be a burden to me,' must not be very good to start with—they have not got their management structures in place and, indeed, they have a mean streak to start with. Perhaps they should look for a different vocation other than managing.</para><para>The senior management of those companies that I dealt with, ranging from very large corporations to those companies that run three or four employees, do not see any difficulties with the unfair dismissal laws as they are. They do not see that there is an onerous burden on their shoulders by doing this, and they certainly do not see that there is a need for substantive change.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: OUTSOURCING</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>22980</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Return to Order</title><page.no>22980</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>22980</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to make a brief statement in relation to an order for the production of documents that was sent to me earlier today. </para></talk.start><para>Leave granted. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>—At about 5 p.m. today I received a letter from the Clerk informing me of an order that was agreed to by the Senate earlier today.

I was hoping tonight to speak on a bill about the year 2000 or even 2001, but it seems that we have resurrected the Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill from as far back as 1998 to bring it on for debate and final resolution. It is not a bill I am unfamiliar with. It seems to have been floating around for quite some time. From memory, I think it has been debated in this chamber some eight times in the past. I recall the previous minister, Mr Reith, tried to introduce the effect of this bill by regulation. If I recall correctly—though I am open to correction—it was before Christmas, which was an unusual time but a time when someone might have tried to sneak through a regulation and hope that no-one actually saw it. I certainly would not subscribe that to Mr Reith, but it was an unusual time to go about doing that. </para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1180">Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998 [No. 2]</inline> is, at its heart, an unfair bill with respect to not only unfair dismissals but also its true nature. It does not introduce fairness. It does not introduce equity. It does not set about righting wrongs or fixing injustices. This government may wish to use its expertise to pursue these issues, but instead it seeks to take away people's rights. It seeks to limit people's rights. In fact, in the workplace relations area, this government seems hell-bent on circumscribing and delimiting people's rights. The government does that under the guise of the word `reform'. The government says that it is really part of a workplace reform agenda. Of course, that does not prevent the government from setting about taking away people's rights under any label it wishes to place on it. What is slightly annoying—and perhaps more so for the people who might be subject to this bill if it were to pass—is that the government uses the word `reform' quite improperly. It uses the word `reform' when in fact it really means a backward step. What it means to say is: `We want to support the big end of town.' </para><para>The government does that under the guise of helping small business and trying to assist business to compete effectively in the marketplace—not by looking at education, health or trade policies but by saying, `What we need to do is deregulate the labour market.' What a term! We are talking about people. We are not talking about deregulating technology, deregulating a structure or moving from away one policy initiative to another policy initiative. We are talking about taking away people's rights to have fair and equitable access to a court of law or, in this instance, to a tribunal to allow it to adjudicate in relation to a dispute that may arise in the workplace. We are told in the explanatory memorandum to this piece of dastardly legislation that the purpose of subsection 170CE(5A) is:</para><quote><para>to specify the requirements for an employee (other than an apprentice or trainee)—</para></quote><para>heaven knows why the government saves them—</para><quote><para>to be allowed to make an application under subsection 170CE(1) on the ground that a termination was harsh, unjust or unreasonable (or on grounds that include that ground).  The requirements will be that, at the relevant time, the employee—</para></quote><para>and here is the sting in the tail—</para><quote><para>had completed at least six months of continuous service with the employer; and</para><para>was employed by an employer with more than 15 employees.</para></quote><para>So there we have it. Should this bill pass, the government intends to gain access to unfair dismissals, to gain access to the tribunal which has been set up to look after the interests of employees—and employers, I should add. An employee will have had to have completed a six-month period of continuous service and be employed by an employer who employs 15 or more employees. So there are two hurdles to jump over.</para><para>In a steeplechase this government might excel, but in relation to employees it is quite unfair to say that to access a tribunal you have to fit yourself within those two circumstances. We already understand that the mobility of employees in Australia is quite high. We already understand that a small business might have more than 15 employees or fewer than 15 employees. We already understand that the federal sphere does not cover the entire field—there are state jurisdictions and a federal jurisdiction as well. And now the government is saying that, in relation to this narrow scope, this narrow ambit, these conditions should apply. These conditions are not positive initiatives. They are not about, as the government would have it, promoting employment; they are about taking away employees' rights. </para><para>Sometimes these conditions mask good policies of employers. Rather than all employers having one policy about how they should employ and how they should be flexible in addressing their employee requirements and being able to ensure that their policies and practices are reasonable so that if they are going to dismiss employees they do it in a fair and equitable manner, the conditions create a dividing line where those above the line are subject to the legislation and are required to keep a policy that is fair and equitable and those below the line are not required, by the looks of it, to do anything about it. Therefore, you can imagine that even amongst the employers there would be a little bit of concern that this bill is unfair and it could work against their own interests. It would not dawn on an employer to restructure the business to try to fit within the legislation. That possibility would be countenanced by some. They would not be the fair and equitable employers; they might be at the other end of the spectrum. </para><para>When you then look at the legislation as it is drafted you get into these definitional problems of who is and who is not within the legislation. In some instances some of those issues will be dealt with by regulation—that is within the bill itself. Others will come about because of the very nature of the two exclusions—employers may seek to address the issue by changing the nature of the employment of employees. In other words, they might say to the 16th employee in the business, `I would otherwise have full-time work for you but it would be better to employ you casually or to employ two people instead of you,' to maintain a number which would then put them outside the scope of this legislation. In other words, employers would make decisions based on legislation rather than on good economic sound principles or profit motives.</para><para>Definitional problems might also arise if an employer changes the nature of their business—split the business into two or have separate companies. The argument might run that they would not do that, that it would not be commonsense. But, having experienced business in a number of occupations in the past—small business particularly—I recall on one occasion that, to avoid the trading hours legislation that was operating in Queensland at the time, businesses did split their businesses and did restructure their businesses to enable them to, as they would say, `open their hours' and compete with the business down the road that they might otherwise not have been able to compete with because they had a different structure with fewer employees or they were a bigger business. So businesses will consider these issues and, if they possibly can, involve themselves in these types of practices. Sometimes it may not be commonsense to do that but still that does not appear to stop them. The second reading speech does provide some explanation. It says:</para><quote><para>The government is not reintroducing this bill because it wants to have an election over it. The government is reintroducing this bill to implement its mandate and policy and to unlock small business access to some 50,000 new jobs which would be created in the economy if this bill were passed.</para></quote><para>Let us dissect the phrase. Usually when you say `not' it is the real reason anyway, otherwise you would not have to deny it. There is not much of a positive statement that you could glean from that. But what you can glean from that is that the government says that it could be created. It does not say that this will happen, that this is a possible corollary of the introduction of the unfair dismissal legislation. It uses phrases that are fuzzy around the edges—to use a nondescript term. It does not say with any degree of particularity that if you introduce this legislation this will happen. What it says is that this could happen. What it does not say is that down the track will small business continue to employ people or will they change the processes or will the government introduce more legislation to fix up changed business practices that may have eventuated? It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The proposed small business exemption has been the subject of an almost unprecedented degree of political obstructionism. </para></quote><para>The government use that phrase when they cannot negotiate legislation through this chamber. It is an unfortunate phrase to fall back on but the government appear to use it when they are unable or do not have the ability to negotiate an outcome through this house. They then resort to the phrase `political obstructionism'. It is unfortunate, but we would certainly put up with it if it meant ensuring that unfair legislation does not pass. In my view and the Labor Party's view the government have not been able to demonstrate in any fair-minded way the reasonableness of this legislation, the necessity for it, or even where it will provide some material benefit to small business and to employees—in other words, in the labour market as well. If you were to introduce legislation to help small business then the Labor Party would be supportive of it. </para><para>The government could take another direction. They appear to have adopted our policies in relation to BAS and some of our policies in rolling back the GST. Those benefits will help small business. The Labor Party is not about being obstructionist in improving the lot of small business; it is about providing benefits in a fair and equitable way without impacting negatively on others in the marketplace. We are all in the marketplace at the end of the day, both employees and employers. Many small businesses operate more consensually than you would expect. Small business has to get on with its employees. As I recall, small business does provide incentives to employees and they do work together. Occasionally those relationships break down and they require the tribunal to assist them to work through those small issues. </para><para>I do not think that it is a matter that is easily put aside on the basis that the introduction of this bill would be a `fix-it' for small business, unlock unlimited job opportunities and provide small business with the incentive to create employment. The truth of the matter is that small business with government support directed in appropriate areas and with assistance in relation to the more weighty issues that confront it, such as BAS, would be provided with greater opportunity to develop in the marketplace and create employment. The second reading speech states:</para><quote><para>The case for the passage of the bill is overwhelming.</para></quote><para>I am overwhelmed by that statement! There is no clear argument that is overwhelming that I can find, let alone within the second reading speech. It refers, hopefully, to the Senate committee report on the area and very little else, except for perhaps a survey or two, to create a position where they can say that the position is overwhelming. In fact, if the case were put that that was the only thing that they relied on—and, from my reading of the second reading speech, there do not appear to be many other arguments being put forward—then, certainly, I would be underwhelmed that they use that to say there is a dire need for the introduction of this bill.</para><para>The difficulties, as I alluded to earlier, are also fairly clear. If we dissect the Commonwealth's responsibility in relation to industrial relations—let us do that for a moment—we see that the small business exemption that is offered here is a part of what this government has already tried to implement, and has implemented in some respects, through its so-called reform agenda—and that goes to caps on the number of claims that can be progressed through the unfair dismissal area. There are also other stops in the system, which include of course that federal legislation does not cover corporate associations; it only covers incorporated associations and the like. This legislation really brings it down to a very marginal area compared with the greater area where small business exists. Of course, that might also bring inequities whereby people could point to the federal sphere in particular and say, `If this bill were introduced, it would be unfair because, while we are subject to state law, or while we are outside the cap, we are unable to access this particular unfair dismissal provision encapsulated in this bill.' So you create this quite confusing position. </para><para>The supporters say—and I think they are bland statements, in truth—that it does not affect the rights of existing employees. As I have said, if you look at job mobility, it will affect employees. To say that it does not affect existing employees is quite erroneous when a person might leave a small business and return at some point and so then would come back under the legislation. Supporters say that it is necessary to ensure the continuing growth in employment in small business. There is no evidence of that. Some of the supporters of this unfortunate bill say that it was a mandate given to this government to pursue; I think it is more of an election campaign issue that this government is pursuing. The critics of the proposed bill justify the case for why this bill should not proceed. They continue to say that the bill may encourage some employers to create artificial business entities to avoid the law by reducing the nominal size of their work force and the like.</para><para>The Industrial Relations Commission has the capacity to deal with this area in a fair and equitable manner. This government should support the Industrial Relations Commission. It should leave this area to the Industrial Relations Commission and leave employers and employees to sort out the issues through consultation, and it should not intrude in an obstructionist manner.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>22984</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The debate on the <inline ref="R1180">Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998 [No. 2]</inline> is a very important one, and I thank all honourable senators for their contributions.

Senator Collins is from the Shop Assistants Union; Senator Hutchins, who declared his interest, said he was a proud lifelong executive member of the Transport Workers Union; Senator Cooney is a successful industrial advocate; and I do not know about Senator Buckland. I will have to ask Senator Alston's research assistant to update his list; Senator Buckland is not mentioned. But I would be incredibly surprised, after listening to Senator Buckland's impassioned speech, if he was not a long serving executive of a union.

He cannot see the other point of view. I can actually see the Labor point of view. They believe that if you centralise control of workplace relations, if you believe truly in your own heart that the individual rights of workers, of employees, in Australia can only be protected if they are members of a union and have a union to protect them, then they have no rights and the unions must have a special place protected by legislation. That is the only way you could have that point of view.</para><para>Senator Hutchins, from the Transport Workers Union, referred in his speech to some research conducted this year, I believe, for the Victorian Trades Hall Council by Sweeney and Associates—I think that was the name of the company that conducted the survey. It found that, of 400 randomly selected small businesses, 39 per cent said that unfair dismissal laws affect their business. The Labor Party people opposite say, `Oh, it is only 39 per cent of people who are worried about the unfair dismissals anymore.' Some other Labor speakers on this bill said, `This is all about having double dissolution election triggers.' If you seriously go around after the Ryan by-election saying that it is all about politicians listening to what the people are saying, one of the messages out of Ryan is, in fact, that the people of Australia do not like being taken out to unnecessary by-elections a few weeks after an early state election. There is a whole range of messages out of Ryan.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—Why did Moore create the by-election?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—Quite right, Senator Cook.

But what I am saying is that if you say you have to listen because of the messages coming out of by-elections and other state elections, then you should listen to the 39 per cent of small businesses who will tell you that unfair dismissal legislation is a serious concern to them. In fact, 46 per cent of small businesses in the survey conducted by Sweeneys for the Trades Hall Council said that industrial relations issues were of concern to them. And in the Yellow Pages small business survey, 79 per cent of businesses said that they would employ more people if it was not for the unfair dismissal laws. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It suits the Labor Party senators opposite to just ignore all of that, not to listen to that but to listen to their union mates who see a protection for their own place in the sun by having a highly centralised and highly regulated industrial regulations regime. So they come in here saying, `There is no call for this.' If they are highly organised, if they are a member of the Australian Labor Party, if they come from a union background and they have two ears, then they hear their union mates saying, `We do not want to water down unfair dismissal laws because it keeps us in business.' But they do not listen to the 39 per cent of small businesses who say that unfair dismissal laws affect their business. </para><para>If you go out and talk to small business people about issues of concern to them—and I make a point of talking to as many of them as I possibly can wherever I go—they still talk about unfair dismissals. It is in their top two or three issues every time you talk to them—and you wonder why we bring this reform into the parliament so often! The trouble, I suspect, is that small business people have given up hope of ever seeing this reform come in. When they are looking at employing extra staff, they make a decision based on the fact that they know they have to take a risk every time they employ someone. So small businesses have made a decision that this is a serious problem and it does affect their employment decisions.</para><para>Quite frankly, if Labor Party people want to go out and tell small businesses that the unfair dismissal laws in this country are okay, then go out and do it. We want you to nail your colours to the mast. Mr Beazley came out last week and said he had problems with funding his policies because he did not have any policies. I really wish you would nail your colours to the mast and go and tell them what your policies are. I want to go around to small businesses and say that, in the Senate's last sitting week, you refused small businesses access to the ACCC's powers to run representative actions under 45D and 45E. Labor Party senators, with the assistance of their friends in the Democrats, said to small businesses, `If you want to take on Coles and Woolies or any other big business with the assistance of 45D and E under Trade Practices Act, you can't do it.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—Hear, hear!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—Thank God for the interjections—I hope <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> got them.

Yet when we come into the parliament and say that we want to listen to those 39 per cent of small businesses in Victoria and the many small businesses right around Australia and that we want to give them relief—only to those with 15 or fewer people in their employ and only applying to new employees, so it is very targeted relief—then the Labor Party and the Democrats join together and say, `No, we will listen to the people of Australia, but only if they are members of a union or a union executive.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>With all due respect to the honourable senator, it is absolutely misleading for Senator Buckland to say to the Senate that this hypothetical person in the hypothetical fish and chip shop would be sacked because he dared to ask about his $3.50 pay. The person that Senator Buckland refers to would not have their rights circumscribed—or limited, to use Senator Ludwig's words—at all. What he says is totally untrue. Under the Workplace Relations Act, it is unlawful for an employer to terminate an employee's employment where the reason for the termination includes the fact that the employee has made a complaint. I refer the honourable senator to section 170CK.</para><para>Senator Buckland has come in here with another excuse for his opposition to the bill. Labor senators have been saying, `Fifteen—how do you determine that? Why not make it 16? Why not make it 14?'—arguing boundary issues.

If so, he knows that he got up here in the Senate and totally misled the place about the effect of this bill—or he has been misled; I do not know.

It is in fact giving rights to people and ensuring that, if they want to find redress with the support of an organisation like a trade union or if they want to find redress by going to a court, then it is a decision that is open to them as free individuals living in a free nation. I happen to believe that that is by far the best way to protect individual rights. Senators opposite—who continue to interject and chatter and laugh—would believe that the only way that you can protect individual rights is to force people to join a union and to ensure that you take away rights from individuals and place those rights in the hands of a select few. The select few opposite who contribute to these workplace relations debates are part of a highly centralised workplace relations organisation and structure that grew up in this country over decades and has ensured that virtually all of the people who held high office in trade unions around Australia, if they played their cards right, if they were loyal to the right faction, would sooner or later end up with a seat in the Senate. That is one of the reasons why it is very hard for a government that is committed to ensuring that individual employees in their workplaces have freedom to make decisions on their own account—not be dictated to by people sitting in the trades halls councils who tell people what they think is right and do not allow individuals to make their own decisions, and who will not allow reform of workplaces to go through this place.

We have Senator Buckland coming in here, misleading the Senate about the rights of an employee in a fish and chip shop, saying the rights of that person will be taken away when in fact they will not, and we have Senator Collins saying it did not help employment in Queensland. For the period of similar exemptions in Queensland, employment growth was in fact 10.5 per cent for businesses with 20 or fewer employees, compared with a 6.3 per cent growth in a similar period prior to the introduction of that reform.

Some people might say that this is the `rats and mice' bill that picks up on and overcomes a number of administrative mistakes that this government has made in administering the tariff system in Australia. I will not be quite as uncharitable as that, because as a former customs minister I know that, no matter how hard you try in issues as complicated as the tariff list in Australia, from time to time, despite the best efforts of the officers, occasional slip-ups will be made in the definition of what should be in the table and what should not be. All governments try hard with this, and although my government, when we were in office, certainly tried very hard, occasionally we had to bring in legislation to amend the tariff act to take account of the fact that there had been some administrative difficulty.</para></talk.start><para>The major issue of this bill, though, is not an administrative difficulty. It is about outlining the agreement reached between the Australian government and the American government over the Howe Leather company issue. This is a saga that goes back to the time of the government I was a part of, and it has flowed through to be resolved only in recent times. I have to say that, generally, I find it extraordinary in many ways that the American government—which is without fear or favour whenever it has felt its own interests are at stake—has intervened and has used tariffs and penalties to protect its own industry, irrespective of whatever else its administration may say about free trade, and that, whenever the heat has been applied in a particular local area of industry in America, the American Congress and the American administration have always backed away from supporting their rhetoric in favour of free trade.</para><para>One of the most notorious examples was the Jones act, which has protected the American domestic shipbuilding industry for over 100 years now. You cannot sell ships into the American market for domestic use along the coast, because that trade is reserved for shipbuilding in America. We have a very efficient, highly effective fast-ship building industry in Australia that is world competitive and does not rely on subsidies or protection, other than a small shipbuilding bounty which is very modest by comparison with what most other countries provide. We have maintained in opposition, as we did in government, that that bounty should be maintained until all the other countries producing ships come clean and sign the OECD agreement on shipbuilding to get rid of the subsidies amongst the major players. We quite rightly said that we will sign on when we see the colour of the money of the United States and of Western Europe.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—The US knocked it back twice.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—As my learned senatorial colleague and shadow minister for trade—and Minister for Trade in seven or eight months time—quite rightly points out, the United States knocked back the opportunity to sign the agreement, under domestic pressure. So they have a warped and rotten system of protection for the shipbuilding industry in their country, and this is to the disadvantage of the efficient fast-ship builders in Australia that are now world famous. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Take another area: sugar. The Americans have consistently provided protection for the production of sugar cane in America. This has meant that efficient producers, such as Australia, are at a disadvantage selling into what is a very big domestic market. Some years ago in America, a major manufacturer of confectionery in Chicago, employing 800 workers making confectionery, closed the factory and said, `We can't compete with imported confectionery if we can't use world's best price for sugar. If we have to pay the highly subsidised price for American sugar, our confectionery is no longer competitive.' So, in a short-sighted way, the American government sat by and watched a major manufacturer close, and 800 jobs went out the window.</para><para>We all know that, about nine months before the last American presidential election, suddenly out of nowhere the American government announced tariffs on the importation of Australian lamb and sheep meat. This was done apparently to protect a very small number of what could only be described as hobby farmers in the Rocky Mountains region, I understand, of the United States: farmers who had a few sheep and wanted to protect their market. In many cases, as I say, they were hobby farmers and not major meat producers. But that tariff went on, and that affected access for Australia into that market.</para><para>Looking back at the history of the Howe Leather arrangements, I have to say that our good and powerful friendly allies the Americans are not very friendly when it comes to trade matters when dealing with Australia. I know that all sides of this parliament have at times expressed exasperation at the Americans' inability to match their rhetoric on free trade with what they actually do. Indeed, Americans take on and complain about Howe Leather and then go to the WTO and complain about leather arrangements; but when asked whether they will allow the WTO to deal with agricultural markets and products, they and the Western Europeans sit on their hands. We have not been successful in getting the WTO to deal with agricultural commodities in the way it has been dealing with manufactures in other areas—and regional areas, and in particular our farmers, have suffered.</para><para>The Howe Leather company in Australia is an example of which we should be proud. Instead of exporting raw skins overseas to be made into leather for someone else to do the value adding, Howe Leather developed in Australia a high quality leather product, value adding, so that we would export the leather and not the skins. Certainly that company did this with assistance from Australian industry programs at a time when the Labor Party was in government. I think those arrangements were available to any company that wanted to invest in developing leather and other related products in Australia. The Americans did not mind Howe's activities until it got serious about winning contracts in America. In May 1995, Howe won a $75 million contract to supply leather for car seats used by General Motors. As more contracts followed, the two companies that had previously dominated the US market requested that the US government launch a World Trade Organisation challenge, based on the assistance that had been provided to Howe.</para><para>Howe had been rewarded under the export assistance grants that we had provided, and I believe those grants are available to any company, Australian owned or foreign owned, operating in Australia. The program does not discriminate about who owns the company as long as it is based in this country. The WTO rule was that Howe had to pay back the $30 million it had received in government assistance. The Clinton administration also threatened to impose tariffs on imports of Australian wine. That threat was a very serious one to be made to our growing wine industry. The Americans had picked an industry that we would be sensitive about and then threatened to undermine it. They also threatened beef, car parts and other unrelated goods that had nothing to do with leather. But, generally, they had a scattergun approach and picked out the most vulnerable industries and threatened to put a tariff on them unless something was done to Howe.</para><para>Of course, at the time, if Howe had had to repay $30 million to the Australian government, it would have put the company out of action; it would have liquidated the company, and several hundred Australians workers would have lost their jobs. After a long period of negotiation—at times I think it was far too long—a settlement was come to between Australia and the US, and that is what this bill deals with. According to that settlement, Howe will be required to pay $7.2 million over 12 years, automotive leather will be ineligible for grants under government and industry schemes, and tariffs on a range of products will be suspended for 12 years. The government has also agreed to remove leather from being eligible for support under the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program scheme and the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme.</para><para>American weight has been brought to bear on the Australian government. And the Australian government? A judgment is asked for here. Did it give in too early? Did it fight it out? Did it give too much? I suspect that in the end Australia might have had to give too much—but we are a smaller economy than the Americans are, and the Americans can say, `Well, you can't really threaten us.'</para><para>I do note that in other areas America relies on Australia. We have joint facilities in this country. Some years ago, even Tim Fischer, when he was leader of the National Party, put it on the table. If we continue to be treated like this by America on trade matters, sooner or later the continued existence of the joint facilities in Australia will come into question. We cannot have a powerful ally use our ability to provide it with assistance in world security terms, though it is good for the world, but have our industries undermined and threatened in the way they are here. We cannot expect that we will always be involved, under United Nations arrangements or resolutions, in peacekeeping forces with other Western allies under the leadership of America. We have never backed away from that. We have always put our hand up, even if there has been a domestic dispute about it. We have been doing that for 50 years, but we have not got back from the Americans commensurate treatment for what is supposed to be a close ally. </para><para>We have very similar attitudes to America in supporting human rights, democracy and those related issues around the world. But America have to understand that they cannot expect us always to go to the same well when our farmers and our rural communities in particular are being affected by the American policies of overprotection, and they cannot take direct action against us over one particular company to teach us a lesson. I wish the Americans had spent more time attacking the European community over its agricultural policies than picking on Australia, which is an ally through the Cairns Group. The Cairns Group has done more to promote free trade, and particularly trade in agricultural products, than any other group established in the world.</para><para>The other thing that I really find interesting is that the government has had to remove tariffs on a wide range of consumer goods. This list is really interesting. The present five per cent tariff, as I understand it, will be removed from a number of products, including: microwave ovens, skis, home glassware, pruning knives, outboard motors, food mixers, hair clippers, condoms, digital tape recorders, video projectors and vacuum flasks. I suppose that, when you go and have a look, every one of those items is manufactured in and exported from America. We have had to give away a whole range of items, where the tariff is removed for a period of years, to settle the Howe dispute.</para><para>The speech notes say that none of these items is actually produced in Australia in any large numbers, if at all. When you look at this range of items, it seems odd to me that we do not have any industries in Australia that can produce at least some of these items. The ubiquitous condom should be able to be produced in Australia. I presumed Pacific Dunlop, with their Ansell brand, did produce these in Australia, but obviously they are imported. Digital tape recorders, video projectors and vacuum flasks all seem to me to be value added products that we ought to be producing in Australia under a vibrant, active industry policy. Minister, I would be interested if you could provide us with information on how this list of products was drawn up. Did the Americans actually put an ambit claim in and did we negotiate down from a much larger list of items? Minister, I do not know whether you are here to take the bill or whether you are just in here on duty, but I would appreciate it if the minister representing the customs minister could give us some information about that. It does seem a very odd collection of items. I would like to know how this list was reached.</para><para>The Howe Leather matter really is about the issue of trade policy and industry policy writ large and about what it means to have an economy of our size trying to get our companies to become world class, to value add and to sell their products on the world market because of their quality and price. I cannot see why a country such as Australia, or any country, cannot provide some assistance, under certain transparent rules, to companies to grow and establish a factory or a process so that the product is produced.</para><para>If we want to look at the greatest subsidy of all in America, which the Americans hide and say is not a subsidy, it is the amount of money the American government give to defence contractors for R&amp;D. They say, `This is not assistance to our industry; this is national security. This is for our defence program.' Anybody who studies the American defence industry and American industry knows that, overwhelmingly, the R&amp;D expenditure for defence flows back into industry and gives America an enormous advantage in establishing new quality products and new technologies which are then produced and sold in a civil market around the world. But the Americans will not count that R&amp;D expenditure or make any concession that some proportion of the R&amp;D they give to the defence manufacturers, running into tens of billions of dollars a year, flows into the domestic market.</para><para>I know that the Howe issue has bedevilled this government and bedevilled the government I was a part of when it was first raised, but I really think it ought to be put on record that, though we have a very close political and strategic friendship with America and we agree on a lot of things in the world, their treatment of Australia on trade issues has been abysmal. If this is how they treat an ally, it is not much different from being an enemy. If this country does not have a viable industry employing people, we will not be much advantaged promoting the issues of democracy and human rights around the world. The opposition support this bill, but we hope that our American friends do not see it as necessary in the future to attack their friend Australia on the issue of trade. I commend the bill in some sorrow that it has come to this, but we will support it and we hope this is the last time that we have such a bill dealing with the action the American government have taken.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>22992</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have listened to Senator Schacht—who was in the good old days a very good Minister for Customs, may I say, and who did much to bring some civil rights to the area—and have heard him take the United States to task, a place which you now know a considerable amount about, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson. Over Christmas, two friends of ours—a husband and wife—came over from America. The husband teaches in one of the Ivy League universities there. The wife teaches at the other end of the scale. To her university come a lot of fine Americans, mainly from migrant backgrounds—many have migrated from Mexico and other countries to the south of the Rio Grande—or African-Americans. She said that the interesting thing about these people is that they all make the same observations which are general throughout America: that America is the centre of the world, that America is the most powerful country in the world, that America does not really have to worry about the rest of the world and that Amercia can afford to be inward looking. She said that the remarkable thing about all those observations is that they are absolutely true. </para></talk.start><para>That brings us to the point—whether we are talking about the Howe Leather case, the lamb case or all those other matters that Senator Schacht raised—that, in dealing with the United States, we are dealing with the most powerful country in the world. It is therefore very difficult to get fairness in trade.</para><para>I remember being in the United States on one occasion some years back when we went to see the people in Congress. They welcomed us in a way you would be very familiar with, Mr Acting Deputy President, and told us how much they liked Australians. We thought that this would be a great opportunity to talk to them about their market enhancement scheme. We said, `It would be great if you took away the enhancement you gave to produce from the land which you send overseas, because that takes our markets.' You could see them looking at us and, although they liked Australians—they liked us and would very much like to please us—they saw absolutely no votes at all for them in the next election or preselection. Then they looked at mid-America and the situation there where there are lots of farmers and they saw lots of votes for them. It seemed to me that our case was lost before it started. I have not seen anything to change that situation and I think the same applies with the European Union.</para><para>Those great markets and centres of trade in the world are clearly going to play a major part in what happens. We can rant and rave as the chilly winds blow but we cannot do much about it except what we have done—that is, to see what we can negotiate. I think we have had some great negotiators over the years. Mr Michael Duffy, who was minister for trade, was very good. He is a personal friend of mine and that is why I mention him, but there have been others who have tried to do their best. No doubt we are tempted to talk about alliances and how we have helped the United States over the years. That is pretty true: we have helped many a nation and done great things. This is a country that does punch above its weight, which is often said because it is true. What can we do? We can try to reach an agreement that, as far as it is possible given the balance of negotiations, puts Australia at the greatest advantage and helps it in its trade.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1210">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000</inline>, on what has been told to me here, contains provisions to correct mistakes that have been made. In cases such as fibreglass fabric, tariffs have been taken off and are now being put back on because when they were taken off it was thought that there were no manufacturers in Australia of the particular product and then it was realised that there were. That has happened in a number of instances. As Senator Schacht says, these sorts of things happen. It is better that they should not happen but there we go. Then he went into the issue of Howe Leather and how protracted that was. Given the situation, I think the one thing that Australia could do is present its cases better, whether as a country that wants to press a case or defend a case.</para><para>That brings me to the rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes of the World Trade Organisation. I notice Senator Coonan is in the chamber, and she is presently chairing a subcommittee of the treaties committee which is looking into this issue. I do not want to anticipate matters that will arise from that but, although the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does a good job and pursues these matters as well as it can, there is room for a more focused approach to the issues that arise in this area. I do not want to commit myself—and I am sure Senator Coonan does not want to commit herself; we are both very open-minded in all this—but it does seem that, when a system is set up on the basis of rules which set out how agreements that have been reached between parties are to be dealt with if they fall into dispute, you need to have people who are very familiar with the way rules work, with the way the law works and with the facts of this issue.</para><para>I do not know the details of the Howe Leather case—I do not know that at all—but I would be surprised if Howe Leather did not have, over the years, legal advisers, for example, who knew the circumstances of their trade and the circumstances of the difficulty they got into and who knew intimately the way the system worked within Howe Leather. Knowing that, those lawyers would have been able to give considerable assistance to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade if that were necessary. I have a considerable impression that that was necessary. They would also have known the law. If they did not know the law, they could have brought people in who did know the law.</para><para>When we are a small nation amongst very powerful ones in terms of trade, in terms of the way the markets are ordered around the world, and when we have to rely on agreements and the proper method of dealing with those agreements, we need to be as smart as possible. I hope the department disabuses me of this impression as time goes by, but I have the impression that the people in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are not necessarily the greatest minds we have in Australia on matters that are commercial and on matters of presenting a case which needs a long-time knowledge of the facts relevant to an industry and a deep knowledge of that industry. We need to present that as well as can be presented before the tribunal which decides these issues, the dispute settlement body within the World Trade Organisation.</para><para>It is important that every advantage that we can gain from prosecuting our cases before these bodies under the World Trade Organisation we should gain. We are up against countries that are very powerful and, if we want some sanctions against these countries, they are very difficult to enforce. We can say, `We won't trade with you,' or, `We'll withdraw these advantages that we have given you as a country,' be it the United States, the European Union or Japan. But, if we withdrew from trading with them, their loss would not be as great as ours: we would cut off our nose to spite our face. So we have to act very smartly and very cleverly to ensure that, when these agreements are brought into dispute, they are resolved—under these rules—as far as possible to our greatest advantage. That is the way we have to start to think. </para><para>It is no good to suddenly have a case come upon us, whether it be Howe Leather or the lamb issue, and starting to prepare the case then. We have to think ahead, think where we are going and do much about it before the problems arise. The only way we can do that is to have people who are used to running cases helping the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to present these matters. I will give an illustration of what I mean by reading article 13 of the rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes. It states:</para><quote><para>1. Each panel—</para></quote><para>and a panel is a mechanism within the organisation to gain information and knowledge—</para><quote><para>shall have the right to seek information and technical advice from any individual or body which it deems appropriate. However, before a panel seeks such information or advice from any individual or body within the jurisdiction of a Member it shall inform the authorities of that Member. A Member should respond promptly and fully to any request by a panel for such information as the panel considers necessary and appropriate. Confidential information which is provided shall not be revealed without formal authorization from the individual, body or authorities of the Member providing the information.</para></quote><para>So that contemplates that, if a dispute arises, the panel can get information and advice from the relevant members of the World Trade Organisation. In this case it would be the two parties in dispute, although there is provision elsewhere in the rules to say that a third party can come into the dispute.</para><para>I would have thought it was absolutely essential that the facts that are marshalled at that stage—that is, at the very early stage when this panel is coming into operation—should be full and accurate and that any facts put up by the other side should be fully tested to the utmost. I get the feeling—and these are only impressions, there are no final conclusions—that a lot of this work is not done as fully as would be desirable. To put it the other way, if I were on a charge of murder, I would want a lot more work done on my behalf than seems to be, at times, done in this area. I am not, in this sense, suggesting that there is negligence or a falling away from the duty that the department must exercise—I am sure they do all they can do. What I do say is that when a group of people come on issues like this cold—where they have no familiarity, say, with lamb or leather, and where they have no deep and thorough knowledge of the law and the way to put it—if there is some help to be got from outside, that help should be obtained.</para><para>The sorts of things that Senator Schacht was talking about are things that we might raise with countries like the United States, Japan and the European Union. But I think the most effective action that we can take is to make use of the terms of the agreements that are made, and make use of the procedures by which they are resolved if they come into dispute. By making use of those things, we can forward the interests of Australians in the best possible way.</para><para>There is no doubt that we face formidable opposition to this, as was pointed out in one of the meetings that we had with people in the World Trade Organisation. The Japanese put out literature for us in Australia to read which sets out in a very seductive way why Japan should be allowed to have barriers to protect its own agriculture. In the same sort of way, Senator Schacht was talking about the United States using its military research and development to develop all sorts of goods and services which should not be protected but are protected because of the label given to them. The United States does that, and so does Japan with its food. Indeed, so does the European Union, in many other ways.</para><para>Perhaps there is another way we could look at this: we could expand our population and decide to become a market. Senator Schacht was talking about condoms before. Perhaps we could put a very high tariff on them and start to produce a very big population, and thus establish a market. Unless we are willing to take drastic action like that, I think we have to start looking at ways we can use these rules in a better way than we presently are. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>22994</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight, unaccustomed as I am to speaking in relation to the customs area, to speak on the <inline ref="R1210">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000</inline>. This amending bill is short; it seeks to amend only a couple of areas. The major amendments in this bill are directed at amending the Customs Tariff Act 1995 by, firstly, reducing the duty on some 30 tariff subheadings from five per cent to three per cent as part of a settlement between Australia and the US over assistance provided to the Howe company. I will not go into the full name; Senator Cooney tonight and a couple of other speakers have referred to it. I might come back to that area. The amending bill also seeks to accord a five per cent tariff margin to imports to Australia from Angola and Madagascar. </para></talk.start><para>In addition—and this is perhaps one of the most unfortunate aspects of this bill—it seeks to reintroduce a five per cent rate of duty on imports which cover woven fibreglass fabric. That is one of the unfortunate things that have come about because there has been a general view that, if a nuisance tariff exists, the nuisance tariff should obviously be removed or taken from the field. Perhaps it is just one of those things that slipped through the net, or perhaps it is a more serious occurrence than that—we will give the department or the various people involved the benefit of the doubt—but in fact a manufacturer does exist in that area. Of course, it would be unfair to not allow the tariff to be removed under the nuisance heading where a nuisance tariff should not apply to anyone; whereas, in this instance, it has been removed and it had to be put back in place to ensure that the idea of the nuisance tariff is not cavilled with. The bill deals with a number of other matters which I do not intend to refer to this evening. </para><para>Senator Cooney has stolen a significant amount of my thunder in relation to some of the issues I wished to speak on tonight. But, be that as it may, I will nevertheless try to add to the debate rather than simply cover the same field. Interestingly enough, Mr Truss, the member for Wide Bay, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, on 6 December, in his second reading speech on the <inline ref="R1210">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000</inline>, mentioned a number of matters. In particular, he said:</para><quote><para>Finally, this bill reintroduces a five per cent duty rate on woven fibreglass fabric from 1 September 2000. The duty on these goods was removed in December 1999 as part of the nuisance tariff exercise—</para></quote><para>which I referred to earlier this evening. He then went on to say:</para><quote><para>One of the criteria used to determine the existence of a nuisance tariff was that there was no local production of the goods covered by that tariff item.</para></quote><para>The explanation that we were given was that, despite an extensive consultative process, a producer of these goods was not identified. But it did arise in any event. I guess it was one of those things that sometimes happens—an unfortunate oversight—or perhaps it was a reflection of more serious things, but we will leave that for perhaps another debate. The intention was not to disadvantage the local manufacturer and, as a consequence, the duty on this item has been reinstated. That seems to have raised sufficient problems. When you go down the track of removing nuisance items or putting them under that heading, there is always one that proves the rule—and in this instance that did arise.</para><para>The other major area which the customs tariff amendment bill seeks to impact upon is the Howe Leather case. I will give a short synopsis of the case. The dispute occurred around 1995 when Howe Leather was successful in winning a major US contract to supply leather for car seats used by General Motors Holden—at least that is what the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 22 June 2000 advised. By the look of it, the company went on to be reasonably successful and more contracts followed. The downside to that was that, on the other side of the ledger, it appears that some US manufacturers missed out or no longer dominated the area—something which, given the American experience, is not usually taken lying down. In this instance the manufacturers requested, or managed to persuade, the US government to launch the World Trade Organisation to challenge the basis of any assistance that was awarded to Howe Leather—or Howe, which is the more generic term—in export assistance grants. Subsequently, to cut a long story short, the WTO ruled that Howe had to pay back some $30 million that it had received in government assistance—at least that was the outcome according to the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of 22 June 2000. </para><para>The press of the day reflected the troubles that might beset Australia if it did not fix the issue. As I understand it, and I think Senator Cooney also went to this issue, the Clinton Administration threatened to impose tariffs on imports of Australian wine, beef, car parts, et cetera—the list was quite considerable—unless, to put it bluntly, Australia required Howe to repay the $30 million of government grants the WTO had declared in contravention of the rules—or illegal, as the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 22 June seemed to say. The government's response was to announce on 21 June that it would remove tariffs on a wide range of consumer products—a mixed bag of goods, including skis and the like. I think Senator Cooney mentioned a number of items which I will not go to, but I am sure anyone reading <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> would be able to guess what they were. There was a joint media release by the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources on this issue. </para><para>The terms of the settlement included that Howe would pay at least $7.2 million over a 12-year period, that automotive leather would be ineligible for grants under government industry schemes and that tariffs on a range of products would be suspended for 12 years. I think there were a couple of other terms as well, including that leather would be ineligible for support under the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Scheme—at least that is what the joint media statement went to. I will not go into that in any great detail other than to give focus to what the debate this evening might be about. </para><para>We support the <inline ref="R1210">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000</inline>. We support the measures to ensure that nuisance tariffs are fixed and we also support the measures to ensure that the Howe Leather issue is fixed. However, to provide some background to the debate, I would like to comment on the way the government has handled the matter. Mr Kerr, during the second reading debate on this bill in the House of Representatives, gave some insight as to our view on this matter. His second point, after dealing with the nuisance tariffs issue, states: </para><quote><para>The resolution of that—whilst of necessity a matter—</para></quote><para>that is the Howe matter—</para><quote><para>which comes before the chamber and which we support—again reflects poorly on the administration of the government over a substantial period of time, a period of time which has caused considerable uncertainty to those employed by Howe Leather, and no doubt has caused considerable concern to those in the management and ownership of that company who have seen this battered around the place like a ping-pong ball ...</para></quote><para>Although the settlement was, it appears, trumpeted by this government, I think it masks a longer and deeper story. The matter also was reflected in questions without notice in the House of Representatives in which the World Trade Organisation was mentioned. Mr Tim Fischer, on 21 June 2000, asked a question addressed to the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile. I will not quote the whole question, but I have given the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reference so that if anyone wanted to follow that up they could. Mr Fischer asked:</para><quote><para>Would the minister advise the House of any developments in the World Trade Organisation long-running Howe Leather dispute in the United States?</para></quote><para>Perhaps that was an admission by this government that it was a long-running dispute and that the government was a shade neglectful in the way it dealt with the dispute to allow it to run on for so long without resolving it in a more effective manner. Perhaps it is not only the ineffectiveness of the government to be able to shorten the dispute but a systemic problem that exists within the government—in other words, the inability to be able to address this area of WTO or dispute in a pragmatic and practical way and to allow these things to go on for so long. Quite unusually, Mr Vaile responded: </para><quote><para>We cannot underestimate the significance of reaching a satisfactory conclusion to this and avoiding the possibility of hundred of millions of dollars worth of retaliation that may have been levelled at Australia's wine industry or beef industry, as the member indicated in his question. The US is our second largest export market and is worth about $13 billion annually.</para></quote><para>As I have given the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reference, if I have taken it out of context I am sure that will be raised. To put it in some context—and not to take it out of context—it appears on the one hand that Mr Vaile recognised that it was a long-running dispute. At least it was not denied, and I think the facts speak for themselves. Interestingly enough, Mr Vaile also recognised that leverage wasapplied in the sense that a conclusion had to be negotiated because of the apparent retaliatory action by the US in relation to Australia. The underlying importance is that a negotiated settlement would help to safeguard 700 jobs within the Howe company. </para><para>There is a recognition that the government did handle the dispute poorly. It let it get to a position in which the market applied an amount of leverage to Australia that said, `If you do not settle the matter and come to a concluded settlement'—and perhaps I can even add the words `under US terms'—`then there will be significant retaliatory action.' The government took the spin that it should be applauded or congratulated for coming to that position of avoiding the nasties contained within the retaliatory action. One wonders whether or not the whole issue may have been avoided if the government had been a little pragmatic about the matter and dealt with it in a more holistic sense—in other words, embraced the concept of the WTO dispute settling procedures and been proactive in coming to the concluded view that we may have got to a position without having to say we were effectively levered into it.</para><para>A question without notice asked in this house on 21 June 1999 by Senator Cook to Senator Hill in which the matter of the Howe judgment was raised may shed some light on that. Senator Cook, in asking a supplementary question, made the point:</para><quote><para>While you are referring it back to the minister—</para></quote><para>that is the question about Howe Leather and how the position came about—</para><quote><para>will you also ask him why the government will not make clear to the United States that, if they put a tariff on lamb that breaches World Trade Organisation rules, we will lodge an appeal with the World Trade Organisation?</para></quote><para>The WTO has an effective dispute settling procedure. It allows appeals to be lodged and matters to be progressed in a firm, legal way. But, of course, this government did not do that in relation to this matter. It chose to say that, after a long, protracted dispute after leverage was applied and the media managed to maul it, it came to a concluded negotiation. In relation to the US, short, sharp litigation may have been the better choice. It would at least have allowed an appeal process to be put forward.</para><para>I go to a submission by the Law Council of Australia that was put to the Treaties Committee. Without trying to take it out of context, the matter addressed the brief of the Treaties Committee in relation to the WTO and the matters that might impact upon the Treaties Committee. I found this submission on the web, so I do not think it takes us outside the realms of what is available. The Law Council of Australia, in talking about Australia's capacity to undertake WTO advocacy, highlighted a telling statement. They said:</para><quote><para>Australia appears to have a small team of highly competent and experienced WTO advocates. While their past endeavours are to be commended, it is likely that increased resources and community liaison could only enhance that capacity. Effective representation through the WTO requires a combination of various fields of professional expertise. The Australian Mission has not had a strong tradition of legal representation as part of the team in Geneva although this may have changed recently.</para></quote><para>Without taking it too far, I think the Law Council of Australia is having a shot at, or at least criticising, the ability of this government to practicably deal with the dispute settlement procedure in the WTO and the capacity of the department to be able to, in this instance, effectively present the case to the WTO. It also makes that point in relation to Howe Leather specifically. It states:</para><quote><para>WTO advocacy that does not sufficiently include those private interests is highly problematic. For example, in the recent <inline font-style="italic">Howe Leather</inline> dispute, there was an intergovernmental agreement not to appeal the outcome of the Panel's findings. When there was a decision adverse to Howe's interests, including a surprising decision to demand retrospective repayments of the subsidy, the private company lost out on the potential for challenging that finding.</para></quote><para>It would be interesting to explore that statement a little further, but, unfortunately, my time is coming to an end. It highlights the fact that this government seems to have made a bad decision, through poor planning and poor work, in relation to its lack of understanding of the role and place of the WTO. It should understand that the WTO, in relation to certain players such as the US, should be pursued vigorously and people's rights for an appeal mechanism should not be denied. I think it was poor form in the end to actually trumpet a decision that was not that good. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>22998</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the <inline ref="R1210">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000</inline> this evening. The proposed amendments in this bill have previously been tabled and debated in the other place. I will run through those, in short. Part 1 of the schedule to the bill contains a number of unrelated amendments: firstly, Angola and Madagascar have been added to the list of least developed countries; secondly, it implements duty reductions on 30 tariff subheadings from five per cent to three per cent as part of the settlement reached between Australia and the United States in the Howe Leather trade dispute. </para></talk.start><para>In that regard, I will refer to the question posed by Senator Schacht when he asked how the tariff items were chosen for the Howe Leather settlement. I am advised that Customs was not involved in the development of that list of items. I understand, however, that in most cases the goods listed were chosen for inclusion in the Howe Leather settlement in part because of the limited impact on Australian industry. In many cases, the goods are covered by tariff concession orders indicating there is no local manufacturer in Australia. In view of this, the impact on local businesses is considered to be minimal.</para><para>Finally, in relation to other matters in this bill, item 54 of schedule 4 has been amended to allow import credits earned under the textiles, clothing and footwear import credit scheme to be used until December 2001. Parts 2 and 3 contain amendments to items 17 of schedule 4 to the customs tariff legislation. This item, which provides concessional entry for goods which have been exported from Australia and subsequently reimported in an unaltered condition, is being amended to more adequately reflect the original policy intent—that is, you do not impose duty twice on the same article which is imported on two different occasions. Part 4 reintroduces the five per cent duty rate on certain woven fibreglass fabric that was removed as part of the nuisance tariff exercise. Despite extensive consultation, a producer of certain woven fibreglass fabric identified itself after the duty reductions were introduced, and so not to disadvantage local manufacturers, the duty on these goods is being reinstated. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>22998</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>22998</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not want to delay the Senate too much on the <inline ref="R1210">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000</inline>, but in my speech on the second reading—and, Minister, you may have answered my remarks while I was walking back into the chamber—I asked whether the Americans put an ambit claim in for a much longer list of items that they wanted the tariff removed on to reach a settlement on the Howe Leather case. I do not need the answer to be provided now, but I would like you to take it on notice. In the information provided, there are a number of items, which I read out, amongst others, that are included in the bill. It says in the explanation of these items—which I will not read again because the information is in the second reading speech—that there is no known manufacturer in Australia for the products subject to tariff reduction. That is the advice written in an article in the newspaper. Is that correct, or are there any manufacturers in Australia of those items on  the list which I read out before? I trust they are correct—microwave ovens, skis, home glassware, pruning knives, outboard motors, food mixers, hair clippers, condoms, digital tape recorders, video projectors and vacuum flasks.

I understand that you may have to take this on notice but, in relation to the Howe matter and the settlement thereof, I am curious about the reasons behind the settlement rather than about the appeal process. Was that a matter that went to the inability of the department to successfully take advocacy in the international fora or was there some other reason that may not be quite apparent from the records that I have seen but which would demonstrate the reason for the settlement? Of course, to rule out one of the obvious replies, a negotiated settlement is the better course. You might temper the reply by my view that America is a different kettle of fish; the US is a litigious place. It may be a rule where a negotiated settlement might be preferable in other countries—perhaps in Europe, where they are more accustomed to negotiating these things.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>23000</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand that matter was dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

In some other respects, it is legislation which in essence reflects the force of protection already available to the Lake Eyre Basin. I do not need to speak at length on this legislation, other than to say that the bill gives legislative approval to the Lake Eyre intergovernmental agreement which was signed on 21 October 2000 between the Commonwealth and the states of Queensland and South Australia. It is an agreement which was overwhelmingly welcomed by the communities concerned. An important aspect of this agreement is that this was a community driven process; one which was quite successful in this particular instance, resulting in the agreement being signed by the relevant governments.</para></talk.start><para>The agreement in fact comes into force when it has been approved in legislation by the Queensland and South Australian parliaments. Though technically there may not be a requirement in the agreement for the federal government to introduce legislation, I think the decision to do so is an important one. It does confirm not only the government's commitment but the parliament's commitment to a sustainable management future for the Lake Eyre Basin. When we talk about the Lake Eyre Basin we are talking about a monumental area of Australia, encompassing enormous portions of Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory, with a touch of New South Wales.</para><para>It is important for this parliament to approve such legislation at a time when the issue of sustainability is an increasingly pressing one in the minds of an increasing number of Australians. That is increasingly important, because I think there is a realisation that the way that we are using our resources in this country is not sustainable. That is of enormous concern not just to the environment movement, a movement which has for a long time had primary interest in and concern for these sorts of issues, but also for another part of the community, which in some respects may not have been as vocal or as strident in terms of its actions but has been just as caring and concerned and just as effective in lobbying as the environment movement has been, that is, the broader community: those who use the resources, particularly the farming community, the rural community, and communities living in their vicinity. There are a lot of people who are concerned about a sustainable future for our resource base, our land base; and that concern has been reflected in the way that the community has driven the outcome for this particular basin, for the protection of the basin.</para><para>Basically, this legislation confirms a commitment to the future sustainable management of the Lake Eyre Basin and to the protection of dependent environmental and heritage values. Anyone who has spent some time there, as I have done—particularly last year but also over the years—could appreciate the enormously impressive characteristics of this basin. One only has to go to, for instance, the Georgina-Diamantina catchment area, the Cooper Creek catchment area, to see that there we have an enormous degree of ecological life—wildlife, bird life and natural habitat—that is probably one of the most underestimated, underpromoted and underappreciated parts of Australia, but one that has nestling within it an enormous degree of diversity of natural life and habitat.</para><para>So, firstly, protection is important; secondly, understanding of the characteristics is important; thirdly, promotion is important; and, fourthly, protection in its promotion is an important aspect of this area. I have been to Kakadu quite a number of times. I have been to the Cooper Basin a few times. I must admit that the extensiveness of the wildlife in that Cooper Creek catchment area is something which I think needs to be appreciated by an increasing number of Australians. We do not appreciate this area as much as we should. Although technically this bill may not have any real legal enforceability, it is an important statement by this parliament and an important reflection and endorsement of the community driven process that has led to this outcome, and the opposition supports it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>23002</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats are also pleased to support the <inline ref="S295">Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement Bill 2001</inline>. In looking at this issue and the various aspects of it, I have had a look at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>record on this particular issue and, in many ways, I was not surprised to discover that the Democrats have raised the matter of the management of the Lake Eyre Basin on very many occasions over the last 20 years or so. In particular, former Democrat Senator John Coulter had a particular interest in the management of the Lake Eyre Basin and had spent a lot of time in that area himself, along with other people over a long period of time, gathering information to support the Democrats' views that the area should be better managed and, indeed, supporting the nomination of the area for world heritage listing, a proposal that was announced by the Keating government during the 1993 election campaign. </para></talk.start><para>It is notable that the legislation that we are debating tonight reflects the conclusions drawn by the Democrats back in the early 1990s, that the management process needs to include all the various stakeholders and be primarily a bottom-up approach, if it is to be a success. It is probably worth reflecting on the words of the minister in the second reading speech, in terms of the importance of that approach, which is basically the need for a comprehensive management approach to the Lake Eyre Basin:</para><quote><para>Ensuring that the Basin's values are protected for present and future generations requires an ongoing partnership involving governments, industry and the community. This Bill and the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement will strengthen and build upon the regional catchment management frame-work already established by the Basin community ... as part of the Lake Eyre Basin Regional Initiative.</para></quote><para>Those words of the minister indicate that this is a partnership and that it is more of a bottom-up approach, which involves better management of the area. That it is such an important area and has various stakeholders who have been involved in aspects of it for a long period of time highlight why it is so important to have people involved in it from all those different perspectives. Land-holders in the region do have a vast repository of knowledge in relation to land management, and that can be databased and accessed for future generations. Quite a bit of progress has been made in recent years, and repair of some damaged and degraded land has come along quite well after the exclusion of non-native animals.</para><para>There are proposals to export organic beef from the region—a proposal that, as a vegetarian, does not necessarily appeal to me personally. But, if the raising of meat for human consumption is to be undertaken, it may as well be conducted in a manner that minimises the effect of harmful agricultural practices on the environment. The development of markets such as those does attract a premium. Again, if we are going to pursue such methods that are value adding, it is beneficial to ensure that it is done in a way that does minimise environmental damage. If the region is to develop as an organic production zone and, more importantly, realise its tourism potential, as well as preserve the biodiversity and other important environmental aspects of the region, it is crucial to minimise the effects of various human activities on the environment. In particular, I think it is crucial to look at other agricultural operations in the area, such as proposals to grow cotton in parts of the region, in terms of what the impact of that on the environment may mean—and particularly in terms of water usage.</para><para>There is still a long way to go in terms of how the area is best managed. But I think this particular bill does provide some opportunity for better future management and for ensuring that at least we are on a forward path. I think there are still some more issues to be addressed, some of which have been raised before by the Democrats many times over quite a number of years. That will be something that we will be continuing to look at. But, as with any issue that at least moves us in a forward direction, we are happy to support this legislation. We will always point to what other things need to be done, but we will not stand in the way of ensuring that things move in a positive direction.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>23003</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take this opportunity to thank honourable senators for their support of the <inline ref="S295">Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement Bill 2001</inline>.

This was a statutory board, it was financed by growers through a four per cent compulsory levy and it had responsibility for both promotion and research. The promotion part of the organisation was handled by the Woolmark Company, which was formerly owned by the International Wool Secretariat, and the other part of the operation was the research and development corporation. The Senate will recall that, in 1998, there was a no-confidence motion passed in AWRAP, and the McLachlan task force made a number of recommendations with respect to the future of the wool industry, particularly with respect to the operation of Woolmark and also the operation of future research and development. The government delivered on these recommendations with the privatisations of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation and the creation of the new Australian Wool Services company.</para></talk.start><para>This company and its subsidiaries commenced operations on 1 January this year as a company limited by shares under the Corporations Law, meeting the target date set by the minister for agriculture. Australian Wool Services has two subsidiaries: Australian Wool Innovations Pty Ltd, which manages the wool levy and funds the R&amp;D and innovation; and TWC Holdings Pty Ltd, which has taken over the work of the Woolmark Company, concentrating on the commercial development of the Woolmark brand and its sub-brands and the commercialisation of intellectual property matters. The new structure was developed in consultation with wool growers and from the McLachlan recommendations. It provides for increased contestability and competition in the application of wool levy expenditure, which has been reduced from four per cent to three per cent with an expectation that it will be reduced to two per cent; it allows wool growers to have a more direct say in the levy expenditure and to have shareholding in the commercial activities of the company; and it allows for increased accountability to the Commonwealth in the expenditure of wool levy funds and the Commonwealth matching R&amp;D contributions. </para><para>The successful start of Australian Wool Services followed the passage of the Wool Services Privatisation Bill in the Senate early in December last year. At the time there had been concerns that the passage of the legislation may have been delayed by the contingent liability relating to the claim by Cape Wools of South Africa for its share of equity holding in Woolmark, but this matter was settled prior to the conversion, and the passage of the legislation proceeded without delay. AWRAP and Cape Wools settled the dispute on 30 December 2000 and former AWRAP chairman Mr Tony Sherlock has said that he considered that the $11.25 million payment to Cape Wools was `appropriate and realistic'. Moreover, the settlement was an amicable one, and Cape Wools has the option to take up to seven per cent of equity in the Woolmark Company at some stage in the future for a sum of money to be negotiated, with the agreed price to be uplifted by 12 per cent per annum.</para><para>On 19 December 2000 the minister signed off on key documentation, including the companies' constitutions and the statutory funding agreement covering the flow of levy funds from the Commonwealth to the company. Wool growers' reaction to the company continues to be positive, with over 36,000 wool growers out of approximately 45,000 applying for shares. This represents around 70 per cent of growers paying wool tax to the company at the time of conversion. Australian Wool Services have advised that the share certificates have now been distributed to wool growers, and they are currently awaiting confirmation from the computer share registry that the distribution has been completed. It is worth making the point that there are a number of wool growers who are entitled to shares in Australian Wool Services—both the research and development company and the company that owns the Woolmark—who have not taken up their shares. I understand that Australian Wool Services will shortly be spending some time and energy in directing publicity to those wool growers so that they can take up the shares that they are entitled to. </para><para>The company has contacted 1,500 wool growers for additional information to validate their claims. If they do that, I expect at least another 1,400 wool growers will receive the shares that they are entitled to. I also understand that the AWS chairman, Mr Rodney Price, is currently conducting a public awareness campaign via radio interviews, both on the ABC and in the media generally, to raise awareness in those growers who may be eligible to apply for shares but may not have done so yet. Although the initial call for applications for shares in the company closed last year, the legislation allows the Australian Wool Services company to still be able to issue shares during a six-month truing up period. Growers who are eligible are encouraged to contact the company directly. I make very clear to wool growers who have paid wool tax over the period of three years until 30 June 2000 that they are entitled to shares in both the company that owns the Woolmark Company and the intellectual property and in the research and development company.</para><para>Together with the very successful privatisation of Woolstock, the privatisation of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation has gone a considerable way to bringing Australian wool marketing up to date. It has been a most difficult 10 years for wool growers. Despite all the problems that have occurred over the last 10 years, wool is still our second largest primary industry export after wheat, but more importantly it spreads its tentacles much further than any other primary industry because it tends to impact on a number of others. The reason for that is that so much of Australia is ideally suited to wool production. If the wool price is up, that takes pressure off the fat lamb market, off the beef market and off the grain industry. For that reason, to see the wool market proceeding forward, admittedly from a very low base, is very welcome news not only for wool growers but for other primary producers and for regional Australia generally. </para><para>Many of the country towns that all of us who live outside the metropolitan areas know and love were based originally on wool production, and then wool and wheat production. It was an industry that really developed this country. We all understand the folklore attached to the wool industry, not only on this side of politics but on the other side of politics as well. The modern Labor Party came out of the shearers strike of the 1890s. It has been a difficult 10 years, but the privatisation of Woolstock and now the privatisation of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation is good news for wool growers. It is also good news for regional Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Disabled Peoples Incorporated</title><page.no>23005</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>23005</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to speak tonight about a small group of people who gain little recognition yet do so much for their community of Whyalla, and it is right that I raise the work of these people at this time, with 2001 being the Year of the Volunteer. It is right that as a nation we pay tribute to all those volunteers who help our nation sparkle on the world stage at events such as the Olympics and the Paralympics. It is right that we pay tribute to those volunteers who continually serve the community as firefighters, ambulance officers, emergency services workers, air-sea rescue and the like. It is right too that we pay tribute to and honour those who volunteer to work with the poor, the sick and the oppressed in overseas countries. It is right for me tonight to bring to your attention and put on the record the work of this small group of Whyalla volunteers who have done, and are doing, so much for their community. The group I refer to is Disabled Peoples Inc., commonly known as DPI. </para></talk.start><para>The concept adopted by DPI embodies the very best in Australian culture: Aussies committed to helping Aussies because they care. DPI is a nonprofit association run by volunteers. The association has a management committee which is responsible for the overall policy making decisions and the day-to-day running of the services. The services are divided into two sections, one being the transport section and the other being the respite service at Amaroo Lodge for the elderly. Both services are closely integrated to ensure the best possible service for the client group.</para><para>DPI have a team of over 50 volunteers who cover all of the association's operations. As the request for accommodation increases at Amaroo Lodge, DPI have engaged five casual workers to assist in the running of the respite centre, along with three casual cooks. This means that the services are covered in the event of some volunteers not being available at certain times due to daytime or shift work arrangements. DPI attempt to employ people with some form of disability who may not have the skills to gain employment in the broader community but whose caring skills are of a great assistance to the association.</para><para>Apart from the aforementioned casual employees, the rest of the DPI services are managed by volunteers who receive no remuneration for their services. It is important to note here that DPI is completely free from political and religious influences. DPI Transport Services started in November 1982, when a few people came together to set as their goal the introduction of a transport service to meet the needs of people with disabilities. Within a month the group had grown to over 26 members. Today DPI has over 300 members in Whyalla. In 1984, the DPI was lent an old bus, which it shared with the St John Ambulance service for two days a week. Since those early days, DPI has purchased 22 vehicles, of which 21 have been purchased without any financial assistance from any government agency. With the most recent vehicle, the association was fortunate enough to gain a $20,000 grant from the state government. It cost the association a further $25,000 to have the vehicle converted with lifting ramps, seat modifications and the other things necessary to transport disabled people.</para><para>It is estimated that, since the start of DPI's operations in 1982, they have completed over 200,000 single vehicle trips. These trips include door-to-door transport to shops, doctors, hospital, social events and trips to Adelaide and Melbourne. The cost of joining DPI is only $11 per year. The cost of a single journey is $3 for a trip in and around Whyalla, where the taxi service would cost some $8.50 to $10. DPI operate their normal services Monday to Friday and are available for evening and weekend work if required and if the volunteers are available. There are six vehicles in the fleet, some of which are modified for wheelchair and disability access.</para><para>In cooperation with the Whyalla Hospital, DPI operate the dialysis machine service for Whyalla people needing treatment at Port Augusta Hospital three days a week: Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Recently they have been taking elderly people whose partners may be in hospital or in care facilities in the country towns surrounding the district to visit these partners. They can be as far as 300 or 400 kilometres away from the city of Whyalla. This is a new project, and the domiciliary services and the association see an expansion of such services, provided they can obtain some funding to operate the vehicles. The need is certainly there for that to occur. The only financial help DPI receive is $3,600 a year from Home and Community Care towards petrol costs which amount to about $12,000 a year. In their 19 years of operation, they have not been involved in a single accident involving any of their members.</para><para>Another service offered by Disabled Peoples Inc. is that of Amaroo Lodge. Amaroo Lodge was opened in November 1993 to serve the needs of elderly people and people with disabilities living in Whyalla. Amaroo Lodge was formerly a motel facility in the city.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—A very good place—I have visited it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>009D2</name.id><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name></talker><para>—Thank you. I tend to agree with you. There are no board members or shareholders. The facility is run entirely by a management committee of volunteers. DPI receive no funding of any kind from either state governments or the federal government for this service. The funding needed to operate the facility comes from residents' accommodation charges, fundraising and community donations. To my knowledge there is no other such facility in Australia that operates in the same manner.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Every item of furniture and bedding, curtains, sheets, towels, et cetera, and all the cooking equipment, and everything that is required to run such an establishment, has been purchased by the management committee. This has been done by fundraising, donations and a lot of hard work by the people concerned. DPI took over an empty shell of a building in 1993 and today they operate a homely and caring establishment that is appreciated by all who live there and those families who have relatives in the facility.</para><para>Amaroo Lodge provides good accommodation for elderly people who live alone and without family support and who cannot manage to do those daily chores such as cooking, cleaning and shopping but who are not in need of any form of nursing care. DPI hold a licence as a supported residential facility and not a licence for a nursing home and, therefore, do not employ nursing staff. In spite of their age and disabilities, Amaroo Lodge residents move around the facility and the community at a pace of their choosing and with dignity and independence. DPI do not provide any personal care but such care, if needed, can be provided by various community services such as domiciliary care, nursing associations and the like.</para><para>Since their opening in 1993 they have accommodated over 150 residents at no cost to either the federal government or state governments and I believe that they have saved such governments millions of dollars. This has been achieved by not receiving $1 in grants and providing a service that keeps such people out of the over-stretched hospital system. Madam President, I see that my time has all but expired.

This is an area of precious wilderness in the western part of Sydney which is at risk of residential and commercial development. A public meeting is being held this coming Sunday, 1 April to fight for this nearly 200 hectares of the former Australian Defence Industries site to try to protect it from sale and from inappropriate development. As with any area of wilderness and environmental value, it is always important to try to prevent inappropriate development occurring. But I think in this particular area it is even more important. It is about time that governments at state and federal levels followed their own environmental legislation in relation to this site. Governments around the country—and certainly in New South Wales and at the federal level—are trying to portray themselves to the electorate as environmentally responsible. At the same time they go ahead and pass legislation exactly opposite to what they brag about in press releases and TV ads. </para></talk.start><para>This particular site in Western Sydney is quite unique. It contains about a quarter of the last remaining native ecosystems in Western Sydney. However, only six per cent of the site's original native vegetation coverage remains and a quarter of the known 190 plant species are rare or vulnerable. It is the last place that many native animals are found on the Cumberland Plain. The development proposal, ironically, would see the end of emus on Emu Plains. Instead of preserving this site, governments want to open up these precious woodlands, wilderness and native areas to accommodate urban population increases. It is particularly unfortunate that the first vegetative native species to be placed on the threatened species list—the Cumberland Plain woodland—is under threat from the New South Wales government, the same government that put it on that threatened species list in the first place. </para><para>It gets to a stage at which the community despairs of the growing and endless hypocrisy of governments in the area of development—you get regular statements about caring for the environment but at the same time processes go ahead that will inevitably result in destruction of that environment. There is no surer outcome in relation to the sale and redevelopment of this land than that it will be used for inappropriate development and that it will inevitably result in significant environmental destruction. I think people around the country—not just people from New South Wales or Sydney—would be clearly aware of the immense environmental consequences of the massive population spread over the last few decades. Enabling that to go unchecked in one of these few remaining areas is clearly grossly irresponsible. No-one can say that they do not realise what is going to happen if they allow this process to go ahead. Clearly, at the moment unfortunately governments are going to allow it to happen nonetheless.</para><para>It shows the importance of ensuring that, if the government no longer has a need for sites—whether Defence Force, Defence Industries or other government owned sites—for the original purpose for which they were used, those sites can be used in a socially and environmentally responsible way in the future. In this chamber, we had the rare opportunity—which, thankfully, the Senate grasped—in the debate on the Sydney Harbour Defence Force lands of ensuring that Defence Force lands were protected from future sale and were protected from inappropriate use. In the situation at St Marys, we have not been able to guarantee that and, unless the community can come to the rescue and bring its will to bear on this situation, we will see another inappropriate outcome and further environmental destruction.</para><para>I wish to briefly address the crucial issue of global warming and climate change and the strange but nonetheless very disturbing comments by government ministers—particularly Senator Minchin and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer. Minister Downer supports the backflip of the US President, who is backing away from attempts to introduce some minimal controls on carbon emissions. The US President made a decision not to regulate the carbon dioxide emissions of power plants, which reversed a pledge that the President made during the presidential campaign. He promised to set mandatory reduction targets for carbon dioxide. It is bad enough that the leader of the largest industrialised nation on earth has chosen to back away so quickly from that crucial pledge, but it is even more appalling that the Australian government has chosen to support him in that action.</para><para>Minister Minchin came out against emissions trading, saying that it is an extremist position, it is alarming and it would be devastating for the Australian economy, despite the fact that the government's own Australian Greenhouse Office has established a panel of experts to try and put forward proposals for the best way to go in relation to domestic emission trading systems. An emission trading subcommittee has been established under the Council of Australian Governments high-level group on greenhouse—again, to try and figure out the best way forward with emissions trading—yet we have the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources openly canning the whole concept as being a hugely damaging one.</para><para>The issue of climate change is incredibly urgent and, as every single piece of further scientific evidence comes forward, it is also clearly incredibly serious and more and more alarming. Yet we have statements repeated at the federal level and all other levels of government that try to get in the way of concrete action to address this crucial issue. Just a couple of weeks ago, Senator Minchin said that, if the greenhouse issue is to be effectively addressed, something has to be done about constraining emissions from developing countries. That is nice to know and is something that people would not disagree with. It is important to try and constrain emissions from developing countries. But you do not try and do that by doing nothing at all about constraining emissions from developed countries, from industrialised nations, yet that is what we have seen from this government and, unfortunately, from the US government. These governments are backing each other up in trying to prevent any constructive global action or local action in relation to this crucial issue. Even the Canadian government, who—in broad diplomatic terms—Australia and the US have been in cahoots with in trying to prevent constructive action on greenhouse issues, has criticised President Bush for what he has done in the last week or so. Yet Australia is still slavishly following the US on this issue and, I fear, even without the US lead, would still be dragging the chain more than virtually any other country on earth. </para><para>It is worth while to look at the comprehensive range of recommendations put forward by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee on greenhouse issues—the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">The heat is on: Australia's greenhouse future—inquiry into global warming</inline>—which, among a whole range of other things, spoke about the importance of an emissions trading regime as one step, not even the biggest step, towards reducing our emissions and trying to make some impact on Australia's appalling performance. Even if we are talking pure economics, it is worth emphasising that, if we do not do something about this issue now, Australia—apart from any other nation—will have to pay a huge economic price down the track. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Political Parties</title><page.no>23008</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>23008</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak on a topic that is rarely spoken about in this chamber, which is rather strange, given that the purpose of this chamber is to be one of the two highest political forums of the nation. The topic I wish to speak on is politics and political parties or, more precisely, the image of political parties. I shall proceed by way of a couple of recent events to illustrate how the image of political parties can have nothing to do with the reality of the same political parties.</para></talk.start><para>Last weekend, the Queensland division of the National Party took what the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> called `two difficult but proper decisions' that will help it retain its place as the dominant political party in rural Queensland. The first decision was to put the One Nation party last in its Senate preferences at the next election. The second decision was to re-endorse Senator Ron Boswell in the No. 1 spot on its Senate ticket. These are important decisions not only for the National Party but also for Australia. The National Party should be congratulated for making them and Senator Boswell should be congratulated not only for his reindorsement but also for his courageous and successful efforts to persuade his party to stand by its proud history of serving the people in rural and regional Australia and its even prouder history of having helped lead Australia to greatness on the world stage as a trading nation.</para><para>I used the word greatness, and it is true. Today we sometimes forget that it was the National Party, under the leadership of the late John McEwen, that helped develop Australia into, proportionate to our population size, one of the most powerful trading nations and one of the most outward looking nations of the world. Since 1996, in coalition the National Party has again helped to repair much of the damage done to rural and regional Australia during the preceding decades due to the Labor government's neglect—neglect that has bred the kind of discontent that unscrupulous opportunists, typified by the One Nation Party, will seek to fan and use to seduce for their own aggrandisement. This kind of unscrupulousness Mrs Pauline Hanson demonstrated on the weekend, when she warned the voters of Queensland about the dangers of giving government to the Labor Party at the next election, because, if she did not get her way, she would direct preferences to the Labor Party. What a contradiction! However, that is Mrs Hanson.</para><para>As far as the National Party is concerned, I am enormously reassured by the fact that Senator Boswell and the National Party will stand as a bulwark against unprincipled opportunists, such as the One Nation Party represents, at the next election. Here, we look at the image of a party which is supposed to be conservative and which is denigrated as conservative by the Labor Party, and yet it has the courage—which the Queensland Labor Party, at a state election, did not have—to stand up against One Nation.</para><para>Now let me turn to a political party image of a different kind. One of the images which the Labor Party has laboured to acquire for itself is that it is supposed to be the party for the ethnic communities of Australia. It is supposed to be a party that promotes multiculturalism and ethnic diversity in politics. How does this image fit reality? Let me tell you the story of a Chinese Australian member of the Australian Labor Party, a man who has given faithful and loyal service to the Labor Party for 30 years, who is nevertheless a man who is not afraid to speak his own mind and to make his own decisions according to his own beliefs, which does not make him popular within the Labor Party. Nevertheless, he is a member with 30-plus years of service.</para><para>I have the privilege of knowing Robert Chong and have worked with him—in spite of our political differences—as a community advocate. I admire his persistence and his integrity, which are not often found in the party that he prefers to belong to. But I do value his contributions as a community worker and advocate and also as a representative with political interests in the Chinese community. Robert Chong is a councillor of the city of Whitehorse, a suburban municipality in Melbourne that includes the suburbs of Box Hill and Nunawading—what we might describe as middle Melbourne. </para><para>Like many other Chinese Australians who came to Australia in the sixties, Robert came as a student from Malaysia who, after obtaining tertiary qualifications, stayed on and became Australian by choice. He developed an interest in politics while he was still at university and joined the Labor Party then. As I said before, he served it loyally as a thinking member. Robert worked for the Australian Defence Organisation as a senior civilian staff member. He also developed his political interests as a community advocate for the multicultural community.</para><para>Four years ago he successfully stood for the council in the city of Whitehorse in an area which is predominantly mainstream Australian. He stood as an independent Labor candidate and not only got himself elected but also helped the endorsed Labor candidate to be elected. He served the council well and he served the community well. Three years later, in the year 2000, he was re-elected against a challenge by another sitting member, who came across the boundary thinking that he might be able to knock Robert off, because Robert was serving in a mainly Anglo-Australian area. But he lost; Robert won again. </para><para>With four out of 10 councillors, the Whitehorse City Council has been, if not a Labor controlled council, then at least a Labor dominated council. By this year, every one of the four Labor councillors except Robert Chong has served a term as mayor. One would have thought that 2001 would be Robert's turn to be mayor—the first Asian Australian to serve as mayor in middle Melbourne. In his four years on the council, Robert Chong has been easily one of the best performing members of the Whitehorse City Council. He is well known in the community; he is well regarded in the community. He could have stood for mayoral office before but has stood aside in favour of his Labor colleagues. This year should have been his turn, surely. </para><para>Two of the non-Labor councillors pledged their support. The local papers, a week before the election, anointed him as a shoo-in. When the vote was counted, Robert Chong had polled three out of 10 votes. The two non-Labor councillors had delivered their votes—one an Australian Democrat and one an Australian Green. Only the three votes from Robert's Labor colleagues were missing. What does this tell us of the difference between image and reality? When the numbers were counted, the Labor Party's votes were missing. When the crunch came, the chardonnay set of the Labor Party could not stomach the thought of an Asian Australian mayor in middle Melbourne. When the line was drawn, the Labor Party was on the wrong side. The image does not fit reality.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Which council are you talking about?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>86Y</name.id><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name></talker><para>—The Whitehorse City Council in Melbourne.

His unqualified medical diagnosis was provided on 6 March during speeches in the second reading debate on appropriation bills Nos. 3 and 4. Mr Latham's assertions included that I have abused my parliamentary entitlements, am a person of unfit character to hold a parliamentary office and am sick and in need of help. Mr Latham's attack incorrectly confuses my concerns about sex offences against children with the private affairs of consenting adults. </para></talk.start><para>I am unaware of the context from which Mr Latham drew his abusive outburst; however, if his diagnosis that I am sick and unfit for a parliamentary office is based on my concerns for the safety our children and the protection of our children's inalienable rights to unconditional protection and safe passage through their years of innocence and my relentless pursuit of zero tolerance to predators who traffic in children and their images for sex, then thank God Mr Latham is not my doctor! Maybe his outburst was because I have concerns with the devastating legacy of an acquaintance of Mr Latham—an acquaintance who is a former New South Wales Law Society President who has had two judgments against him in the District Court of New South Wales, before Judges Coorey and Taylor, for child sex offences and has admitted under oath to being a drug taker, giving a false name upon arrest, having sex with numerous dysfunctional destitute clients and inciting a witness to alter expert medical evidence to mislead court proceedings. Maybe it was because I believe this solicitor should be struck off. </para><para>Maybe it was because I believe the Law Society and Bar Association in New South Wales are at grave risk of a loss of public confidence, and there is a mountain of evidence to support the view that sections of the legal, judicial, parliamentary and religious institutions of New South Wales are compromised and guilty of turning a blind eye. Maybe it was because I think the Wood royal commission, constrained by its charter, failed to address the issues surrounding crimes of sexual offences against children. Maybe it was because I think predators and not the victims of child sexual abuse should be the point of shame and that these victims whose lifestyle often leads to the street, drugs and suicide should have political access and stronger advocacy. Maybe it was because I believe that a judge who has come to the attention of the Child Protection Enforcement Agency in New South Wales, whose file—in the words of the Wood royal commission—`was mismanaged and its contents lost', fails the test of judicial legitimacy and should not sit in judgment on people charged with sex offences against children.</para><para>Maybe it was because I think the screening of predators in our government agencies and religious institutions, including the ordination process, has been a breathtaking failure and produced protected enclaves of child abusers—so starkly highlighted by Father Usher in the Wood royal commission. On page 1,000 of the final report, <inline font-style="italic">Volume 5, Paedophilia inquiry</inline>, at section 11.34 `Celibacy', Father Usher says: </para><quote><para>... there has been a widely held belief that the vow of celibacy has been confined to heterosexual relations involving penetration and did not extend, for example, to acts of indecency or encounters with boys, or adolescent males. Clergy might see it as a moral wrong, but not define it as a serious sexual offence or as a breach of the vow of celibacy.</para></quote><para>The commission concludes:</para><quote><para>... this has the traditional overtones of paedophilia minimisation and distortion in cognitive thinking.</para></quote><para>If Mr Latham or anyone else for that matter thinks abuse, threats and intimidation will weaken my resolve to end the code of silence on all these issues and protect our children from people who think it is a perk of office to have sex with children, they will be sadly disappointed. I would like to read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a response to my last speech, which is quite different from Mr Latham's reaction. The letter says:</para><quote><para>Dear Senator Heffernan,</para><para>Your exposure of the law's inadequacies in parliament was a wonderful community service and I thank you for picking up the ball and running with it. Much work is still to be done to expose how poorly sexual assault victims are dealt with. I am the mother of sons who were sexually abused, to the point that at the age of 9 one son had to undergo a sphincterectomy due to this abuse. During this operation it was discovered that his anus had prolapsed due to repeated forcible dilation. I have been attempting to have his named perpetrators, the DOCS and education department people who covered up his original disclosures brought to justice since the police royal commission in New South Wales. No charges have ever been laid. The CSC has recently sent selected documentation to ICAC but have omitted much of the strongest evidence. Mr Carr has since had the CSC investigations halted. After three years of investigation from the Ombudsman's Office, Mr Bruce Barber, finally intervened and asked for an investigation as to why no interviews and charges have ever been laid in relation to this. I am awaiting the police report on that, but do not expect results, as everyone seems more content to cover up the misgivings of the system than expose them. Is there any way you will be able to assist me in exposing what has occurred in our case?</para><para>Sincerely,</para><para>Karlene Connolly</para></quote></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Political Climate</title><title>Rural Field Days</title><page.no>23011</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Rural Field Days</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>23011</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to make a couple of points on the adjournment. First of all, in regard to the remarks made by Senator Heffernan, I accept that he has a very strong view on all of those matters that he has raised on child abuse—so do all of us. I note that he made a strong attack on the New South Wales Law Association and Bar Council for not being more diligent in dealing with a number of members of their profession. I agree with him that the profession should take action. I hope the profession also takes action in dealing with QCs in New South Wales who apparently deliberately arrange their financial affairs to consistently go bankrupt so that they avoid paying tax but are able to live very comfortably and earn a large amount of money.</para></talk.start><para>But that was not the real reason I wanted to speak tonight on the adjournment. I have recently made in various speeches in the Senate remarks about the political climate in Australia over the last six weeks. It is all on the record now that in three different elections—two state elections and one federal by-election—there has been a remarkable change in the perception of where the present government of Australia, led by John Howard, stands.</para><para>I have been involved in politics now for a long time—I have spent over 30 years in the Labor Party—and I have to say I have never seen such a reaction in what are traditionally conservative areas of Australia whereby the population are taking the decision at the ballot box to express their displeasure about the present federal government and state coalition governments. Since the federal election of 1996, there have been numerous state elections, another federal election and territory elections. At every election since 1996, the Liberal Party and the National Party vote has gone down. There has not been one election since 1996, the high water mark for the Liberal Party and the coalition, when they have done other than lost votes. I think that indicates that as time goes on the Australian people realise that the Liberal Party has not been able to offer a relaxed and comfortable future. I think Australians are also realising that the ideology of the Liberal Party is not offering them the vision of security for their families in the years ahead.</para><para>We have seen in results the Labor Party winning electorates that have not been held by Labor for a very long time, if at all. The by-election in Ryan has seen the seat go to the Labor Party with nearly a 10 per cent swing. That seat has never been held by the Labor Party before. There are state seats in Queensland which the Labor Party have never held but which now they do. The state seat of Burnett has never been held by the Labor Party and, in a straight contest between Labor and the National Party, the Labor Party candidate won by a margin of a couple of per cent. That is an astonishing result when you consider the nature and background of that seat.</para><para>We from the Labor Party want to make it clear that, although we recognise that there is real angst in the community against the present government, we are not about trying to win government on the basis of the mistakes of the Howard government. They speak for themselves. What we will be about over the next six months is putting forward a broad range of policies to show the Australian people that the Labor Party is capable of governing this country in a civilised and proactive way and will give people a real opportunity to participate in a positive way about their lives and their contributions to the community. The narrowmindedness of the present government and its attitude towards public life will be rejected.</para><para>I want to conclude my remarks on an aspect that does not often get recognised here in the parliament, although it is occasionally spoken about—that is, in rural communities, despite economic circumstances and some difficulties, there is still a very strong commitment by people to their community. This, as I have seen in my own state, is demonstrated by the success of the community-run field days at Cleve, Paskeville and Lucindale and in the Riverland. On Friday a week ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Lucindale field day in the south-east of South Australia. What struck me, first of all, was that the field day was organised by the small town of Lucindale as a community venture. It was extremely well organised with a range of exhibits, stands, expositions, et cetera, running to close to 400. I spent six hours there and I think I had the chance to see about a quarter of what was on display. </para><para>But what particularly struck me as I walked around and saw all those exhibits was that so many of them were of ordinary Australians in regional and rural Australia starting their own businesses, developing products and selling them in the Australian community. I saw at that field day, as I did last year at Cleve, many more Australian businesses manufacturing and making products and selling them within the Australian community. They were innovative, good ideas made by practical people and sold to the local community. They had the best local value adding, the best local import replacement and even, in many cases, the best exporting you would wish to see.</para><para>One feature that particularly stood out at Lucindale that I would note is the number of small businesses in the clothing manufacturing area, usually run by women from small country towns and rural areas who have taken the bit between their teeth and are designing, manufacturing and selling a range of good quality Australian clothing that is competitive—because of its quality and design—with any that is produced by larger, mainly overseas, companies. They were employing people at the local level to do so.</para><para>I think that if more people from the cities, including me—although I grew up on a dairy farm—could visit these field days and see what regional and rural Australia is doing to help itself, that would end some of the misconceptions that may be around at the moment. I congratulate Reg Hocking and the Lucindale committee that run and manage the Lucindale field day. They do a great job not only for their local community but for rural and regional Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Political Climate</title><page.no>23013</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>23013</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I feel obliged to respond to Senator Schacht's short adjournment speech because he says that he has drawn on all his experience over 30 years in politics to come up with what is to be expected—a Labor victory at the next election.

If the Labor Party really want a proper analysis of politics—and they will need it because we are in real-time election time now—they cannot rely on the Senator Schachts of this world. They need someone—as we do on this side—to step back and not look through the prism that Senator Schacht, who has grown up in the whole culture of the Labor Party, has never, ever stepped outside of.

This government is only too aware of the messages being sent by the electorate, and we are very flexible in our policy approaches and we are listening. I could go through all that, but I just want to talk about political analysis at the moment. Under any analysis, we are not in that Whitlam-Keating landslide atmosphere at all. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Take the signal of the Whitlam landslide—the Bass by-election.

No doubt there was a lot of anger from those Ryan traditional voters and, quite frankly, why shouldn't there be? If you have a by-election six months out from a general election, you will get a strong reaction, and that makes up a great deal of the Ryan backlash against this government. If you enshrine that as symbolic of a coming landslide for your side, then your political analysis is utterly wrong. I suggest you pick up the paper tomorrow and read the Newspoll.

There are messages to be read—there is not doubt about that—but, as you should know, Senator Schacht, there was far more to the Queensland election than just a federal vote. There was a divided conservative vote. On top of that there were something like five choices in an optional preferential system and, what is more, the National Party—the dominant party in Queensland—was split within its own preference ranks. You only have to look over the weekend to see that the Queensland National Party made a very firm and strong decision to support Senator Boswell and the direction of preferences, so we are not going to get the same Queensland situation that unfortunately its leader, Mr Bob Borbidge, had to endure. It was a terrible mistake by the Queensland National Party, which had an enormous effect on the vote in the last week. Therefore, do not try to read too much into that in regard to the federal sphere, Senator Schacht.</para><para>Senator Schacht, you mercifully did not take up all your time, so therefore I will sit down and save a few minutes. I was at the Lardner field day over the weekend. I think that is one of the biggest field days at least in Victoria, if not in Australia. They are great weekend events because not only did the National Party have a tent—we were at the front, at the coalface listening to the people—but also they display and show off all the produce and machinery of rural and regional areas. I see my colleague George Brandis taking notes. I invite him also to stand up if he has anything to say about Senator Schacht's comments.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 10.52
