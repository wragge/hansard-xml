The application is for approval for seismic work, not for drilling. What this government has said is that, in accordance with the law, if such an application is made, then it must be assessed. I determined, as the honourable senator will know, that it triggers the Commonwealth environment protection legislation, and I further decided that there would have to be a full environmental impact study. Whether the applicant will proceed with that study, I do not know—that is for the applicant to decide. But, if the applicant does, it will obviously be thoroughly analysed in accordance with the obligations that are upon the Australian environment minister under the EPBC Act. </para></talk.start></continue><para>So we are talking about an application for seismic work some 50 kilometres beyond the world heritage area—not for drilling but for seismic work.

There is further good news here, and I would like to share this with the Senate. Under the Howard government, real wages have grown by an average of 2.4 per cent a year—a mighty improvement on the 0.4 per cent annual growth which occurred under the previous government. As Senator George Campbell has pointed out in an important article, in some years under the previous government real wages actually fell. </para></talk.start><para>Combined with the growth in real wages, Australian families received a $12 billion cut in income tax last year and home mortgage rates are at almost record lows. All this means that Australian families have more money in their pay packets than they ever had under the previous government. They have more money to spend on education, more money to spend on their children and more money for living expenses. We simply cannot afford to go back to the Labor days of high taxes, high interest rates and low growth of the Australian economy.</para><para>All these gains have been made possible because this government has been a responsible manager of the economy and has made Australia the fastest growing economy in the industrialised world in the March quarter. Everyone knows the economy is going well. Even the Labor Party knows it, but Mr Crean and Mr Beazley cannot admit it and they are still running around the country frantically trying to talk down the economy. We in the coalition have been saying that we are sick of them trying to talk down the economy; the Australian people are sick of it. Even the Premier of Victoria, Mr Bracks, has pointed out that the Victorian economy is going particularly well. There was an important statement in the press today. Finally, a Labor frontbencher has said that he or she is sick of the Labor Party trying to talk down the economy. An anonymous ALP frontbencher was reported in today's <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> as saying:</para><quote><para>The less you see of Simon [Crean] whining about economics, the better.</para></quote><para>I do not know whether that was Senator Cook; he is very famous for certain quotes, so it may well have been Senator Cook. But there is a frontbencher who is in charge of the smallest faction of the Labor Party—the truth in policy faction. Was it Senator Stephen Conroy? The fact is: what this shows is that the Labor Party are once again split; they are in a total shambles. Whatever happened to rollback? They are not allowed to even mention that word. Last year Mr Beazley said that the ALP would not be moving a millimetre on rollback plans. That was a year ago.

It is another area of stark contrast. We had 13 years of inaction by Labor on the environment and we have no policies from them in opposition on the environment. In contrast, the Howard government has established an outstanding record in leading and supporting the national effort to restore and protect our natural environment. We delivered in full on our election commitments to establish the Natural Heritage Trust, to provide funding support to community groups around Australia to work on local environmental projects. Already the trust has invested almost $1.2 billion in more than 10,000 locally based projects across Australia, and we have also committed a further $1 billion to continue the trust's work. As I said, by contrast, the Labor Party can only carp in opposition— they have no policies—and continuously oppose the Natural Heritage Trust, which has delivered sound on-ground outcomes in over 10,500 projects. The Labor Party furthermore refuse to give any undertaking to continue the commitment of the extra $1 billion the Howard government has made towards this invaluable work.</para></talk.start><para>In addition to our investments through the trust we have shown national leadership by encouraging better environmental practices through the taxation system. In 1997-98 we introduced a landcare rebate to assist primary producers on low incomes to invest in works for sustainable land and water management. In July of last year, gifts of over $5,000 to eligible organisations became tax deductible. This included land for conservation purposes, for the first time in this country's history. At the same time testamentary gifts became capital gains tax exempt, a move which encourages donations of land for conservation through wills. In June of this year we announced further changes to capital gains tax rules to benefit landowners who accept a payment for entering into a perpetual conservation covenant. Landowners will face a reduced tax liability for payments they receive in return for putting parts of their property under a conservation covenant. In some instances the tax liability will be zero. </para><para>Last night the Prime Minister announced a new environmental philanthropic measure. The government will amend the income tax law to provide land-holders who donate land for conservation purposes by entering into a conservation covenant with an income tax deduction. All of these measures reflect the government's commitment to supporting better land management practices in Australia. So if a farmer nearing retirement is prepared to donate land for conservation purposes, the value of that land becomes a tax deduction. If a younger farmer is prepared to dedicate part of his or her land for conservation purposes, the reduction in the value of the land becomes a tax deduction. These are real incentives to allow better environmental outcomes across the country, to enable partnerships to be built between government and farmers, delivering sound economic outcomes in terms of more profitable agriculture while at the same time supporting better conservation outcomes across Australia.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting: Zimbabwe</title><page.no>26212</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>26212</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

We are particularly disturbed at continuing reports of attacks on farmers and farm workers and of politically related violence, which is having a damaging effect on stability and safety in parts of the country. I can advise the Senate that Mr Downer has communicated in strong terms the government's increasing concern about the situation in Zimbabwe to the Zimbabwe High Commissioner to Australia.

It is true that producing LNG in Australia does produce greenhouse gases, but in so producing LNG you are producing a clean fuel for use in countries like Japan and China which have much more potentially significant greenhouse problems than we do. We are producing clean fuels for those countries, albeit that in producing them in Australia there is an emissions issue. </para><para>We gave those companies—in particular, those on the North West Shelf—the sorts of assurances they needed in relation to future policy in this country that we will not unduly inhibit the competitiveness of Australian industries like our great LNG industry. That has given them the confidence to commit to over $2 billion worth of investments in building a fourth train in Western Australia and the associated gas infrastructure. So we are quite unabashed in saying that we are not going to do anything to destroy the competitiveness of great Australian industries in order to achieve our Kyoto protocol commitments, which we believe we can do—unlike those opposite, who are prepared to risk the jobs of thousands of people in manufacturing in this country by the sorts of positions that they are prepared to take on greenhouse gas emissions.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>26214</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

Indeed, in that vein I announced today the allocation of $155 million under the government's major national research facilities program, which was part of our $3 billion Backing Australia's Ability initiative announced in January this year by the Prime Minister.

In between talking about rolling back the GST or, on the other hand, saying that the priority is health or education, there is something apparently called Knowledge Nation that Mr Beazley sometimes refers to, but we simply have no idea from all of this plethora and endless diatribe from Mr Beazley what his policies for science really are. He has had 5½ years in opposition to develop a policy. He had to find Barry Jones a job after they dumped him from the ALP national presidency, so they sent him off to write a report. We saw the noodle nation outcome from that endeavour, but there is still no policy from Labor. This noodle nation report was one of the great all-time debacles for an opposition and a real own goal by Mr Beazley. It was such a disaster that he actually admitted on radio earlier this month that: `If it hadn't been for that little design of Barry's'—as he referred to that monstrosity—`it would have been talked about for one day and disappeared.' What an incredible indictment of your own document—that you reckon it would have completely disappeared in one day had you not put in that nonsensical diagram. We understand Mr Beazley's office tried desperately to exclude it from the document, but Barry Jones said, `No, if there's no diagram, there's no document at all.' Now we are expected to believe that Mr Beazley actually wanted that diagram in the document to make sure it lasted more than one day. It is the most extraordinary, convoluted and idiotic presentation I have ever seen. </para><para>While we are talking about Mr Beazley and his commitment to science, this is a great opportunity for Mr Beazley—while scientists are in the parliament— to finally have the guts to say where he stands on the new replacement research reactor for Australia, one of our most important pieces of scientific infrastructure, when two of his shadow ministers say they are happy to repudiate a contract which was legitimately entered into. We have two shadow ministers saying that they will turf it out. We never hear anything from Mr Beazley on this very important issue. The lives and livelihoods of 800 scientists and fellow workers are at stake, but still we hear nothing about where he stands on that critically important issue. By cutting revenue with roll-back and by increasing spending on health and education, Labor has only one way to go if it is to fund its commitments to Knowledge Nation, whatever they may be, and that is by raising income taxes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Imports: Cooked Chicken Meat</title><page.no>26217</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>26217</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Alston, representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.

The electoral roll is a document fundamental to our democratic system. As such, it should be valued by all Australians and not be used as a political plaything for partisan purposes. It is a tragedy, therefore, that Labor Party careerists, in their unseemly scramble for office, have seen fit to compromise the roll's integrity and corrupt its spirit. Presenting identification at the time of enrolment was one of the key provisions of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Act (No. 1) 1999.

Senator Faulkner, in his childish outbursts, you will recall has said on a number of occasions that it was paranoia on the part of this government to want integrity of the electoral roll.

That is because that is the way that the Labor Party have been using the electoral roll, especially in Queensland. So much for Labor's commitment to universal suffrage. They only want Labor people on the electoral roll because they do not believe in everybody being on the electoral roll. They see the electoral roll as a plaything for the Labor Party, for them to put Labor people on it in appropriate electorates.</para><para>I am sure that the new senator, John Cherry, who is not currently with us, would have a very good understanding of the need for some degree of identification to ensure that enrolment on the electoral roll has some integrity.

The reason I am seeking those answers at this time is that they are relevant to the circumstances surrounding the loss of the fishing boat the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret J </inline>and three lives in Bass Strait in April this year. I have been seeking answers to these questions so that those answers could be considered as part of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquiry into the role of Australian Search and Rescue in the search for the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret J.</inline> I note the government again used its numbers on the committee to defer this important investigation, but I am still seeking answers to these questions. I wrote to the chair of the committee, Senator Crane, about these questions on 10 August. I also asked that Senator Crane seek an answer to question 3784, which was not outside the 30-day limit but had direct relevance to the inquiry. I copied that letter to Mr Anderson's office on that day. I then, through the committee secretariat, put in a request to AMSA for answers to those questions. In that letter, I also sought other material relating to the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret J</inline>, some of which has now been provided. I specifically requested copies of all internal and external emails relating to the lost boat, but they have not been provided. I will continue to pursue that material because it is important that the committee have access to all material held by AMSA or AusSAR relating to the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret J</inline>.</para><para>Question No. 3695 relates to legal opinions provided to both the Department of Transport and Regional Services and the minister, Mr Anderson. My office was advised last Wednesday that the answer to this question had been cleared and would be provided to the table office and a copy faxed to me in Launceston. I was later advised that that answer had in fact not been cleared and would not be available until some time this week. There was a strange discrepancy between those two contacts. The government has in its possession more than one set of legal advices in relation to the Senate inquiry into the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret J</inline>. I am given to understand that the department has legal advice that gives AMSA little or no comfort as far as cooperation with the Senate is concerned. This is in sharp contrast to the legal opinion from Mr Bell QC that AMSA is relying on to protect it from proper scrutiny by this chamber. AMSA was quick to provide the Senate with the Bell legal opinion because it suited the authority to do so; but, in doing so, it removed any basis on which it can deny the Senate access to other legal advice on the same matter.</para><para>That question also goes to the issue of the role of Mr Anderson in this matter. He is, after all, the minister responsible to the parliament for the performance of the Commonwealth search and rescue function. If that search and rescue effort is found wanting, then it is Mr Anderson who should be called to account for that failure in this parliament. However, given that Mr Anderson's profile is not so much low as subterranean in relation to issues such as the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret J</inline>, I do not expect him to act to ensure organisations such as CASA or AMSA do the job required of them by their charter. As far as the transport portfolio is concerned, that administrative oversight falls to this place generally and Senator Crane's committee in particular. Mr Anderson's advice to the CASA board in 1998 said it all. He told the board its job was to ensure that he was not asked any questions in parliament about aviation safety. All he wanted to ensure was that air safety was not the subject of public debate. In contrast, his charter is that we enjoy a safe aviation system in Australia. Self-interest beats public interest yet again. </para><para>Question No. 3696 relates to the search for a yacht off the Queensland coast that commenced on 8 July, and question 3715 relates to a missing motor cruiser called <inline font-style="italic">Just Cruising</inline> that was travelling from Mooloolaba in Queensland to Swansea in New South Wales. The information I am seeking in relation to these two matters relates to the role of both the state authority and Australian Search and Rescue. I want to know—and I am sure my colleagues on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee would also like to know—what level of effort was required by AusSAR of the state authority before it involved itself in those searches. AusSAR was advised by the Tasmanian police that the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret J</inline> was missing on 13 April, and I understand that the police requested that AusSAR take over the search at that time. I am advised that AusSAR told the Tasmanian police it would not take over the search until the state had exhausted its own resources. I want to know whether the same conditions were imposed on the state authorities involved in the search for these vessels as were required of the Tasmanian authorities. I want to know exactly what resources Queensland and/or New South Wales were required to commit to these searches before AusSAR took an interest in the searches. I am further advised that the Tasmanian police search and rescue had exhausted its resources by late on 14 April or early on 15 April and had advised AusSAR accordingly. But, despite the AusSAR advice of 13 April, the authority refused a second request to search the greater Bass Strait area again because it considered the search area to be too large. </para><para>I would like to know—and the answers to question 3696 and 3715 should tell me—exactly what the search area was over the period of the search for the missing yacht and what the search area was over the period of the search for the vessel <inline font-style="italic">Just Cruising</inline>. I also want to know what intelligence was available to AusSAR in relation to the search for the yacht and the cruiser when it took control of, or put resources into, the search effort for those missing boats. I understand that AusSAR told the Tasmanian police on 17 April that, without further information about the whereabouts of the missing fishermen, the search should be abandoned.

AMSA have evidence from very learned counsel, experienced in the law and these matters, who advises AMSA that under no circumstances should they make this material available before the coronial inquiry. There is no attempt to hide anything. All material, all witnesses, all documents and all tape recordings will be produced for the coronial inquiry being held by a Tasmanian coroner. The truth will come out in the appropriate place—at the coroner's inquiry— under cross-examination by every party that wants to be represented at that inquiry.

As of today, 76 remain outstanding—only 26 are in Minister Anderson's portfolio; the remaining 50 are in Minister Macdonald's portfolio. Senator Crane knows full well, as does my colleague here, Senator O'Brien, that these questions are now four weeks out of date. The minister has just been completely derelict in his duty. In fact, the chair of the estimates committee, Senator Crane, wrote to the minister a couple of weeks ago in relation to the outstanding questions. The minister has not even given the estimates committee the courtesy of a response. So here we are, a month late, and 50 questions are outstanding.</para><para>While we are on the subject of Senate estimates hearings, which I have the dubious pleasure, along with Senator O'Brien and Senator Forshaw, of attending, I would like to indicate what happens. For the people of Australia who are listening it is important that I give a few examples of how Senator Macdonald behaves in estimates committees. The most embarrassing moment that I have had in my five years in the federal parliament here in Canberra was when an AFFA officer agreed to give up his night to come along and answer questions in relation to flood mitigation—an issue which is critical to regional Australia and also urban Australia—his attendance having been cleared with the committee through Senator Ferris, and Minister Macdonald refused to allow this official to sit at the table and answer the questions. He made the official go to the back of the room. He refused to allow the official—I do not think Senator Crane was there—the opportunity to answer the questions. As a result of this, we had to put a lot of questions on notice in relation to flood mitigation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

After it was cleared with the Senate estimates committee, the officers involved in the Roads to Recovery program were called to answer questions on Roads to Recovery, which is quite a complicated area and something that the Labor Party were extremely keen to ask a number of questions on. Understand this: the officers involved in Roads to Recovery were there, but Senator Macdonald refused to allow them to come to the table and answer questions. He bluntly refused: `You will not come to the table.' The Labor Party's only response to that was to put the questions on notice. It is a bit rich for the minister to come in here and talk about the cost of questions on notice— when he himself exhibited really rude and appalling behaviour towards officers who do not have the opportunity to defend themselves here in the parliament, which I am doing on their behalf—and to then accuse the Labor Party of costing taxpayers money.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me give you another example. I asked a question in relation to COAG, the regional development ministers meeting that was held in March. I attempted to find the answers to my questions during an estimates hearing, which is the appropriate place. After some interaction, Senator Macdonald said: </para><quote><para>You have been told again the general thrust of the investigatory work being done.

I would also like to take this opportunity to read out what I thought were some absolutely offensive remarks that Senator Macdonald made with regard to the Clerk of the Senate. I am glad that the Clerk of the Senate is actually here. I raised with Senator Macdonald advice from the Clerk of the Senate that he had provided on a request from me in relation to the contract on rural transaction centres—a $6 million contract which we still do not have a copy of. What is in that contract is becoming increasingly questionable; I have some recent information on that. Mr Evans kindly indicated to me that there was no problem with getting the contract.

There are questions on notice about Queensland that we are still waiting on. There are questions on notice about Western Australia that we are still waiting on. They are all about regional programs, and we are still waiting.

In my view, they should have been dealt with very quickly as part of the estimates process, but unfortunately—and I am paraphrasing this very briefly because I want to get to the substance of what I want to say—it became an inquiry. The terms of reference of the inquiry have been put down by the committee I chair, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. When we sought to have hearings, there were two requests. The first one was from AusSAR and the other one was from the Commissioner of Police in Tasmania, both asking that the hearing be deferred until after the coronial inquiry. The committee agreed to that on the understanding that the coronial inquiry was to be completed by August and that we would hear the matters in September. </para><para>As time went past, the coronial inquiry was not completed—in fact, it has not started. We were going to go ahead with those inquiries, but a series of events started yesterday lunchtime which changed the course of events. First of all, I received a phone call from the senior counsel supporting the coroner. On having received that, I said that I would not act on a telephone call but that, if the coroner were to authorise the writing of a letter to the committee, I would take that to the committee. That happened yesterday afternoon at approximately 2 o'clock—maybe a little later. That was then sent to the committee. The part that I want to get to concerns Senator O'Brien. I am very disappointed in the comments that Senator O'Brien made last night. He tried to infer in those comments that the government members of the committee, and me in particular—because he named me—took a political decision in dealing with that. I want to say to the Senate that nothing could be further from the truth; I think it was a very silly comment that Senator O'Brien made last night. </para><para>The facts are that when the coroner asked us to defer the matter until after the coronial inquiry was completed, in my view, and in the view of the government senators, this whole matter was lifted to a much higher level. The insinuation that we were playing politics with this is very disappointing indeed. We met and we discussed the whole issue. Last night—it is absolutely true; it was the government members who voted for it— we determined that we should respect that request. We did it for very simple reasons, and I will read from the letter that I sent to all committee members. In that letter I said:</para><quote><para>The more I have considered this matter, when set against the Committee's terms of reference, the more I am concerned at the likelihood of a Committee of the Senate placing in jeopardy, or prejudicing, the course of the coronial inquiry.</para></quote><para>I go on to say:</para><quote><para>I remain particularly concerned that hearings by the Committee may act to prejudice the rights of the deceased crewmen's families.</para></quote><para>That is why we voted last night for a deferral of this matter. I think it is incredibly important that this goes down straight on the public record. Much has been said with regard to the opinion given to us by the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans. A part of that has been missed out all the time and I want to read that bit from the Clerk into the record, because I think it is absolutely crucial to the position government senators adopted on this. Mr Evans says:</para><quote><para>Conceivably—</para></quote><para>and this is the second half; I can table the whole letter if it is wished—</para><quote><para>this could cause difficulties for the coroner's inquiry. If it became apparent that a witness before the coroner contradicted something said before the committee, it could be submitted to the coroner that the coroner's inquiry could not fairly be completed because of the inability to cross-examine the witnesses on the contradiction, and the coroner might accept such a submission. The coroner would be bound to consider whether the problem was really so great as to be fatal to the whole inquiry.</para><para>The risk of this occurring, however, would appear to me to be fairly small.</para></quote><para>I agree with that. But we, the government senators, were not prepared to take that risk, because the people whom we would have been jeopardising would have been the families of the deceased men. All we did last night was to defer our role in this—no more, no less. We have already had an enormous amount of information given to us that was requested to be kept in camera. But I think it is very important when we are dealing with people who are unfortunately no longer with us that we put at the top of the list of considerations the families of those people. That is what we on the government side did last night.</para><para>The opposition side saw it as an opportunity—and you can read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> yourself—to run the political line. I am very disappointed in that, because, in my nearly 12 years in this Senate, I have never done that on issues such as this, and I do not believe that my colleagues sitting on this side have ever done it. I say that last night Labor Party senators and Senator Cherry from the Democrats made a grave error of judgment. There is nothing that we will not be able to explore by agreeing to the requests of the coroner, and I submit to this chamber that what we did last night as senators of the government was the correct, proper and decent thing to do.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>26228</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Great Barrier Reef</title><page.no>26228</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>26228</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator McLucas today relating to seismic testing near the Great Barrier Reef.</para></motion><para>It is an answer that millions of Australians will find disturbing, and it is an answer that millions of people around the world would find disturbing. It was a clear abdication of responsibility by the environment minister this afternoon when asked about drilling and testing near the Great Barrier Reef. There is no greater national icon than the Great Barrier Reef, and there is no greater responsibility on a national environment minister than to protect the reef. Today in question time Senator Hill failed to live up to that responsibility. What was needed was a clear message about the protection of the reef. What we got from the minister was a range of excuses for his decision to allow an environmental assessment on the proposal for seismic testing near the reef. </para><para>Today in question time Senator Hill left open a very clear and distinct possibility of mining near the Great Barrier Reef. His answer was a series of excuses for his bizarre decision. He claimed that seismic testing was to be nowhere near the reef. It was going to be 50 kilometres away from the reef—and I will get to that in just a few moments. He claimed that what was involved here was only seismic work. But what we are talking about here is 72,000 blasts of air pressure spread over 50 days. He claimed that he had to take this decision under the EPBC legislation. If that is the case and the legislation is flawed, it is the minister's legislation and it should be amended. But what we have here in this context is a situation where minister after minister in Queensland has said that this proposal is not on. The Premier has said that it is not on, so there is no need for the minister to invoke some concern about a Queensland government decision when minister after minister—Beattie, Welford, Wells—has said this proposal is not on. What we have today is a manoeuvre which is part of a sting to allow the testing to go ahead and then to try to put pressure on the Queensland government. That is totally objectionable.</para><para>The Australian public does not want this proposal. It should not be encouraged. Instead of excuses, what we should have got from the minister today was a clear and unequivocal message that this proposal is not on. The company could save their money. The minister should make it clear that there will be no approval in terms of decision making after the seismic testing and the EIS. If we win government and if the Beattie government stays in office, this proposal will not be allowed.</para><para>As I said, the public does not want it.

The Commonwealth government is saying, `Before this matter can be appropriately addressed we need to know the full environmental consequences in order that best judgments can be made.'

The company has been told that if it wants to carry out such seismic work it must satisfy the Commonwealth government that there will be no threat, not only to the reef but also to other values such as marine mammals, migratory birds and the like. If the company wants to proceed with its application it will now have to go through the process of a full environmental assessment study in order to attempt to make its case—the most precautionary option that is open to the Commonwealth government in this regard.

This government instituted the first dugong sanctuaries in the world, and these are already having beneficial effects. Look at what we have done in relation to fishing.

If I have made that mistake, I will correct it. Political leaders in North Queensland are astonished that Senator Hill would countenance such an activity. Even the former One Nation MP for the seat of Thuringowa said that he would be the first person to anchor his boat there and tell them to—he says something different but I will say—go away. He said that he would in fact lead direct action against anything out there. Even Mr Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert, in January of this year said that he was opposed to the company's plans, saying that world oil supplies were running out and it was time for a new approach to energy. He said: `Let's take this opportunity to find an alternative. It's not worth the danger to the reef.' However, this morning on ABC 4QR he changed his tune and said that maybe we should wait and see what the environmental impact assessment process reveals. He has been pulled into line by his bosses. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The other industry that is so important to Queensland, and which this minister should really be adamant about and take note of, is the tourism industry. The tourism industry is the largest industry in Queensland and it is absolutely opposed to any notion of drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. Ecotourism is a very sensitive sector of the tourism market. Perception in that industry is just as important as reality. Perception internationally is that this government is prepared to walk down the path of allowing oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef, on one of the seven wonders of the world. The tourism industry is clearly saying that you cannot do it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>26232</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— We owe Senator McLucas a vote of thanks. She said that during question time today Senator Hill, in answer to Senator McLucas's question, said to her firmly and unequivocally, `No, there will be no drilling.' Senator McLucas just then got up and said, `I don't believe him.' Senator Hill made it very clear that oil drilling is not allowed and is unlawful. I am very grateful that Senator McLucas reminded us that there are good reasons that she does not believe clear statements like this. She comes from a party which makes an icon of the person who made the l-a-w law promise. It is well known that on Senator McLucas's side of politics something being law does not mean anything. But that is not true with this government. I can reassure Senator McLucas that as long as this government is in place the Great Barrier Reef will be protected, because this government recognises and takes seriously its obligations to the care of the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area. We do that from a position of understanding and knowledge. We do understand and appreciate that the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area is a role model for the protection of the world's coral reef ecosystems.</para></talk.start><para>While there are clearly issues in the Great Barrier Reef that are being addressed—it being a living ecosystem, there are always changing conditions and it has to be managed—any suggestion that the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area is in danger is plainly not appropriate. I understand that Senator McLucas is acting only in accordance with what her party has been doing for the last five years—continually trying to scare people, trying to confuse facts. For example, in this particular case, Senator McLucas understands very clearly that the application is to carry out a series of seismic tests. Perhaps Senator McLucas misunderstood that `seismic' meant `earth shaking' and was therefore something which would cause a lot of damage. Nowadays, seismic testing simply means sending shock waves which—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84L</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLucas</name></talker><para>—You blow up a little bomb.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>86Y</name.id><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name></talker><para>—Senator McLucas, there is no bomb involved. If you had listened to Senator Bolkus, you would know that they now use compressed air—no dynamite and no drilling. This, again, is a case of Labor Party senators trying to confuse the issue, trying to frighten people and trying to mix up words. There is no drilling proposed. There are not even any seismic tests proposed on the reef; they are to be done outside the boundary of the reef area. It is not only outside the marine park but outside the boundary of the area which is set up to protect the marine park. It is a good 50 kilometres away from it. So there is not any real threat.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The proposal has nothing to do with exploration as such, it is only for geophysical testing, and it is a long way from any proposal to actually drill on the reef. This government not only has given a reassurance that there will be no drilling on the reef but has continuously sought to improve the management and protection of the Great Barrier Reef. Of course there are challenges which must be met to ensure that the reef stays healthy, and the government is continuing to meet these challenges. Senator Hill has given some examples of that. This government has introduced regulations which prohibit operations for the recovery of minerals in those parts of the Great Barrier Reef region not currently part of the marine park. In addition, the government has added 18 new inshore areas to the marine park. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>26233</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support my colleagues in this debate.

To speak of it being 50 kilometres or 70 kilometres misses the point: the sea knows no specific boundaries. Of course, if they got within 70 kilometres of the world heritage area, the next thing that they would seek to do would be to go into the world heritage area itself. We are dealing with a unique system which knows no boundaries and needs protection. The goal of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, according to their web site, is:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>To provide for the protection, wise use, understanding and enjoyment of the Great Barrier Reef in perpetuity—</para></quote><para>and I think that is the important thing: `in perpetuity'—</para><quote><para>through the care and development of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</para></quote><para>There should be nothing that intrudes on the area. It is interesting to look at some of the history of the issue of drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. While this issue does not go specifically to drilling at this stage, I will lead into that in a few moments. In the chronology that the Parliamentary Library were able to supply me, I will go back to February 1979 when then Premier Bjelke-Petersen of Queensland stated that no oil drilling would be allowed directly on the reef but that it was all right in many places between the reefs. That view, I believe, is still held by quite a wide number of people in the community— `between the reefs'! At that stage, a poll showed that 66 per cent of Australians were opposed to reef drilling, with an even higher number against it in Queensland. Of course, my colleague Senator Bolkus has just pointed out that a recent survey showed 92 per cent. In the same year, the then Queensland Minister for Mines, Mr Camm, said that oil exploration on the Great Barrier Reef would come eventually. So there is an expectation on the part of some people that there will be exploration on the reef at some time. Of course, that is anathema to people who see the reef as the wonder that it is.</para><para>To get to the heart of the debate here this afternoon, one needs to look no further than the press release of Senator Robert Hill of 30 January this year, when he said in respect of this issue:</para><quote><para>It is clear that the proposed seismic tests will not adversely affect the Great Barrier Reef itself. No drilling will be carried out.</para></quote><para>He confirmed that again in question time today. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>The acoustic noise associated with seismic testing will not affect areas of the actual Reef which are at least 70 kilometres away.</para></quote><para>He confirmed that again, but that does mean that there will not be whales and other mammals that will be affected by the seismic actions that will take place. The next part of the press statement by Senator Hill earlier this year really gets to the issue and the concern that my colleagues and I have in this particular debate. He says:</para><quote><para>However, it seems obvious that seismic activity is carried out only as a precursor to further exploration and production activities, such as drilling. </para></quote><para>Senator Hill, in his own press release, gets to the point: if you are going to have seismic testing, why have it? He says in his own press release that the seismic testing is the precursor to further exploration and production activities such as drilling. That is the fear and the concern that we have. Whilst this area is not in the world heritage area, it is adjacent to that area. Nonetheless, it is the precursor, by his own admission in his own press release. The concerns expressed today should be taken seriously. The government should stop any seismic testing proceeding in this area. It should remove any thought that this will happen at any stage. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Senator Brown, the President was given an indication by the Democrats that Senator Allison was going to speak on this matter, or speak to a motion to take note.

This seismic testing plan will damage the government more than it will damage the Great Barrier Reef. The people of Australia simply will not allow it to progress. I am surprised that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, could say to the Senate, as he just did, that the oil drilling company must satisfy the government that there can be no threat to birds and marine life and so on from seismic testing. He knows that you cannot prove that. He knows that there is worldwide alarm about the impact on whales, for example, who use sound to communicate with each other, right around the globe—certainly for hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometres.</para></talk.start><para>This seismic testing will, until proven otherwise, have an impact on the whales and presumably the dugongs. There is no way the minister can say that there will be no threat to the reef. That is simply like saying that, by building more thermal power stations, we could not in any possible way be a threat to Kiribati. He has to recognise that this global ecosystem is interconnected and we know very little about it. We know very little about the workings of the reef or the impact that seismic testing will have. As other speakers have said, if seismic testing were allowed to go ahead, it would lead to oil drilling. The minister should be saving the company money. He should be saving his own reputation as minister. He should be saving the government from a lot of damage. He should be saving the Australian people from a lot of anxiety and uproar by accepting responsibility and putting an end to this crazy and destructive idea before it gets under way.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Greenhouse Gas Emissions</title><page.no>26234</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>26234</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources (Senator Minchin) to a question without notice asked by Senator Allison today relating to greenhouse gas emissions and proposals to introduce a carbon tax. </para></motion><para>My question was related to an OECD report two weeks ago which suggested that the best way for Australia to restructure the economy so we can meet our very generous—they did not say that but I do— greenhouse commitments was to put in place a domestic emissions trading system, or a carbon tax. I am sure the OECD will be most interested in Senator Minchin's response and the fact that he suggested that these two options were part of some mindless strategy. They are not part of a mindless strategy. Concentrating on the domestic emissions trading system to begin with, the Australian Greenhouse Office some time ago developed a proposal for Australia to adopt a domestic emissions trading system. They did that because it is a very sensible approach. In this country, our risk is not associated with a carbon tax or a domestic emissions trading system on industry. The big risk to this country is global warming and climate change. Already scientists are saying that we could see anything up to a 32 per cent reduction in rainfall over most of Australia. Our economy will be very severely damaged if that is the case.</para><para>Last year, the environment committee conducted an inquiry into greenhouse. We focused on the question of domestic emissions trading—in fact, global emissions trading. It was widely seen by people who made submissions to the inquiry as an ideal mechanism to stimulate markets to reward abatement and to recognise the environmental costs of greenhouse pollution. Emissions trading, people said, would ensure that markets internalise environmental costs and reward investment in greenhouse abatement whilst creating flexibility which ensures that lowest cost abatement opportunities are taken up first and which permits flow to areas where abatement costs are too high. In fact, the committee recommended the early introduction of a national emissions trading system with the aim of building capacity and experience, encouraging the uptake of fuel switching and energy efficiency, and positioning Australia to lead the international debate in the development of a global trading system.</para><para>It was recommended that there be a phased in introduction of an emissions trading scheme, with the possible introduction of a voluntary scheme in advance of a mandatory scheme, designed to direct the economy towards meeting Australia's Kyoto target in the first commitment period and to meeting potentially lower targets in subsequent commitment periods. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

We know about the awful circumstances of the East Timorese under the Indonesian military, with widespread murder, rape and destruction of property, including some 70 per cent of houses, in East Timor during that period. There has been, in the wake of unsatisfactory moves by the Indonesian government to establish a war crimes tribunal which would bring to justice the people who were responsible for that particular period of bloodshed, growing pressure on the United Nations to establish a war crimes tribunal and, moreover, as my motion indicates, to extend the war crimes tribunal to the whole period of Indonesian occupation of what is now the independent nation of East Timor. I call on the Senate to support this motion, whereby the Australian government would add its pressure to the United Nations to do just that, by drawing attention to the true horror of that quarter century of occupation for the East Timorese and to the war crimes that took place under the Indonesian military and government during that time.</para><para>I can do no better than to quote the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of Friday, 2 February this year, by Fiona Carruthers from Dili, which has the headline `Start with 1975 invasion, says war crimes author'. This refers to the call by United Nations war crimes investigator James Dunn, who was the consul for Australia in East Timor before the 1975 invasion, as follows:</para><quote><para>As Mr Dunn prepares to hand the UN his report into the violence surrounding the UN-supervised independence poll on August 30, 1999, he is urging the Australian Government to upgrade its role in pushing Indonesia to respect the need for justice. “Australia could encourage the process (of war crimes prosecutions) far more than they have been doing at the moment,” Mr Dunn said in Dili ...</para></quote><para>The report goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Between 1000 and 2000 East Timorese are estimated to have died during the transition to independence in late 1999. About 250,000 people fled ... and 35,000—or 70 per cent—of their homes were destroyed. “It's important that those who planned and organised these brutal operations are brought to justice,” Mr Dunn said. “I address that in my report.” </para></quote><para>It went on to say:</para><quote><para>While 1999 was a critical year for East Timor, the UN tended to focus on atrocities committed during the independence vote to the exclusion of earlier mass killings, many of which have never been fully investigated. </para></quote><para>Further, it said:</para><quote><para>Mr Dunn named the Craras massacre of 1983, in which an estimated 700 to 1000 people died, and a mass killing near Bobonoro in 1976, when it is believed more than 1000 people were killed, as two events that UN experts should investigate. “During the Indonesian occupation, some 200,000 Timorese have died.”</para></quote><para>Listen to what Mr Dunn then said:</para><quote><para>“That is like losing 6 million Australians.”</para></quote><para>That is the proportion of the carnage which occurred in East Timor under the brutal military dictatorship of President Suharto. Mr Dunn goes on to say:</para><quote><para>“It's massive in relative terms and if we're going to make the world a safer place, we have to tackle indiscriminate killing and torture head on.”</para></quote><para>Who could countermand that? How can we turn our backs on that quarter century of brutality which led to the deaths of one in three or one in four of the East Timorese population? We cannot do that, and we cannot settle for an investigation set up by Jakarta which limits the time, limits the scope and limits the intensity of the investigation. There is an alternative, and that is the United Nations. The United Nations investigation into these war crimes must extend right back to 1975.</para><para>Supporting this motion will take courage by the Senate and by this parliament, because we all know that our own government record is not entirely divorced from those events. We know that military assistance was given to the Suharto regime by the Australian government—not least in the training of Kopassus. These obnoxious and brutal elite troops, who have operated not only in East Timor but also in Aceh and West Papua, have been implicated in the recent assassination of political figures in Jakarta. We must not, however, become complicit in a cover-up in any way. We must demand the most full and open investigation into those 25 years, and we must do it without fear or favour.</para><para>I say to the Senate that, if we do not move to ensure that the United Nations establishes a war crimes tribunal on this matter now, we will get one later. But, if we have one later and Australia has not pushed for a full UN tribunal now, the question will be: why not? The question I would put to anybody who opposes this motion is: why not? The argument may be, `We now have a new president in Jakarta and she is looking at this whole question anew.' So be it, but what Australia should be doing, as part of the community of nations and the civilising process for the human community on this planet, is insisting that, as in Bosnia and Kosovo, the crimes committed in East Timor come under the survey of an international war crimes tribunal. You cannot look at 200,000 people being murdered—with many more having their lives destroyed through rape, physical injury and mental horror—out of a population in East Timor of 600,000 to 800,000 and not have the word `genocide' raise its ugly head in connection with the events in that country.</para><para>We must not just have a supportive role in the United Nations establishing a tribunal in this matter but take a leading role in it. My motion is a call to both the opposition and the government to support that process. You would support it for Bosnia, you would support it for Kosovo and you would support it for Rwanda; you must support it for East Timor. If not, why not? I am very passionate about this motion. I think Australia has a real opportunity here to show a better face than it showed through the 25 years of the travail of East Timor. The question is: can this chamber and then the government, which this chamber is calling on to act through the United Nations to establish an international war crimes tribunal, have the courage, the humanity and the quest for dignity that are involved in the imperative that this motion be supported?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>26239</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move an amendment to Senator Brown's motion:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Omit all words after “That the Senate”, substitute: </para><para>	(a)	welcomes the decision of Indonesian President, Megawati Sukarnoputri, to broaden the scope of the special Indonesian court dealing with human rights violations in East Timor in the period leading up to the 1999 independence ballot;</para><para>	(b)	expresses the view that the successful prosecution of those responsible for crimes against humanity in East Timor in this period would be a major step forward in the promotion of human rights in Indonesia and the securing of justice for East Timor;</para><para>	(c)	further observes that failure to bring to justice those responsible for crimes against humanity can only encourage a climate of impunity and abuse of human rights;</para><para>	(d)	notes the lack of unanimous support within the United Nations Security Council for the establishment of an international tribunal to deal with crimes against humanity in East Timor;</para><para>	(e)	calls on the Indonesian Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that those military personnel and other persons responsible for crimes against humanity in East Timor are brought to justice; and</para><para>	(f)	affirms that in the meantime the question of establishing an international tribunal should remain open.</para></quote><para>We think that the amendment I have moved would significantly improve Senator Brown's motion. We think that so strongly that, were this amendment to be defeated, we would not support the original motion. That will be our position in this debate. I want to say a few words in support of what I have moved. The proper place to begin is in fact at the same place that Senator Brown began in his expression of support for his motion— that is, with a consideration of the absolute horror and disgust that we in the Australian Labor Party and, we believe, that people in the wider Australian community have for crimes against humanity during a period of war or at any time. They are among the most base and reviled types of deprivation of liberty or murder that can occur. We of course stand foursquare with all civilised peoples of the world in rejecting exercises of that sort, and there is no doubt or question about that in our minds at all.</para><para>I do not adopt, nor would I express in the same language as Senator Brown, what has occurred in East Timor. What is quite clearly the case is that, in the time leading up to the UN ballot and in the time immediately after the ballot in East Timor, atrocities against individuals and institutions were committed on a broad scale and many people died. Many others were tortured; rape and wounding occurred. People were abducted, people were driven away from their homes and large parts of the community were razed. The infrastructure of the island virtually became non-existent. These are matters that have been considered by the Senate in the past, and in the past we have put on the record at some considerable length our concern about those things and the steps that should have been taken. We have made always, one believes, public and constructive criticism about how things could have been handled differently to prevent the loss of life.</para><para>What we are now invited to consider is: what is the correct path to justice? What is the exact nature of the crimes and how can those that have perpetrated them be brought to justice? It is true that the conscience of the world could not rest when war criminals continue to be at large and, for the sake of the future, it is important to deal with those problems of the immediate past. I therefore think that the question before the Senate, despite the massive horror of the crimes and the rejection of that conduct that we have expressed, is: what is the best way of finding justice in these circumstances? I regret to say, but it is true—and I am sure Senator Brown knows this—that the United Nations Security Council currently by any assessment is not of the mind to establish an international tribunal in relation to East Timor.</para><para>If that is the case, then even if we were to carry Senator Brown's original motion—and that is not our proposal at all—it would be a motion that would go nowhere and not result, as a consequence, in any injustices being corrected. On the other hand, we do know that the new President of Indonesia, Megawati Sukarnoputri, has set up a new process which will broaden the scope of the special Indonesian court's work in investigating human rights violations in East Timor in the lead-up to the 1999 election. If that occurs, that will be in the longer term interests of the promotion of human rights in East Timor and in Indonesia. We think that the appropriate response is to allow that process to be concluded. We see the development of that process as an important one, though we are not without an opinion about the efficacy of the process. We believe it is an important issue and we believe that Australia should be on the record about it. </para><para>As a consequence, in the amendment that I have moved we call on the Indonesian president, and her government, to make sure that all necessary steps are taken to bring to justice those responsible for crimes and human rights violations. We also believe that, if this is done, it will go a long way towards securing justice in East Timor. </para><para>In all of these circumstances, we think that a degree of prudence is necessary and we should leave open the question of an international tribunal but, in doing so, hope, expect and express our view quite directly that the quickest way to justice and the best way to justice is for the scope and widening of the Indonesian machinery that has now been put in place by President Megawati to be able to operate. At the end of the day, if this matter can be settled with justice and honour within Indonesia, that is a far better outcome than an international body seeking to impose a standard on that country from outside. Therefore, we welcome what the new Indonesian president has done and hope that that can solve the problem. We express in my amendment precisely those sentiments.</para><para>Dealing with these issues in this chamber has become a matter that crops up from time to time. I just want to say a word about the importance of how we confront them. These are matters so fundamental to our civilisation, way of life, expectation of democratic rights and expectation of human liberties and freedoms that, as much as possible, while never retreating from any point of principle, we should try to gather the most significant expression of view to articulate, as completely as possible, a full Australian position. I do not know precisely what the government's intention is, but I imagine it is not to support the Brown motion. I do not know whether the government's intention is to support our amendment at this stage, but I certainly do invite the government to consider doing that and, if the vote is called, to vote for our amendment. I think that, in a balanced way, it articulates all of the concerns and would, in a balanced way, express most forcefully a view from this chamber on this matter.</para><para>Having said that, I also think it is entirely appropriate that we keep a constructive focus here. Senator Brown's motion calls for something that we know will not occur and, as a consequence, is not likely to directly and materially affect the wellbeing of the people concerned or the hunt for the perpetrators and the process of bringing those perpetrators to justice. Asking for something that will not occur leaves us to one side in this issue. Supporting a process that will occur and calling for it to be properly implemented gives us a clear stake in resolving the matter. I therefore hope that this does not become one of those debates in which there is an attempt to make populist points against a sober and considered position and to appeal to populist sentiment against a considered position by which a genuine outcome can be more speedily reached.</para><para>I direct those remarks to Senator Brown. I do not question his commitment—I sometimes question his method and at times we differ on method. If his method were to simply pursue this issue for the sake of populism, then I think it is the wrong approach. I suggest, and I offer this advice in this chamber: let us try to pursue this issue in the interests of achieving justice for those people who have been injured or damaged or who have lost their lives, and of bringing those responsible to justice. That does require the widest possible unity around a principled position, and I believe our amendment reflects that. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>26241</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— This is a most important motion for consideration by the Senate, and I endorse the remarks and the tenor of the debate from the other speakers. I am, however, very concerned at the timing of the Labor Party amendment that has been proposed here today. Whilst the government is generally inclined to support it, I note that Senator Cook handed me a copy of this amendment some 15 minutes ago, at the commencement of the debate after Senator Brown had, in fact, started speaking. On the amendment that Senator Cook passed to me, which is actually a copy of a fax, I note that there is a date on the top of 9 August 2001. Similarly, on the copy that was subsequently distributed in the chamber the date on the fax is 8 August, which I note is the day after the notice given by Senator Brown. I find it appalling that the Labor Party would come into this place and put down, some two weeks after it had obviously been prepared, a draft amendment— and this is from a party that is so sensitive to the issue of developing foreign policy on the run. There is a very important sensitivity with regard to the appropriate way in which to consider important matters of international significance and of a foreign policy nature.  </para></talk.start><para>With regard to the original motion that was proposed by Senator Brown, let me put on the record that the government places a high priority on human rights in East Timor and has urged the Indonesian government to bring to justice those responsible for human rights abuses in East Timor. In fact, the Prime Minister, John Howard, discussed the issue with President Megawati during his visit to Jakarta on 12 and 13 August. There are two processes under way to ensure such justice: the work of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, UNTAET, and the judicial system in East Timor, as well as the ongoing process in Indonesia. The Indonesian attorney-general's department has prepared 12 dossiers for trial, covering 18 of its 22 named suspects, including Enrico Guterres. </para><para>In April, former President Wahid issued a decree establishing an ad hoc human rights court to try those accused of crimes in East Timor after the August 1999 ballot. The government warmly welcomes the decision by President Megawati to expand the court's jurisdiction to include crimes committed both before and after the ballot, which will allow the court to examine crimes in Liquica, Dili and Suai in April and September 1999. The decision sends a strong signal about the President's commitment to justice.</para><para>The government has urged Indonesia to establish the court quickly and to cooperate fully with UNTAET under the terms of the April 2000 Memorandum of Understanding on Legal, Judicial and Human Rights Cooperation. Australia has assisted both the UN and the Indonesian human rights investigations, including pursuant to the UN Security Council resolutions calling for such assistance, and has provided support to the justice sector in East Timor, including the provision of court interpreters and forensic and autopsy assistance. If the Indonesian government does not expose and bring to justice the perpetrators of crimes committed in East Timor, we will need to explore other ways of doing so, including possible international action.</para><para>While I have, in the brief period available to me, been able to consider the ALP amendment, I note that it is very important that we concentrate on part (d) of the amendment, that is, that the Senate:</para><quote><para>notes the lack of unanimous support within the United Nations Security Council for the establishment of an international tribunal to deal with crimes against humanity in East Timor. </para></quote><para>The Australian government certainly notes and endorses those particular remarks. As I said, whilst I am critical of the way in which the Labor Party has processed this matter here today, given the two weeks notice they very obviously had of the matter—and I condemn them for their lack of courtesy and goodwill in seeking to promote this in this way—this is an amendment which the government will support.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>26242</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are three things to say about this, but I will be brief because we have a first speech coming up. First of all, Senator Brown's motion relates not only to 1999, which is the period the new President of Indonesia has targeted for what, I think, is a very good thing, that is, her new court dealing with the war crimes and the human rights violations in East Timor leading up to the 1999 referendum. That is something she should be applauded for and it is something that Indonesia should be applauded for, and I do applaud them for it. I agree with most of the amendment, although I do not see why we need part (d). If we had to wait for the UN Security Council to be unanimous on anything we would be waiting a very long time. I agree with almost all that amendment. I also agree with the feeling behind Senator Brown's original motion. We have a period here where hideous and horrendous war crimes were committed. I have been through some of the more hideous ones in this chamber. I will not go through them again. They sound so gross as to be impossible but they are not and they happened. Those people will never be brought to justice—never—and it looks like we do not care. We should at least be lobbying to say that these people should be brought to justice. </para></talk.start><para>In many cases, now that East Timorese people are free to say what has happened, they will say what has happened. We are getting an awful lot of evidence coming through to the United Nations now about what happened as far back as 1975. People know who the individual was who chopped off somebody's head and stuck it on a pole outside a school. They know, and they will give that evidence, but we will never hear it because that tribunal will never happen and those people will never be brought to justice, unless something happens throughout the UN or Indonesia changes completely and decides to bring those people to justice, but I do not think that is going to happen either. So if those people are still within East Timor, yes, I think there is a chance that they will be brought to justice, but if they are not—if they are back in Indonesia, and the vast majority of them would be, whether they are East Timorese or not— then, no, they will not be brought to justice. I think that we should be making a stand on that. I think that is important.</para><para>I certainly agree with the spirit behind Senator Brown's original motion. I would agree with the amendment, except that I do not think you need (d), but that is neither here nor there. I would take out (f) and I would amend it with an (f) that would be substantially Senator Brown's original motion which calls on the Australian government to lobby in favour of an international war crimes tribunal to bring to justice those responsible for the crimes against humanity committed during the period of 1975 to 1999 during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>26243</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not accept this amendment because it is simply saying, `Well, this matter should be left to Jakarta and it should be circumscribed to the events surrounding the referendum in East Timor.' The opposition and government know that my motion is saying that we should have a war crimes tribunal into the whole of the East Timorese occupation by the Indonesian army. Let me put that in perspective. During the horrific referendum period, 2,000 East Timorese were killed. During the occupation, 200,000 East Timorese were killed. How can we, as a chamber, support a war crimes tribunal into one per cent of the crimes? Are you really satisfied with that? What about the 99 per cent? Is that a matter for us to shrug our shoulders at? You simply cannot say that there is a logic to this, and we cannot leave it to Jakarta. Unfortunately, what is happening here today is that we are seeing that we cannot leave it to Canberra.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition did have their amendment ready a fortnight ago but put it on to us at the start of this debate, and they will have to explain that. It looks like political manoeuvring to try and get a result other than through debate and strength of position in this chamber. The opposition are very well aware that one of the reasons that there has not been further progress on this in the United Nations is because Australia has not been advocating with strength, vigour and determination that the UN establish an international war crimes tribunal into the death of those 200,000 people, the ransacking of their country and the indescribable cruelty to which Senator Bourne just referred.</para><para>We either support the United Nations option or we become complicit in denying it. Senator Cook and the opposition know that, if Australia were to take a strong line in the United Nations, we would get an international tribunal—that is my belief. On the issue of East Timor, Australia has huge authority in the United Nations, not least because it was the Howard government that overcame the policy disaster of the previous 25 years and put Australia in the peacekeeping and rescue situation, of which so many Australians can be proud. But we cannot leave it at that. We cannot simply shrug our shoulders at the history of the East Timorese travail any more than war crimes tribunals can shrug their shoulders at what happened in those other countries I have mentioned. </para><para>I mention in passing—and I do not want to stress this because I think it gets away from what happened to the East Timorese people—that there is a political embarrassment in the body politic here in Canberra about those 25 years. I think that is manifest in the debate that is occurring today. I call for courage to overcome that. If we cannot overcome that, how can we expect President Megawati Sukarnoputri to overcome it in Jakarta? We cannot—yet how much less is the courage required to do the right thing here in Canberra?</para><para>Make no mistake about this. Australia is pivotal to getting a United Nations tribunal to look into the whole of that period from 1975—the whole 25 years. I believe that if that does not happen it will be because this chamber, this parliament, this government and this opposition suppressed it. It is not a matter of saying, `Oh, well, we have made a decision to go with the Jakarta option.' It is a matter of denying actively the alternative of a United Nations war crimes tribunal. I ask all those who are going to vote against that option—and it appears the whole of the opposition and the government will now vote against it—whether a massive rape, death and destruction campaign in East Timor is different from one in Rwanda or Bosnia. Of course it is not—except for one thing: it is closer to home. </para><para>Through government decree, we have had some involvement in the training and facilitating of troops in Indonesia, not least the reviled Kopassus, and in facilitating the Suharto government through those years. We are seeing a failure of nerve here today and we are seeing a failure of morality of the highest order—a morality which says that when crimes like that have occurred they should be discovered and the people who perpetrated them should be dealt with. We cannot get away from it. By denying a push through the United Nations, with Australia's pivotal role there, we effectively end up sheltering the people who murdered, raped and destroyed for 25 years in East Timor. That is how it is. Even at this eleventh hour in this debate, I appeal to the government, if not the opposition, to reconsider. It is a very grave matter. If I fail here today, I will not let up on it.</para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para><para>Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title><type>Matters of Urgency</type><page.no>26244</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Higher Education: Funding</title><page.no>26244</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Hogg)</inline>—I inform the Senate that the President has received the following letter, dated 21 August, from Senator Carr:</para></talk.start><para>Dear Madam President</para><para>Pursuant to standing order 75, I give notice that today I propose to move:</para><motion><para>That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</para></motion><para>the crisis in Australia's university system as a result of the Commonwealth government's funding cuts, as well as the Government's intemperate attacks on those Vice Chancellors with the temerity to point this out.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Senator Kim Carr</para><para>Is the proposal supported?</para><para><inline font-style="italic">More than the number of senators required by the standing orders having risen in their places—</inline></para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in today's debate.

Then followed an extraordinary chain of events, including a denunciation by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives of those claiming that the education system is in crisis; a confrontational correspondence from the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs to vice-chancellors, attacking the executive of the AVCC; and allegations of incompetence made by a senior bureaucrat. What had Professor Chubb, acting on behalf of the AVCC, said that so got under this government's skin? Professor Chubb had spoken to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee about the current crisis. He described it in these terms: </para><quote><para>... when you get emails from students asking you about tutorials of 32:1 every second week, when you get lecture classes of 400-plus, when you get practical classes every other week, when your infrastructure is eroding and when you see all your equipment and your capacity to provide the resources you need for the staff to do the work that they want to be able to do slowly but surely degrading, then that does not make me—or a majority of my colleagues—very happy at all.</para></quote><para>What was the result? With such unambiguous advice being voiced by Australia's most eminent university administrators, did this government take notice? Did it take it all seriously? Of course not! As with so many other matters of national importance that are now under intolerable strain, this government has gone, yet again, into a state of denial. More particularly, the government has sought to obscure the crisis by means of intimidatory letters and outright abuse. </para><para>The minister, Dr Kemp, has written to Professor Chubb, personally undermining him. He has done so by (a) claiming that Professor Chubb is unrepresentative of vice-chancellors, (b) accusing him of undermining the efforts of his colleagues, and (c), ironically, saying that Professor Chubb was damaging Australia's international reputation. This has become Dr Kemp's standard ploy in attempting to fend off well deserved criticism. But we cannot defend the quality of education in Australia if no-one can talk about it. The best defence for education is to identify the weaknesses and mistakes in current policy and seek to remedy them. This does not appeal to the minister at all. There is an analogy that can be drawn here. A view is held by some overseas that Australia is tainted by racism. This does not mean that issues of reconciliation and concerns about injustice should not be raised. In fact, the opposite is true: we have an obligation to ensure that these issues are no longer a cause for international concern by addressing such problems head on in this country. </para><para>When Professor Chubb made his comments, he was supported by a number of other vice-chancellors, none of whom, either then or since, has disagreed with his description of the current state of universities as being in crisis. Why then has Dr Kemp seen fit not only to send an intemperate letter to Professor Chubb but also to gratuitously circulate that correspondence to other vice-chancellors? This is nothing more than a blatant attempt to intimidate anyone who speaks out against the ill-considered policies of this government. Such crude efforts will and must fail.</para><para>Not being satisfied with that, Dr Kemp has sent one of his public servants into the higher education inquiry to tell the vice-chancellors and the rest of the country that the earth is flat, that black is really white and that there is not, and never can be, a crisis in higher education. Can the minister deny this? Whether the hapless public servant got his orders confused or otherwise is a moot point, but what resulted was a blast of ill-considered vituperation and bile? There is no point in seeking to rebuke the vice-chancellors, because the evidence is overwhelming. Rather, the minister has adopted the coward's way by misrepresenting his opponents and demeaning their motives and by using a public servant as his surrogate. This government, of course, is attempting to rewrite history. From its perspective there can be no crisis. It is a reality that cannot be admitted at any cost.  </para><para>There has been some response from the government, however feeble. If you cannot find a conspiracy, then you find a fall guy. Therefore, we have a problem which is represented by the vice-chancellors, as was said before the Senate inquiry, as `looking for an easy way out', as failing to address their `management responsibilities' or, to use the pseudoscientific language adopted for the occasion, `There is probably an inverse relationship between those who make those allegations and their management competence.' In other words, although there can be no crisis, the government has no confidence in those who administer many of our largest universities and who spend hundreds of millions of dollars of public money every year. If critical pressures do exist, then the vice-chancellors who speak up are suitable scapegoats and such pressures `reflect the inadequacy of the management of the universities to deal with the problems they have'. That is the government's response to this criticism. This is a government that has lost control of higher education policy. In the face of policy failure, we now hear a familiar refrain of denial: there is no university crisis, the problem being only one of incompetent administrators.</para><para>The question I asked Professor Chubb, which sparked this spurious outrage on the part of Dr Kemp, was whether the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee believed that the tertiary education system—I emphasise the word `system'—was in crisis. This is the question that the government has been so desperate to avoid. This is the question that it wishes to avoid answering at all possible costs. What are the characteristics of the tertiary education system that give rise to such concern? In recent years, we have seen staff-student ratios explode from 14.6 in 1995 to the current level of 18.8—an increase of 28.8 per cent. The deleterious effect of stress, of reduced student access to teachers and of a general decrease in the quality of the education experience has been profound. In regard to IT, we have seen the inability of institutions to recruit sufficient staff become a national problem, with resulting ratios approaching 50 in some areas. We have been watching an alarming decline in the number of teachers in key areas. Since 1995, chemistry is down by 23 per cent, physics by 29 per cent and mathematics by 24 per cent. The slash and burn approach of this government has resulted in the erosion of basic infrastructure.</para><para>Under this government, the cost of up-to-date equipment has risen while the funding provided for universities has fallen every year. Exacerbating such cuts, the real purchasing power of grants has fallen a further four per cent since 1996, with no remedial action even contemplated. There has been a considerable and unchecked decline in the capacity of university libraries to either serve the student population or fund sufficient purchases to keep these libraries up to date. All this is clear evidence of the decline in quality as a result of this government's policies. We have seen the size of lectures and tutorials— already too large—grow even larger. For example, more than 100 students were recently turned away from an accounting lecture at the University of New South Wales when chronic overcrowding became a health and safety issue. There are too few facilities already overstretched, with too few staff and no money to address the problems—further evidence of a crisis. It gives the lie to the allegation of incompetent management. We have seen an explosion in the rate of casualisation of staff and the consequent effect on teaching quality. </para><para>These are the consequences of an education system in crisis. What are the indicators? A simple thing to look at is the number of students seeking university entry. That has begun to fall. The international comparisons are poor and getting worse. Morale among staff and students is low and continuing to fall. Under these circumstances, how can any minister, however myopic, be so blind to the continuing decline in quality and assert that there is no crisis? We have seen the overwhelming evidence of this decline put before the Senate inquiry. How does the government respond? By seeking to intimidate vice-chancellors and any other critic who seeks to come forward.  </para><para>If we look at the cause of this crisis, we see that the responsibility has to be levelled directly at this government and at this minister. The approach taken by the government has been to cut $3 billion from university funding. If funding had been maintained, if the government had continued the policies of the previous government, we would have seen student numbers increase by 54,000 publicly funded places this year. The government has reduced funding for universities every year it has been in office. Universities now face a situation, as Professor Chubb in a memo to the members of the council pointed out, where student fees and charges have increased from 19 per cent of total revenue in 1996 to 31 per cent of total revenue. Total revenue of Commonwealth government spending has fallen from 61 per cent to 47 per cent in a period of only five years. The six per cent direct cut from Commonwealth funding made in 1996 has had a devastating effect on educational quality. Funding for 2002 is set at $4.223 billion compared with $4.875 billion in 1996. On DETYA's own figures, we can clearly demonstrate the decline in federal government grants, yet the minister, the Prime Minister and others now claim that there is more money available. The truth could not be further from those facts because there is a decline in government grants. Any claim that there is additional money has to be seen entirely in the context of increases in fees and charges and HECS payments being made by students. </para><para>What we see is below average investments per tertiary student, a fall in the number of Australian students at our universities and a slashing of the number of research training places at universities, all of which reflects directly upon the government's policies. When we see these things, a state of crisis in Australian universities is quite clear and demonstrable. We see a crisis both created and compounded by a misdirected education policy established by this government. </para><para>Dr Kemp, in his own cabinet submission, pointed out: </para><quote><para>... already eight institutions appear to be operating at a deficit and some regional campuses are at risk... [H]igher student staff ratios, less frequent lecture and tutorial contact, the persistence of outdated technology and gaps in key areas of professional preparation are fuelling a perception of declining quality.</para></quote><para>We have seen that this government has almost exhausted the short-term benefits gained by using HECS levies as a substitute for direct Commonwealth grants funding. This government has, as a result, pushed to force universities to raise more and more of their revenue from private and commercial sources. We are seeing a faltering strategy that has imposed a type of double jeopardy on universities. Not only has it failed to provide sufficient alternative revenue but also the manner in which these strategies have been pursued has the potential to damage the ethical and civic framework in which our universities currently operate. The examples are numerous. I need only mention the vicissitudes of Melbourne University Private— with which the Senate is familiar—for others to appreciate just how dangerous the strategies could prove to be. </para><para>DETYA has admitted that university operating surpluses have been declining in recent years, a fact linked to the unsuccessful nature of this government's push for the substitution of public expenditure by private revenue. The department has also admitted that it is unaware—as are many universities—of the true costs of many universities' commercial and fee paying programs. The best it can say is that it is `pretty confident'. I would like all senators here to recognise that the government simply run on the position that they do not know the answers to what is actually affecting the costs of universities at the moment—and they certainly do not have any clear understanding of the implications of their own policies.</para><para>What we have effectively seen is a government that seeks to blame the messenger. When the vice-chancellors come forward and point out that the education system is in crisis, this government seeks to intimidate and to abuse. It effectively seeks to disguise the true impact of its policies by running misleading and erroneous claims in the media and through the universities. We have seen Professor Chubb have the courage to put forward a view that he should not be condemned for. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>26248</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this MPI debate we actually have a repeat of a national debate that Senator Carr and I took part in at the ANU a few weeks ago, and I am delighted that I can now put on the public record a response to the nonsense that Senator Carr has been trotting out.

It was in so much crisis at the end of 13 years of Labor rule that, in response to increasing salaries in universities, all they could offer was that universities should take out a loan to pay their salary increases and, presumably, pay it back five years down the track.

That is how hopeless the Labor government policies were in the early nineties. Students were banging on the gates and they could not get in under you. You came up with some rather strange policies to try to correct the situation, but by the time you left government you certainly had not succeeded. It is absolute humbug to suggest that any perceived problems started in 1996. You have got to go back to the Dawkins reforms of 1987.

That was also the minister who then clawed back—what a great term, `claw back'; it is very visual—research funding out of the universities and created the ARC grants and other central mechanisms. We have no problem with having these central mechanisms, but he did not put any extra money into them. He just clawed it back out of the universities and created that centralised type of system. He moved from a total budget system to an off budget system. We have to ask ourselves: with all these changes, with the government at the time trying to grapple with the problems of expansion, what did it deliver? It delivered 50,000 people still trying to get in the gates of a university. It delivered rapidly rising average lecture sizes and average tutorial sizes. This was all happening under the last Labor government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Also, new blocks were placed in the way of universities at this time in the way they restructured. We had network universities—for example, the University of Western Sydney and the University of New England. These were very costly administrative arrangements, which they were not given proper funding for. One of these universities to this day carries a very large debt as a result of this. There was no special provision for the multicampus nature of universities, particularly for regional universities at that time. For example, Charles Sturt, which was carrying out its activities across 700 kilometres from Albury up to Dubbo, did not get any additional funding. The changed role of staff in these new institutions—the CAEs becoming universities; teaching institutions becoming teaching research institutions—did not mean that they were given any upgrade in funding. Indeed, for research institutions there was a small program of infrastructure called mechanisms A, B and C. These were phased out. The inadequate funding that was put there was phased out after three years.</para><para>That is what happened under Labor; that is their record. It was interesting that Senator Carr in what he had to say today made no reference at all to those points. He tried to point out that any perceived problems started in 1996. If there are any problems in the system, the whole foundation goes back to the restructured nature of the university system that started back in 1987. Despite that, we have a system today which is delivering. It has extra numbers, despite the sorts of figures that Senator Carr was quoting. It has delivered extra funding of $9.5 billion—up $1.2 billion since 1995. Public funding per student is $12,000—higher than in 1995. But the really scary thing for the university system is what is going to happen if Labor get back in.</para><para>I would like to dwell on something called Knowledge Nation. What does that mean?

And then what did this government do when it got into office? </para><para>I acknowledge Senator Tierney's point that Senator Robert Hill—then opposition education spokesperson—was very quick to criticise, to acknowledge the difficulties that the sector was facing. Indeed, I recall a quote in 1995 from Senator Hill when he drew this chamber's attention to the crisis in our higher education institutions. He said:</para><quote><para>The government is not prepared to face up to its own responsibility. It is its policies ... that have resulted in this crisis in higher education, the deteriorating quality in degrees and the anger that is being expressed by students and their teachers today. </para></quote><para>That quote was in relation to a national day of action. So what do the government do? Far from addressing this acknowledged crisis—and again Senator Tierney has put that on the record today in both his address and his interjections—what do they do? They deregulate the undergraduate sector. They start charging fees and charges—up-front fees that we know are a psychological and financial disincentive, particularly to disadvantaged groups that want to participate in higher education. Do they do anything about income support? Absolutely not. They do little, in collusion with the current opposition. They have done very little to remove the disincentives that currently exist for students to participate in higher education. </para><para>It is quite fortuitous, or maybe ironic, that today is the first of the Science Meets Parliament days. Indeed, I have just been at the National Press Club where scientists were asking, `What can we do to get more people to enrol in undergraduate courses, in science based courses, and to undertake science based careers? How do we get better teachers, in particular science teachers?' One of the obvious areas where we could be providing some form of incentive—or at least removing a disincentive—would be to get the science out of that second tier of HECS. This government once pledged to examine the impact of that HECS band on enrolments in science based courses and, of course, it has not done so. However, I do welcome the comments by Senator Grant Chapman today at the National Press Club when he acknowledged that maybe this was an issue that should be addressed. It is the first public concession I have heard from the government in five years that maybe it should be doing something about the issue of HECS payments.</para><para>This government has ripped public funding out of educational institutions at all levels but in particular at higher education levels. Senator Carr has referred to some of the figures, and I find it extraordinary that Senator Tierney has the gall to come in here today and argue that somehow there has been an increase in public funding. Certainly Dr Kemp makes much of the fact that the cutbacks in public funding to universities— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name></talker><para>—There has been: 4.4 per cent. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Let me finish, Minister. Dr Kemp has said that, since the cutbacks to public funding for higher education, since 1996, total revenues going to universities have increased. Yes, they have—the Democrats acknowledge that. However, what this government does not acknowledge is that the increased resources from private sources have not replaced the diminishing public resources and they have not gone to the core activities of teaching, learning, scholarship and fundamental research. Rather, those increased revenues from private sources have primarily gone into marketing, recruitment of international students, commercial research, offshore campuses and other activities that are on the margins. So, despite the claims of total increased resources, the decline in public funding has resulted in course closures, cost shifting to students, increasing staff-student ratios, cutbacks to libraries and significant casualisation of the academic labour force. On that note, I acknowledge Senator Tierney's comments about the former government's idea of how to cope with the supplementation of staff salaries. It was an inadequate solution, but I do not think that this government has attempted to do, or has done, any better in that regard. We certainly still have some of our key academics being paid only 75 per cent of the salaries of comparable American academics, for example.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The damage that has been wrought as a consequence of the changes to public funding and the cutting of resources has been particularly acute in the core enabling disciplines of physics, chemistry, mathematics, philosophy and history—disciplines which are so crucial for critical thinking and performance. Anyone who is conscious of the Science Meets Parliament events today and tomorrow would recognise that these are core components of a creative and innovative society.</para><para>We have had many submissions to the Senate inquiry, as both Senator Tierney and Senator Carr have pointed out. In the past five months, we have heard not the glossy circumstances to which Senator Tierney was alluding but evidence of a crisis. We have heard that this crisis is manifest in the declining access and participation of equity groups, the scandalous and inequitable state of student income support, worsening staff-student ratios, crumbling infrastructure, diminished quality of the learning and teaching experience, and uncompetitive salaries that are leading to the brain drain of some of our best academics and researchers. We have heard of the deprofessionalising and casualisation of university staff and an overemphasis on narrow, vocational courses at the expense of broader education.</para><para>This government's persistent denial of a crisis— and we have heard it from Senator Tierney today on behalf of the government— is not substantiated by the facts. The crisis is not simply anecdotal but the facts we have heard from vice-chancellors, organisations like the AVCC and the National Tertiary Education Union, student representative groups like CAPA and NUS and people right across the board. It represents a serious abrogation by the government of their responsibility to the future wellbeing of the Australian community. </para><para>Dr Kemp is well aware of the fact that our universities are in crisis. His infamous leaked cabinet submission in 1999 painted a disturbing picture of higher education including, and particularly in relation to, regional campuses. He pointed out that they were at considerable risk and that they were on uncompetitive salaries. This came from Dr Kemp himself. Let us not forget that his cabinet proposal urged an additional $800 million investment in higher education. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with Minister Kemp's description of the state of higher education; we agreed with his description of higher education in that leaked document. His agenda failed, however, because his solutions were inept and politically untenable.  </para><para>As I have acknowledged before, this is not the first time that the coalition have talked about the crisis in higher education in this country. They did so in 1995, and yet in the last five or six years they have done nothing to address that. In fact, they have compounded it with specific policy decisions that have—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Six per cent cuts.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Six per cent cuts— whether it be operating grants, whether it be to infrastructure, whether it be in relation to staff and academic salaries or whether it be in relation to fees and charges. When Senator Tierney stands up and accuses the former government, which I also do, of introducing fees and thus being responsible for this spiralling decline, he fails to acknowledge that his government has distorted the HECS system and has now made it incredibly difficult, particularly for disadvantaged students, to pursue an education.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The nonsense that we have heard from the government today denies the reality of the crisis. It is even worse than that. This government has gone on and made it worse by slurring the President of the AVCC, Professor Ian Chubb and other senior vice-chancellors who have had the temerity to give the Senate committee an honest and substantiated appraisal of what is going on in our higher education institutions. While there may be a certain facile skill in blaming the victim and shooting the messenger at the same time, it is an unedifying and irresponsible characteristic of this government—it is typical— whenever there is the faintest whiff of criticism. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>26252</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I suspect that the worst possible time to have an inquiry into university funding is a matter of months before a federal election. Inevitably, the inquiry becomes overtaken by partisanship, by political point scoring and by the desire of opposition senators to raise political issues to beat the government around the head with rather than to inquire into where the needs really lie.</para></talk.start><para>In saying that, as a member of the committee as well, I acknowledge the absolute sincerity with which, it appears to me, Senator Carr and Senator Collins have pursued their interests in this matter. There is no question whatsoever about the sincerity and the intensity of Senator Carr's commitment to this issue. However, unfortunately—as in everything else Senator Carr does—the sincerity of the commitment becomes mired by the ideology. Let us consider what is common ground between the government and the opposition—and, for that matter, the Australian Democrats. All of us are committed to the notion that Australian universities ought to be places of excellence in teaching and in research. All of us are committed to the view that Australian university funding should be greater, not less, than it is. All of us are committed to the proposition that equality of opportunity, or equity of access to universities, should be a fundamental principle of the system. All of us are committed to the view that the burdens placed upon students in making their contribution to the cost of university funding should be kept at the lowest feasible level. But where we part company from the Labor Party, and where we in particular part company from the approach taken at the committee hearings by Senator Carr, is this: we on the government side are eager to explore the options of getting more money into universities from other revenue sources.</para><para>In the United States and, as we recently heard in evidence at our hearings in Sydney, in Ireland—to take them as good examples— the elite universities have been enriched and nourished by the infusion of private capital from philanthropic institutions, from corporations and from centres of research excellence in the private sector. I do not believe for one moment that the opportunity to enrich Australian universities and the opportunity to broaden the funding base to increase the amount of money going into Australian universities from private capital has been exhausted or even explored to a sufficient degree. So it is facile and it is false—and I can understand that there is an election around the corner and Senator Carr wants to make some political points and engage in a bit of point scoring about his pet issue—to say that there is a crisis in university funding because public funds have been maintained at constant levels. It is not a six per cent decline, Senator Carr. The level of operating grants paid by the Commonwealth under the Higher Education Funding Act have remained constant in real terms since 1996, but the amount of private capital going into universities has increased. University revenues in this country from all sources have, during the life of the Howard government, increased in real terms by some nine per cent.  </para><para>That is not what we hear from the Labor Party. It is not what we have heard from Senator Carr and Senator Collins at the higher education inquiry. There is this assumption that the only legitimate source of funding for universities is public funding, and that is false. That assumption, if it were to be adopted as policy, would pauperise Australia's universities. Look at the great universities in the United States. Look, for example, at Stanford University, which is an outstanding example of partnership between private capital and public funding to create one of the world's greatest research institutions. That is the vision of the Australian university sector which the Howard government embraces—a vision of Australian universities which are funded to a greater extent, not a lesser extent, and which have more revenue, not poorer revenues, but in which the funding stream comes from a greater variety of sources than the public sector.</para><para>Let me turn to the equity issue. The less reliance you place on opportunities to explore the introduction of private capital into university funding, the greater the risk that you will impose more burdens on students. The HECS system, which was introduced by the Labor government and has been maintained by this government, is still in international terms a system of funding for students which guarantees equity. It means that anyone, regardless of their socio-economic status, regardless of their background, as long as they achieve the entry standards, can be the beneficiary of an interest free loan which is then repayable years into the future at a time when they have the capacity to pay, and not before. There was no inequity in the concept of the HECS scheme when it was introduced by the Labor government, nor as it has been continued by this government.</para><para>I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, if universities need more funds, if we do not want to impose any greater burden on students—and we do not, for obvious equity reasons—and if the Commonwealth contribution is being maintained at real levels but there is private capital, particularly for the research capacities of universities, that can be attracted to universities as it is in the great research universities, particularly in the United States, is that not a line of public policy that any responsible government would wish to pursue? Please, Senator Carr, do not give us the socialist rhetoric. Let us not have the zero sum game between private capital and public capital. Universities are great public institutions. They work for the public good.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>26253</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— There is a crisis in higher education in Australia, and it is time that the Prime Minister admitted it and it is also time that Dr Kemp admitted it. They also need to admit that it is as a result of this government's policies that we are in this situation. It is not just me saying this. We have people such as Professor Ian Chubb and the other vice-chancellors supporting the notion. And what is Dr Kemp's response? To shoot the messenger. Dr Kemp does not do it himself, however; he sends in his first assistant secretary in the higher education division of the Commonwealth education department, Mr Mike Gallagher, to do the job. In response to a question from Senator Carr on 13 August following up the position that both vice-chancellors had put to the Senate committee inquiring into higher education—and that is that the university system is in crisis—Mr Gallagher said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>It is an interesting thesis, but there is probably an inverse relationship between those that make that allegation and their management competence. If there are critical pressures on universities, they reflect the inadequacy of the management of the universities to deal with the problems they have.</para></quote><para>Shooting the messenger. According to Catriona Jackson of the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, Dr Kemp subsequently wrote to Professor Chubb's colleagues expressing his displeasure at Professor Chubb's comments. She said: </para><quote><para>Several Vice Chancellors have since been notably cautious about using what some now call the “C” word. </para></quote><para>The `C' word. Is that `C' as in crisis or `C' as in censure? The answer is both. Vice-chancellors are speaking about a crisis while the Howard government at the same time is trying to censure them. This is so typical of this government. According to the government, universities are no longer about education; universities apparently are about management. When eminent people raise concerns about education this government accuses them of being poor managers. Doesn't Dr Kemp understand that this managerial approach to higher education is the reason that we are having this discussion? It is so typical of the government to shoot the messenger when real issues are raised.</para><para>The crisis in higher education is a direct result of this government's policy. It has cut funding to higher education to the lowest levels in history. This has undermined the ability of universities to conduct sound research and their ability to teach effectively. Professor John Quiggan, Australian Research Council fellow of the department of economics at the Australian National University, expressed this succinctly in his submission to the inquiry when he said:</para><quote><para>Although the causes of this crisis are complex, the most important single factor is poor government policy. Not only have governments reduced expenditure on education relative to GDP when a rational assessment of our economic needs would dictate higher expenditure, but the diminished resources available to the system have been, to a significant extent, dissipated in the pursuit of ideological agendas and managerial fads.</para></quote><para>What is particularly concerning is not only the decline in funding to higher education in Australia but also the change in that funding mix. We all know that this government is driven by economic ideology, education policy included. So, when universities raise more money through HECS or foreign students, they cut back the public contributions to higher education. We are hearing of the Americanisation of the health system under way by this government. Dr Kemp obviously has the same ideological approach to higher education. Professor Simon Marginson, director of the Monash Centre for Research in Education, in his submission to the Senate inquiry stated:</para><quote><para>Whereas governments provided 90 per cent of funding in 1983 and 70.3 per cent in 1989, by 1998 its share was 51.9 per cent.</para></quote><para>Dr Kemp no doubt thinks that 50 per cent public funding for higher education is too much. Dr Kemp is leading us down the American path, and Senator Brandis in his contribution earlier today seems to think that this is a good idea. </para><para>The Howard government's pursuit of an economic rationalist university system has been particularly damaging to the sciences and humanities in our universities. We have seen the expansion of business and economics schools at the expense of other disciplines. These faculties more easily attract wealthy fee paying students, particularly overseas students. This, though, has often occurred at the expense of opportunities for domestic students. When you place managers in charge of universities they chase dollars, not learning.</para><para>Unfortunately, this is also the case in Queensland, where our universities in order to continue to operate have had to increasingly market themselves overseas. The Queensland government has said that 15,000 funded places are required now in order to maintain current participation rates and accommodate predicted growth. This is a crisis in my state. Proportionally, Queensland is second only to Tasmania as having the lowest number of postgraduate places in the country. This is exacerbated in high growth areas like the Gold Coast. This crisis does not stop with research and teaching; facilities are also suffering under this government's misdirected priorities. James Cook University's music school in Townsville has two grand pianos sitting directly under a leaking roof. This might not be a problem to Dr Kemp, but he does not understand North Queensland and our tropical climate.</para><para>Funding cuts are also putting pressure on the quality of education delivered. We have seen a substantial increase in student numbers during recent years with no corresponding increase in staff numbers. How do you make more money? You increase the student-staff ratio. Do not worry about the quality of the education your system is providing. Profit is the key performance indicator in Dr Kemp's education system. The National Tertiary Education Union branch from the University of Sydney in its submission to the inquiry stated: </para><quote><para>Funding is clearly inadequate to meet demand. Effects are visible through staff shortages:</para></quote><para>·	Students are queuing for up to 7 hours to obtain information or vary enrolments.</para><para>·	There are insufficient staff within Faculties, Schools and Departments to provide students with advice concerning their courses and units of study.</para><para>·	There is severe overcrowding in classrooms, to the extent that Health and Safety requirements are not being adhered to and students are not receiving a sufficient level of individual attention from teachers.</para><para>If this is the case at Sydney university, how do you think universities in regional and rural Australia are faring? They are in crisis, Dr Kemp. We are seeing an expansion of the managerial sector in universities under the Kemp ideology. Professor Quiggan in his submission points out that a study by Marginson and Considine in the year 2000 of 17 universities found that the total number of deputy vice-chancellors and pro vice-chancellors had risen from 19 in 1987 to 69 in 1998. He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Allowing for three personal support staff for each senior manager, the additional employment associated with these extra managers is around 600 positions, or about the number of academic staff in a medium size university.</para></quote><para>Dr Kemp is complaining about managerial competence, yet he has invested heavily in it. The fact is that he is missing the point. Universities should be about education, not management. This ideology has also had a significant impact on research at universities. Academic staff are increasingly having to shift their focus from research to teaching in order to raise necessary funds. Research has also become more outcomes focused to service economic rather than educational needs. This has meant a decline in the level of research carried out at universities. It has meant a decline in the level of groundbreaking research at universities.</para><para>Research is a cooperative endeavour. Science today is built on the knowledge of those who have come before us. The current research paradigm, however, limits the ability of scientists to undertake research that has no immediate monetary outcome. There has been a real decline in blue-sky research not only in our universities but also in our research organisations, including CSIRO. The frightening thing is that research generates real jobs and real income in Australia. Labor look forward to a time when they can return education to its important place in our community. Kim Beazley is committed to building a knowledge nation. Labor know that the crisis in higher education has to be averted, and we will work to that end.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>26255</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— The urgency motion moved by Senator Carr this afternoon, like those previously moved by Senator Carr and others opposite, fails to recognise the tremendous progress that has been made in the tertiary sector since 1996.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Is that what you call it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name></talker><para>—Senator Carr, I would like you to listen quietly while I explain it to you.

Mr Gallagher is right when he says that there is no crisis in the tertiary sector. The situation we have here—which for political reasons Senator Carr seems happy to exploit—is one where certain individuals are finding it difficult to adjust to a new, open and more market based environment.

This figure is not only higher than the OECD average but a higher proportion of GDP than in both the United Kingdom and Germany. </para></talk.start></continue><para>One of this government's key education policies has been to encourage universities to seek much greater private funding to complement the amount they receive from the Australian taxpayers. This approach has strengthened the independence of universities and allowed them access to far greater amounts of revenue. Indeed, the total funding that our nation's universities will receive from all sources in 2001 is estimated to be a record $9.5 billion. This is around $1.24 billion more than was available to universities in Labor's last year in government just five years ago. Why is Senator Carr so reluctant to acknowledge this increased funding? Why is Senator Carr also not applauding the fact that there are now 30,000 more undergraduate students in our university system than there were five years ago when Labor lost power?</para><para>University offers this year have risen by 2.3 per cent compared to the previous year, with the number of unsuccessful applicants dropping by 14.4 per cent nationally. Australian universities are in fact enjoying high enrolment numbers and expect that applications will actually reach more than 580,000 full-time places by the year 2003. This is a 30 per cent increase in enrolments since 1995—not a bad rate, I would have thought. Despite this, those opposite have consistently argued that our changes to the HECS system would mean fewer people would be able to go to university.

I would respectfully suggest to Senator Carr that he could more usefully be applying his education focus if he were to have a word with his leader, Mr Kim Beazley.

I trained as an economist; I should admit that. Economics is not a religion. It is merely a tool to achieve an end, and that end is a stable and prosperous civil society. For 20 years in this country the interests of the markets have been placed ahead of the interests of Australian society. That has shaken the very basis of Australia's sense of community to its core. Nobel Prize winning economist Amartya Sen has been very critical of the blind pursuit of economic growth without seeing human freedom as the real end objective. Development should be seen `as a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy'. He writes: </para><quote><para>Development requires the removal of the sources of unfreedom, poverty as well as tyranny, poor economic opportunities as well as systematic social deprivation, neglect of public facilities as well as intolerance or overactivity of repressive states.</para></quote><para>That means a quality free public education and health system that delivers freedom of opportunity. It means a legal system that respects and defends basic freedoms, a government dedicated to promoting the freedoms of all of its peoples and a social safety net that delivers freedom from need. It means recognising and minimising the full costs to the environment so that future generations of Australians enjoy the freedom to live in a sustainable environment without debilitating environmental repair bills.</para><para>These are the core beliefs of the Democrats—socially sustainable economics, environmentally sustainable economics, and an emphasis on defending and restoring freedom. These are the fundamentals on which Australia's sense of community, social cohesion and long-term economic prosperity should be built. Unrestrained economic rationalism pits individuals against individuals, towns against towns, countries against countries in an unrelenting race to the bottom. The winners are those who can compete, such as increasingly larger transnational corporations. The losers are ultimately the poor, the uneducated, the marginalised, the voiceless and, too often, those living in rural areas.</para><para>My predecessor, Senator John Woodley, was a tireless campaigner for these groups, for the true Australian battlers. His compassion, his fierce commitment to social justice, and his humanity will be greatly missed in this house. On behalf of the Queensland division of the Democrats, I wish to thank John Woodley for his wonderful work for the party and for Queensland, and wish him and Marie well in his well-earned retirement. One of John's last campaigns was to support struggling dairy farmers facing hardship because of the national competition policy inspired deregulation of the dairy industry. This was a classic case of short-term economic objectives being placed ahead of the long-term sustainability of rural communities.</para><para>A recent ACCC report on dairying claimed that consumers had been the winners from dairy deregulation because of a fall in the retail price of milk since full dairy deregulation in July 2000, but the report ignored the fact that milk prices had risen by more than inflation in the previous four years during which retail prices were progressively deregulated. Since 1995, the retail price of milk has risen by 14.6 per cent and the price of other dairy products has risen by 24.3 per cent, but the price paid to dairy farmers for milk at the farm gate in the same period fell by 10.8 per cent. What sort of an economic policy allows very large increases in retail prices paid by consumers when the return to the rural producers on the same product is falling? What is happening to the agricultural, the processing, the wholesaling and the retailing sectors of our economy to produce such a perverse result? </para><para>But wait, it gets worse. The retail price of bread has risen by 17.3 per cent since 1995 while the prices paid to wheat farmers have fallen by 19 per cent. The retail price of lamb has risen by 10 per cent while the price paid to graziers has fallen by 16 per cent. The retail price of pork has risen by 17 per cent, four times faster than the prices paid to pork producers. The retail price of fruit has risen by 17 per cent, but prices paid to fruit growers rose by only 3.6 per cent. The retail price of vegetables has risen by 23.5 per cent while prices paid to growers fell by nine per cent. Ask the Tasmanian potato growers what they think about that one. The retail price of eggs has risen by 16.4 per cent while producer prices fell by 13.5 per cent. Are Australian eggs so much better packaged today that they are worth 16 per cent more than they were worth five years ago? These prices are evidence of serious market failure. It is a market failure that is beggaring our rural communities. It is also costing Australian consumers on the most fundamental of commodities—the food they eat.</para><para>I was first attracted to this issue by complaints from families about the rising price of food which, of course, was being blamed on the GST. The Democrats are very proud of the fact that we got the GST taken off food groceries. Research by the ACCC, Econtech and the Australian Consumers Association shows that the introduction of the GST did not affect food grocery prices as predicted. So why did food prices rise five per cent in the last year, one to two per cent more than the underlying inflation rate? Why did food prices rise faster than the inflation rate in three of the four years preceding the GST, despite national competition policy inspired deregulation? Why, according to the World Bank, were Australian consumers already spending a higher proportion of their income on food than the consumers of the US, Germany, the UK, Canada or Hong Kong? Why such a raw deal for consumers and producers when Australia is one of the most efficient food producers in the world, with one of the lowest levels of agricultural subsidies, and when prices paid to farmers were falling sharply? QUT economist Mark McGovern has been tracking this trend and he writes:  </para><quote><para>This paradox warrants investigation. What happens between the farm gate and the consumer plate? </para></quote><para>The declining bargaining power of rural producers, evidenced by the recent Tasmanian potato growers' protests, needs to be carefully analysed. Is it related to the fact, as Dick Smith points out, that 85 per cent of the food in our supermarkets comes from foreign owned food manufacturers or imports? Is it related to the dominance of the Coles-Woolworths-Franklins supermarket oligopoly with an 80 per cent market share of the food groceries market?</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Choice</inline> magazine's supermarket price survey recently reported that `there is hardly any difference at all between the three major chains'. In fact, the two major chains have reported strong increases in revenue and profitability. A recent ACCC survey showed that returns on assets and equity for Australian supermarkets were rising when returns on US and UK retailers were falling.</para><para>Nothing is more fundamental than the price of food. Australian households spend some $44 billion a year on food. Food makes up a quarter of the spending of low income earners. When social security payments are indexed only to CPI, are payments adequate to keep low income Australians out of poverty when food prices keep rising faster than CPI? What is happening to the fattening margin between prices at the farm gate and the consumer plate?</para><para>This looks like a real scandal, a scandal that affects every household in Australia. We are all paying more than we probably should for food, and we need to know why. In the United States, where similar trends are evident, the questions are now being asked. The US Senate and the new agriculture secretary Ann Vennemann are considering proposals to apply antitrust laws to the agribusiness sector, to address the consolidation of ownership, and the imbalance in marketing power that that creates.</para><para>That debate is yet to start in Australia. I believe that a full independent inquiry, maybe even a royal commission, is needed into food prices. That inquiry needs to look not just at the economic issues of the widening margins but also at the social impacts that falling producer returns are having on rural communities. The hard questions are yet to be asked. The hard questions need to be answered. I see part of the role of the Australian Democrats as asking the hard questions no-one else is prepared to ask, as representing the minorities that no-one else is prepared to represent, and as presenting forward thinking policy solutions that no-one else is yet prepared to consider.</para><para>Australian business is constantly exhorted to adopt world best practice in business and economic policy. The Australian Democrats believe that governments should be adopting world best practice in public policy as well. The triple bottom line of balancing environment, social and economic needs is now world best practice in public policy. Best practice is no longer small government retiring from the field of policy and leaving it to the market. Best practice is now about governments investing heavily in quality public education systems; public health systems; state-of-the-art infrastructure; research and development; environmental repair; and proactive industry, social and regional initiatives.  </para><para>Best practice is not about government doing it all on its own. Rather, best practice is about putting in place the appropriate carrots, and the appropriate sticks, to ensure that private sector investment is directed towards national policy goals. Best practice is the sort of proactive government action that lifted countries like Ireland, Finland and the Netherlands from double-digit unemployment and high debt to the top five on the World Competitiveness Index in a decade. Leading economist Peter Brain argues that Australia needs to learn from overseas economic success stories by recognising the key role that the public sector should play. He writes:</para><quote><para>Securing the future will require a government leadership role, an operational performance and public integrity to match the Dutch; a creativity in the approach to industry development policy to match the Taiwanese, and a vision adopted for the development of industry, and its complex, flexible interactions with the community to match the Americans.</para></quote><para>I believe that Australia should not settle for an unemployment rate of seven per cent as the best we can do, as this government has done. Ireland has an unemployment rate of 3.8 per cent; the Netherlands, 2.3 per cent. Employment growth is achievable if we give greater priority to people in the setting of national policy objectives. At present, Australia has seven unemployed persons for every job vacancy. No amount of Job Network matching, of training programs or of breaching can change that cold, hard arithmetic.</para><para>I believe that employment must be given at least equal, and occasionally first, priority over fighting inflation in national economic goals. That might occasionally mean bucking the financial markets. But, as a key architect of financial deregulation Fred Argy has said, if the government makes it clear it is pursuing achievable and reasonable longer term goals, a little bit of short-term market criticism is manageable.</para><para>Above my desk is a photograph of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a hero to my father and a continuing inspiration to me. Roosevelt showed that politics can change people's lives for the better, that there is more to governing than just managing, and that having the courage to push through a change agenda against overwhelming odds can prevail. In his final year, he said:</para><quote><para>The only limit to our realisation of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.</para></quote><para>Australia needs to broaden the boundaries of acceptable political debate. We need to shed our economic rationalist straitjacket and catch up with the cutting edge policy debates now occurring in other parts of the world. We need to overcome our doubts about our national direction and boldly confront the future with clear, agreed national goals, backed up by properly funded, and directed, public and private investment. We need to put our people and our natural environment first and foremost in national goals, and use the economy as a tool to achieve those goals rather than the other way around. That way, we can ensure that there is a bright tomorrow for the next generation of Australians.</para><para>The Democrats are a party with our eyes fixed firmly on tomorrow. That is why I am so proud to stand with this party today as its newest senator. I wish to thank the many people who have contributed to getting me here, especially my mother, Joan, and family, who are here today and who have always been there for me. To my long-suffering partner, Nicky, her extraordinary mother, Pam, and her family: I thank you for your understanding, for your long years of work in defence of human and indigenous rights, and for opening my mind to the importance of these issues.</para><para>To the Queensland Democrat division, particularly Marianne Dickie, I thank you for the great confidence you have placed in me. And to my staff, Kate, Rose and Heather, and the staff of the Senate, thank you for all your wonderful help to date, and a heartfelt apology for all the stress and angst I am sure to cause you in the future. Finally, to my Democrat Senate colleagues, thank you for welcoming me, and for keeping up the good fight against such overwhelming odds. The Democrat senators are all in my view exceptional people, and I am very proud to have taken a seat with them.</para><para>The Democrats are a small party, run almost entirely by volunteers. But with the declining voter share of the two major parties, I believe the Democrats are set to play an increasingly important role in the realignment of Australian politics. Slowly, we are moving away from the tired two-party system to a system where more voices are being heard, and where governing will require greater emphasis on consensus building, and listening to community concerns. </para><para>It is an exciting time to be starting my work as a new Democrat senator. I look forward to the challenge ahead of helping to change politics, and of developing a new politics where the long-term gets a mention, and where the voice of the community rings louder than the voice of corporate cronies. As Margaret Mead once sagely commented:</para><quote><para>Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.

Taken by themselves, each of the amendments contained in this bill is relatively insignificant. However, taken as a package, they represent an important updating of the four Acts.  I will consider each Schedule of the bill in turn.</para><para>Schedule 1 will amend the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Act 1989 (the LLMC Act).  The LLMC Act implements in Australia the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976 (the 1976 Convention).</para><para>In brief, the 1976 Convention allows a shipowner or salvor to limit the total amount of damages they can be required to pay for damages caused by the ship, the shipowner or the salvor in accordance with limits set out in the 1976 Convention.  Liability limits increase with the size of a ship.  The 1976 Convention has been amended by a 1996 Protocol to increase liability limits and to provide for a simpler method for future increases to liability limits.  The bill will amend the LLMC Act to implement the 1996 Protocol.</para><para>The amendment to the LLMC Act is expressed to commence on a date to be proclaimed.  Proclamation will not occur before Australia has become a party to the 1996 Protocol and the Protocol has taken effect internationally.  The passage of this legislation is one of the domestic requirements before Australia becomes a party.</para><para>The 1996 Protocol will not take effect internationally until ninety days after at least ten countries become parties to it.  As at 28 February 2001 only four countries (Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, Finland and Norway) were parties.</para><para>By reversing the effects of twenty years of inflation, the increase in liability limits made by the 1996 Protocol will provide a reasonable level of compensation in the case of an accident involving a ship while not making the limits so high that shipowners will not be able to obtain insurance coverage.</para><para>Schedule 2 of the bill will amend the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981 to revise the list of chemicals in respect of which the Australian Maritime Safety Authority may take “intervention action” on the high seas, in the exclusive economic zone or in the territorial sea.  Such action may be taken to prevent or reduce pollution if a chemical  has escaped, or is likely to escape, from a ship.  The intervention action may range from moving the ship to another place to, in an extreme case, sinking the ship. </para><para>The revision to the list of chemicals is in accordance with a Resolution of the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization, taking into account new chemicals now being carried by ships in bulk.</para><para>Schedule 3 of the bill will make a number of amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 (the Pollution Prevention Act) which gives effect to the operational provisions of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships, commonly known as MARPOL.  I will briefly refer to the more important of the amendments to the Pollution Prevention Act.</para><para>The requirement to include the text of Conventions in Schedules to the Pollution Prevention Act has been removed.  There are fourteen Schedules which contain the original MARPOL Convention of 1973, the Protocol of 1978 and eleven separate amendments to that Protocol, and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.  The inclusion of amendments to MARPOL in Schedules to the Act does not provide an easily understood version of the text of MARPOL as in force in Australia at a particular time.  Further, the inclusion of the text of the Conventions in the Schedules is misleading as it can give the false impression that this is the latest text of any amendments - that is not so.  The removal of the Schedules will not disadvantage users as the text of MARPOL is readily available in written form from specialist maritime booksellers and in electronic form.</para><para>Requirements relating to the disposal of garbage have been inserted in Annex V of MARPOL.  The new sections 26FA to 26FD will give effect to those requirements.  Australian ships of 400 tons or more which are certified to carry 15 or more persons will be required to have a shipboard waste management plan and to carry and maintain a garbage record book.  These provisions are designed to complement existing provisions restricting the disposal of garbage from a ship and are intended to ensure that the oceans are not polluted by ship's garbage.  In addition, every ship of 12 metres or more in length will be required to display placards to inform passengers and crew about the restrictions that apply to the disposal of garbage from the ship.</para><para>Incident reporting requirements are being expanded to require ships of 15 metres or more in length to report any incident that affects the safety of the ship or results in an impairment of the safety of navigation, thereby having the potential to result in pollution.  This is an improvement over current arrangements where incident reports are required only when the master determines that there is a probability of pollution.</para><para>Members of the Australian Federal Police are routinely appointed as inspectors under the Pollution Prevention Act during investigations into marine pollution incidents.  Inspectors have a number of powers (including going on board a ship, inspecting any parts of a ship and requiring a person to answer questions) for the purpose of ascertaining whether the Pollution Prevention Act has been complied with and, in the case of a foreign ship, whether MARPOL has been complied with.</para><para>The definition of “inspector” is being amended to include a member or special member of the Australian Federal Police.  The amendment will reduce administrative procedures at the time of an incident by removing the need for specific appointments of AFP members as inspectors.</para><para>Occasionally, when marine surveyors from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority are conducting ship inspections, it becomes clear that the amount of waste on board the ship at that time - such as oily waste or garbage - is such that the ship would have to discharge some of the waste at sea before reaching its next port of call.  The bill includes amendments that will enable surveyors, where it is reasonable to do so, to require waste to be discharged from the ship to a suitable discharge facility.  This is another small but important step to help reduce the amount of waste discharged from ships into the oceans.  There are waste reception facilities at more than fifty ports in Australia, although not all facilities can accept all types of waste.</para><para>Some of the offence and penalty provisions of the Pollution Prevention Act are being revised.  One of the most significant of these changes relates to the disposal or discharge of, for example, oil or garbage, into the sea.  Currently, it is only the master or owner of a ship who can be prosecuted for an offence.  The relevant penalty provisions have been rewritten to provide that any person whose reckless or negligent conduct caused a discharge is guilty of an offence.  Where a discharge is not the result of reckless or negligent conduct, the owner and master will be strictly liable but, in that case, the maximum penalty is lower.  There are a number of defences set out in the relevant provisions of the Act.  For example, there is no offence if a discharge occurs for the purpose of securing the safety of the ship or saving life at sea or the discharge occurs in accordance with the strict conditions set out in MARPOL. </para><para>Finally, I mention the amendments to the Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act 1963, set out in Schedule 4 of the bill.  That Act gives effect to Australia's international obligations to make it an offence if a submarine cable or pipeline is damaged by an Australian-flagged ship in the exclusive economic zone or the high seas.  The amendments included in this bill reflect the wording of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which Australia has been a party since November 1994.  In its present form, the Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act reflects the wording of the redundant 1958 Convention on the High Seas.  The amendments simply include a specific reference to the exclusive economic zone in the Act and do not have any effect on the application of the Act.</para></quote><para>—————</para><para>FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</para><quote><para>The Finance and Administration Legislation Amendment (Application of the Criminal Code) Bill 2001 amends eight Acts administered by the Finance and Administration portfolio. These Acts are the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, the Superannuation Act 1922, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 and the Public Works Committee Act 1969.</para></quote><para>The Bill makes amendments to those Acts to reflect the application of Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code, which contains the general principles of criminal responsibility, to offence provisions under all Commonwealth Acts from 15 December 2001. The Bill follows on from the Government's decision to harmonise all Commonwealth Acts with the Criminal Code on a portfolio by portfolio basis to provide greater consistency and clarify of criminal offences in Australia.</para><para>Schedule 1 amends existing offence provisions under the various Commonwealth superannuation Acts to ensure that they will operate in the same manner when Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code applies or in a manner which is consistent with Commonwealth criminal law policy. The proposed changes involve imposing the lighter evidential burden of proof on a defendant and expressly stating time limits to satisfy requirements under offence provisions in the Acts. The proposed amendments will not introduce any new criminal offences under the various Commonwealth superannuation Acts.</para><para>The Bill will also update maximum penalties in the various superannuation Acts to ensure that they are appropriate and conform with the principles of the Crimes Act 1914. Changes proposed in this respect include converting penalties from a dollar amount to penalty units.</para><para>Schedule 1A of the Bill proposes amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 to ensure that the offence provisions under these Acts continue to operate in the same manner when the Criminal Code commences. Further, the Bill will repeal a small number of offences from the Referendum Act that can now be adequately prosecuted under the Criminal Code. The Bill will restructure certain offences in both Acts to clarify the interpretation of those offences. The proposed amendments will not introduce any new criminal offences under either the Commonwealth Electoral Act or the Referendum Act.</para><para>Schedule 2 of the Bill proposes amendments to the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 and the Public Works Committee Act 1969 to provide for the application of Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code to these Acts. A number of minor amendments to sections in these Acts, which contain descriptions of specific offences, are included so that these offences continue to operate in the same way but also comply with the Criminal Code.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ludwig</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CYBERCRIME BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>26263</page.no><id.no>R1360</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title><page.no>26263</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>26263</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Payne, I present the report of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Cybercrime Bill 2001, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000 [2001]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>26264</page.no><id.no>S283</id.no></debateinfo></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL BILL 2000 [2001]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>26264</page.no><id.no>S284</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000 [2001]</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>S285</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>26264</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 9 August, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>26264</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Senate is debating the <inline ref="S283">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 [2001]</inline>, the <inline ref="S284">Australian Heritage Council Bill 2000 [2001]</inline> and the <inline ref="S285">Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2000 [2001]</inline>. I read the titles of those bills out because they are evocative titles that point the way to a very important debate in this chamber. These bills attend to the great matters of the hearts and souls of Australians. They deal with Australia's environment, with Australia's history and with the monuments that are in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>It is proper to pause in that context to acknowledge the considerable speech of Senator Cherry and to take the occasion to call to mind former senator John Woodley, whom Senator Cherry replaced. Senator Woodley was a man of great heart, of great soul and of great compassion. He was a person of considerable eloquence and of great courage. I would like to put that on the record.</para><para>The <inline ref="S283">Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 [2001]</inline> deals with the machinery of the way things of great value to Australians are to be saved. It amends a piece of legislation that we put through earlier in this parliament, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The act seeks to preserve the animals, the birds and the other living life of Australia, including its plants.</para><para>A great tragedy occurred in Australia in the 1930s, when the thylacine, the Tasmanian tiger, was `squandered'. I do not think there is any other word I can use for what happened. The thylacine was a great symbol of a great state and it has now disappeared. It need never have disappeared. Think of the snaring that took place. It is just a tragedy. There was a bounty put upon the thylacine. It is disastrous for Australia that we in the 21st century are without a great symbol of Tasmania, a great symbol of Australia. The thylacine is no longer with us because we, as a nation, squandered it. It is a tragedy, and the thylacine is only one of many animals that we have let go.</para><para>It is not only animals but also buildings that have disappeared. Keeping the Tasmanian theme going, in 1833 or 1834, the Henty family sailed from Tasmania. Senator Mackay, one of the great Tasmanian senators, is here, and she would remember this. The Henty family sailed over from Launceston and founded the first town in Victoria, Portland. Beautiful buildings were built there. Some of them still remain, thank heavens, but some were pulled down in the 1950s. It is a great shame. When we go down there, we see buildings, yes, but not the buildings that could have been preserved had things taken a different course in the 1950s. Another great town in Victoria is Beechworth. It is full of historical buildings. Ned Kelly, that great icon of Australian life, was held prisoner in the jail there for a while. And there is the courthouse there and so on. They have been preserved, but it is dreadful to see places which are now empty of great monuments that were previously there. </para><para>The legislation we are discussing here seeks to set up a scheme that is going to preserve these great traditions of Australian history. The big thing about this debate is that it is not about, as people call it, the bottom line of the economy. It is proper that that should be so. When Banjo Paterson wrote <inline font-style="italic">The Man from Snowy River</inline>, he was not concerned that the colt that got away was worth $1,000. That was put there just to indicate that the colt was a very valuable colt. What he was concerned to show was that great spirit of Australian life: the spirit of adventure and the spirit of going down the mountainside with considerable courage, with calculated risk, with pride, with skill, with drive—the sorts of things we like to think are part of the Australian spirit. There is an Australian spirit which it is absolutely essential to preserve, to develop and to nurture. Australia is a proud country and we look to these monuments to point to that. With Senator Mackay here, I am reminded that Tasmania is full of great buildings, great traditional houses, beautiful rivers and great mountains, particularly down the west coast, where a lot of my forebears came from— down around Zeehan, Macquarie Harbour and Strahan. There are also the great rainforests down there which we must preserve. </para><para>I have been talking about the natural environment we live in and the great buildings we have. But there are also great historical institutions that ought to be preserved. I would like to mention several. I see the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, here, so we will start off with Ballarat, a great Victorian town, where the Eureka Stockade took place on 3 December 1854. The great Peter Lalor led a multicultural force against men purporting to be representatives of law and order. Ballarat is famous not only for Eureka but also for its buildings, including a fine art gallery. There are some beautiful buildings there.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator Lightfoot</name></talker><para>—And Geoffrey Blainey.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—And Geoffrey Blainey.

Before I leave the subject of Ballarat, I want to pay tribute to a couple of recent arrivals from Vietnam, Henry and Sandra Thai, who have a restaurant in Ballarat. The reason I acknowledge them is that they restored the Chinese cemetery there. We have mentioned Mr Ronaldson. He, amongst others, had much to do with this. The Chinese cemeteries go back to the time of the gold rushes in the 1850s. If you look in the cemeteries at the causes of death, there is real tragedy there. There were a lot of suicides. Times were very hard. It is proper that we accept the good and the bad part, the dark and the light side of our history. The Chinese cemetery in Ballarat is an indication of that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other story that I would like to tell is about the Chinese in the nearby town of Ararat. In those days, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, Victoria made it very difficult for the Chinese to go to the goldfields, so they used to land in Robe—I acknowledge the beauty of Robe in South Australia—and walk overland. In May 1857, some hundreds of Chinese came across from Robe on their way to Clunes—which is a great place too. They got to Ararat where, looking for some water, they came across one of the great alluvial goldfields of Victoria—Victoria had many a great goldfield—indeed of Australia, the Canton Lead. So Ararat was a town established by the Chinese. In that context, I mention a memorial building, the Gum San, which means `hill of gold', that has recently been built, in accordance with Chinese architecture, and Mr Don Reynolds of Ararat, who unfortunately died before it was completed. Catherine—or Rene—Reynolds is still alive, and I would like to acknowledge the work that she and particularly Don did. That building is again a symbol of the pride that many Australians take in the history of Australia.</para><para>From the east to the west and from the north to the south of Australia, one sees that it is teeming with natural beauty, with natural monuments and with buildings which are symbols of the place that have been built by our forebears. I look at Tasmania—I am fixed on Tasmania but that is where I was born—and the great convict history of Australia that Marcus Clarke wrote about in <inline font-style="italic">For the Term of His Natural Life,</inline> which no doubt everybody has read. All these things I think we feel pride in. We are uplifted by them— the soul sours up; the heart rises—because they are things that we see as symbolising what Australia is all about. They give us encouragement to go on as a decent and united community, with the great aspirations that we want. These are the things that are perhaps not debated in this chamber as much as they should be. In here we usually talk about interest rates, about how much money we are going to give a particular group, about how much money we are going to collect and about how much money we are going to spend—all of which is essential, because without a reasonable amount of income things will become uncomfortable. These bills are about—and we will get into the technical matter when we go into committee—something more important than just the accumulation of wealth. These bills are about the accumulations of great memories, the accumulations of the soul, the aspirations we have and the accumulations of those humanising factors that we all so strongly believe in.  </para><para>Whether you are looking at the Sydney Harbour Bridge—we from the south have to concede the great buildings of Sydney—or the Opera House, whether you are walking along Macquarie Street where you see historic buildings such as the Parliament House, the hospital and the old convict barracks and so on, whether you go to the Blue Mountains to look at the natural beauty there or whether you go further south to Victoria to see its beautiful Parliament House—as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President—particularly the Legislative Council chambers or St Patrick's Cathedral or St Paul's Cathedral—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—What about the MCG?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—Thank you.

God forbid anybody would try to destroy or in any way damage these great attributes of ours. This is what this legislation is all about. I might have a go at this when we get to the committee stage debate, because a lot of this regulation is left to subordinate legislation and many a judgment falls upon the minister. The minister is from South Australia, which has some great icons, but is he on his own able to grasp the whole broad breadth of this and take into account the matters that should be preserved? He will preserve a lot, but will he preserve it all? He is always gracious in his discussions, and we will discuss this during the committee stage.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—You cannot preserve it all.

There are places that, unless you knew the history, you might not preserve. There is a church in Ballarat—since I see the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, here—called St Alipius. I have driven past St Alipius on several occasions and I took it to be just a parish church. But Anne Lynch tells me— and I accept it because it is very important—that that was where Peter Lalor was taken after he was wounded at Eureka. So what looks like just another church is a historic building because that is where the great leader Peter Lalor was taken after his wounding. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I could and, in a sense, should go on but time has caught up with me.

To begin with I must say that I agree with and echo a lot of the sentiments expressed by Senator Cooney. I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate Senator John Cherry on the connection that was made with this in his first speech, and to acknowledge the work undertaken by former senator John Woodley in relation to heritage issues in this country. This is something that he has been involved with and has had a personal interest in for quite some time, and that has been most appreciated by indigenous people across the country. I know that he was directly involved not just with issues that arose in relation to the Native Title Act, which is impinged upon in terms of understanding the possible consequences of the amendment bill, but also issues relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act and various inquiries that have gone on for quite some time to try to define and come up with answers on the appropriate balance and the appropriate context in which to acknowledge things concerning heritage and, more particularly, indigenous cultural heritage in this country. </para></talk.start><para>So this is of particular importance to me and, as part of the debate on this issue, there is an amendment that I have circulated.

The first two centres were opened in northern Tasmania in May 1998. With the recent opening of the Kingston centre near Hobart, there are now 64 online access centres operating in Tasmania. This completes the establishment of the Tasmanian Communities Online Network, which provides Tasmanians in rural and remote areas local access to, and training in, the use of information technology and the Internet.</para></talk.start><para>These are community based and managed facilities, are often housed in a library or school building and have at least two multimedia computers, a printer and a scanner. Users have access to a variety of software applications, can open email accounts and search the vast resources of the Internet with some one-to-one assistance from a friendly coordinator and trained volunteers.</para><para>From the start, usage of online access centres has a record of continual increase. As at 30 June 2001, 345,000 Tasmanians living outside metropolitan areas have easy access to an OAC located in their community. This represents about 75 per cent of all Tasmanians. Almost 36,000 Tasmanians have registered as users with about 12,000 registering in the past year. Over 525,000 one-hour bookings of computers have been made, and 925 volunteers have contributed over 140,000 hours of support to the centres.</para><para>With some 36,000 registered users, these OACs are assisting to nurture a network of rural and regional communities that are vibrant, diverse and connected to each other. Support for initiatives such as Seniors Week, regular statewide chat sessions and organised online gaming tournaments for youth are fostered, bringing communities closer together. These OACs provide Tasmanians with the opportunity to access government and business services, communicate with business and government and participate in decisions that affect their lives.</para><para>The importance of these centres is further reinforced by the fact that, in 1999, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Tasmania was ranked the lowest of all states in the home ownership of computers and in the use of the Internet. As information technology skills increase in importance, this trend could have resulted in a considerable socioeconomic disadvantage, especially in rural and isolated communities. Consequently, the continued operation of these OACs provides a direct and effective means for addressing the needs of these communities into the future. That is a great initiative of the coalition government.</para><para>All centres provide business access training and support, including training in the use of spreadsheet and accounting software, and support with desktop publishing and researching product and other business information is regularly provided. </para><para>This is a unique partnership with the Tasmanian central portal and Telstra in providing Tasmanian micro-business with a low cost entry into the world of e-commerce through the local centre. To date, over 100 businesses have used this webpage hosting service provided through the centres, which has enabled the centres to establish another income stream by providing such a service. Centres have also established partnerships with a diverse range of businesses which have resulted in, for example, the King Island centre providing `The Beef Group' with access to the centre to use email, et cetera.</para><para>The Redpa centre is now hosting stock auctions. The Tasmanian company Roberts is a partner of Calm Services, which runs online stock auctions enabling farmers to sell their cattle without hauling them to a market.</para><para>These Tasmanian online access centres are also involved in strategies that have arisen from a number of government policies and projects such as indigenous participation in online learning, online access for people with disabilities, Seniors Week and Adult Learners Week. </para><para>From the beginning of the project, partnerships with local government have been formed as councils have enthusiastically supported their local centres. Some councils have had annual reports or websites produced by the centres. These centres continue to assist many small tourist operators right across Tasmania. A major initiative in this area involves the development of a tourism portal in the Meander Valley. In a joint approach, three centres in the region were granted $90,000 through the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Science and Resources to showcase the Meander Valley region, with a comprehensive coverage of all tourism aspects, and to support businesses so that tourists could undertake a virtual tour of the region's attractions prior to visiting the area.</para><para>Centres have also been active in promoting cultural and community events in their areas, such as the Meander River Festival, the Deloraine Craft Fair and the Taste of Huon. The website of Campbell Town Arts Festival led to a number of local artworks being purchased by overseas collectors. In addition, some centres are active in producing community newspapers and newsletters.</para><para>A culture of lifelong learning is being fostered as members of rural communities use the facilities to access education and training, such as Tasmanian TAFE and Open Learning courses, to email tutors and to chat with other online students. Many centres have dedicated homework support sessions and study circles supporting students of all ages. Other clients use the vast resources of the Internet to research local history, genealogy, arts and crafts, and for a myriad of other purposes. One centre runs a personal computer club which lasts for 10 weeks each school term. This involves students from grades 10 to 12 teaching students from grades 5 and 6 how to use computers. Another centre offers Internet classes to mothers in the community.</para><para>Recently, the Scottsdale Centre hosted a day for 10 intellectually disabled participants from a nearby day care centre. Ten OAC volunteers provided one-to--one assistance in web surfing, emailing, scanning, printing photographs and listening to music. One of the visitors, a 60-year-old man who never usually speaks, was chatting with everybody by the end of the session.</para><para>The centres also host professional training sessions. To date, over 19,500 Tasmanians have undertaken more than 4,300 training courses in the use of computers and the Internet. This has enabled many to find meaningful careers and has increased their knowledge and understanding of the opportunities presented by the new technologies. A partnership with Hobart College provides local delivery of a nationally accredited IT qualification throughout the state. A significant number of people undertaking this training have subsequently found paid employment in the IT sector. That is good news.</para><para>In conjunction with TAFE, online access centres deliver one-to-one training to members of the community to access government services and payment of bills facilities through the Service Tasmania Online web site. Centres are widely used by people seeking employment. Centres have also been used by the Work for the Dole program, giving participants the opportunity to study for a certificate in information technology. Centres host activities of interest to young people, such as surf competitions and other sporting events. An increasing number of these centres are setting up clubs for children to introduce them to computers and the Internet. </para><para>Throughout the state, centres have been actively involved in promoting health programs and healthier lifestyles in their communities. Centres provide access for ethnic communities to information resources such as newspapers in their native languages. Other migrants use the centres to access information resources placed on the web by the migrant resource centres. Older persons and recent retirees have been enthusiastically using these centres. Many use the technology to email their family and friends or to access courses from the University of the Third Age.</para><para>You can see that these online access centres are not just 64 venues with computers. They are all, in their own way, contributing to the community of Tasmania as a whole. They provide computers, training and assistance to people of all ages and interests. It must be said that the Tasmanian Communities Online Project, with its original funding from this government, is truly a success story for all Tasmanians who participate in the many and varied services that these centres provide. I trust that the communities that have benefited from such centres will continue to grow as their centres expand, improve and provide even better windows to the fascinating and remarkable world of information technology, 21st century style.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Valedictory: John Woodley </title><page.no>26270</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>26270</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on this occasion to speak belatedly of the contribution of former senator John Woodley to parliamentary life as well as to the life of the nation. One of the unfortunate things about the departure of former Senator Woodley, an esteemed person and someone who embodies the idea of complete integrity, is that he never got the chance to make his final speech. On this occasion, the night of the first speech of the new senator from Queensland, John Cherry, it is also appropriate to acknowledge John Woodley. In that sense, I want to make a few remarks about him. First of all, he was born in Brisbane in 1938 and spent most of his time in and around rural Queensland. He regards himself as belonging to the bush, and he continued to display that attachment in his contribution to national life. He was elected to the Senate for Queensland in 1993 and, as we all know, finished up recently. He first became a member of the Australian Democrats in 1991 and he continues to be one. He was, at one stage, the state president of the Australian Democrats in Queensland, and he was the national ombudsman from 1988 to 1991. </para></talk.start><para>However, his public life was much more than just a list of what we would regard as political achievements. Not only was he a minister of the Methodist and Uniting churches from 1962 onwards but he was the Director for Social Responsibility of the Uniting Church and later the chaplain at Queensland University of Technology. Many things influenced his life, most of all the impact of what he saw as the growing disadvantage amongst people out there in the bush, and he continued to articulate a need for the parliament to focus its attention on addressing the circumstances in rural and regional Australia. When you look back at his first speech, it is not surprising that one of the things he spoke highly of was not just the context of rural and regional Australia but the treatment that people on the land were getting from banks. Many years ago he raised the issue of the relationship between banks and banking services and those on the land, and he advocated that these things needed to rise higher on the national agenda and to be dealt with in this parliament. Of course, we now see that the issue of rural and regional Australia and the question of banks and service provision are most topical.</para><para>John would agree with me that, when reflecting on his achievements during his time here and acknowledging his contribution, much of what has come to shape him as a person is his story of what he calls `sidetracks and gullies'. In particular, it was most informed by his upbringing and roots in rural Australia, his lifelong ministry and a questioning of the self. When he became the Director for Social Responsibility, I think he came face-to-face with many questions about prejudices, stereotypes and evangelical conservatism. But, most of all, he has had a capacity to rise above the self-informing new beliefs, far beyond a simplistic understanding of human nature. </para><para>He maintained a fundamental belief in measuring ourselves and the nation by the way that we treat those at the bottom of the heap. In today's language, we would call that social justice, but unless you internalise those beliefs and live them out, in my view, you are untrue to yourself and untrue to the nation and the office that you serve. Certainly, John can leave this parliament feeling completely satisfied that he has filled his brief about himself and contributed greatly to the nation.</para><para>What makes a person great is not so much their list of achievements in life but the journey they take, the friends they make along the way and the simple changes they make in people's lives. That is what he sought to do—to make that very simple change in people's lives—understanding that life itself and the human condition are far more complex. It is not a case of looking at problems and trying to come up with very simplistic or popular answers. I think that John was true to himself but that, most of all, he will now have the time to devote many years—which previously were sacrificed—to his wife, Marie, and to his family and his grandchildren. He has probably got the better deal compared with us who have to continue on here. When John made his first speech, he said:</para><quote><para>... beyond viewing humanity as the sum of each individual, and beyond humanity a concern for the earth and every living thing on the earth.</para></quote><para>These things, I think, have been borne out. I had the occasion to first meet him in a more formal and serious sense during the Mabo debate in late 1993, although we had met earlier as members of the party. Most of all, he impressed upon me the need for compassion and understanding in dealing with complex issues and the relationship of legislation to behaviour and the circumstances of people out there on the ground. </para><para>It is not surprising when we consider the story that he has contributed to national life that he has made 1,788 entries to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in his time here. I would put down probably four things that informed his capacity to perform effectively as a senator. They would be truth and universal justice, an understanding of the notion of what citizenship is, the need for cultural diversity in dealing with the question of relationship between peoples and the human condition. In relation to truth, understanding that there was a need for the factual basis of knowledge and truth as an essential precondition to positive change, others saw, through the process of trying to analyse our past during his time on the Council for Reconciliation, his great humanitarian and compassionate effort towards indigenous people in this country. We praise him and thank him, for he saw it as a process that others might know something of the facts concerning themselves and how they treated indigenous people and the less powerful in this country.</para><para>Understanding that there was a need to be a modern day humanitarian, I think he embodied universal justice in the sense of overcoming that evangelical conservatism about what he had been taught as a young man and what he had learnt through the journey of life. Lastly, what he thought about citizenship in terms of the need for equal rights in all actions, protections and opportunities and how to extend that was shown by his leadership role on the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs References Committee, certainly with the work he did in relation to family and aged care and, most of all, in relation to reconciliation. On behalf of indigenous people across the country, I can say fairly that we appreciate and acknowledge the support that he has given. And we acknowledge the sacrifice that his wife, Marie, has had to make along that journey. Most of all, he is someone who will be welcome continually within any community across the country because he has made a difference in the lives of many people. We want to put it on the record that that is a part of his contribution to national life. We in this place will also remember that contribution and will see those themes as something we can all emulate and aspire to as part of our senatorial and official roles. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Woods, Mr Donald</title><page.no>26272</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>26272</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— This evening, I would like to say a few words in tribute to Donald Woods, the South African journalist who became a significant figure in the campaign against apartheid during the 1970s and 1980s and who died in London last Sunday. Most people in the West probably first came to hear about Donald Woods through Sir Richard Attenborough's 1987 film <inline font-style="italic">Cry Freedom</inline>. That film depicted an only slightly sensationalised version of the story of how a white South African journalist from a comfortable middle-class background was transformed from a liberal critic of the apartheid regime to a committed political activist who moved national and, ultimately, international opinion against that regime and, by doing so, helped to hasten its end.</para></talk.start><para>Donald Woods was born in Elliotdale, in the Transkei, on 15 December 1933. His early life followed an essentially conventional path: he was educated at private schools and at the University of Cape Town, where he read law. As he records in his appropriately titled autobiography, <inline font-style="italic">Asking for Trouble</inline>, it was during his time as a law student that he underwent what he described as a `period of inner turmoil' as he came first to question, and then to confront, the racialist assumptions with which he had grown up. By the time he had graduated, he wrote, he had come to the realisation that apartheid was `a great obscene lie'.</para><para>In 1957, at the age of 23, he stood for parliament as a candidate of the white liberal United Party and was heavily defeated. As was the fate of many white liberals, he was calumnised by his peers and colleagues for breaching `white unity'. That willingness to take a stand in defiance of the expectations of his race and his class was one of the emblems of his career. Unattracted by a career in law, he was beckoned by journalism. He pursued that career in England and in North America. He visited Little Rock to study racial segregation in the American South. Interestingly, his impression of racial segregation in 1950s America was that it was more brutal, although less entrenched, than in his homeland.</para><para>Returning to South Africa in 1960 just after the Sharpville Massacre, he became a journalist on the <inline font-style="italic">East London Daily Dispatch</inline>, the newspaper at which he enjoyed the chief part of his professional career and whose editor-in-chief he became in 1965 at the age of only 32. From that vantage, he became an increasingly strident critic of the National Party, of apartheid and of the then Prime Minister, John Vorster. Yet he was still only a commentator. It was his friendship with Steve Biko, whom he first met in 1973, which marked the turning point in Woods's life. Biko was at the time the leader of the Black Political Consciousness Movement, a voice for moderation in black politics, and a young political leader of the greatest stature, described by some as a future Prime Minister. Woods's friendship with Biko gave him a richer feel both for the complexities of black politics and the moral ambiguity of the position of the white liberals. And it was Biko's murder in police custody in 1977 which radicalised Woods, transforming him from a commentator to a campaigner.</para><para>From that time the growing stridency of Woods's challenges to the legitimacy of the apartheid regime, together with his pursuit of the circumstances surrounding Biko's death, led to a banning order being placed upon him by the South African government, designed to silence him. It had the opposite effect. As he wrote in <inline font-style="italic">Asking for Trouble</inline>:</para><quote><para>The irony was that the South African government's ban on me, which sought to stop me from writing, to confine me to my home and to prevent me from communicating publicly, in fact caused me to write more than ever and to communicate with a greater mass of people than ever would have been possible had I been left alone. It has seemed, in the circumstances, an appropriate response to such a ban.</para></quote><para>It was also at this time that he and his family were subject to harassment and physical violence at the behest of the security police which led at one point to the serious injury of his five-year-old daughter. Those events led to the flight from South Africa of Donald Woods and his family. They escaped under cover of darkness, Woods himself disguised as a priest, and made their way some 300 miles overland to Lesotho. From there, they settled as refugees in Britain.  </para><para>From his new base Woods became a key contributor to the growing international movement to bring about the end of apartheid. He was an effective critic of the approach of the Thatcher government, which called for the relaxation of sanctions against the apartheid regime. He became the first private citizen ever to address the United Nations Security Council. His work as campaigner and publicist materially contributed to the international pressure which ultimately, with the accession to the South African presidency in 1989 of F. W. de Klerk, brought the evil system of apartheid to an end. That work was recognised in many ways, among them the conferral of honorary degrees by universities in the United States, South Africa and Britain, and his appointment as a Commander of the British Empire in the millennium honours list. </para><para>There are many kinds of heroes and there are many different kinds of courage. The particular kind of courage which Donald Woods's life exemplified was the courage which emboldens a man to take a stand against all of the prejudices and comfortable assumptions of his own background, to set himself in defiance of his own social group and to risk liberty and even life simply because he believes something to be wrong and seeks to set it right. It was the kind of courage of which Robert Kennedy spoke in his celebrated address to the South African people in June 1966—words which are often quoted in political circles but cannot be quoted often enough:</para><quote><para>Few are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle, or great intelligence. But it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world which yields most painfully to change.</para></quote><para>Those words could well stand as the epitaph of Donald Woods. I salute the memory of a valiant man.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Youth Participation in Civic Affairs</title><page.no>26273</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>26273</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to discuss the important issue of youth participation in civic affairs in Australia. As shadow minister for youth affairs, I have been fortunate to attend many youth forums, festivals and consultations across the country. This has enabled me to witness first-hand the energy, creativity and talent of many young Australians, as well as the anger, confusion and sense of hopelessness amongst others. As a policy maker, I consider both of these experiences to be valuable and urge my parliamentary colleagues to use those experiences to inform them and see how young people are faring in their own backyards. Unlike Labor, this current government has failed to understand that communities are stronger and more cohesive when all members are included, recognised and feel able to participate in the life and decisions of the community. This means the inclusion of young Australians in both decision making and community affairs across a wide spectrum of issues. </para></talk.start><para>Young Australians have been disproportionately hurt by the Howard government's mean and ruthless five-year policy agenda which has seen funding slashed to many of the services provided for those most in need and, more often than not, in favour of the big end of town. Young people have experienced first-hand the effects of various coalition policy blowtorches applied to key areas of youth concern, including income support with the Youth Allowance, education, labour market programs, health programs and the environment. Many of these issues affect young people directly. They affect their personal experience. Also, the issues where the coalition has so dismally failed affect those areas that young people find themselves increasingly passionate about, such as the environment. </para><para>Young people have seen the coalition defund their national youth peak body, AYPAC, for being critical of government policies. This obviously has had a detrimental impact on the way young people see themselves valued by government or, indeed, in this case with this cut, not valued. The Youth Roundtable, the government's alternative to the youth peak body, has turned out to be an expensive, part-time and inappropriate replacement. I want to make it clear that I am not reflecting negatively in any way on the Youth Roundtable members, or indeed on some of the erstwhile efforts of many of the facilitators and coordinators who have supported the venture. Rather, I am observing the fact that this is not a replacement in structure or nature for AYPAC. I stand by my comments when I have described the Youth Roundtable as a very expensive Liberal Party focus group. </para><para>There have been various articles and public statements made by past Youth Roundtable members which vindicate this view. I would like to quote from an article in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> written last month by a past roundtable member:</para><quote><para>Two years down the track, those who attended the first Roundtable, and I am one, would like to know what impact our recommendations have had, if any.</para><para>It is insulting and discouraging to be asked to give an opinion, spend a lot of time and energy providing a considered response, including practical recommendations, only to have those opinions taken no further.</para></quote><para>It is no wonder that young people become cynical. Even those most active and keen to involve themselves in such a process are now somewhat disheartened and tainted by virtue of having put up their hands in the first place, and that is very disappointing. It does not have to be this way. Through consulting with young Australians around the country, we have been told that they have been finding that life has been getting harder. Young people have told us that they are passionate about issues like the environment, reconciliation, globalisation and the republic. Young people have told us that they want school to be more relevant to the job marketplace and to independent living. They have told us that they want permanent full-time jobs and better access to education and training that will improve their career prospects and opportunities.</para><para>Young people have told us that they value their family and their friends. They have told us that they feel alienated from the political process and want more meaningful opportunities to speak directly to government and have their views heard and, indeed, considered. Finally, young people have told us that they find the vast array of government programs and services difficult to understand and access and that they want better information about what programs and support services are available to them. This is what young people have told us. It is not rocket science. It is a reflection on the real-life experience of so many young people, yet these fairly clear messages are continually falling on deaf ears.</para><para>It is interesting to note that young people have told us specifically that they perceive themselves as having been the biggest losers under the Howard government and that they are seeking in public office holders what they perceive Mr Howard to be most lacking in—that is, they value vision and they are looking for strong leadership. An alternative Beazley government will listen to and take into consideration the views of young Australians and will invest in the future by developing a Knowledge Nation. The whole concept of the Knowledge Nation is about creating an improved environment where we value the individual and collective contributions of all Australians. It is about improving living standards and creating a long-term sustainable future in terms of providing both education and jobs. Those young people who are just trying to scrape together enough money together to pay rent, to eat and to put petrol in their cars are not seeing any vision being expressed by the Howard government.</para><para>There are, however, two strong and consistent themes emerging from various outcome statements and reports from the youth consultation processes that I have received and been involved in. Firstly, underlying many of the challenges confronting Australia's youth is the sense that young people do not feel that they belong. They feel alienated from their community and the political processes of the wider society. Secondly, they see an urgent need for policy makers to remove barriers and to create opportunities for greater youth participation in society, using a variety of strategies. In essence, this is a remedy to their problems that I described in the first theme. Young people are coming up with their own solutions. </para><para>Depression, suicide, leaving school early, drug and alcohol abuse and transience represent some of the symptoms that young people experience as a result of feeling dissociated from their community. Structurally imposed realities such as unemployment and poverty also compromise a young person's ability to interact with their community. These factors combined with personal experiences and relationships with family and peer groups shape their outlook, adaptability and resilience to life's many stresses. The key areas for political and community debate should therefore be centred around identifying the causes for this disengagement and identifying ways to further engage young people and support their participation in society.</para><para>In most cases the issues confronting youth are interrelated and dispersed through a variety of portfolio areas. These include but are not limited to health, education, employment, training and social security. It seems pretty obvious. It is a wonder that it is so difficult for the coalition to understand. Approaching it this way makes analysis and understanding of issues of particular importance to youth more elusive than it should be. If policies are made within those portfolio silos then it is no wonder there is no holistic approach to youth policy, and it is clear that a holistic approach to youth must be developed. This position underpins many of the recommendations in the Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce report.</para><para>Sensationalised reporting of atypical events involving young people and the resulting public perceptions further strengthens negative stereotypes of Australia's youth. The corresponding law and order crackdowns on youth typify the reactionary political response to these stereotyped public opinions. This serves to further convince young people that there are few in political office representing their interests. This in turn contributes to a sense of generational alienation.</para><para>It is well documented that the largest proportion of swinging voters exists within the baby boomer generation; hence, young people are rarely the target group in political campaigning. However, it is important to remember that there will be about 80,000 young people who will be casting their vote for the first time in the next federal election. I would just like to close on a quote from the bill of the youth voting rights act 2001 that was debated at the YMCA Centenary of Federation youth parliament:</para><quote><para>With the Centenary of Federation upon us, an unparalleled opportunity is brought to the attention of the youth of this nation. It is a chance to effectuate change in order to create a fairer democratic society based on the Australian ideals of egalitarianism, tolerance and inclusion.</para></quote><para>That quote was in the context of the rights of young people to exercise a vote, and I support the continuing debate in that regard. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para><inline

Rural capital adjustment grants are allocated through the annual Aged Care Approvals Rounds.</para><para>(2)	In the 2000 Aged Care Approvals Round four homes in the Northern Territory were allocated Residential Care Capital Grants totalling $1.14 million. In a mini-Approvals Round early in 2001, additional capital grants totalling $1.10 million were made to two homes. Viability funding has been doubled and in the Northern Territory thirteen aged care homes now qualify for viability funding at an annual rate of $592,130, paid retrospectively from 1 January 2001. Viability funding is now paid automatically. Previously, only five aged care homes received viability funding.</para><para>Nationally, the 2000-01 Commonwealth Budget provided $20.1 million over four years to increase viability funding. These additional funds have been used to more than double the number of aged care homes receiving viability supplements, from 211 to over 500 homes. The increased number of homes receiving viability funding is in response to Professor Len Gray's Two-Year Review of the Aged Care Reforms which found that viability supplements were sufficient and questioned whether enough homes were receiving it.</para><para>(4)	Future Rural Adjustment Capital funding will be allocated through the annual Aged Care Approvals Round, as assessed against the national assessment criteria at the time. The estimated annual entitlement to viability funding in the next three financial years for the thirteen aged care homes which have qualified for that funding is $592,130, based on 2000-01 funding levels. Viability supplements will be indexed in future years.</para><para>(5) and (6)   In the 2001 Aged Care Approvals Round, eligibility for Rural Adjustment Capital Grants is limited to small services in rural, remote and urban fringe areas, which are seeking to expand or upgrade their buildings and new services, or to establish and increase the number of aged care places in their area. Aged care homes can also apply for general capital grants. Priority for these grants will be given to aged care homes in which a majority of residents are, or will be, either concessional or assisted residents under the Aged Care Act 1997, or who have special needs as defined under that Act.</para><para>The Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA), which measures accessibility to services for each of the towns across Australia, is used to give weightings for remoteness.
