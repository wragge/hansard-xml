Is the minister aware that a nursing provider in Western Australia, Western Health Care, is attempting to turn all its nursing and care staff into subcontractors? Is this allowed under the Aged Care Act? And doesn't it raise significant implications for the continuity of care of residents when there are no permanent care staff in these nursing homes?

After the government came to office in 1996, the Auditor-General out in Centenary Houseâthe building that gives the Labor Party some $36 million more than they would otherwise be entitled to; a contract they gave themselves in government, Madam President, you might rememberâfound that there was a 10,000 aged care place deficit left by the previous Labor government. I have no doubt that $36 million would buy quite a few of those aged care places. Over the last three years, more than 31,000 new places have been released to make up for the deficit and the need for growth. In 1995-96, the former Labor government spent $2.5 billion on residential aged care. The outlay in 2001 financial year is expected to be $4.2 billion.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âPoint of order, Senator McKiernan.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name></talker><para>âMadam President, I am only one minute into my answer. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKiernan</name></talker><para>âMadam President, I rise on a point of order.

I can understand the upset of my otherwise honourable colleagues opposite when it is pointed out that in 1995-96 they only spent $2.5 billion on residential aged care, whereas in 2001 this government is expected to spend $4.2 billionâa $1.7 billion increase. The total income to providers of residential aged care during the five years following the Howard government aged care reforms is projected to increase from $4.2 billion in 1997-98 to $6 billion this yearâan increase of some 41 per cent. That sets the general scene, and a very positive scene it is for this government. I could go on. I could take up the whole four minutes in time, but I do not think I need to, because I know, Madam President, that you know the good story and I know that the Labor Party know the good story as well. They know how hopelessly they did in aged care. Senator McKiernan asked me a specific question about a specific provider in Western Australia, which goes to the question of whether I know about this provider, whether I have a brief on them and are they turning their staff into subcontractors and subsequent questions following from thatâfor example, the security of the employee. I do not mean to say you are only interested in employees; you raised the question of the guarantee of care levels for the patients, which of course this government is particularly interested in. I will refer that part of your question to Mrs Bishop. </para></talk.start></continue></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>26761</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam President, I ask a supplementary question.

I will tell you why. The Builders Labourers Federationâas they were called thenâand the rough stuff that goes on in the unions and on building sites is something you would not even want to hear about, and none of us would want that visited on people who work in nursing homes and who provide care for the elderly.

I am happy to report to the Senate that the latest Yellow Pages business index for small and medium enterprises was released today.

Furthermore, whereas in May this year a net balance of 35 per cent felt that the economy was in a slowdown, the latest figure shows a net balance of 12 per cent now believing the economy is in a period of growth. </para></talk.start><para>I strongly concur with their assessment that the economy is in a period of growth.

This gives small business a better chance to grow. </para><para>Dealing with the second part of the question, as to whether I was aware of any alternative policies, I am able to say to Senator Chapman and the Senate that there are a number of concerns that small business have. One of those particular concerns is the Labor Party policy of roll-back. Small business have made their views clear through the thoughts of many people.

Templestowe Private Nursing Home has been the subject of quite significant debate over the last couple of months. I have some information in relation to that, and I will give that to the senator and indicate that such portions of his question as are not answered by the information I am about to give will be referred to Mrs Bishop. </para></talk.start><para>Mrs Bishop tells me that she was advised on 23 and 24 July this year that the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency conducted an accreditation audit at Templestowe. Serious risk was identified at the home. Since that time, the department and the agency have been working with the home to try to achieve the best outcome for residents, their families and the carers. Mrs Bishop advises that a new provider with a good track record in aged care has purchased the places at the home and that the department approved the transfer of the places on 15 August this year. Although accreditation at the home will cease on 12 September 2001, there is the capacity for the department to determine that exceptional circumstances may exist which would permit the continuation of residential care subsidy for a further six months. That matter is not decided but is still under consideration by the department, and it would allow the new owner further time to undertake a gradual winding down of the home in consultation with the residents and their families. </para><para>I hope all senators would support a situation where there are difficulties at a nursing homeâdecisions not being made and then no time or very little time given to families and residents to accommodate what changes might have to be made. The new approved provider will continue to care for the residents until they are relocated to suitable alternative accommodation. Commonwealth nursing officers are visiting the home regularly to ensure that residents receive appropriate care, and the department and the agency will continue to monitor the home closely. </para><para>Mrs Bishop has also been advised of an incident at the home resulting from the vendor-approved provider's failure to pay a bill. The department has sought and received assurances of restitution of the services from the previous approved provider's lawyers, and they will ensure that that is carried out. The department has also arranged to have the restitution work professionally assessed when it has been completed. The department will attend the home today to assess the situation and make certain that the residents' safety needs are met. Senator, I know there are some parts of your question that predate those comments, but I thought that since you are interested in the home you might be interested in that. Those parts of your question which go to earlier dates and other matters will be referred to Mrs Bishop.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>26764</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer. I want to focus her in on the question, which was on early incidents, because Minister Bishop has constantly talked about being notified on 23 July.

We all know how it has supported the economy generally but it is not quite so well known how it has supported local government, and through local government home owners, families and small business. Local governments around Australia owe about $6 billion in debt. When Mr Beazley was in charge of the Labor Party government, councils were paying around 14 to 15 per cent interest rates on that debt. Now, as a result of the Howard government's economic management, councils are paying around six to seven per cent. So there is an eight per cent saving on some $6 billion in debt, which means councils in Australia are now saving something like $480 million every year. That means real savings for home owners, for families and for small business. </para></talk.start><para>I appreciate Senator Calvert asking me this question. Senator Calvert was a very distinguished warden of Clarence council in Tasmania and he did a great job there. Senator Calvert is interested in these things. It is a pity, though, that Mr Beazley's frontbench has no interest in local government whatsoever. They have not asked one question during question timeâthe time when you can get a few debates and a few different ideas goingâthis whole year on local government, and only one has been asked on regional services. That shows what Mr Beazley thinks about local government and about regional services. </para><para>In addition to that, Senator Calvert will be pleased to know that the Howard government has just paid out $1.38 billion to local government around the country. That again means that people's ratesâfor families, for small businesses, for home owners generallyâwill be that much less. In addition to that, we have provided $1.2 billion in Roads to Recovery money. That means that motorists can drive on local roads safely as a result of the Howard government's initiative. The Howard government was able to make that $1.2 billion investment in local roads because of its good economic management. </para><para>Senator Calvert asked me whether I was aware of alternatives for policy in relation to local government. Normally I would say that I have heard nothing from Mr Beazley's frontbench, but I have. There is a policy out from Mr Beazley's frontbench. They do have a policy for local government. Let me tell you what it says. It says that Labor will `work towards' a review of some financial issues. It does not say that they will have a review, but that they will `work towards' a review. That is not one of the 166 inquiries that Mr Beazley is already having. It is another one that the shadow minister will `work towards'. We know that Labor want to up spending on health and education and they will tell you they want to up spending on local government and they want to fund roll-back, but Mr Beazley is simply unbelievable in his claim on local government, as he is with everything else. He could not tell the truth about the health system. He could not tell the truth about his own family and the health system.

The Howard government appreciates the importance of, and remains committed to, a transparent disclosure system for political donations. It is regrettable that the Labor Party does not share this commitment. There was some fanfare last month when Senator Faulkner belatedly announced that the Labor Party would disclose the sources of funding to the McKell Foundation. The fanfare of course was ridiculous, given his previous defence of these types of scams. The welcome but overdue announcement amounted to an admission of guilt. The McKell Foundation is a slush fund enabling Mr Brereton's white shoe show to travel the world and embarrass Australia. Perhaps that is why its money men do not like it to be identified. One can appreciate their embarrassment.</para></talk.start><para>When Senator Faulkner announced that the McKell Foundation would finally come clean, no-one was more surprised than the foundation's head, Mr Paul Mansfield. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> described Mr Mansfield as `taken aback' by Senator Faulkner's announcement and quoted Mr Mansfield as saying `some people don't want their philanthropy to be known'. How interesting! Who would not want their philanthropy to be known? Perhaps people like Mr Salazar, a Filipino once charged with murder who laundered $25,000 of foreign donations to the Australian Labor Party. The same issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> reported that Mr Mansfield had agreed to the McKell Foundation disclosing all as early as 14 July. But recently the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> reported that, rather than revealing the sources of its funds immediately, as had been agreed and promised, the McKell Foundation now intends to convey the information to the Australian Electoral Commission first. And guess what, Madam President: in the normal course of events, the AEC will not release the list of donors until February next yearâwell after the next election. How convenient but also how very shonky. So why this sudden reversal? The article quotes Mr Mansfield as saying that public disclosure at this point is not possible because he has `101 other things to do' and he cannot `walk and chew gum at the same time'. Yet, previously, it was possible to have full disclosure by the very next day. So what has Labor's McKell Foundation got to hide? Just how dirty is the money being used by Mr Brereton to fly him around the world to embarrass Australia?</para><para>As with Labor's electoral rorting in Queensland, as with the Markson Sparks fundraising rorts, as with the $36 million Centenary House rort and as with the McKell rort, the usually prolix Mr Beazley is strangely quiet.

Finally she is not correct in asserting that workers in Western Australia are in danger from contact with radioactive materials produced with petroleum production.</para><para>There is a level of background radioactivity in all substances. The radioactivity level of the oily waste produced in Gippsland is comparable to that of granite used in, for instance, kitchen bench-tops. The Australian Nuclear Safety and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) in 1986 assessed and surveyed the oily waste going to the Dutson Downs waste management facility. ANSTO found minimal levels of radioactivity and as a result the Victorian Department of Health advised Esso in 1987 they had no interest in regulating the waste. In 1999, Esso Australia Pty Ltd (Esso), in cooperation with the Victorian Department of Human Services, the Victorian Environment Protection Authority (EPA), and Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) conducted comprehensive assessments of risk from naturally occurring radioactive materials. The Victorian Radiation Advisory Committee (RAC) concluded that the activities of Esso do not present a radiological hazard to workers, the general public, or the environment.  In fact, it represents less than 1% of Australian and internationally accepted limits for such exposure.</para><para>The Dutson Downs waste management facility employs landfill disposal of the sludge produced by petroleum operations. The landfill disposal method has been assessed by ARPANSA. On the basis of a review of this report by the RAC, the Victorian Department of Human Services accepted in November 2000 that the level of naturally occurring radioactive materials from Esso operations is very low in concentration and that landfill disposal will eliminate any hazard to human health or the environment. They have issued a notice of exemption to Esso for the disposal by landfill of solid waste. </para><para>The Dutson Downs waste facility is not a municipal dump. Dutson Downs is licensed by the EPA as a prescribed waste facility. It is licensed to take oily waste, not radioactive materials. Nor is it intended to become a nuclear waste repository. To further improve the integrity of the waste, the operator of Dutson Downs, Gippsland Water Authority, proposes to establish a waste stabilisation plant for the treatment of oily residue wastes. Treatment of the waste in this plant is needed to reduce the hazard associated with oil contamination (not radiation) prior to disposal. Further, the treated waste will only be disposed of in a dedicated specially lined cell to further reduce any potential hazard from oily contamination. In other words, this upgrade has nothing to do with the level of radioactivity.</para><para>NORM waste of the same level as that produced in Gippsland would not be reinjected in the UK or US. Only much higher radiation level material is reinjected. </para><para>The safety of Western Australian workers is not at risk. Australian petroleum safety legislation for offshore exploration and production requires that potential hazards are identified, assessed and adequately managed. Geological conditions in the main Western Australian petroleum producing regions do not present major management problems. The risk potential from naturally occurring radioactive materials accumulating to dangerous levels in petroleum operations in Western Australia is considered to be very low. Where radioactive scale is known to accumulate, routine measuring is carried out to monitor and assess the risk. This material usually has a very low level of radiation, less than that of a sport or diver's fluorescent wristwatch. There have been no reported safety incidents related to management of radiation in the petroleum industry in Western Australia.</para><para>Finally, with respect to a national approach to dealing with the regulation of naturally occurring radioactive materials from the mining and mineral processing industries, this is a matter for the Minister for Health and Aged Care. However, I am advised that ARPANSA is currently working with states and territories to revise relevant Codes of Practice. </para><para>The new Code of Practice and Safety Guide âRadiation Protection and Radioactive Waste Management in Mining and Mineral Processing 2002â, currently being drafted, deals with the mining and processing of ores for the production of uranium and thorium, but may also be applied to other mining and mineral processing operations, such as those in oil and gas operations.</para><para>In addition, a fundamental principle of the regulation of oil and gas operations is that they not present a hazard to workers, the general public, or to the environment. Regulatory processes in place ensure that all risks are identified, assessed and adequately managed.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Queensland Liberal Party</title><page.no>26776</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>26776</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked by Senator Ludwig, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) and Senator McLucas today relating to taxation and a Liberal Party fundraising dinner.</para></motion><para>Last Thursday I reminded the Senate that it is not so much the offence as the cover-up that gets you. The example I drew was Watergate. In Watergate the cover-up led to the dismissal of President Nixon. The missing 9Â½ minutes of the Watergate tape was part of the cover-up that implicated him. The cover-up will be what gets Minister Macfarlane. Mr Howard's refusal to sack his Minister for Small Business after Mr Macfarlane yesterday gave his fifth different explanation of his knowledge of the Liberal Party GST scam is nothing short of an absolute disgrace. Mr Macfarlane yesterday told parliament that he had been told of a plan to defraud taxpayers by a member of his federal electorate council, Neville Stewart. Since the scam was first made public by Labor on Thursday, Mr Macfarlane has now given not one, not two, not three, not four but five different explanations as to what happened in the scam. So now we have the situation of so many stories, so little truth. Let me just go to what those five different explanations are. Last Thursday Mr Macfarlane told parliament:</para><quote><para>I am not aware of anything untoward that has been done in the FEC.</para></quote><para>That same night he said:</para><quote><para>The matter was drawn to my attention by the Treasurer's Office in early March and I subsequently raised the issue with the president of the Groom FEC.</para></quote><para>Earlier in the day he said `I am not aware of anything' and then later that same day he said that the matter was `drawn to my attention in early March'. The third example of where he contradicted himself: a short time after he had given that explanation he appeared on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> and said that the issue had been discussed at the 19 December meeting of the FEC in his home. He said then:</para><quote><para>The methodology was raised at an FEC meeting which I partially attendedâI think, from memory, in early December, but it may have been earlier than that.</para></quote><para>First he did not know, then he said that he knew in March, and now he admits that the FEC had discussed the methodology. That is the third version of his response. Then last Friday night he issued a further statement that revealed that he had been told of the scam in a telephone call by Mrs Margaret Watts on 18 December. Remember: did not know, then in March, then at the FEC, now on 18 December 2000. He said:</para><quote><para>On 18th December 2000 I received a telephone call from Margaret Watts expressing her concern about the process proposed by the Queensland Division for settlement of the account for the fundraising dinner held on 23rd November.</para></quote><para>Not only did he know about it but he had received from the treasurer of that Liberal Party branch a concerned inquiry about this whole scam. The full ramifications of what was involved had been drawn to his attention. But then he topped it: there is a fifth explanation. Yesterday he told parliament that Neville Stewart had told him of the scam some time in December. What did he say? He said:</para><quote><para>The account was paid by Mrs Watts on behalf of the Groom FEC the day after the dinner. The account was paid in full, including the GST. Subsequently, in December, I understand from a discussion that I had with Neville Stewart, a member of the FEC and Queensland state executive, that accounts over $2,000 were to be paid by the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. I understood from the discussion that the arrangements were based on advice received from the Queensland division. </para></quote><para>Dobbs the Queensland division in. The fifth different version.

While most businesses might have inputs like wheat, leather or computers to provide such outputs as bread, shoes and IT consulting, the Queensland Liberals seem to do it rather differently. They purchase catering services to provide a service they describe in the tax invoice that they themselves have issued on 23 January as `A service net costs of Picnic Point function'.

I would just highlight the fact that the Labor Party are the champions at defrauding the taxpayers of Australia. If they do not believe they are, then perhaps they should explain to us why they would defraud the Australian taxpayers of $36 million over 10 years as far as Centenary House is concerned. The present Auditor-General has been trying to get the rent reduced to reasonable levels but the ALP have repeatedly refused to reduce the amount. At the Auditor-General's last attempt in April this year, the Labor Party said they would do nothing to reduce the rent and would not renegotiate the lease. So they are defrauding the Australian taxpayers to the extent of some $36 million on a rent which is above and beyond the market rent currently payable in Canberra. They are ripping off the taxpayers to the tune of $36 million. It is not just the $36 million; it is the fact that the rent is over and above what the normal rent would be. The money goes straight out of taxpayers' wallets and straight into the coffers of the Labor Party. If that is not defrauding the Australian taxpayer, I do not know what is.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We hear Mr Beazley and Mr Crean committing themselves to cost-cutting. They constantly and self-righteously talk about cost-cutting. If they were as good as their word, they would immediately renounce this shonky deal with Centenary House and renegotiate that lease. The $36 million could be well put towards their costly and chaotic policy of roll-back, if that is what they want to do with it. The $36 million they are defrauding taxpayers of could produceâto use Mr Beazley's figuresâover 2,000 heart bypass operations or nearly 3,000 hip operations or 432 new portable classrooms. Where are Labor's social concerns now? Where is their feigned compassion when it comes to defrauding the Australian public? We all know that there is no truth. They are using this for a very short-term political gain and, in doing so, are proving themselves to be just what they are: not genuine at all in their attempts at looking after the Australian taxpayer. If the lease on Centenary House were a test of Labor's supposed commitment to cost-cutting, would they immediately renegotiate it? I am sure we are all waiting for the Labor Party's response. </para><para>If they want to talk about transparency, how about we move on to Markson Sparks, who have been a generous supporter of the Australian Labor Party. They bankrolled the Queensland ALP to the tune of more than $175,000. But that pales into insignificance when you talk about money raised and given to the New South Wales ALPânearly $900,000. Senator Faulkner wants these things to be transparent but, as we heard today from Senator Abetz, when he says, `Yes, we should make these donors transparent', in fact none of them will be. There could hardly be a donation from Mr Markson. To the best of my knowledge, Markson Sparks have a paid-up capital of $100. So it would be pretty interesting to see how the Labor Party could in any way suggest that that is anything but a cover-up of money that is donated to them. </para><para>If Senator Cook and the Labor Party want to talk about defrauding the taxpayers, they want to look in their own backyard and think of the $36 million that they are defrauding Australian taxpayers of, instead of coming in here and making a song and dance for three days about three minor irregularities in some 700 transactions which amounted to less than $180. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>26781</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to take notice of answers from Senator Hill today about the actions of the Liberal Party in avoiding their tax responsibilities, especially in the state of Queensland.

We have an unprecedented situation in terms of the law of the sea. We have a very grave signal that is being given by Australia to other countries around the world about how to treat asylum seekers. In my view, if we are talking about ministerial responsibility and ministerial resignations, this is a much, much, much more serious issue and there is a much more crucial principle at stake. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us not kid ourselves that we would be acting the same way if this boat had anybody else on it other than a boatload of asylum seekers from the Middle East. If this boat were carrying 100 people who had been rescued from a passenger liner, Australia would not think twice, and yet they have used this subterfuge, this extremely technical and highly dubious interpretation of the Law of the Sea to refuse entry to over 400 asylum seekersâmen, women and children. Already I have managed to get about five different legal opinions from people with expertise in the Law of the Sea saying that this is at best dubious and at worst a clear breach of our international obligations under the Law of the Sea. </para><para>In question time today, the minister refused to answer whether or not the captain of the boat was given any indication by Australian officials that he would be able to land at Christmas Island. Certainly, that has been reported to be the case. But he refused to answer whether or not the boat was actually closer to Christmas Island than any other port. There certainly have been reports that that was the case as well. There is little doubt that this is a significant breach in terms of our obligations under the Law of the Sea and it sends a very serious signal, not just in terms of treatment of asylum seekers but in terms of people who are in need of rescue at sea. </para><para>We have had comments already from people such as the Maritime Union and others who work in this area regularly that this will send a very clear signal to people in the future not to pick up people who are in distress at sea. Who would want to stop to pick up people who are in distress at sea if they are going to find themselves in the sort of situation that the captain and crew of this Norwegian tanker have found themselves in? They did the right thing; they did the humane thing; they rescued people who almost certainly would otherwise now all be drowned. Four hundred or more men, women and children, including a number of pregnant women, would all be drowned now if it were not for the actions of this Norwegian crew and this skipper. Their reward for that is to find themselves in the middle of this disgraceful international tug of war and Mexican stand-off about which country can be the most hard-hearted. </para><para>We are now in a race to the bottom around the globe to see who can be the nastiest, meanest and most hard-hearted towards asylum seekers. That is the extra tragedy of this situationâthat it not only sends a dangerous precedent in terms of the Law of the Sea but it is sending a very dangerous signal about how asylum seekers should be treated. Obviously, this is not the first situation where a boatload of asylum seekers has got into trouble anywhere around the world. Indeed, I saw that one got into trouble off the coast of Italy just a few days back. If we are going to get into a situation where countries say, `It is not our problem. Go somewhere else,' whilst the boat merrily sinks in the middle of the ocean, then it is going to be a very dangerous situation that we face in the future in terms of what are, without doubt, people who are fleeingâin many casesâpersecution and who are suffering enormously. It is an incredibly serious situation and it is an incredibly dangerous precedent that has already been set. </para><para>Certainly, the Democrats, along with everybody else, hope that a solution can be found to this situation as immediately as possible, but I think a lot of the damage has already been done by the actions of the Australian government. Let us look at many of the people who have been criticising the government for their response, including just recently the Archbishop of Adelaide, Archbishop Philip Wilson, who has pointed out that this is a human problem and that the Christian reaction to this situation would be to care for and assist these people in need. Let us recognise that it is not just a legalistic argument; this is an issue of humanity. As Andrew Clennell said in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> today, it may or may not be legal what the government has done, but it certainly is very dubious morality that is involved here.

This would mean that the earliest the final distribution could take place, given the current selling projections, would be after July 2002. The intention was to ensure that the final distribution to shareholders would be based on the final set of audited financial accounts for WoolStock Australia Ltd, following the end of the financial year in which the last wool was sold. Given the expected timing of the last sale, WoolStock Australia Ltd has now advised that this provision would delay the final distribution and winding up considerably (between 8 and 10 months, depending on the exact timing of the final sale).</para><para>The Bill will allow the final cash distribution to shareholders of WoolStock Australia Ltd to proceed as soon as the final accounts are prepared, audited, approved by the Board, and shareholders notified of the intended distributions.

relation to this, on 22 February 2001 during Senate estimates I first asked Senator Alston and Telstra to provide the committee with the E71 faults database. The response from Mr Stanhope at the timeâand I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>âwas: `Okay.' He also indicated that there were about 10,000 to 20,000 E71sâthat is, faults in the network. Subsequent letters between Telstra, me and the Clerk of the Senate followed regarding Telstra's failure, under the cover of commercial-in-confidence, to provide the information on notice. The Auditor-General's report on the use of confidentiality provisions in Commonwealth contracts came out on 24 May. Recommendation No. 1 states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... contractual provisions ... should be disclosed to Parliament and its committees unless there is sound basis for their confidentiality.</para></quote><para>I subsequently asked Senator Alston and Telstra during budget estimates on 7 June, based on advice from the Clerk of the Senate and the ANAO report, to explain the use of commercial-in-confidence. Telstra agreed during that hearing to provide the database with what they regarded as commercial-in-confidence information blanked out. A letter from Telstra's Director of Finance and Administration, John Stanhope, on 14 June followed to confirm that, indicating that the information would be provided ASAP. Since then, my office has been dealing on a weekly basis with the Telstra government relations officer, Graham Murphy. We are cognisant of the fact that this was a big exercise. However, last week on Thursday, 23 August Mr Murphy told my office that he had been instructed to cease direct discussions with my office and that we were to deal with the minister's office with regard to any matters. He also indicated that the database would be provided to the minister's office in the next weekâthat is, this week.</para><para>We now are amending an order to provide Telstra with yet some more time to get the database in order. Telstra wrote to me on Wednesday, 22 August, indicating that they were `migrating to the new Total Order Management System, TOMS' and that therefore the database would not be forwarded to the minister's office until this week, as opposed to last week's initial deadline. We restated in our correspondence that we wanted the original E71 databaseâthat is, the faults database. </para><para>I am also aware that Telstra have renamed E71 as CNIsâcustomer network improvements. I am now suspicious about why all this has taken so long. We gave Telstra and the minister the benefit of the doubt in relation to the complexity of the information. What we were only recently made aware of was that the entire database was being changed and that the way in which the information was being presented was being changed. Labor have been pursuing this since February of this year, and Telstra only advised us on 22 August that a total change to the database was occurring. A total of almost six months has been spent trying to get this information, which, according to Telstra's estimates alone, concerns between 10,000 and 20,000 faults on the networkâmost of them in rural and regional Australia and many of them dating back to 1995. Out of deference to the Democrats, we have extended the deadline to the next sitting week, but at that point, depending on the views of the Democrats, we will be insisting on the information and we will be insisting on having it in its original form, not in a contorted, Orwellian form which seems to have occurred over the last couple of months. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>26791</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI welcome the reasonable position that has been taken by the Democrats in relation to this. The way in which Senator Mackay has just described this issue to the Senate is an exaggeration and a beat-up of the issue. Firstly, I think we should make it clear that the so-called E71 database is in fact not a record of service faults; it is a very detailed record of Telstra assets which require maintenance. There is a very significant difference, and I will point it out to the Senate and to all those people who are listening to the broadcast or in the chamber today to this fascinating area of public policy that Senator Mackay has been pursuing. </para></talk.start><para>For example, the database that she refers to includes a whole range of jobsâassets requiring maintenanceâwhich have absolutely no impact on service levels to anybody. I will give you one example of that: a cracked pit lidâin other words, a cracked lid across a telecommunications pit. They are the sorts of things that you will see from time to time if you are walking along a footpath, pushing a pram or even riding a bike. This database includes things such as cracked pit lids which need to be repaired. They are things that Telstra will put into the database, I am informedâI am not an expert on these cracked pit lids or any other maintenance issues in relation to Telstra's assets. They make a very good point that there is a range of items within this database which a sensible person would ensure were fixed but would fix as they were going past there to do something else. There are also matters that require earlier attention.</para><para>The point should also be made that the government have put in place a legislative and regulatory scheme that ensures the fault repairs on the Telstra networkâin fact, on all telecommunications networks, because we no longer have just the one network, which Labor seemed to be happy with; we now have 83 carriers in Australia providing competition to Telstra: competition to improve their services, competition to repair their faults more quickly and competition to install new services where they are required. But not to rest on that, we have also introduced something the previous government never contemplatedâthat is, the customer service guarantee. Where a fault does occur, you are guaranteed under law that that fault will be fixed on time and that, if it is not fixed on time, a charge against Telstra will be made and compensation paid to the person who is affected by the fault repairâand that is not only for fault repairs but for installations.</para><para>In the context of this search for the database, which the government has always made clear it will comply with it, Telstra has made it clear and Senator Mackay has actually made that clear in her statement here today if you go back to look at it. But I think even she will respect the factâcertainly the Democrats doâthat this is an enormous database and it requires an enormous amount of work to put it into a form to comply not only with the questions from the estimates committees but also the return to order. I think this pursuit is for basic political purposes rather than any intrinsic interest in Telstra's asset maintenance program.</para><para>The reality is that the Australian Labor Party's policies in relation to Telstra were founded back in the 1950s. What you would have under Labor is diminished competition and diminished shareholder values not only for the government shareholder of the majority share in Telstra but also for the private shareholders. The Labor Party want to go back to the good old 1940s and 1950s when the government ran everything, including the telephone.</para><para>Most people, particularly in regional and rural Australia, remember those good old days when the PMG ran the telephone company. Instead of having calls all around the world for very low rates, which you have these days under the competitive regime, after a few minutes the operator would come on and say, `Senator Mackay, your four minutes is up. Would you like to extend?' Those were good old days, when you had to pay a whole load of money. Senator Mackay would be ringing grandma in England and the pips would goâ `beep, beep, beep'âand you would say, `Gee whiz, those pips are coming up. We're going to have to pay for some more minutes.'</para><para>The Australian people know that a competitive regime has worked very successfully for Australia and that the Australian Communication Authority's independent audit shows that Telstra's fault repair and service provision have improved significantly. The customer service guarantee is working. I think what is important for other people to knowâand this is the saddest thing about the Australian Labor Partyâis that, as in most areas of policy for the Australian Labor Party, their leader is actually a self-styled policy wonk. He is a self-styled intellectual policy wonk and there is nothing sadder in politics anywhere in the world to have a policy wonk who has not got a policy, because I just have to ask: what are you left with?

I just want to briefly explain why we were not prepared to support the notice of motion in its original form, that is, with the production date of 30 August. This return to order requires the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to produce to the Senate a series of documents which I understand number well over 2,000. The documents contain substandard plant reports and are known as the E71 database and they relate to the question taken on notice by Telstra during estimates in June this year.</para></talk.start><para>My office has spoken to Telstra about the delay in the production of the documents and Telstra has provided me with an explanation which does not seem unreasonable. In matters like this and without evidence to the contrary, I feel obliged to accept Telstra's explanation at face value. Senator Mackay may be of the view that Telstra has been delaying the production of documents for a variety of reasons and that may well be true, but I do not have any evidence of it.</para><para>During discussions on this return to order I put a compromise position to Telstra, the minister's office and Senator Mackay's office, and that was that the documents should be produced by Tuesday of the next sitting periodâTuesday, 18 Septemberâand that is just 2Â½ weeks away. </para><para>The concern that I conveyed to Senator Mackay's office was that if we, the Senate, impose an unreasonable timetable on the minister for producing these documents he will simply return to the chamber on Thursday and explain his inability to produce the documents. The basis of his answer will be the unrealistic time frame set under the order. Telstra and the minister's office were prepared to accept the 18th and in fact Telstra gave my office a commitment that it would ensure that the documents were with the minister's office in sufficient time for them to be produced on the 18th. I understand that the outcome is not an optimal one for Senator Mackay, but I assure her that the Democrats are not knowingly concurring in any sort of cover-up by Telstra or by the government.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title><type>Matters of Urgency</type><page.no>26793</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Refugees: Norwegian Ship</title><page.no>26793</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âI inform the Senate that the President has received the following letter, dated 28 August 2001, from Senator Bartlett:</para></talk.start><para>Dear Madam President</para><para>Pursuant to standing order 75, I give notice that today I propose to move:</para><para>âThat, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</para><para>The Government's decision to refuse entry to the Norwegian vessel <inline font-style="italic">The Tampa</inline> carrying asylum seekers, and the need for the Government to honour its international obligations concerning the rights of refugees, and allow the asylum seekers into Australia to receive medical attention and be assessed for refugee status.â.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Andrew Bartlett</para><para>Democrat Senator for Queensland</para><para>Is the proposal supported?</para><para><inline font-style="italic">More than the number of senators required by the standing orders having risen in their placesâ</inline></para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âI understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in today's debate.

This is an unprecedented situation and I think one that is a very dangerous step in what is undoubtedly a very contentious area of public policy. It is worth noting commentary from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees spokesperson that has just come through on the wire stating that this is the first time that Australia has refused accommodation to people rescued at sea. Whilst we certainly hope that indications and reports that are coming through that Indonesia may accept these people do bear some fruit, I think the damage has already been done, firstly, regarding the precedent in relation to rescuing people at sea and refusing them entry into a nearby port where they quite clearly could be dropped off, and, secondly, I think because of the obvious situation that if this was any group of people other than asylum seekers there is no doubt that this issue would not be arising. Quite clearly, this government is acting purely because of the nature of these people. Again I think that sends a very dangerous signal and sets a very dangerous precedent in terms of where Australia is going in relation to refugee issues. </para><para>Of course, we have the added situation of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs this afternoonâprobably around about nowâtabling new legislation in the House of Representatives which seeks to further restrict the definition of a refugee. I think that again sends a very dangerous signal to the rest of the world about how we address and deal with refugees and asylum seekers. It generates great concern on the part of the Democrats and many other people in the Australian community who believe that there is not just an obligation but indeed a real necessity to ensure that public policy measures are informed by morality and humanity and that we do not adopt the policy approach, the political approach, that involves a race to the bottom with other countries around the globe to see who can be the most hard-hearted, who can treat asylum seekers the harshest, as some sort of suggested way to stop them from arriving here.</para><para>This minister has done any number of things in the last few yearsâmany of them, although not all, supported by the oppositionâto make life very difficult for refugees and asylum seekers, and he continues to try to make it harder and harder for them. He has said repeatedly that our unique approach of mandatory detention is in part a disincentive to people, that it is trying to send a message to them that they should not come here. Yet obviously that is not working. The whole policy approach of this government in relation to the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees is clearly not working. It is not reducing the number of people coming here; it is increasing antagonism within the community, it is increasing the suffering involved for the people and it is increasing the cost to the taxpayer. We now have this latest situation where we are sending an increasingly dangerous message to seafarers about how they should react to boats in distress. It does evoke some concerning analogies. A few years ago, I recall, there was a barge loaded with toxic waste sailing around the United States trying to find a port that would take that cargo, but no port would take it. I think we have reached the unfortunate situation where that is the way we are now treating asylum seekersâas though they are just human garbage that nobody wants to take and that everybody wants to have dumped somewhere else. That is not going to solve what is a global problem and what is a difficult issue. We need to have a better approach.</para><para>It is also sending a very dangerous signal in terms of the calls that repeatedly come from the communityâand all of us here get themâabout boat arrivals, that is, we should tow them back out to sea, that we should send them back where they came from, that we should sink their boats, that we should send out F111s against them, and all sorts of other extremist responses. Here we have a situation where the government has stopped them coming in and is sending them back. We are now going to be in the situation where those people in the community who hold such views will be saying, `Well, if you can do it with this boatload of people, why can't you do it with the other boats that arrive? They also have Indonesian crews; they also come from Indonesia; what is the difference? Why don't you stop them? Refuse them entry and send them back.' Again it sets a very dangerous precedent, as the UNHCR itself has noted.</para><para>I think we should have much more empathy for these people. The absence of empathy was famously entitled `the genesis of evil' in the Nuremberg trials. We really do need to examine where we are going before we go further down what is a very dangerous path. I do not think we want to have an election played on the race card. We have had debate about people putting One Nation last on their how-to-vote cards. There is not much point putting them last on how-to-vote cards if we are going to adopt their policies at the same time. We do need to heed calls from church leaders and from other community organisations around the country to ensure that we do have a more humane approach to this issue and that we do not simply approach it from the point of view of seeing how hardline and how hard-hearted we can be, and how miserable we can make life for people who have already suffered enormously. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>26794</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is very strange to hear Senator Bartlett talking about people going down a dangerous line. Having read his motion, I think it is possible that Senator Bartlett and the Democrats are going down a dangerous line when they use such inflammatory language as `hard-hearted' and `Nuremberg trials' and all of the other things that only serve to inflame and incite the wrong attitude amongst opinion in Australia. I can tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, although you would already know it, that Australia has a record in relation to caring for refugees which I think everybody in this Australian parliament should be proud of. There is no nation in the last 50 years that has been more generous or more decent towards refugees than Australia. We need not look at just recent times; we ought to look back 50 years, which was before Senator Bartlett was born and about 20-odd years before his leader was born. Many of our Australian citizens today came here through the refugee program, and they came through the proper process.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Bartlett talks about us being `hard-hearted'. I wonder what he means when he says that we `further restrict the definition of refugee'. In fact, in recent times the definition of `refugee' has expanded in Australiaâit has become much softer. Whereas some 20-odd years ago the department of immigration were the final arbiters in determining whether or not a person was a refugee, now they can appeal to the courts and there is a far wider definition of `refugee' than there was some 20-odd years ago. To talk about further restricting the definition of `refugee' is just nonsense. </para><para>Senator Bartlett talks about boats at sea. He talks about this boat as though everybody on board it is a genuine asylum seeker. We do not know who is on this boat. All we know is that it has come from Indonesia, it was heading towards Australia, but it got into some serious difficulties. Senator Bartlett's motion says that the boat is carrying asylum seekersâhe is assuming that, to start with. He says:</para><quote><para>... the need for the Government to honour its international obligations concerning the rights of refugees, and allow the asylum seekersâ</para></quote><para>again, he is presuming that everybody on board that boat is an asylum seekerâ</para><quote><para>into Australia to receive medical attention and be assessed for refugee status.</para></quote><para>Senator Bartlett should really stick to the facts so that we really know what has happened in this situation. In fact, in most of the elements that he is talking about, the Australian government is already doing many of these things. I understand that there is going to be an amendment to this motion which probably sets things down in a much more orderly fashion. Hopefully, the Australian government will achieve all the things that will be proposed.</para><para>The real point is that this Norwegian freighter rescued 434 unauthorised arrivals from their disabled vessel on Sunday, 26 Augustâthat is a fact. Having rescued the individuals, the freighter was proceeding to the Indonesian port of Merak at the direction of the Indonesian search and rescue authorityâthat is a fact; that is where it was proceeding. We understand that the freighter subsequently turned back to Christmas Island at the insistence and the threatening of the rescued individuals. So people are rescued on the high seas on their way to Indonesiaâto where the boat was travellingâbut, at the insistence of those individuals, the boat turns around and heads for Christmas Island. </para><para>The government has requested that the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, the Norwegian freighter, not enter Australian territorial waters and continue on its way to Indonesia. Australia is continuing to seek the assistance of the Norwegian and Indonesian governments to secure an acceptable solution for all concerned. That is the way it should be treated, not like the motion that Senator Bartlett puts up or that the Democrats support.</para><para>The Democrats would let everybody into Australia, regardless of who they were. Anybody who wants to come to Australia should not be mandatorily detained, according to the Democrats. We should let them all in and see what happens after they get here. Whether they are processed after they get here or whether there is some form of process, we simply do not know, but they would let anybody in. In fact, both the government and the opposition have a policy of mandatory detention so that these people can be processed, so that we can sort out, from amongst those people who are coming into Australia, who are genuine refugees and who are not. That is where the Democrats fall down. They take it on face value that everybody who applies for asylum in Australia is a genuine refugee. In fact, we know that simply is not the case because, if it were the case, we would not have the numbers of applications rejected that have been rejected over the past few years.</para><para>When he talks about applications for refugee status, it is interesting to note that the UNHCR, in their own assessment of Afghanis who are attempting to seek refugee status in Australia or anywhere else, assessed that only about 14 per cent of the people who apply for refugee status from Afghanistan are actually refugees. Compare that with Australia's record with regard to people from Afghanistan who come to Australia under the guise of asylum seekers and who apply here for refugee status. Australia accepts some 84 per cent of people from Afghanistan as refugees, as against the assessment of the UNHCR that only 14 per cent of those who apply are genuine refugees. So anybody who suggests that Australia is not meeting its human rights obligations in relation to people who are attempting to seek refugee status as asylum seekers in Australia certainly has a lot to answer for.</para><para>Amongst other things, the urgency motion talks about asylum seekers receiving medical attention. Australian personnel are already being flown to Christmas Island by Hercules aircraft to provide humanitarian assistanceâsuch as food, water, medical supplies and safety equipment or any of the things that may be required. There is a doctor on Christmas Island who is available to provide medical assistance. What more do they expect us to do for these people? The government is currently trying to source a helicopter with winching capacity to transfer any necessary supplies or other assistance from Christmas Island to the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> if necessary and, as well as that, the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Arunta</inline> has been directed to proceed there with all possible speed to render any further assistance that might be necessary.</para><para>We have a container shipâthe <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>is a container shipâthat is berthed in international waters off Christmas Island and it is suggested that this container ship should go into Christmas Island. It simply cannot. There is no provision on Christmas Island for receiving container ships. People would have to be transferred from the high seas in bargesâthat is the only way that anybody could get on thereâand the nearest place that can accept the container ship is the Indonesian port. That is the nearest point of possible disembarkation, and they can get there within 12 hours. It is only because the captain was forced that they came back towards Christmas Island. I have been advised that Christmas Island does not lend itself to receiving a container vessel. Vessels cannot come close to the island or any of the points at which food or other material for sustenance could be received. People could only be carried off in barges and it is quite an unsuitable destination.</para><para>We heard Senator Bartlett talking about the terrible conditions that people are living in in our detention centres. As a member of a committee that has visited each of our detention centres, I would describe the conditions as spartanâand so they should be. He says that we are sending out a disincentive for people to come. I think we should be sending out a disincentive for people to come through illegal channels. All they are doing is taking the place of genuine refugees who do not have $US5,000 or $US10,000 to pay a people smuggler to get here. There are people in camps overseas who are going through the proper process. At some stage last year, that processing was suspended because of the numbers of people coming here. We hope that that does not happen again, because there are people going through the proper processes who should receive some priorityânot people who have the money to pay criminals to get on boats and come to Australia. It is important that we remember that when we are thinking about the whole situation of arrivals coming into Australia.</para><para>It is most important that there is a disincentive for people to try to come to Australia this way. There are proper channels. We need to bear in mind that, among those seeking asylum, we have people with criminal records, people who are security risks and people who are simply circumventing the normal migration channels in order to come to Australia. It is not fair that people who should go through the normal processes are short-cutting, coming to Australia by unauthorised means and seeking to receive proper attention and due care from the Australian people. I want refugees that come to this country to be genuine refugees and to come through the proper process so that we can show them the compassion we have always shown over the last 50 years as an Australian parliament. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>26797</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Omit all words after âthe<inline font-style="italic"> Tampa</inline>,â, substitute:</para><para>carrying asylum seekers, and the need for the Government to:</para><para>	(a)	coordinate a process with the United Nations, Norway and Indonesia to manage a resolution to the current impasse in accordance with inter-national law;</para><para>	(b)	provide interim assistance for the humanitarian needs and safety of asylum seekers and the crew on board; and</para><para>	(c)	acknowledge the humanitarian acts of the Norwegian Master and his crew,</para><para>and for the international community to follow their compassionate lead.</para></quote><para>The opposition cannot support the Australian Democrats' position, which is a simplistic response to an enormous problem. We cannot do what they want. We say to them and to the government that we do not walk away from this issue. We acknowledge thatâjust as the government says that Indonesia and Norway have to sort it outâAustralia also has a responsibility in this area. I speak with a degree of bemusement that this issue has been raised by the Australian Democrats. Following on from what Senator Ferguson said, for quite some time, particularly under John Coulter, the Democrats were a single issue migration policy party. They did not haveâand probably still do not haveâa balanced immigration policy. Essentially, their view was that they would defend asylum seekers who came by boat, but under former Senator Coulter they had a view that a wider migration program was contrary to the interests of Australia because of the environmental impacts. </para><para>Our view is that you have to have a balanced migration program. It is important for our social and economic development. It needs to be balanced and needs to accommodate all elementsâfamily, economic, refugee and humanitarianânot just asylum seekers. To be fair and balanced, it has to be fair for all. It has to provide access for all and acknowledge that different driving forces mean that a country like Australia needs migrants and that migrants can find a future in this country.</para><para>This matter of urgency is not the simple issue that the Australian Democrats would like us to believe; it is riddled with a diverse range of issues confronting this country. It goes to national sovereignty, it confronts our legal system, it raises issues of international relationsâregional and in a wider senseâand it goes to our international reputation. An issue like this needs to be debated in the community and not just on talkback radio programs. The debate needs to be informed, otherwise we will go down the wrong road and find ourselves in policy turmoil with situations that we will not be able to handle. Driven by talkback radio and the talk jocks, we will find ourselves in an impasse and not able to get out. That is why there needs to be a better understanding of the issues in the community than we have had so far.</para><para>I indicate to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, that taking cheap passing shots at the opposition and at parliament because some of the government's legislation has not been passed by this parliament is not the way to handle this issue. It is a complex issue. We need to send the right messages out to the rest of the world. By bagging the opposition and by bagging parliament, not only does the Prime Minister demean his position but also he blurs the messages that he sends to the rest of the world.</para><para>I speak on this issue with a degree of experience, having had to confront similar problems in the past as minister for immigration. We handle them somewhat differently. I had an influx of boat people before Christmas one year in numbers that we had not seen in Australia before thenâapart from the Vietnamese influx in the mid-1970sânumbers which have been surpassed by recent events. I was able to draw on the experience of people like Chris Conybeare, Dennis Richardsonâcurrently head of ASIOâMark Sullivan and experienced staff, and we were able to handle the issue differently. I suggest to the minister that he needs to look at that experience and handle this issue differently. Yesterday, Kim Beazley backed the government. The Labor Party takes that position because, as Kim Beazley says, it is legally and technically correct. But we are also concerned about Australia having a responsibility for the health and safety of those on boardânot just the potential asylum seekers but also the crew. There are issues in this debate that have been ignored. In recent months, watching the debate continue and watching the minister handle the issue, I have become more frustrated by the way he has handled this problem. The problem now facing Australia is greater than it needed to be because the minister has botched the broader issue of asylum seekers.</para><para>Our most recent influx has come predominantly from the Middle East, but Middle East asylum seekers and refugees in this country are not a new problem. I can remember going to places like Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Israel and being confronted by migration officers with story after story about the sorts of abuse that people were being subjected to in surrounding countries. There were people from Iraq, Iran and Sudan who were seeking access to Australia. From Muslims to Coptics, there were people wanting to come here. What was our response then? Our response then was to do two things: to increase the number of people who could come through an orderly process from the Middle East and to ensure that there was quick access. I was confronted with stories of young, professional medical women who were dragged overnight out of the countries in which they wereâoccasioning risk to our migration officersâbecause they were going to be raped. I heard the story of a leading boxer in one country who was going to have his hands cut off. But our people went in, our people made themselves available and our people helped him get out.</para><para>There is a legitimate need for people to come from the Middle East, and I think there is a legitimate demand on government to ensure access to our offshore orderly processes. I have a painting in my office which was given to me at the end of 1995 by a refugee from Iraq. I will not give it awayâit was important to him and it is important to me as a token which continues to remind me of those daysâbut I cannot bear to look at it and I turn it the other way, because it is this painter's depiction of life in the community from which he came. It is a pretty ugly, dastardly depiction of what this person had to go through and what his family and friends had to go through. You are looking at a painting with disembowelment and with all sorts of acts of torture perpetrated on people. He was just one person who came to Australia and has made a life for himself here. That person and that painting are continual reminders to me that we really have to ensure that when we deal with people in these circumstances we acknowledge there is a human element.</para><para>Philip Ruddock has not met that challenge. What has he done? He has cut down the actual numbers available and he has cut down regional access. He has presented a biased picture of the people who are actually coming here. As a former minister, I say to him: don't raise the bar too high for yourself. You have raised the bar too high already. There are individual stories that the Australian public needs to be told, individual stories that people carry with them which have driven them to come and seek refuge in this country. As the minister says, 85 per cent are genuine refugees. But don't let the debate be hijacked by your rhetoric about the 15 per cent that are not. Let the public know about some of the real stories about the 85 per cent that are. Educate the public. Let them feel as if they are part of the humanitarian response to the savagery in some parts of the Middle East. How can we go to war, for instance, against Saddam Hussein and call him a tyrant but not acknowledge that there are victims of his tyranny and that those victims are seeking assistance from Australia? Provide the resources. Try and stem the flow of illegal boat arrivals in Australia by accommodating this in the way we used to accommodate it offshore in the Middle East, and don't make the access so difficult. Immediate access is so important for some of these people. You cannot have an 85 per cent approval rate under our government's `hands off from ministerial intervention' system without having some genuine cases come to Australia.</para><para>We need to have a much more balanced debate. If we were to have a much more balanced debate, we would be able to better handle the situation we have now. In the current situation, we have to keep in mind that relations with Indonesia are important. From my experience, we used to have ongoing, almost weekly, contact. We had mechanisms and structures in place. We had early notice. We had assistance from the Indonesians. We worked cooperatively. The relationship with Indonesia is important, and the way we have confronted them over the last 48 hours does not help. In fact, you could say that we are provoking a collapse in that relationship by shunting the problem off to the Indonesians.</para><para>John Howard went to Indonesia a few weeks ago. A fickle gallery decided that, because he delivered a block of King Island brie to President Megawati Sukarno, relations were back on a footing. It is going to take more than a block of King Island brie to get them back on a footing after the last 48 hours. We cannot underestimate the importance of those relationships, relationships which are critical generally and critical when it comes to boat arrivals. The foreign policy implications are also critical. We need to have ongoing good relations with the UNHCR. We need to be able to select people abroad. They have offered assistance in the last 12 hours or so. We do not want that organisation to feel as if they have been set up or doublecrossed by the Australian government. In that context, relations with Europe are important. Norway may feel offended at the moment, and they have an impact that ripples through the Scandinavian countries and through the rest of Europe. We must acknowledge that we need to ensure that our relationships with them are an important plank of our status and credibility in Europe. As I said, there are foreign policy implications, but the international image is also affected.</para><para>At the end of the day, we have a problem in this country, and it cannot be treated in the way the Australian Democrats are asking us to, not just in respect of these people but in respect of the people who have come over recent months. Do we send the failed asylum seekers back to tyrants like Saddam Hussein? That is question No. 1. Do we send the 12-year-old kid who was on the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> program the other week back to Saddam Hussein and his tyranny? We must ask not only, `Do we send them back?' but `Can we send them back?' Iraq will not take them back, and if they did would we be satisfied that they would be safe? The government has tried other countries in the region as staging posts. Can we send them there and then work out where they go thereafter? Those countries have quite rightly said that is not on. Airlines, of course, do not take people without adequate documentation, especially if no country will receive them. I think it is important for the immigration minister to keep that end game in mind. What does he do with failed asylum seekers?</para><para>It is okay to go on talkback programsâas he and the Prime Minister would like to doâand respond to that feeling in the community which basically says, `They've got no right to be here, let's shunt them off pretty quickly,' but this is a problem that Phillip Ruddock may not be around to handle in a few months time. However, it is a problem that the Australian people have to face. Where will we send those people who are left in detentionâthose 15 out of 100 asylum seekersâwho do not pass? Will John Howard send this 12-year-old back to Iraq, back to Saddam Hussein? That is a real live issue that we will have to confront. Will he send the parents? What do we do? When do we stop passing the parcel with these people? This is not a theoretical question and it is not a rhetorical question. This is a real live question that immigration ministers in this country have been facing for quite some time, but now we have it on a much bigger magnitude. It is a real live issue that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Prime Minister have to confront in the interests of Australia.</para><para>The government needs, as I suggested, to have those resources offshore to stem the tide and draw the line clearly between those who are bona fide and those who are not. But, at the end of the day, let us acknowledge in all our rhetoric that, on the basis of 15 per cent, we will be left with some thousand or so people who will not have a place to go to or an airline to take them; we will be basically caught with them. How do we educate our public? How do we make them more aware of the fact that those real live situations will be here for us to handle? We should not do it in the way the Australian Democrats suggest; we should do it internationally in cooperation with UNHCR and countries like Norway and Indonesia. I commend the opposition amendment to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>26800</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI agree with Senator Bolkus that the issue of people coming out of the Middle East is very important. We all have to think very carefully about the issue and consider its implications as well as the fate of the people involved. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Philip Ruddock, has done an excellent job in perhaps one of the most difficult of government portfolios. I have nothing but praise for the way in which he and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs have handled the avalanche of people who are coming to Australia from the Middle East in particular.</para></talk.start><para>Australia has an outstanding record with respect to refugees. From back in the 1930s to the post World War II era, Australia has accepted large numbers of refugees. At the present time, I am told, there is somewhere around 23 million people in the world who have left their home countries. That is an enormous number of people. Australia can proudly say that it has played its role in looking after its share of the refugees of the world. But Australia is a quite a small country with limited resources. We have a population of only 19 million, and there is only so much we can do.</para><para>Australia has an intake quota of 10,000 refugees per year who come through the assessment processes of the United Nations, the Red Cross and other such agencies. When people come through those assessment processes, they are screened for health, criminal records and political associations. Some of the people who claim to be refugees of course are not refugees. Some of them are criminals, some of them are spies, some of them are political agents of repressive regimes, some of them have health problems that we would not want to have in Australia and some of them are not who they claim to be. Sometimes they claim to be citizens of a country but they bring no documents to Australia, although they obviously needed them to get onto an aircraft or a vessel to come to Australia. In fact, they come from a country other than the country they claim to be from, and they claim refugee status because of persecution in the country they falsely claim to come from. So there is much to be said for the process of assessing refugees in an orderly way. </para><para>The extra people who are coming in via the back door, through Indonesia and on the boats, are not going through that process. This group of people on the Norwegian boat off Christmas Island are an example of that. These people were on a boat in the Indonesian search and rescue zone. They were six hours from Merak, an Indonesian port on the south side of Java, when they were picked up. It would have been very easy for the master of the vessel to take them back to Indonesia but, under duress, he was asked to take them to Christmas Island, which he did. The point has to be made that these people have never entered Australia. There is no question, therefore, that Australia has any legal obligation to them. There is no question of our having an international law requirement to admit them to this country or to assess their claims of being refugees. These people have come from Indonesia and, under international law, they should go back to Indonesia. Nevertheless, Australia does recognise that the 430-odd people on this boat do need food and medical attention. Arrangements have been made for food and medical attention to be provided to the people on the boat for as long as they remain in the waters around Christmas Island.</para><para>We have to ask ourselves why these people come to Australia in this way. They come to Australia because our assessment system for refugee status is easier than that in the camps run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or the Red Cross. In Indonesia, only 14 per cent of Afghanis are assessed as refugees against United Nations criteria. When these same people come to Australia and they have gone through a process of assessment in the detention centres, and then into a series of legal appeals that are available to them under the Australian legal system, the percentage that are assessed as refugees rises to 85 per cent. Australia is a country where it is pretty easy to get refugee status compared with many other countries in the world, because our legal system has extended the criteria of the United Nations.</para><para>People also come here because Australia is a country with a good social security system and a good education system and it is an ideal place to live. But, as I said at the beginning, Australia is a country with limited resources. We have a fine record in terms of looking after refugees. We have done our bit. We have a quota of 10,000 a year, and we simply cannot have an open-ended policy of admitting people who come through the back door, through Ashmore Reef or through Christmas Island, and letting them be assessed with the expectation of remaining here as refugees. Australia, as we know, with the influx in recent weeks has just about reached the end of its resources. It is time we gave consideration to how we are going to deal with this. </para><para>I understand the Indonesians have acknowledged that they have certain responsibilities to the people who are entering their country and claiming to be refugees on their way to Australia. I endorse Senator Bolkus's view that more should be done to assess these people offshore and a different methodology should be used. I believe the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has a bigger role to play and I would urge the United Nations to do that. Australia is doing its bit. The minister has done a great job, and I think that in this case these people should be returned to Indonesia after they have received appropriate medical care and attention, if that is needed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>26801</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to be joining in this urgency debate this afternoon. I am sorry we are having an urgency debate. I agree it is a debate we have to have and it is indeed urgent. It is urgent because there is a ship anchored off Christmas Island, an Australian territory. But it is also urgent because the detention centres in Australia are in a state of crisis and it is urgent because of the large numbers of people who are seeking to enter this country illegally, particularly over the last week or so. I would like to have seen Senator Bartlett in the chamber because I want to respond to a few of the matters that Senator Bartlett addressed in moving the urgency motion.</para></talk.start><para>Before I do that, can I give the chamber a bit of good news. While I have been sitting here listening to the debate, I have had some good news about a family that I and my office have been working desperately hard to get into Australia. I am talking about the wife and children of SalahâI will not use the surname of the person because he is already in this countryâwho, as the debate went on here, have been issued with tickets out of Syria to enter Australia and join their husband and father. Salah entered Australia in March of last year as a refugee after 2Â½ years of trying. It took 2Â½ years to get him in, and when we finally got him into Australia as a refugee, to be reunited with his sister who had previously entered into this country as a refugeeâthey are of Iraqi nationality; they are Kurdsâhe did not know at that time if his wife and children were alive or not or, if they were alive, where they were. Through the good offices of the International Red Cross, his family were found in Syria and after his residency was sorted out he returned and joined them briefly to ensure that they were okay when he found out they were alive. Now they have been issued with tickets. </para><para>Although in Australian law there is a right for refugees to be joined by their family members if they were indeed family members at the time of the grant of refugee status, the wife and the five children aged six to 16 were not going to be granted refugee status in this country because there was no room for them. Why was there no room for them? Because others who have got the resources and got the funds to pay people smugglers got here and jumped in front of the queue. For those who say there is no queue, I direct their attention to that particular constituent of mine with whom we have been working for four years to get him and his family into this country. I would ask them to join me when Veyan, the sisterâagain I am not using the surnameâsits in my office with tears flowing out of her eyes, not only for this brother and sister-in-law and her nieces and nephews but for her other brothers in other parts of Europe, having fled in desperate straits and with no ability to work. I would ask them to join me with them and tell them that there is no queue and that those who have the resources to pay the people smugglers can jump to the head of it and have their cases put first.</para><para>We have an urgent situation on our hands at the moment. It is a situation that I do not believe is of Australia's making. I am only going on news reports because I have no entree into either the minister's office or the offices of the UNHCR or of the two other governments that are involved in the issue we are dealing with at the moment. As I understand it, there was a boat making its way to Australia which got into trouble. There was a ship in the vicinity, the master of which exercised his responsibilities under the international Law of the Sea and went and rescued those 400-odd people. He rescued them; he took them from the water and gave them temporary sanctuary on board his vessel. Then what happened? As the ship's masterâas I understood what he said on radio yesterdayâsteamed to a safe port, his ship was diverted. Who was it diverted by? By the very people he had rescued, whose lives he had just saved, who determined, `Uh, oh, we don't want to go where you want to take us or where the international Law of the Sea directs us to. We want to go where we want to go.' I am not saying that that is an act of piracy, but I do know that when a ship is apprehended on the high seas and control is taken away from its master it does verge on piracy. The master, as he was reported on radio yesterday and today, was fearful for his vessel and for members of his crew. I think, as is in the amendment to this motion moved by the Australian Labor Party, he is indeed to be commended for his humanitarian act.</para><para>This debate is urgent for a number of other reasons as well, none the least being that there are a number of human beings on the high seas who are, it would seem, in need of care and protection. But what are they? Are they refugees, asylum seekers or migrants? A number of senators who have entered into this debate, including the mover of the motion, Senator Bartlett, need to understand what we are talking about. They also need to address the definitions we are talking about in this matter. In recent times I have been very pleased to talk with the Reverend Professor James Haire from the National Assembly of the Uniting Church of Australia. He provided me with a policy paper entitled `Asylum Seeker and Refugee Policy Paper'. On page 2 of that policy paper Reverend Haire gives a definition of a refugee and an asylum seeker and explains the difference between migrants and asylum seekers. I am grateful that a church group has done this, because all too often in the debate that has raged on this subjectâcertainly during my service in this parliamentâthere have been great mix-ups and misunderstandings, including by church groups, about the various terms that are used. If an individual such as Sadiq Elmi, who featured very prominently in an inquiry of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee last year, puts his hand up and says, `I am a refugee,' there are many in our community, including church groups, who say, `That person is a refugee because he says he is a refugee.' There are laws that determine whether a person is a refugee or not a refugee and there are also conventions of the international world that go to these determinations as well. I would commend to honourable senators this policy paper from the National Assembly of the Uniting Church of Australia on asylum seekers and refugees and, in particular, to the definitions that are contained within it.</para><para>Reference has been made in this strange urgency motion debate to some of the comments that have emanated from the Prime Minister and indeed from Minister Ruddock. In particular, Senator Bolkus talked of the minister trying to divert attention to legislation that is before the chamber and his getting the Australian Labor Party to debate it. I think he is referring to the <inline ref="S193">Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 1998 [2001]</inline>, which was adjourned in this very chamber on 2 December 1998. It still has not been brought on for debate. The minister has the gall and the audacity to seek to divert public attention away from this urgent matter which is confronting Australia, Norway, Indonesia and, indeed, the UNHCR on to the Australian Labor Party, yet it is the Australian Labor Party who have moved an amendment that actually puts some sense into the urgency motion that has been moved by my colleague Senator Bartlett. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>26803</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAt the moment, there are over 400 men, women and children just like us, with warm hearts and hope for the future of their lives, being tossed on very rough seas and in extraordinary circumstances. They have come from frightful circumstances and are seeking asylum in this country, but they are being turned away. They are being turned away under the glare of international publicity which will do nothing but bring discredit to this wonderful nation of ours. The Prime Minister and Mr Beazley, who stood at his side, washed their hands of their responsibilities and said, `This is a matter for Indonesia or Norway, not us,' even though the boat is moored nearest to our territorial waters at the moment and it was our authorities who asked the Norwegian ship to go to the assistance of these people.</para></talk.start><para>Senator McKiernan has just spoken about piracy. I thought that pirates were people who made others walk the gangplank. Here we have desperate people who felt like jumping overboard if they were not able to proceed to Australiaâand they are being labelled pirates. What an extraordinary vilification of good-hearted people who would become good citizens of this great country of ours if given a go. We are in a country which has a very tiny number of asylum seekers compared with comparable countries in Europe and North America, but by the big parties fuelling the fear and the vilification of these human beings, who are no different from us, a great deal of unnecessary fear in the community has arisen. I think that Australia has turned its back on a whole suite of good values for which we have in the past been rightly famous. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>26803</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Bartlett's urgency motion before the Senate this afternoon addresses four major issues: (1) his claim that the government has refused entry to the Norwegian vessel the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>; (2) his claim that the government is failing to honour its international obligations regarding refugees; (3) a claim that asylum seekers should be able to come to Australia to receive medical attention; and (4) that they should be assessed as refugees. Senator Bartlett is grossly misinformed in the intent of his motion. Let us have a look at the facts. The <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> rescued 434 passengers and crew from their disabled vessel north-west of Christmas Island last Sunday. It was then proceeding to the Indonesian port of Marek but was allegedly turned back to Christmas Island at the insistence of the people it had just rescued. The government has requested that the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> not enter Australian territorial waters and for it to continue on its planned route to Indonesia. Australia is continuing to seek the assistance of the Norwegian and Indonesian governments to secure an acceptable solution for everybody, including the Indonesian crew.</para></talk.start><para>In his second point Senator Bartlett claimed that Australia does not accept its international obligations. What we do not accept is that our immigration policy should be run by people smugglers. We have never denied entry to genuine refugees. We are trying to ensure protection for those who are genuine refugees over those who are not. This government's action today will protect the integrity of our immigration laws and the sovereignty of our country. The third point that Senator Bartlett's motion raises is the need for asylum seekers to have access to Australia to receive medical attention. Let Senator Bartlett be assured that all humanitarian assistance has been offered to Captain Rinnan, including the services of the doctor at Christmas Island. The master of the ship has not asked for any particular security at this stage; however, Australia has despatched HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Arunta</inline> to the area and is seeking a helicopter with a winching capacity to transfer any necessary supplies or offer other assistance from Christmas Island to the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> if it is found to be necessary.</para><para>Senator Bartlett's final point relates to whether Australia is meeting its obligations in relation to assessments for refugee status. It is important to understand that in this year alone almost 3,700 people have arrived in Australia illegally by boat, compared with 2,939 for the whole of last year. So we have already exceeded the number for the whole of last year. An extra $22 million has already been allocated to provide 3,100 extra places in three new emergency detention centres around the country. As well, more than $15 million has already been spent on judicial action, and there are another 200 people awaiting the outcome of refugee appeals processes.</para><para>Senator Bartlett appears to think that our processes are not efficient enough. Does he realise that 80 per cent of applicants for refugee status are given their primary decision within 15 weeks? But, Senator Brown, the workload is growing, it is overwhelming and the backlog is also increasing, and today we have another potential 438 illegal migrants with as many as 900 more likely to come here in the next few weeks. Senator Bartlett might also like to spare a thought for the 1,500 residents of Christmas Island, who in the past month alone have had to cope with an extra 850 people arriving on boats. Their community has grown by 50 per cent in four weeks with no increase in community facilities.</para><para>Let us get the facts about this latest immigration issue on the table. The boat carrying these people was only 90 kilometres from the coast of Java when those people were rescued from their sinking vesselâ75 nautical miles from Christmas Island and well outside Australia's territorial waters, which extend over 12 nautical miles out to sea from Christmas Island.</para><para>The resolution of this very difficult humanitarian problem will come about as a result of careful and sensitive negotiation primarily between Norway and Indonesia, from where these people and their crew sailed, and not from an emotionally charged debate in this chamber. Unfortunate suggestions by Senator Bartlett contained within this motion that we have failed to honour our international obligations or that we would refuse to provide medical attention are particularly unhelpful when they reflect neither truth nor substance. I note that the opposition has moved an amendment to this motion which suggests that the government:</para><quote><para>... co-ordinate a process with the United Nations, Norway and Indonesia to manage a resolution to the current impasse in accordance with international law.</para></quote><para>I am not quite sure where Senator Bolkus has been during the last few days. If there is any doubt that Minister Ruddock has worked day and night on this issue to do exactly that, then I wonder what Senator Bolkus thinks he has been doing. The suggestion that we should `provide interim assistance for the humanitarian needs and safety of asylum seekers and crew on board' is very clearly under way. My speech and the contributions of others today in this place and in the other place have outlined the humanitarian offers that we have on the table: HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Arunta</inline> on its way, a helicopter on its way, supplies available for the ship and a doctor at Christmas Island. Senator Bolkus's amendment that we `acknowledge the humanitarian acts of the Norwegian Master and his crew' leaves me breathless. What have we been doing for the last couple of days if we have not been acknowledging the work of the crew? We have stood by to assist the captain at every opportunity. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>26804</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFirst of all, how can this not be an emotional debate?

I do not begrudge any senator or member of the community who gets emotional in this debate. But, when we are talking about sparing a thought, let us spare a thought for the captain of that Norwegian freighter, let us spare a thought for the fact that we do not have a national strategic, compassionate, tolerant approach to some of these issues, particularly in relation to asylum seekers and refugee cases in this country, and let us spare a thought for the precedent that we may be setting today in relation to international law, our obligations under various treaties and maritime law as well.</para></talk.start><para>As for Senator Ferris's claim that Senator Bartlett is claiming that the government has turned this ship away, the truth is that the Prime Minister has declared that Australia will not allow the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, that Norwegian freighter that has rescued more than 400 boat people stranded off Christmas Islandâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator Ferris</name></talker><para>âHow can we turn it away when it is not even in Australian waters?

The committee has tabled two interim reports, in April and June this year, that detail a number of instances where it has experienced difficulties in obtaining relevant documents to assist it in conducting its inquiry. In the early stages of this inquiry, it became clear to the committee that public accountability would be a major theme in its examination of the initiative.</para><para>This final report, <inline font-style="italic">Re-booting the IT Agenda in the Australian Public Service</inline>, provides a necessary chronology of events, a serious critique and a series of practical, forward looking and necessary recommendations. While examining the immense detail of the whole-of-government outsourcing of IT, above all the committee's focus has been directed to an examination of the efficient, effective and ethical use of Commonwealth resources.</para><para>This report reflects not only upon the Commonwealth's use of Australian taxpayers' money to achieve certain outcomesâthe policy objectives of the initiativeâbut also upon Commonwealth departments' and agencies' accountability to the parliament for those outcomes. This includes public accountability for the management of IT contracts designed to deliver quality IT outcomes, as well as the transparency of those contracts and all other processes involved.</para><para>The implementation of whole-of-government IT outsourcing was an ambitious undertaking and the initiative introduced substantial risks in its own right. While the committee's report to the Senate reveals a series of problems and shortcomings and is critical of many aspects of the initiative, it also acknowledges the positive outcomes. The committee has endeavoured to produce a forward looking report with practical recommendations to improve all aspects of future IT outsourcing.</para><para>Outsourcing, competitive tendering and contracting are not new concepts. Government administrations in Australia and overseas have built up a wealth of experience as they adapt to the dynamic IT marketplace and look for more effective and efficient ways of procuring the goods and services they require. With the government's IT outsourcing initiative, however, the committee found that planningâthe most fundamental axiom of procurement on this scaleâwas inadequate for the task. Lack of planning influenced all levels of the initiative's administration. The lack of early research, analysis and adequate consultation meant that, from the beginning, cracks appeared in the process. No records were retained to record a benchmark against, to evaluate whether and, if so, to what extent, the policy objectives were achieved.</para><para>The whole-of-government initiative is a matter of the greatest public interest. It has attracted favourable and unfavourable submissions and some valuable evidence. When the cracks began to appear, the government and the responsible agencies in the Finance and Administration portfolio, DOFA and OASITO, did not take heed. It required the Auditor-General's report No. 9 of 2000-01 to draw out and make public the deficiencies in the implementation of the initiative. It required an independent review conducted by Richard Humphry AO to pull the government back and to instil better order into the process. It recommended that agencies take back control of their own IT destinies, in accordance with the responsibility they hold under legislation. </para><para>The committee makes 22 recommendations, and I will summarise some of them here. The committee has recommended that recommendation 10 of the Humphry review regarding agencies with distinctive data security needs, such as the science agencies, and agencies with high security needs, such as the Australian Federal Police, be extended to apply to the evaluation of the implementation risks of all other agencies. Another recommendation is that, for future IT outsourcing contracts valued over $10 million, agencies contract the services of both a probity auditor and a probity adviser and that their roles involve separate and distinct tasks. The probity auditors are to keep accurate records and provide sufficient information to allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny of the audit process and for probity auditors' reports to be made public.</para><para>The committee recommends that the Commonwealth adopt an open and transparent methodology for estimating cost savings for IT outsourcing. In developing this methodology, all relevant Commonwealth agencies, including ANAO and DOFA, are to be consulted, and a common methodology adopted. It also recommends that any future requests for tenders and contracts entered into by a Commonwealth agency include provisions that require contractors to keep and provide sufficient information to allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny, including before parliamentary committees, of the contract and its arrangements. </para><para>There are recommendations that the government act immediately to remove barriers, such as onerous requirements, including financial guarantees, that hamper the participation of SMEs in the initiative; that agencies consider releasing an invitation to register interest as part of a pre-qualification phase of the tender process with follow-up public information seminars and briefs; and that tender documentation should clearly identify, at the very least, the relative importance of the separate evaluation components of IT outsourcingâtechnical, corporate, financial and industry development. They should also indicate the evaluation criteria given top priority within each of these components. Further recommendations were that all RFTs for IT outsourcing which contain clauses allowing the Commonwealth broad discretionary rightsâfor example, to exclude a tenderer from the processâalso include a clause which places a clear and definite obligation on the Commonwealth to provide in writing the reasons for such decisions, and that for any future tender process for IT outsourcing, the evaluation plan be finalised and approved before the RFT is issued. </para><para>Other recommendations are that DOCITA investigate the feasibility of publicising and marketing intellectual property rights registers in current contracts under the initiative, as well as details of intellectual property held by agencies that are not outsourced, with a view to maximising returns on Commonwealth intellectual property, and that the government review the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines with a view to making them more explicit and detailed for agency heads operating on behalf of one Commonwealth in a devolved environment and less likely to broad and uncertain interpretation. Further, it recommends that officers performing duties in relation to the procurement of property or services be required to `act in accordance with' rather than simply `have regard to' the core policies and principles and must make written records of their actions and reasons, that the government re-introduce mandatory competency standards for all officers undertaking procurement functions, and that, consistent with the Department of Finance and Administration's policy responsibility for Commonwealth contracting and procurement, competency standards and training be developed by that department. This is to be done in consultation with the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission to ensure consistency with the Australian Public Service values. Another recommendation is that the government consider establishing a centre of IT outsourcing expertise in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, concerned with the technological and industry development side of IT outsourcing but not necessarily the tendering and contracting process. </para><para>The committee proposes that the role of a service unit in DOCITA would be far different from the OASITO model and be more consultative and helpful than the service unit now established in DOFA. It would have broader horizons on IT and would establish and form the hub of a network between IT outsourcing units in Commonwealth agencies. Further, it would assume an education and training role in IT outsourcing, with its focus on IT planning for the future. Finally, the committee recommends that the government give serious consideration to introducing legislation that will provide a greater degree of transparency in Commonwealth contracts by making them publicly available. </para><para>The committee heard from the public and private sectors, from agenciesâinvolved and not involvedâand from industry. In the light of their evidence, the committee has focused its recommendations, some of which I have just mentioned, on strategic improvements to the many facets of outsourcing, including probity and contract management, data security, intellectual property, and succession planningâthe next major challenge. It focuses on privacy issues, on savings or value for money IT services, on transparent and measurable industry development, and on assistance to the Australian Public Service to more productively and successfully outsource their IT requirements in a truly devolved environment. </para><para>The committee reminds the Senate that $1.2 billion of public money has already been committed under the initiative and that the process of outsourcing the Commonwealth's IT is yet to be completed. The committee reminds all parties to this initiative that, in all processes, public accountabilityâaccountability to the parliamentâis paramount. The committee calls on the government to move IT outsourcing forward in the Australian Public Service and to assist agencies and private industry to reboot the initiative by implementing these recommendations.</para><para>May I, on behalf of the committee, express our appreciation to the committee secretariat for its role and commitment in producing this report under very difficult circumstances, and in many circumstances lacking cooperation from many of the departments directly involved in it. Despite all of that, it has been able to put together a comprehensive report which, if followed by the government, should improve considerably our IT outsourcing agenda.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>26809</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Howard government's IT outsourcing initiative has been an outstandingly imaginative and groundbreaking step in public policy with respect to government IT services. The Humphry review signalled a change in direction for the government's IT outsourcing policy. For example, responsibility for the policy's implementation has been devolved to agency heads, who are responsible for choosing the most appropriate outsourcing model and also determining if they want to group together in a cluster. This has meant that <inline font-style="italic">Re-booting the IT agenda in the Australian Public Service</inline>, the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee we are discussing tonight, has, to a significant extent, been looking at the initiative as it once was and not as it currently is. </para></talk.start><para>The reflections on the role of the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology Outsourcing, OASITO, are no longer relevant, because the initiative is no longer a centrally managed process and OASITO no longer has a role to play. Additionally, many of the criticisms made by the majority members of the committee have been made in both the Humphry review and the Auditor-General's report No. 9, <inline font-style="italic">The implementation of whole-of-government information technology infrastructure consolidation and outsourcing initiative</inline>. Given all of this, the necessity for the committee to conduct this inquiry must be questioned.</para><para>The Minister for Finance and Administration, the Department of Finance and Administration and OASITO are all criticised in the majority report for failing to cooperate with the committee, including failing to provide the committee with various documents that it requested. The minister, OASITO and DOFA have not been motivated by a desire to deliberately frustrate the committee in the course of its inquiries, but, while recognising their accountability to the parliament, have been motivated by a legitimate desire to protect the interests of the Commonwealth. The minister, OASITO and the department have provided the committee with voluminous amounts of material, and there were good reasons, including public interest immunity, commercial in confidence grounds and a risk of litigation, why the committee was not given access to certain documents or was given documents with parts blanked out.</para><para>In a broad sense, the IT outsourcing initiative has benefited the Commonwealth government through cost savings and facilitation of access to improved technologies, thus enabling the delivery of services more efficiently and effectively to the Australian people. The initiative also played a key and a positive and constructive role in promoting industry development in the IT sector. The initiative has resulted in six significant achievements. The first is cost savings. The Humphry review found:</para><quote><para>... there is broad agreement that, in the aggregate, the Initiative has delivered significant savings, however there is a divergence of opinion as to the precise quantum. </para></quote><para>The Auditor-General found that the initiative had delivered cost savings to the government. Whilst there has been controversy over the methodology in calculating the savings and the overall quantum of savings, what is not in doubt is that in the aggregate the initiative has delivered considerable cost savings to the Commonwealth.</para><para>The second benefit is industry development. The industry development component of the initiative has been a tremendous success. It has created opportunities for companies which simply would not have existed but for the initiative and provided a valuable stimulus to the development of the IT sector in Australia. In general, the contractors have not only met their ID targets but exceeded them by a significant margin. The ID component of the initiative has created opportunities for small to medium business enterprises and has created jobs in regional Australia. The government has listened to the concerns that have been expressed about inhibitors to SME involvement and is currently working on a relevant action plan.</para><para>Third, the initiative has freed agencies to concentrate on their core function. IT is not a core function of government agencies, and the initiative has freed up agency resources to concentrate on what they do best. Fourth, contractually defined and improved service levels are another outcome and benefit of this initiative. The service agreements that have been concluded with the contractors contain specified service levels that the contractors are required to meet as well as allowing the levying of service credits or financial penalties where contractors fail to meet these minimum levels of service. The contractors have a direct incentive to meet these service levels, because if they do not it will have a direct impact on their profitability. Under the in-house arrangements, IT staff were paid irrespective of service levels, so there was not the same incentive, or even imperative, to improve service levels.</para><para>The fifth benefit was access to specialised skills and knowledge. Agencies have been able to access skills and knowledge which had not been available to them in house. In addition, there have been improved opportunities for former public sector IT employees. A substantial number of former agency IT employees have been employed by either the prime contractors or one of their subcontractors. This has opened up opportunities previously unavailable to these employees, including working for a company whose core business is IT.</para><para>The minority report puts on the record an alternative view of the government's IT outsourcing initiative. I commend it to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>26810</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is not surprising that the government is trying to characterise <inline font-style="italic">Re-booting the IT agenda in the Australian Public Service</inline>, the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee, as a political report. This is very unfortunate, because this report has the character of an analysis. Whilst the findings are justifiably scathing of the coalition, the recommendations are constructive and work towards an improvement in what has beenâI think there is a general consensus outside Minister Fahey's officeâan absolute debacle.</para></talk.start><para>It is not a new issue. As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, it has been going on now for many years. We have evidence in this report showing that the government were told five years ago that they were embarking upon a path that would eventually come undone, that the experiences overseas at that timeâfive years agoâshowed the government that they were not going to achieve the savings and they were not going to be able to effectively administer this in accordance with their promises.</para><para>This report does not attempt to provide an alternative approach to IT outsourcing. Rather, it addresses the coalition's initiative and its operation under the current government. What it identifies is that there are still many potentially fatal flaws, or further fatal flaws, in the coalition's initiative that will continue to damage both the growth prospects of Australian SMEs seeking to participate in government tenders and the ability of government agencies to strategically control and use information technology to improve their operations' efficiencies and service delivery to the citizens of this country. There is a need for further action and I join with my colleague Senator Campbell in commending the recommendations in this report for their immediate consideration.</para><para>I recognise that, for example, the government are still consulting on the best type of industry development model to be associated with IT outsourcing, but I note that they have been doing this since the Humphry review came down in January and still have no answers. They have been leading industry along by the nose, waving a carrot in front of their face, saying, `We have got a better way. We have got a better way.' But they still have not put any cards on the table and we still do not know what the government have in mind as far as industry development is concerned. I encourage the IT industry to assert itself and make demands of this government to get their act together and to provide at least some certainty in what is a very difficult period around elections, with a potential slowdown in IT procurement anyway. That does have a devastating and immediate impact on IT businesses that are trying to do business with government.</para><para>This report recommends a strengthening of the role of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in its coordinating role for IT policy. That is absolutely necessary. At the moment, there is some policy guidance in the National Office for the Information Economy and there is a little bit in the department and there is a little bit over there in Industry. In fact, there is no cohesive approach from the coalition about what drives ICT industry development. What is needed very specifically is a high level of coordination and some political leadership to get the focus on that industry development right and actually use procurement as an active and meaningful tool to boost and support local industry. </para><para>Perhaps the most telling evidence of this government's failing with respect to IT outsourcing is their pitiful response to this long-term inquiry. Their minority report reads like a cut-and-paste of Minister Fahey's media release web site. He is unrepentant. Despite volumes of evidence, the government's opening line describes the initiativeâas we heard from Senator Egglestonâas `outstanding, imaginative and groundbreaking'. I say it is outstandingly ideological, imaginatively incompetent and groundbreakingly short-sighted in its approach and continuation. </para><para>There are several important themes that are drawn out in this report. One, as Senator Campbell mentioned, is the issue of transparency and probity. Not only this report but the previous interim reports into accountability in a commercial environment, emerging issues and case studies demonstrate that this whole IT outsourcing has exposed a shroud of secrecy around the way this government does business with the private sector. Time and time again, the committee made formal requests for information relating to the contracts and the service levels required and the way those contracts were evaluated. Yet there were barriers and fences put up at every step, dating right back to last yearâin fact, dating back to before this inquiry, through the estimates process, when information about the contracts, the evaluation methodologies and the supporting documentation was not forthcoming. </para><para>We had to work through the Senate officers and rely on our rights under parliamentary privilege to gain access to information which should have been available to the committee in a timely fashion. It is very surprising that the government representatives stand up and say, `Everything is out there on the public record.' It took months. This report could have been tabled back in May when it was initially flagged. It was not, because we have had to fight tooth and nail for information that should have been available to the committee, if not on the public record then at least available to the committee in confidence to assist our deliberations on this matter.</para><para>It is only reasonable that the conclusion we draw from this is that the government has something to hide. So the issue of transparency and accountability has provided lessons not just for the procurement of ICTâinformation and communication technologiesâbut in fact for procurement generally and the way that government does business with the private sector. The findings of both this report and the interim reports and related investigations by the Australian National Audit Office point to a new paradigm, a new environment, where government accountability must be improved.</para><para>Another significant area of focus of this report is the issue of industry development. One aspect of that is that the committee has exposed the sham of regional jobs. Again, Senator Eggleston, in speaking to the government's minority report, talked about regional jobsâpressing that hot button out there about what is so good about this. They have been completely discredited about the merits of their outsourcing program and regional jobs because, as this report says, if you take away Canberra and Adelaide and Newcastle from qualifying as regionalâas they do in the government's current calculationsâyou are left with barely 100 jobs that have been created outside major cities. If you take the Gold Coast out of that, you are down to about 24 jobs. The whole concept, the whole sell of this government about the regional aspects of their industry development associated with this is so weak, and it has been exposed.</para><para>Another important element of this is in-house expertise. I turn to the report and mention, particularly, the evidence of an international expert in IT outsourcing, Dr Wilcox. His researchers found that there is a massive lack of innovation as a result of IT outsourcing. He suggested that knowledge of the business is needed to spur innovation but that suppliers often do not have the required level of knowledge and that, in his opinion, they get so buried in the business at hand that they forget to innovate. More than anything else, this report highlights the need for strategic control by agencies and departments to make sure that they extract the most out of innovation and work on building strategic partnerships with the private sector to extract the best possible value for taxpayers' money. Again, this is in defiance of the government's approach to IT outsourcing. </para><para>There are also critical issues in relation to the cultural change required in agencies and departments that tend to be risk averse. They tend to go with the big contractors rather than take a risk with a smaller supplier who might be more innovative. There is also a need to remove barriers for participation for SMEs. Finally, this report demonstrates that this government has an inability to administer its own departments. The attempt to centralise IT outsourcing had the wheels completely fall off it, and this pile of reports is testimony to that failure. It has been a challenge because of the level of obstruction, and I think that the lessons learnt from that will go on to guideâcertainlyâLabor's policy development in the area of strategic sourcing of information and communication technologies. We will certainly put the findings of this report to good use in that regard. I commend the report to the Senate and I very sincerely thank those in the secretariat who put in very long and difficult hours trying to collate and prepare the information for inclusion in this report.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Legislation Committees</title><page.no>26813</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Reports</title><page.no>26813</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>26813</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âPursuant to order and at the request of the chairs of the respective committees, I present reports from five legislation committees in respect of the examination of annual reports tabled by 30 April 2000.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the reports be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name></talker><para>âI advise the Senate that the Community Affairs Legislation Committee and the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee will not be presenting reports, as no annual reports were referred to them in the period.

The inquiry was referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee in October 2000. It was considered necessary because of the need to examine more closely the management and funding of Commonwealth law enforcement. The inquiry was prompted in part by the refusal of the government to provide information by Mr Tony Ayers AO that assessed the issues of the management in the Australian Federal Police in 1998.</para><para>Essentially, the committee was asked to determine the current capability of both agencies in terms of: the management of resources, including staff and information technology; the resourcing of the AFP and the NCA; the relationship between the new AFP certified agreement and the AFP budget management; the appropriateness of any performance indicators used to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the AFP and the NCA as agencies and of their individual operations; any mechanisms for long-term strategic law enforcement policy decision making and oversight of Commonwealth law enforcement priorities, operations and budgets; the recommendations of, and the government's response to, the Ayers report; and whether the requirement the government placed upon the AFP after the Ayers report to find $50 million in internal savings has in fact been achieved and, if it has, if this was at the expense of operational capacity.</para><para>The focus of the inquiry on determining the capacity of the AFP and NCA to meet their specific objectives meant that the committee relied on a small number of witnesses. With their great assistance, the committee has been able to put forward a detailed response on most of the terms of reference.</para><para>As mentioned above, one of the terms of reference the committee was charged with by the Senate was to examine the recommendations of, and the government's response to, the Ayers report. Unfortunately, the committee was hampered by the attitude taken by the government. The then Minister for Justice and Customs indicated that, because the Ayers report was a cabinet document, it could not be made available for purposes other than cabinet deliberations. The minister did release to the committee the summary of findings, the milestones section and some appendices. However, it would have been more helpful if the committee had been allowed to see the full reportâif necessary, with any classified material deleted.</para><para>In evidence to the committee, both agencies recognised that the government's budgeting climate dictated a limitation in resources and a trend towards inflexible tied funding. The challenge for law enforcement agencies is prioritising resources in an environment that sees new types of crime emerging. The committee found that the AFP's experience with funding over the last few years has been very different from that of the NCA. The AFP was not required to make the same savings in running costs as the NCA during the 1996-97 period. The AFP received funds to enable it to increase and reprofile its work force and to purchase new equipment. The AFP had more flexibility in moving tied funds and in borrowing against future years. Funding of the AFP's reform program will now be part of its base funding instead of being tied, as it had been up until this year. It also appears that the AFP has received funding towards its certified agreement on a more generous basis than that of other agencies. It is encouraging to see from the NCA's forward estimates that its general funding situation will improve and that one of the financial problems presented by the secondment of large numbers of police to the NCA is being addressed.</para><para>It is commonly argued that, because of its nature, police work is difficult to measure and cost. It is against this backdrop that the committee considered any performance indicators for the AFP and the NCA. Overall, the committee was impressed by the ongoing effort of the AFP `to develop and enhance its performance measurement tools'. In respect of the NCA, the committee suggests that the performance indicators of the NCA have really been only quantitative measures that do not provide real information on the effectiveness and efficiency of the agency. In this sense, there are no actual performance indicators for the NCA other than statistics. The committee recommends, to address this problem, that the NCA implement its proposed integrated performance measurement framework as a matter of urgency.</para><para>The committee also examined other resourcing issues such as staff numbers and information technology in relation to operational needs. Generally speaking, these arrangements improved over more recent years. The committee does note concern with the current internal and external complaints system of the AFP. The committee found that this system was complex and could work unfairly against employees. For this reason, the committee recommended that the procedures for dealing with complaints and allegations be examined with a view to their being simplified and made more transparent and to ensuring that employees are not disadvantaged by the use of administrative instead of disciplinary processes.</para><para>The committee also examined the certified agreement for the period 1999-2002, a period that marks a transitional period for the AFP. The essential feature of this agreement is a more flexible use of both people and time to achieve better outcomes. Overall, it would seem that sworn officers have received considerable benefits in training, opportunities and payments.</para><para>From the onset of the inquiry, the material given to the committee indicated that there are no adequate mechanisms for long-term strategic law enforcement policy and oversight of Commonwealth law enforcement priorities, operations and budgets. This was also supported by one of the findings from the Ayers inquiry which identified `a need for a separate review of the Commonwealth's criminal intelligence effort'. This review has not been undertaken. Different mechanisms for making long-term policy decisions and oversighting priorities, operations and budgets were suggested to the committee. The National Crime Authority emphasised its belief that a whole of government response was needed:</para><quote><para>The real question in Australia is whether or not this country, at federal or state level, has a whole-of-government approach to what is an increasing area of interest to all of us, and that is the rise of organised crime ... commentary [on organised crime] will, to some extent, touch on that in the sense of what might be described as a convergence of interests. That is what is lacking in the Australian context. At the federal level and elsewhere, there probably is not the sophistication in bringing together the law enforcement and aligned interests that have an interest in the issues, like organised crime, that affect our lives.</para></quote><para>After deliberations, the committee has made the following recommendations:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline></para><para>The Committee <inline font-weight="bold">recommends</inline> that the Government examine the best means of providing a point or body for the effective peak management and coordination of the Commonwealth law enforcement effort, and work to its expeditious implementation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline></para><para>The Committee <inline font-weight="bold">recommends</inline> that, in light of recommendation 3, the party responsible for the effective coordination and oversight of the Commonwealth law enforcement effort develop, and regularly update, a quantified estimate of the `criminal environment', into which law enforcement bodies provide input.</para></quote><para>Finally, I want to thank my colleagues who served on the committee during the inquiryâparticularly my deputy, Senator Marise Payne, who particularly assisted by attending every one of the hearings of the committee. I must also mention the staff of the secretariat of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, and I refer to Saxon Patience, Sonia Hailes, Yvonne Marsh, Mr Noel Gregory and Dr Pauline Moore. We had some difficulties in dealing with the inquiry because of pressures from our sister committee, the legislation committee, and other work that the Senate gave to us.

After some approaches by the opposition we got the government to agree to separate them. In some weeks past, we have dealt with the earlier parts of the bill, which of course dealt with the increase in penalties on persons who escape from legal custody.</para></talk.start><para>This particular part of the bill is very useful legislation and legislation to be commended because it is an example of what can be done in this place through the cooperation and involvement of parties in the development of legislation that is going to be of assistance not only to those persons who are particularly impacted by the legislation in the first instance but to the Australian community as a whole.</para><para>The purposes of the bill are firstly to provide for the power to conduct strip searches of detained asylum seekers, or even persons who have exhausted the asylum seeker processes and who are held in detention, as a means to safeguard the working conditions of officers who work in those detention establishments and whose job is to guard the detainees and also protect other detainees from those who might wish to do harm to those who are held in detention as well. It also provides forâand this was something that gave the members of the opposition a real cause to thinkâthe ability to strip search young peopleâchildren as young as 10 years old. That weighed very heavily on our minds when we were determining our attitude to the legislation as it is proposed.</para><para>We weighed up a number of factors and took into account that over the past 18 months to two years there have been a number of riots, disturbances, protests and escapes from immigration detention centres: from Woomera in South Australia, from Curtin and Port Hedland in Western Australia and from Villawood in New South Wales. These disturbances resulted in several officers and detainees sustaining some very serious injuries and there was substantial damage done to public property. The actions by some detainees have cost Australian taxpayers many millions of dollars. I am not in the position at this point in time to go into the reasons why those actions occurred. I know that there are some charges before the Australian courts against some of the alleged offenders who have taken part in the disturbances and I do not want to canvass too much more on that.</para><para>It must be remembered that while these disturbances were taking place individuals' safety was being endangered, be it the safety of the guards who were working in the establishment or that of other detainees in the establishments where the persons were detained. Also, one has to remember that there is a community in some instances in very close proximity to the detention facilities. For example, in my home state of Western Australia, in Port Hedland there have been actual en masse escapes which did cause very grave concern within that community. In Villawood, we have also seen escapes into the housing areas which are in the immediate vicinity. Even in remote Woomera the detainees who escaped en masse on one particular occasion were able to get themselves into town, where they remained for quite some period of time.</para><para>We are really concerned about the escalation of violence in Australia's detention facilities and we certainly had this uppermost in our minds when we were considering how we would deal with the provisions that the minister was suggesting ought to be put in place. We considered the bill in very grave detail and, as I indicated in opening my commentary this afternoon, the bill has been split. We are grateful that the minister did that, and we are very grateful for the consultations that were held between the opposition and the government. We arrived at a position which I think is a very useful way of protecting individuals, be they the officers who work in the facilities or indeed the detainees. We considered in detail the provisions of the bill and consulted widely with others before arriving at our position on it, because we do have concerns about what possibly could have been routine strip searching and other searching that may have occurred. We have sought during the course of the consultations to put in guidelines or to make sure that guidelines are established that will ensure there is no abuse of the extended powers that will be included in the legislation.</para><para>Following our consultations we approached the government with a number of amendments and measures that the opposition believed would establish a process whereby the seriousness of the search and the need to prevent abuse of powers were reflected in the process leading to a strip search being actually conducted. We also discussed who would authorise a strip search, who should be present when a strip search was being conducted and who should be aware of strip searches happening. The following measures have been agreed to by the government and are now reflected in the legislation: an amendment providing for strip searches to be conducted only after an objective assessment is proven, that is, following the conduct of conventional searches which are limited to passing through a metal detector, scanning by a hand-held metal detector or a conventional frisk or pat-down search or other intelligence that is available to officers; an amendment providing that authorisation for a strip search must be given by a DIMAâDepartment of Immigration and Multicultural AffairsâSenior Executive Service officer of at least acting deputy secretary level or above; an amendment providing that in the case of a minor being strip searched the permission for a strip search must be given by a magistrate; and an amendment providing the detainee with the option of having another person of their choice present as a witness during the conduct of the strip search.</para><para>The Senate would know that on a number of occasions I have visited detention centres around Australia and that in fact I was in the Curtin Detention Centre in January of this year with the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade a day or so after a major disturbance occurred in that facility. I witnessed the various weapons that had been available for use in the disturbance that occurred there prior to the committee's visit. One would not need to strip search an individual to determine that an individual was carrying some of the weapons. We saw legs of tables and chairs and other pieces of furniture which had been dismantled in order to provide weapons. We saw other more devious means of manufacturing weapons, some of which were described by the minister when he was preparing the ground for the introduction of the bill. In my parliamentary life I have seen other weapons manufactured by individuals in detention. In my most recent visit to the Curtin Detention Centre outside Derby in Western Australia I was told of an incident where the assistant DIMA manager of the facility had her safety put in jeopardy when she was threatened with the blade of a safety razor. I was told that the blade had been removed from the razor and inserted into the thong that the detainee was wearing when he went for an interview with the assistant manager. This young woman found herself in the circumstance where the detainee was between herself and the door, stopping others coming in as well as stopping her leaving. The blade was actually hidden in the thong that he was wearing. Her safety was very seriously in jeopardy. Thankfully, neither she nor the detainee were harmed in those circumstances. I hope that the legislation that hopefully will pass this chamber in a very short time will help to address such circumstances as those.</para><para>There is great difficulty with our detention centres at the moment, not only regarding what has been mentioned so far but also regarding ongoing matters. We heard the news today about the Woomera facility being on amber alert. There are great concerns about further disturbances there. We have also heard in the media today of further hunger strikes, including by young people, in the Curtin Detention Centre in Western Australia. I do not think that the strip search powers that are being addressed in this legislation will overcome those matters, but something must be done about the circumstances that we find in our detention centres at the moment. The problem is continuing to grow, as we have heard in earlier debates. More and more people are coming to this country: we have had something like 1,000 people arrive in the last week or so. These people need to be held while they are being processed to determine whether or not they are in need of Australia's protection. </para><para>Not everybody who comes to Australia claiming refugee status is found to be in need. I suggest that that may be one of the reasons why we are having disturbances in our detention facilities. Some people who have had their claims for refugee status rejected have gone to the Refugee Review Tribunal and again been rejected. Indeed, I know of other cases where people have gone to the courts and have also been rejected. I know of instances where people in our detention facilities have exhausted all administrative and legal processes that are open to them and are now awaiting removal back to their home countries, but they will not cooperate with the authorities in order to get the paperwork done that will facilitate their removal from Australia. </para><para>It is all very well for those persons who ring my office to complain about inaction by government and inaction by opposition regarding people held in detention. One cannot just load people into a Hercules aircraft or into a much larger aircraft and send them back to a country in the Middle East. You just cannot do that. There are international regulations and laws covering the removal of people and the landing of people. For example, we would not like it if people claiming to be Australians being held in another countryâI will not name a countryâwere then removed from that country back to Australia, landing in an aircraft with no landing permission. That would not be a circumstance we would comply with, and it is not something we would do to others.</para><para>It is also said that, because in many cases the last port of embarkation of these people before they arrive in Australia is Indonesia, that is the place to which they should be sent back. I would not think that the Indonesian authorities or governments at a national or a local level would take too kindly to us, the Australian parliament, authorising the removal of individuals without papers back to their country simply because those individuals claimed that their last port of embarkation was that country. </para><para>We are dealing with a very complex problem. I must say that the complexity of the problem is not improved by some of the rhetoric emanating from the minister's voice in some recent times. We do have a difficulty and, as is being practised right here and now, the opposition are cooperating with the government to address these problems in what is considered to be the best way forward. We are cooperating; we have supported most of the legislation that has been brought into the parliament, and most of it has indeed been passed. Where we are being consulted on the legislation in the beginning or during the process, the legislation has been improved, just as this legislation that we are dealing with now has been improved.</para><para>The rhetoric that is coming from the minister is not helping in most circumstances. Some pressure has been put on the opposition partiesâand, I dare say, on the smaller parties within the chamberâto pass legislation. They are not talking about this legislation; I know the legislation they are talking about. Let me read to the Senate a copy of a letter that I received today. I will not give the names of the individuals because I have not sought their permission to give their name, but they are constituents of mine from Western Australia. It is dated today, 28 August, and it says:</para><quote><para>Dear Senate Member,</para><para>I feel compelled to email you regarding the very serious situation with the influx of refugees into Australian waters.</para><para>Being a fourth generation Australian it was my ancestors who fought to keep Australia a free country and Christian country for our families.

And if we pass this legislation that we are currently debating, it will not mean one iota and it will not stop one unlawful arrival coming into this country. And what do we get? What the minister is doing is inflaming the community, and for that the minister and, indeed, the government have to be ashamed. Not only are constituents taking it up, but look at what candidates for the Liberal Party are doing and at the various pamphlets and literature that has been circulated, for example, in the seat of Dickson in Queensland, in the seat of Gilmore by the member, Mrs Gash, and also in the seat of Fadden, which is held by Mr Jull. The propaganda that has been peddled by those people really is verging on xenophobia and building it up in our community. It is verging on racism. Where is it coming from? It is coming from what used to be known as the `oval office', because nothing that happens with his government happens without the approval of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We know of Mr Howard's attitude to people who come from Asia.

There is no need for it, and the government and the minister ought to be condemned for filling the community with this racial hatred.

The latest news to hand is that, according to the Indonesian Ambassador, those people will not be given the ability to go ashore in Indonesia. The Australian government, backed by the opposition, has said that the people on the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, the Norwegian ship, should not be allowed to land on Christmas Island or on Australia proper. The Prime Minister has washed his hands of the fate of these people, with Mr Beazley standing at his side, by saying that it is a matter for Norway or Indonesia. So the numbers are now reduced, if what the Indonesian Ambassador has said is correct, down to Norway being the one noncommittal country. Without expecting that the people will be shipped to the other side of the planet to escape this callous rejection of them from the shores of Australia or of our northern neighbour, we have to have a good look at what this particular incident is doing to us. I will come back to the people on the ship in a moment.</para></talk.start><para>What is it doing to this country which has such a proud reputation for being multicultural and for going to the aid of people who are in difficulty? This country recently took an extraordinary risk in putting in a huge amount of human effort and resources into assisting our near neighbour East Timor in its moment of tragedy. This country has a reputation, in which it glorifiesâand I like to be an Australian who thinks this wayâfor being a country of a fair go and a country, therefore, that respects all human beings as deserving of a fair go. That reputation is now being tested. You cannot have that sort of philosophy ending at a border drawn somewhere against people on the other side.</para><para>The world is looking at this ship with these poor people aboard, and it is wondering where the humanity is that is going to give them succour. It is seeing that Australia, the country these people wished to get to, has turned them down and said that it is up to Indonesia, a much poorer country with great recent internal difficulties and without the clear line of authority and ability to move on behalf of the national interest, I would submit, that the incumbent government here in Canberra has. But the Howard government, in the wake of five years of increasing harshness and implied vilification in many cases of people coming to our shores, has turned its back on these people and said that Indonesia might be a country with greater humanitarian reception for them. Indonesia, for the time being, has said no, and Norway is left, in the Prime Minister's estimation, as the next country which should take these people. The reality is that he is wrong. Yesterday, he met rapidly with his cabinet when the news broke of the rescue taking place between Christmas Island and Indonesiaâand let us not forget in a situation of quite considerable domestic political embarrassmentâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>âTalk about the people smugglers who got them into this situation.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>âand decided that the ship should turn around. Having asked the captain of the ship to take the people on board, he then said `But you can't come here,' when those people said, `We want to land in Australia.' Australia now stands indicted because of the action of the Prime Minister and his cabinet, which action was highly motivated not by the interests of the asylum seekers but by domestic political expediency in the run-up to the election. In doing so, the nation's reputation is going down in the eyes of the whole world. In the coming days this incident, which has now become an international incident and which is playing on the television screens of people right around the planet, will do this nation enormous harm.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On this occasion the asylum seekers are no different from those taken ashore in recent months and recent years, except for one fact: we have a government going to an election badly needing a distraction. In doing so, it is prepared to play to the basest motive of fear in the people. That fear is being played up, and the interjection which came just a moment ago from the government member opposite shows how easily words are usedâquite improperlyâto impugn those people on the boat and to make us fearful that there is some sort of immediate threat to our own wellbeing from their presence on that ship. That is patently not so. When you get a political situation like this and a government that has decided that, for reasons of its own, it can use these people as pawns in the run-up to an election, all manner of principle and fair dealing goes out the window, and that is what is happening in this situation. The Prime Minister is even prepared to allow Australia's reputation as a fair, honest, welcoming and humane country to be shoved down for an immediate base political purpose. It is disgusting that the Prime Minister and the cabinet made that decision yesterday. As the people on the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, including the captain and his crew, get used as hostages for the Prime Minister's political advancement, as he sees it, the rest of the world will count us down as a nation. I object to that. Neither I nor the Greens will be part of it.</para><para>My officeâlike everybody else's office, I have no doubtâhas had a huge reaction to what is going on off Christmas Island at the moment. We have had angry calls, and we have had some calls during which the phone should have been put down much faster. But, fortunately, I have got tolerant staff who try to give people a hearing. But, in my case at least, the preponderant calls are coming from good-hearted Australians who say, `We don't want to be party to this increasing incarceration of people seeking asylum in our country,' or their being turned back in their tracks almost as an echo of the policy performance put forward by One Nation's Pauline Hanson just a couple of years ago and seen then as so despicable. That is what our government is doing now and, very sadly, that is what our opposition is endorsing in this case. I thank the people who are of a different thinking out there in the electorate. I thank those people from all walks of life, religions and philosophies who are saying: `We will not be part of this. This is not the Australia we want. This is not the set of principles we want to see when it comes to dealing with people, including women, children and men, in distress on the high seas just off our coastline.'</para><para>Let me talk about these people for a moment. There are, as we comfortably sit or stand here tonight, 1.2 million Afghani refugeesâour mind is concentrated on some 400 at the moment but there are 1.2 million of themâin refugee camps in Pakistan in deplorable conditions that none of us would want to see our families in. If we were able to alleviate their suffering, then the diaspora that is coming from that huge body of people might not be occurring. But in a country which is rich by any standards less than $1 million has gone from this government to help those 1.2 million people suffering in despicable circumstances in the last year. In that same time, $120 million has been spent in detention centres very little different from jails here in Australia for people like them who have managed to make it to our shores without appropriate papers.</para><para>Instead of going and trying to turn the tap off, the governmentâand the oppositionâis putting a finger on the nozzle at the other end. It has got its priorities wrong. Its meanness of spirit in denying its obligation to help people like those Afghani refugees in despicable circumstances is part of the problem. The body politic in this country must share some of the blame. We are not an isolated country. We are not an island to ourselves anymore. We have a government that, above all, promotes globalisation, because it wants to make money out of being in the global community. But when it comes to the movement of people, rather than money, it draws the line, because in these circumstances money is more important than people. That is what it is about. That is where we are at.</para><para>I have heard from the opposition today about how these people, the refugees, including Afghanis, are displacing other people who want to come to this country. One thing is being overlooked here. It is very easy to say: `They are queue jumpers. They are getting in in front of other people who could come here on humanitarian grounds'â`taint so. Let me read a letter dated yesterday from Mr Bert Gray from Beacon Hill to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. He says:</para><quote><para>In defending his punitive treatment of asylum seekers, Mr Ruddock claims that he is giving priority to the millions of refugees in camps in countries of first asylum. Yet <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> correspondent Christopher Kremmer (<inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline>, June 16) reported that of the 1.2 million refugees in Pakistan, only 450 had been referred by the UNHCR to Australia last year, and the number this year is likely to be 600.</para><para>Given the often desperate conditions in these camps, can Mr Ruddock explain why the number of off-shore humanitarian places for refugees was slashed from 15,000 in 1995-96 to 5,700 in 2001-01?</para></quote><para>We have cut the number of humanitarian refugee places, and I will tell you how we have balanced that: by increasing the number of so-called skilled and wealthy people able to buy their way into this country. It is not other humanitarian refugees whose places these asylum seekers coming in boats to this country are competing with; it is wealthy migrants being afforded entry into Australia in greater proportions than ever before in recent history. I do not wish for them not to come here, but I do believe that the government should stop this quite false argument and vilification that the people being denied here are queue jumpers. The government itself, through its own policy, has closed the door on thousands of humanitarian refugees coming to this country. </para><para>When I turn to the specific bill in hand, what we have here is a piece of legislation to allow strip searchingâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>âI am sorry? The member opposite, Senator Patterson, does not want to repeat that interjection. That is for her. But this legislation does allow for strip searching of asylum seekers from the age of 10 upwards who find themselves in detention centres in this country. My first point on this matter is that those detention centres ought not be working in the way that they are. They are essentially jails. Countries taking a far greater burden of asylum seekersâcomparable countries in Europe and North Americaâhave not found them necessary. But that is the reaction of this government and this opposition. Because of this mentality that people coming to this countryâwomen, children and menâfleeing desperate circumstances are criminals until proven otherwise, we have created a system where we receive them into jails. The treatment in those detention centres then leads to a cycle of violence and psychological despair. We are going in the direction of the American prison system which, as reported yesterday, contains two million people. I am very familiar with the lockdown situation in the United States, which defies all human dignity, including that of those who have created it. It is very similar to the Port Arthur asylum treatment of over 150 years ago. </para></talk.start></continue><para>What I warn against here is the increasing repression within these detention centres of people who are already distressed coming to our shores. Here we have strip-searching, with provisionsâand we will go into those in the committee stage. I have been in jail as a result of peaceful protest in Tasmania and I faced repeated strip searches in jail. That is okay for me, because I knew where I was, I knew that I was close to home and I knew that there were people around and that it would not be long before I got out of jail. But this indignity, without the required specificationâI will get to that in the committee stageâis another step towards making these prisons places of inhumanity which Australia in future will look back on with the most deep and dire regret. I will not be part of this increasing criminalisation of asylum seekers and the harshness with which they are received on to the shores of this great nation. I oppose this piece of legislation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>26823</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1339">Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill (No. 2) 2001</inline>.

Australians are now becoming very aware of the overwhelming numbers that are going to arrive illegally on our shores. This is creating a great deal of heat out in the community. While this bill is not aimed at addressing this problem, it is, however, directed at increasing the ability of the relevant authorities to maintain a safe environment for both the detainees and the detention centre staff. I emphasise that the government and this Senate have a duty of careâa responsibilityânot only to the members in those detention centres but also to those who are given the authority to administer them. This bill goes towards providing a safe environment for both the detainees and the detention centre staff within the detention centres.

That is why I accepted with great pleasure an opportunity a few weeks ago to address some 170 Brisbane business and community leaders gathered at the Go CareerâEnterprise and Career Education Business seminar. The purpose of the seminar was to publicise a recent federal government initiative designed to assist high school students in making a successful transition into the world of employment.</para></talk.start><para>In March this year, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr David Kemp, launched the Enterprise and Career Education Foundation. The foundation is designed to build on the important work of the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation. The main objective of all these projects is to more effectively link business, schools and the community and thus encourage and support effective partnerships between schools and industry. To that end the Commonwealth government has allocated nearly $100 million over the next four years.</para><para>On that same occasion earlier this year, Dr Kemp launched a campaign known as Go CareerâEnterprise and Career Education. Go Career is a brand logo directed to businesses, schools, parents and the wider community, to help them easily identify which programs and activities are available for young people in developing their career and enterprise skills.</para><para>We are living in what we all call today a global economy. Australia has no choice but to move forward and embrace the rest of the world. But to reap the future benefits of open markets and free movement in goods, services and information, we have to lay the necessary groundwork today. Educating and training the next generation of Australians to take full advantage of future opportunities is an essential part of that long-term project.</para><para>More than at any other point in her history, the Australia of the future will need a well-educated, highly skilled and flexible work force. The next generation of workers will have to be enterprising and innovativeâresponsive to the changing world. We need to help our young people today acquire the key skills, but in a globalised world this of itself will not be enough. We also need to help them acquire enterprising attributes that will take them all through their future work life. We need to ensure that they embrace the concept of lifelong learning and that they acquire the capacity to develop and manage their own lives and careers in a world where the only constant is change. </para><para>As we expect our young people in the future to be innovative, so do we in the government need to be innovative today in finding the ever different and fresh ways of preparing young people for their adult life. This is where initiatives like Go Career come in. By getting out to schools and local communities, by sharing the good news stories about young people who have made successful careers through enterprise and career education activities, the participants in and supporters of Go Career can encourage and inspire young people and their parents. When people see the Go Career brand they will know that it is associated with a quality enterprise and career education activity, whether it is vocational education programs in school, career advice, employability skills, work placement or school based New Apprenticeships.</para><para>Go Career obviously benefits our young people, but it also benefits Australian businesses. By getting involved in the training of young people who are still at school, businesses will enhance their skills base, and this in turn will help them to become more productive and will improve their bottom line. As well, of course, businesses will be putting something back into the community. There are already well over 50,000 businesses participating in enterprise and career education activities nationally. But the initiative could do with another 50,000. There are over 153,000 young people engaged in these programs plus nearly 6,000 young people in school based New Apprenticeships, an option that was virtually non-existent three years ago. But there is still scope for further progress and expansion.</para><para>Schools too have a very important role to play in this initiative by encouraging students to participate in various programs. It is a firm belief of the Howard government which I strongly share that in this and other educational initiatives school authorities should play a crucial role in cooperation with community organisations and businesses in building partnerships and social networks that help students make the transition from school to the wider world.</para><para>Education and training have been two areas of public policy which, for all its rhetoric, the Labor Party has much neglected while in government. This is the state of affairs the Howard government made a strong commitment to remedying. Mr Beazley speaks of his Knowledge Nation, but it is the Howard government that has put in place real programs that help our children and young people to obtain decent education and therefore a good start in life. While Mr Beazley cooks up his meatballs and spaghetti diagrams, the Howard government has delivered and served the main course.</para><para>Labor's sorry legacy in education was schools where one-third of children could not read and write properly. Labor's legacy was the neglect of apprenticeships and vocational education, and that meant ignoring the needs of 70 per cent of young people who do not go on to tertiary education. In opposition, Labor's tune has not changedâthe Australian people are still waiting for realistic, workable policy alternatives from Labor. Instead, Mr Beazley serves out some warmed up class warfare rhetoric and the politics of envy against non-government schools and offers meaningless stunts such as his Knowledge Nation fiasco. Meanwhile, under the Howard government, the total Commonwealth education budget has reached and passed $11 billion a year. This represents a 15 per cent real increase in Commonwealth expenditure between 1994-95 and 2000-01.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name></talker><para>âYou normally do not read.

To help children in our primary schools, the Howard government has set up the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan, which will assess children's literacy and numeracy skills at the end of years 3 and 5 and, if necessary, take early remedial action, which I am sure, Senator Ludwig, you agree with. To that end, the Howard government will spend almost $869 million over the next four years.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the area of vocational training the Howard government too has shown great initiative. The government will spend $2 billion over four years for New Apprenticeships initiatives, including $1.5 billion in incentives for employers to take on new apprentices. Over the next three years it is expected that 425,000 young people will become apprentices as a result of the completion of a new round for contracts for New Apprenticeships centres. These are the sorts of practical programs that are bringing tangible benefits to young Australians. No empty rhetoric, just real outcomes. The Go Career initiative is a perfect example of this down to earth, commonsense approach to education and training. The best legacy that any government can leave is to ensure the future wellbeing of its people. I am proud to be a part of a government that understands this challenge and acts on it for the good of our young people and therefore for the future good and prosperity of Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>International Year of Volunteers</title><page.no>26825</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>26825</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs all members of this chamber will be aware, the year 2001 not only marks the celebration of the Centenary of Federation; it is also marks the celebration of the International Year of Volunteers. Indeed, it is very appropriate that our Centenary of Federation and the International Year of Volunteers should share the same year. The Centenary of Federation serves to celebrate the strength of purpose and unity that Federation has brought to Australia. It has been a period in which we, as a nation, have acknowledged the contributions made by Australians from all walks of life to our communities and to the nation as a whole. The International Year of Volunteers is an ideal way to specifically recognise the contributions made by those thousands of volunteers who contribute much personal time and effort to our communities both in the cities and in regional and remote Australia.</para></talk.start><para>In Australia, the International Year of Volunteers aims to meet a number of objectives: to recognise and celebrate the outstanding contribution volunteers make to a strong, cohesive Australian society; to have community, business, the media and government work together to build an Australian society that encourages and nurtures a culture of volunteering; and to support Australian communities in their engagement in valuable and productive voluntary activities. These are laudable goals and worthy of all our support. Indeed, can you imagine an Australia without volunteers? These tireless workers are everywhere you look. They are the coaches of our local soccer, football and cricket teams; they are leaders of the local Scouts and Girl Guides; they are the parents at the markets, cooking hamburgers to raise money for the local P&amp;C; and they are also the retired couples who help support the local hospital auxiliary. As I stated earlier, volunteers are everywhere we look, carrying out countless numbers of valuable tasks. </para><para>I digress for a moment to talk about my parents-in-law. My mother-in-law, who is currently the president of the auxiliary at the QEII, was only this year recognised for her volunteer work of some nine years or more as a working member of the local hospital. The auxiliary has put a considerable amount of money and individual effort into ensuring that the hospital runs well. It has supplied equipment over and above what would normally be supplied to doctors. The auxiliary is a hard-working committee, and the award recognises not only Marjorie O'Keeff but also the many other people who have helped and assisted at the QEII. </para><para>Recently, I had the great pleasure of visiting the towns of Pittsworth and Oakey, in my home state of Queensland, in order to present International Year of Volunteers certificates to a number of very worthy recipients. The presentation ceremonies sought to meet the goals of the International Year of Volunteers by publicly recognising the outstanding achievements of volunteers in Pittsworth and Oakey. They served as a focal point for these communities and were well supported by local businesses, councils and community organisations. I was very pleased with the support given to the International Year of Volunteers by the councils of Pittsworth and Oakey. My personal thanks goes to the Mayor of Pittsworth, Councillor Ros Scotney, the Deputy Mayor of Oakey, Councillor Peter Langton, and Councillors Annette Frizzell and Di McIntosh of the Oakey Shire Council. Their support made the presentation ceremonies a real community event. The people who received International Year of Volunteers certificates were an excellent representation of all those volunteers who largely go unrecognised and unthanked by our communities. A hearty round of applause was certainly overdue for all the work that they do for their local community. </para><para>In Pittsworth, I presented certificates of recognition to Mrs Nell Smith for her longstanding and continuing work with the Society of St Vincent de Paul, to Mr Hugh Smith for his restoration work at the Pittsworth Historical Village, to Mrs Maureen Rushton for her extensive work with the local ambulance committee, to Mrs Maureen Hill for her ongoing work with the elderly and disabled of Pittsworth, to Mr Alan Phipps for his tireless work with sporting youth, to Mrs Patricia Montgomery for her 30-year involvement with the Girls Friendly Society, to Helen Arthy for her work with the Pittsworth and District Care Association, to Mrs Karen White for her work with the St Stephens Parish Council and P&amp;F, to Mrs Clare Neale for her longstanding work with local basketball, to Joan Muir for her work with the Yallambie retirement home and youth in the Millmerran District, and, finally, to Mr Alan May for his work with troubled youth and the environment.</para><para>Later that day, I had the opportunity to travel to Oakey where, again, the volunteers were recognised. I presented certificates of recognition to Mrs Betty Speed for her 15 years of service to the local CWA, to Mr David Coombes for his work with junior rugby league, to Mr Kevin O'Neill for his extensive and ongoing work with the Lions Club, to Mrs Fay Telford and Mr Bruce Weedon for their work with the Oakey Historical Museum, and to Mr Roy Grundy for his restoration work at the Jondaryan Woolshed. I had the opportunity to talk to Mr Grundy at length about the Jondaryan Woolshedâa particularly worthy undertaking which he had committed a considerable amount of his time and effort to, which should be recognised. I also presented certificates to Rosemaree Price for her work with the Westbrook Progress Association, to Mr Frankie Cleary for his longstanding involvement with the local branch of the Queensland Arts Council, to Davis Grundy for her dedicated service with the local SES, and to Mr Neil Hollindale for his work with junior cricket.</para><para>As I stated earlier, these award recipients are a good representation of all those volunteers who go largely unrecognised and unthanked by our communities. My only wish is that all those who volunteer their time, effort and skills to the betterment of our communities could also be publicly recognised. However, this would be an almost insurmountable task, given the large numbers of volunteers within our communities. We can only hope that the general recognition given to volunteers during the International Year of Volunteers goes some way to rewarding all those who do so much for our society. In closing, I would also like to thank Leeann King, the Labor candidate for Groom, who, on my behalf, did the vast amount of groundwork necessary to bring these presentations together. It was Leeann King's strong links to the communities of Pittsworth and Oakey that made these events a true success in recognising the volunteers of these close-knit communities.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>C.E.W.

Bean Foundation, which will not only celebrate our first official war correspondent and official war historian but recognise all those Australian war correspondents who have distinguished themselves in many conflicts. Their contribution constitutes some of the best of Australian journalism over the years. </para></talk.start><para>It is appropriate and welcome that the foundation that bears Bean's name encompasses not just war correspondents but also depicters and recorders of warâartists, camera operators and photographers as well as writers. This foundation will undertake commemorative activities and commission works to assist community understanding of the role of the war correspondent. I understand that in due course we will see books, exhibitions and documentaries produced with the support of the foundation.</para><para>As I have indicated, the foundation's objectives are meritorious and the potential scope of the Bean Foundation's activities is broad. Tonight I would like to talk about one example I mentioned briefly in my speech in the House of Representatives chamber in Old Parliament House last evening. I referred to Charles Bean's great friend Will Dyson. Dyson grew up in a Ballarat family of exceptional creative talent that befriended the even more exceptionally talented family of Lindsay artists and writersâNorman, Lionel, Percy, Daryl and Ruby. Ruby became Will Dyson's wife.</para><para>Dyson and Ruby ventured to London, where Dyson's powerful cartoons made him a sensational overnight success. By 1916, he was famous and had a contented family life with Ruby and their small daughter. Ruby was not only a talented artist herself but a woman of rare beauty and radiant personality. Theirs was obviously a marriage of mutual devotion. But in 1916 Dyson volunteered to leave all this behind and immerse himself in the horror, the squalor and the danger of the Western Front in order to provide an artistic record of what Australian soldiers were doing. </para><para>He took this step at the end of a period when the Australians had sustained 28,000 casualties in seven weeks in and around Fromelles and Pozieres. This was not August 1914, with its delusions of `Get in quick because it'll be all over by Christmas'. Two years later, there were no such illusions. Dyson knew what he was getting into. Yet he felt impelled to volunteer as a result of sincere, high-minded nationalistic feelings. As he put it when writing to offer his services, he wanted `to interpret in a series of drawings, for national preservation, the sentiments and special Australian characteristics of our Army'. </para><para>Dyson accomplished this with outstanding success. He spent two years at the Western Front as Australia's first ever official war artist. He perhaps remains Australia's finest ever official war artist. He was wounded twice. The Australian War Memorial ultimately received 270 Dyson drawings, and Bean envisaged a special Dyson gallery at the Australian War Memorial. Moreover, Dyson's published writing about the war was as brilliant as his drawings. </para><para>In 1919, Ruby died suddenly of Spanish flu. Dyson was never the same again after the combined impact of her death and those draining years on the Western Front. He died in London in 1938 and was buried with Ruby in a joint grave that embodied the connection between two of Australia's most significant creative families. However, this joint resting place of Will Dyson and Ruby Lindsay in London's Hendon Cemetery is and has long been an unmarked grave. The headstone that used to identify them was dismantled for safety reasons in 1969, when the cemetery authorities ruled that it was deteriorating so dangerously that it had to be removed altogether. It has never been replaced. </para><para>Those familiar with Dyson's career, especially what he did for Australia at the Western Front, are surprised and not a little dismayed to learn that he has ended up in an unmarked grave. Recent endeavours to rectify this unsatisfactory state of affairs have been disappointingly unsuccessful. Approaches have been made to the Prime Minister's office, the Australian War Memorial, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Office of Australian War Graves, the Australian High Commission in London and the Black and White Artists Associationâall to no avail at this stage, as I understand it. Here, surely, is a real opportunity for the Bean Foundation, with its aim of pursuing proper recognition of Australian recorders of war, to fill this lamentable vacuum by ensuring that an appropriate headstone is reinstated and that Bean's friend and talented colleague will no longer lie in an anonymous grave.</para><para>C.E.W. Bean brought fair-mindedness to his craft. As I said last night, no politician could ask any more of a journalist. His diaries show that he was aware of his preconceptions and sought to compensate for them. Although he used kinder euphemisms for the cruel truths of Australian retreats and self-inflicted wounds, he nonetheless included them in his <inline font-style="italic">The Official History of Australia in the War of 1914-18</inline>.</para><para>Perhaps most importantly, like every great journalist and historian, he was a great writer. He was conscious of his audience and he wrote in order to be read. He told neither only the worst nor only the best of what he saw and he demonstrated to generations of Australian war correspondents, indeed to journalists of all kinds, that the responsibilities of the press in a country with a free press can be met with diligence, conscientiousness and constant self-scrutiny.</para><para>It is a great thing in this year of the centenary of Australia's Federation that we are establishing a Bean Foundation to simultaneously honour courage under fire, creativity in the most trying circumstances, application to task and, above all, the critical importance of reporting the truth, however uncomfortable that truth might be to people in authority or the nation's preferred image of itself. I hope the foundation can do something to right this terrible wrong in relation to the last resting place of Will Dyson, who was such an outstanding war artist and such a fine Australian.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.17 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>26828</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>26828</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><quote><para>National Health and Medical Research Councilâ</para><para>Grants for 2001.</para><para>Report for 2000.</para><para>Queensland Fisheries Joint AuthorityâReport for 1999-2000.</para><para>Western Australian Fisheries Joint AuthorityâReport for 1998-99.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>26828</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Airports ActâRegulationsâStatutory Rules 2001 No. 222.</para><para>Civil Aviation ActâCivil Aviation RegulationsâCivil Aviation OrdersâDirectivesâPartâ</para><para>105, dated 26 July;

The Government and the Senate also recognise that where a matter is sub judice, that is before a court, it may be inappropriate to produce relevant documents and answer relevant questions.  It would be open to the Government to argue before the Committee that its inquiry should be delayed until after the coronial inquiry, or that it should not ask for production of the documents, or that the documents should be taken as evidence in private.  </para><para>(3)	Q	Would the production of documents presently in the possession of AMSA to the Senate Committee have the effect of limiting the ability to produce those documents subsequently in a court or tribunal?</para><para>A	No, provided copies of the documents were produced to the Committee, the originals or other copies could be provided to the Coroner.</para><para>(4)	Q	Would that same production have the effect of prejudicing in any way the use or value of those documents or of the information in those documents in subsequent court or tribunal proceedings?</para><para>A	The production of a copy of the documents to the Committee would not prevent production of the originals or another copy of the documents to subsequent court or tribunal proceedings.  But, as the sub judice convention recognises, production to the Committee, and in particular publication, may inappropriately influence subsequent court or tribunal proceedings, in particular jurors, magistrates, witnesses or other parties.  It would be open to the Government to argue before the Committee that its inquiry should be delayed until after the coronial inquiry, or that it not ask for production of the documents at this time, or that the documents should be taken as evidence in camera, so as to prevent any inappropriate influence  </para><para>(5)	Q	Would your advice on the preceding two questions differ if the relevant Senate Committee proceedings were held in camera?</para><para>A	The risk that the coronial inquiry would be interfered with would be significantly reduced if the proceedings were held in private.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Powers</inline></para><para>3.	The Committee clearly has power to require persons to attend before it and to order the production of information and documents to it, by virtue of Senate Standing Order 25(15).  A failure to comply with a Committee's order can amount to an offence within the meaning of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, and can be punishable by the Senate, as opposed to the Committee, by fine or imprisonment.</para><para>4.	Although a Legislation Committee has the power to require persons to attend or to produce documents, it will usually proceed by way of request to witnesses to attend or produce documents. </para><para>5.	There is no legal requirement to comply with a request from the Committee.  However, it is usual to comply with a request in the absence of some claim by the Government that the information should not be disclosed.</para><para>6.	A Legislation Committee sitting in estimates does not have power to receive documentary or other evidence in private.  Senate Standing Order 26(2) provides that evidence of the estimates is heard 'in public session'. References Committees and Legislation Committees exercising non-estimates functions can take evidence in private.</para><para>7.	The Senate has not sought to enforce against officials demands for evidence or documents against a ministerial refusal to provide them on the grounds of public interest immunity. The Senate has also recognised that officials can refuse to answer questions pending an opportunity for a minister to make a claim of public interest immunity.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Public interest immunity</inline></para><para>8.	The procedure for making a claim of public interest immunity, and the kinds of information and documents which may be the subject of such a claim, are discussed in the Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters (last issued in November 1989). Generally, the kinds of information which could form the basis of a public interest immunity claim include documents or information obtained in confidence from other governments, material disclosing any deliberation or decision of the Cabinet or of the Executive Council, and material disclosing advice or recommendations given in the deliberative processes of government where disclosure would be contrary to the public interest.</para><para>9.	The Guidelines provide in part, and relevantly to this case:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Scope of public interest immunity</inline></para><para>2.32	Documents - or oral evidence - which could form the basis of a claim of public interest immunity may include matters falling into the following categories that coincide with some exemption provisions of the FOI Act: </para><para> (e)		material relating to law enforcement or protection of public safety which would, or could reasonably be expected to:</para><para>(i)	prejudice the investigation of a possible breach of the law or the enforcement of the law in a particular instance;</para><para>(iv)	prejudice the fair trial of a person or the impartial adjudication of a particular case;</para><para>(vi)	prejudice the maintenance or enforcement of lawful methods for the protection of public safety; and</para><para>2.33	In addition the following considerations may affect a decision whether to make documents or information available:</para><para>(b)		court orders or sub judice issues:  where the provision of information would appear to be restricted by a court order, or where the question of possible prejudice to court proceedings could arise, the Attorney-General's Department should be consulted although decisions on the application of the sub judice rule are for the committee to determine, not witnesses.</para><para>10.	It would be necessary for there to be an examination of the particular material for the purposes of determining whether any or all of it could be the subject of a public interest immunity claim.  But we note that these parts of paragraph (e) may be relevant to the documents in question.  But in the absence of such relevance, it is unlikely that it could be said that the documents fall within the accepted categories of public interest immunity.  As paragraph 2.33(b) notes, it is also necessary to consider whether production of the documents may be subject to the sub judice convention.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sub judice </inline></para><para>11.	As a general rule, the House and the Senate (and a committee) will not engage in discussion of a matter where to do so could involve a substantial danger of prejudice to proceedings before a court, unless it considers that there is an overriding requirement to do so as a matter of public interest. This self-imposed restriction is called 'the sub judice convention'. </para><para>12.	According to the House of Representatives Practice (3rd edition, 1997, pages 481-485) the convention is that, subject to the right of the House to legislate on any matter, matters awaiting adjudication in a court should not be brought forward in debate, motions or questions.  This is particularly so where a person will be subject to prejudice in those proceedings.  The consideration of what amounts to prejudice by the Select Committee on the Procedure of the House of Commons puts the view that it covers the possible effect on members of the court, the jury, the witnesses and the parties to any action (quoted in House of Representatives Practice at page 483).  Such prejudice will be particularly acute in criminal proceedings, but as the discussion in the House of Representatives Practice indicates (at page 484), it will also arise in relation to civil proceedings, and indeed royal commissions.   </para><para>Where the proceedings are concerned with issues of fact or findings relating to the propriety of the actions of <inline font-weight="bold">specific persons</inline> the House should be restrained in its references. </para><para>13.	According to Odgers' Australian Senate Practice (9th edition, 1999, pages 219-225) the rationale for the sub judice principle is that a parliamentary debate on a matter before a court could influence the court and cause it to make a decision other than on the evidence and submissions before it.  Such a danger could arise from a canvassing of the issues before the court or a pre-judgment of those issues. The danger of prejudice to court proceedings is much greater where a jury is involved in the proceedings, because judges are unlikely to be influenced in the formation of their judgments by public or parliamentary debate.  But it is recognised that the danger may exist in other cases.</para><para>14.	In response to an order for production of documents by the Senate relating to the waterfront dispute in 1998, the Government refused to produce the documents on the ground that the documents were relevant to actions pending in the Federal Court between the parties to the dispute (Senate Hansard, 28 May 1998, pages 3378 - 3380). </para><para>15.	However, advice by the Clerk of the Senate suggested that this apparent invocation of the sub judice convention was not well founded (Senate Economics Legislation Committee Hansard, 2 June 1998, pages E124-8).  The Clerk of the Senate provided an opinion dated 1 June 1998 in relation to the statement in the Senate by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts in relation to the operation of the sub judice convention in that case.  In that advice the Clerk seemed to suggest that the convention did not operate as broadly as had been previously thought.  He suggested that it could not operate in relation to civil proceedings; previously it had been accepted that whilst the convention operated most strongly in relation to criminal proceedings, it could operate in relation to civil proceedings.  He suggested that the convention operated less strongly where there had been significant publicity in relation to a matter; previously this had not been seen as a central issue, indeed it was in matters of high controversy and publicity that the convention was most relevant.  </para><para>16.	Generally, in our view, it is appropriate for the Government to argue that the convention should be maintained in relation to civil proceedings where it is possible that the parliamentary process could influence or interfere with those civil proceedings, in particular where the proceedings are concerned with issues of fact or findings relating to the propriety of the actions of specific persons.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Coronial inquiry</inline></para><para>17.	The nature of the coronial inquiry is therefore relevant.  The Coroner is part of the Tasmanian Magistrates Court.  In this technical sense the Coroner is a court.  Further, traditionally, coronial functions are exercised by courts.  However, the Coroner does not determine civil or criminal liability.  Rather the inquiry is investigative in nature.  But a coronial inquiry can have significant consequences.  Section 28 of the Tasmanian Coroners Act 1995 states:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Findings, &amp;c., of coroner investigating a death </inline></para><para>28.  (1) 	A coroner investigating a death must find, if possible -</para><para>(a) 	the identity of the deceased; and</para><para>(b) 	how death occurred; and</para><para>(c) 	the cause of death; and</para><para>(d) 	when and where death occurred; and</para><para>(e) 	the particulars needed to register the death under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1999; and</para><para>(f) 	the identity of any person who contributed to the cause of death.</para><para>(3) 	A coroner may comment on any matter connected with the death including public health or safety or the administration of justice.</para><para>(4) 	A coroner must not include in a finding or comment any statement that a person is or may be guilty of an offence.</para><para>Thus whilst the Coroner cannot make a finding of guilt, nor a finding that a person may be guilty of an offence, the Coroner may make a finding that a person, or group of persons, contributed to the cause of death.  In our view the coronial proceedings will therefore be concerned with issues of fact or findings relating to the propriety of the actions of specific persons.</para><para>17.	If there was concern that the production of material to the Committee may affect the Coroner, or witnesses to the coronial inquiry, or parties to that inquiry, it would be open to argue before the Committee that its inquiry should be delayed until after the coronial inquiry, or that it not ask for production of the documents.  Whilst such an argument would be outside the recent formulations of the Clerk of the Senate of the sub judice convention, it would be within other traditional formulations of the convention.  The decision of the Chair of the Senate Committee would be based on balancing the apprehended prejudice to the coronial proceedings against public interest in the matter and the freedom of the Senate to inquire into matters of public interest.</para><para>18.	The Committee may also hear and take evidence in private.  If there was concern about the production of material to the Committee in public, the Committee could be asked to take the evidence in private.  The Committee is able to do so.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Use of material presented to the Committee before the Coroner</inline></para><para>19.	You have asked whether the production of documents to the Committee would have the effect of prejudicing the use or value of those documents, or of the information in those documents, in subsequent court or tribunal proceedings.  This question arises from an advice which suggests that production of documents to the Committee would mean that those documents are not available to the Coroner.  If this was the case, there would be very significant potential for production to the Committee to interfere with the coronial inquiry.  But in our view it is clear that the production of copies of existing documents to the Committee would not prevent the production of the original documents, or other copies, to the Coroner.</para><para>20.	Section 16(3) and (4) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act are particularly relevant for present purposes and provide as follows:</para><para>(3) 	In proceedings in any court or tribunal, it is not lawful for evidence to be tendered or received, questions asked or statements, submissions or comments made, concerning proceedings in Parliament, by way of, or for the purpose of: </para><para>(a) 	questioning or relying on the truth, motive, intention or good faith of anything forming part of those proceedings in Parliament; </para><para>(b) 	otherwise questioning or establishing the credibility, motive, intention or good faith of any person; or </para><para>(c)	 drawing, or inviting the drawing of, inferences or conclusions wholly or partly from anything forming part of those proceedings in Parliament. </para><para>(4) 	A court or tribunal shall not: </para><para>(a) 	require to be produced, or admit into evidence, a document that has been prepared for the purpose of submission, and submitted, to a House or a committee and has been directed by a House or a committee to be treated as evidence taken in camera, or admit evidence relating to such a document; or </para><para>(b) 	admit evidence concerning any oral evidence taken by a House or a committee in camera or require to be produced or admit into evidence a document recording or reporting any such oral evidence, unless a House or a committee has published, or authorised the publication of, that document or a report of that oral evidence. </para><para>The production of documents to the Committee will be proceedings in Parliament.  The Coroner is at least a tribunal.</para><para>21.	Section 16(3) thus sets out the prohibitions on the use of parliamentary proceedings. The Explanatory Memorandum to the Parliamentary Privileges Bill  provided a further exposition of s.16(3)(b)-(c) as follows:</para><para>(b) attacking the credibility, motives, etc of a person on the basis of proceedings in Parliament </para><para>This would prevent, for example, a member's speech in debate or a parliamentary witness's evidence being used to establish their motives or intention for the purpose of supporting a criminal or civil action against them, or against another person. Thus a member's statements outside Parliament cannot be shown to be motivated by malice by reference to alleged malice in the member's statements in Parliament. </para><para>(c) drawing inferences or conclusions to support a criminal or civil action </para><para>This would prevent, for example, a jury being invited to infer matters from speeches in debate by members of Parliament or from evidence of parliamentary witnesses in the course of a criminal or civil action against them or another person. Thus a member's speech in Parliament cannot be used to support an inference that the member's conduct outside Parliament was part of some illegal activity. This would not prevent the proving of a material fact by reference to a record of proceedings in Parliament which establishes that fact, eg, the tendering of the Journals of the Senate to prove that a Senator was present in the Senate on a particular day.</para><para>22.	In relation to a submission prepared for the Committee, where this has been directed to be treated as evidence taken in camera, s.16(4)(a) would prevent this being produced in other proceedings, including to the Coroner.  However the documents in question would not fall in this class.</para><para>23.	Further, s.16(4) will prevent asking questions about the production of documents to the Committee.  If a witness before the Committee produced documents to it, that witness could not be questioned before the Coroner in relation to that production.  The prime example, in relation to answers to questions, is that if a witness answers questions before the Coroner, that witness could not be cross-examined in relation to any different answers they may have given before the Committee.  </para><para>24.	In relation to documents already in existence and provided to the Committee, if the originals are produced, and no copies kept, then physically the documents could not be produced in another place, including to the Coroner.  </para><para>25.	But generally the Committee takes copies of documents, leaving the originals and other copies with the department or agency.  There is nothing in the specific terms of s.16(3) or (4) which prevents these originals, or other copies, being produced to the Coroner and admitted into evidence before the Coroner.  There is nothing in the explanatory memorandum which supports the view that the Act prevents production of such documents to a court or tribunal, including the Coroner.  There is nothing in the case law on parliamentary privilege, and its development in s.16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, which supports the view that the privilege or the Act prevents production of such documents to a court or tribunal, including the Coroner: see R v Murphy (1986) 64 ALR 498); Prebble v Television New Zealand Ltd [1995] 1 AC 321; Laurence v Katter (1996) 14 ALR 447; Rann v Olsen (2000) 172 ALR 395; Amann Aviation Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1988) 81 ALR 710; New South Wales Branch of the Australian Medical Association v Minister for Health and Community Services (1992) 26 NSWLR 114.  There is nothing in Odgers' Australian Senate Practice or the House of Representatives Practice which supports this view.  There would be very significant public policy arguments against this view; if disclosure of pre-existing documents to a Committee prevented disclosure to a court or tribunal, this would in effect subvert any civil or criminal proceeding, and thereby in effect remove liability for any relevant actions.  </para><para>26.	We note that the decision in O'Chee v Rowley (1997) 150 ALR 199 that privilege could be claimed in relation to documents in the hands of a member of Parliament, which had been used by the member in the course of parliamentary business, and which were sought in a discovery process by a plaintiff in proceedings against the member for defamation in relation to statements made outside the Parliament.  It may be that if copies of the documents were provided to the Committee, and the Coroner sought to require production of the documents by the Committee, that issues of parliamentary privilege will arise.  But this would not affect documents in the hands of others.</para><para>27.	Rather, this material all supports the view that if a witness before the Committee gives evidence about a prior event, say the `x event', that witness cannot be questioned in proceedings before the Coroner about the giving of the evidence about the x event to the Committee.  Therefore, as noted above, a witness who answers questions before the Coroner in relation to the x event, cannot be cross-examined on the basis of different answers they may have given to the Committee in relation to x event.  But it has never been suggested that the witness cannot be asked questions before the Coroner in relation to the x event.  </para><para>28.	So it is in relation to production of documents.  If a witness before the Committee gives a copy of a pre-existing document in relation to the x event to the Committee, that witness cannot be questioned in proceedings before the Coroner about the giving of the document to the Committee.  But they can clearly give the original document, or another copy, to the Coroner, and be asked questions about that document.</para><para>29.
