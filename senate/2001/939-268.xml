Isn't it true that these departments warned the government against the centralised control model of IT outsourcing and disputed the government's claims of $1 billion in cost savings?

Although various efforts were made to encourage agencies to outsource their IT infrastructure very few outsourced ...</para></quote><para>In other words, while the Labor Party was in government, while Senator Lundy's colleagues were in government, they adopted a policy of outsourcing but the fact of the matter is that very few agencies in fact outsourced. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>...very few arrangements had been put in place up to the commencement of the Initiative. While there are differing views as to why there was little acceptance of IT outsourcing during the first half of the nineties—</para></quote><para>that is during the Labor term of office—</para><quote><para>it is widely accepted that agencies' inertia and resistance to change contributed significantly to the delays.</para></quote><para>That provides the background for the initiative that the government took. There was a Labor Party policy and yes, from time to time there are Labor Party policies. This policy was in fact failing to deliver and so the government, as Senator Lundy mentioned, announced that it would put into effect new arrangements. Since the original initiative there has been a review and the government is responding to that review. From what Senator Lundy said in relation to savings—that was one of the issues that Senator Lundy raised—one would have thought that in fact there were no savings at all from the outsourcing initiative. That is not true. It is an irrefutable fact that the IT outsourcing contracts let to date have delivered significant savings, Senator Lundy, to Australian taxpayers—by any measure. This was of course referred to in the Humphry review, which noted:</para><quote><para>There is broad agreement that ... the Initiative has delivered significant savings ...</para></quote><para>That is what the review found, Senator Lundy. This fact was also confirmed in a recent Senate estimates hearings by the Auditor-General, who stated that on the face of ANAO's arithmetic, there have still been significant savings from IT outsourcing.</para><para>So the proposition that Senator Lundy puts to the Senate—that there were no savings from IT outsourcing—is in fact quite baseless. I am sorry, Senator Lundy. You do not appear to me to have read the Humphry report with the detail that one would have expected from you. The fact of the matter is that the government has projected, on the basis of methodologies determined in accordance with expert advice and following consultation with agencies—including, I might say, the Department of Finance and Administration and Treasury—that IT outsourcing contracts let to date should save taxpayers around $365 million over five years.

I then mentioned that there was a review and that the Humphry review confirmed that there were savings from IT outsourcing. The Humphry review also proposed certain changes. The government looks very closely at constructive suggestions, Senator Lundy, unlike the pathetic attempt at political point scoring that we often receive from you.

At its core, this plan is about investing in Australian ideas and their commercialisation and turning those ideas into Australian jobs. It very much builds on our reforms in industrial relations and taxation, because what we are about is a stronger, more competitive Australian economy. It also builds on our very strong support for science and innovation already, including the establishment of Biotechnology Australia and the fact that we doubled funding for health and medical research with an additional $600 million. In this financial year, before this spending kicks in, we are spending a record $4.5 billion on science and innovation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The key initiatives in the plan released last week were the doubling of funding for the Australian Research Council grants, boosting the very good CRC program by 80 per cent, at a cost of $227 million, and a range of incentives for additional business research and development. We have a new 175 per cent tax concession rate for additional R&amp;D, a cash rebate for small business and, of course, we are continuing the very successful R&amp;D Start Program, which provides grants for R&amp;D to small and medium sized enterprises. One of our most successful new programs, the COMET program, which assists companies to commercialise their skills and ideas, is being doubled. We are establishing world-class centres of excellence in biotechnology and, very importantly, in information and communications technology, which Senator Alston has pushed very strongly, to support these key emerging technologies and, of course, there is a very substantial increase in funding for university infrastructure to boost their science research. </para><para>As you would expect, this package has been very warmly welcomed by the science community. The chief executive of the CSIRO has described the plan as `good for science, good for business, and definitely good for Australia'. The chair of the Australian Research Council, Vicki Sara, said that it `thrusts Australia forward in the global innovation race' and is `quite superb'. The Australian Industry Group said that it `comprehensively addressed the key elements needed to strengthen Australia's innovation system'. The Business Council applauded it as a `major step forward which is very closely targeted'. The chair of the Cooperative Research Centre Association has said that it `exceeded all expectations'.</para><para>As Senator Hill said, this investment—the biggest ever—is possible only because we got rid of Labor's deficits and we have got the government's budget back into surplus. That means that we can make these investments which could not be made previously. What is the alternative to our plan? We have a policy-lazy opposition. All it has had is some slogan, and it runs around mantra-ing that slogan. It has now released last week, which did not last more than five minutes, a half-baked policy for an online university, which has sunk without a trace and been panned by most commentators.

The short answer is: I have not heard of reports of Mr Tuckey suggesting that money for restructuring of the timber industry in Western Australia would be withdrawn if the coalition lost government.

In fact, there are reports that up to 5,000 may have been killed and perhaps up to 400,000 displaced. Australia obviously regrets the personal injury, loss of life and destruction of property that have occurred. We have frequently made our concerns known to the Indonesian authorities at the highest level. Most recently, an embassy team visited the provinces in November and met senior government officials as well as church leaders and NGO representatives. These representations urged restraint by security forces and protection for human rights of all residents in the province. Australia has committed substantial humanitarian relief of over $6.4 million over a period of about the past 18 months, mostly for food and medical aid, and we stand by to offer more as the situation stabilises. We are appalled by the many claims of violations of fundamental human rights that we are hearing in relation to the circumstances of Maluku, including that relating to abuse of religious freedom.</para></talk.start><para>Apart from our representations—and Senator Harradine asks whether we know of any actions that might be occurring that could give a hope of leading to stability and the reduction of these abuses—all I can advise Senator Harradine is that I understand that the governor of Maluku is planning a conference for March to bring leaders of each side together. A presidential working group on Maluku was to have met, and I presume it did, on 1 February to identify the issues which are perpetuating the conflict, with a view to identifying solutions. Many visits of course have been made, including three from the Indonesian vice-president to the province, again looking for ways to bring about stability and a reduction in the violence that is occurring. So yes, we have heard these awful allegations. We regret what is occurring. We are seeking to do what is within our capacity to influence an end to these abuses.

But it is particularly important, I think, to note that it is a very comprehensive package designed to ensure that Australia is very well placed on the world scale. What we have done here is to boost not only basic scientific research but also applied areas, particularly areas which lend themselves to commercialisation and areas that are particularly at the leading edge, like information and communications technology. The doubling of the ARC grants, for example, has already funded special research centres like the quantum computing laboratory, and the funding for cooperative research centres has led to the hugely successful photonics CRC.</para></talk.start><para>What we are really seeing now is a quantum leap beyond those very successful programs to establishing a world leading ICT research centre of expertise which will provide a globally recognised capacity, will attract the best and brightest from around the world, will ensure that many leading Australian researchers stay in this country and will provide the opportunity for clustering and networking on the part of major Australian IT and multinational companies. It is particularly important that that ICT centre of excellence is one that will be able to accommodate the various activities that are already occurring around Australia. For the government to be putting $129 million into that ICT centre of excellence, combined with $45 million into a biotech centre of excellence, shows that we are very serious indeed. Of course we drew very extensively on the report of the Chief Scientist, who said that centres of excellence are extremely expensive and highly specialised laboratories which provide leading edge research capabilities. He said that they have very significant cost and are of a specialised nature. In other words, he spelt out very clearly what a centre of excellence is all about.</para><para>Those who paid attention to what Mr Beazley said at the Press Club a few weeks back probably could not believe their ears, because what he did was to get out there and say that every school in Australia was going to be a centre of excellence. He was not game to go on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report </inline>to explain himself, so he sent along Dr Lawrence, who of course has no idea about these issues. She basically tried to hold the line, saying that Labor's online university could be funded and promising 100,000 places within 10 years, but all subject to budgetary considerations and not taking account of the fact that places like Charles Sturt University and the University of Southern Queensland, having gone down this track in recent years very successfully indeed, have expressed very real concerns about the Labor proposal. In fact, they have been highly critical of it. The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Southern Queensland said:</para><quote><para>USQ and other universities like us possess a great investment already in online education. One would like to think there would not be the need to create a separate institution.</para></quote><para> Of course this is one of the universities that Mr Beazley pointed to. So that is a classic own goal.</para><para>What is extraordinary of course is that Mr Beazley uses these rhetorical flourishes to try to cover up for the fact that Knowledge Nation is still a two-word policy. They are not interested in serious initiatives; they are not trying to address Australia's leading edge research capability; they are simply interested in putting a few words on the table and hoping that they can surf into government by being a policy-lazy opposition. This has to be the high watermark of it: to confuse centres of excellence—leading edge research institutions—with saying every school in Australia is going to be one just reduces words to meaningless concepts and makes it plain that they have no idea, no commitment and no interest in policy formulation; they are simply interested in trying to scrape through.

Let me say as a preliminary point that the appointment of Shaw Pittman has been discussed ad nauseam in this chamber. Perhaps we can try, once more for the record, some of the matters which were touched on in the question. </para></talk.start><para>Shaw Pittman was engaged by the former Office of Government Information Technology in 1996. The appointment was made by the former Chief Government Information Officer, who was himself appointed by the former Labor government. Do you understand that? He was appointed by the former Labor government. OASITO, who assumed responsibility for IT outsourcing after OGIT, conducted a full competitive process for the consultancy in 1998. The advice I have is that the competitive selection process, which involved consultancy firms from Australia and around the world, identified Shaw Pittman as the best firm for the job. Seventeen firms were invited to tender; 10 sought the role and seven were interviewed. The selection committee—which included two senior businessmen from the commercial sector—approved the selection of Shaw Pittman as representing the best value for money for the Commonwealth. The panel explicitly considered the fee levels required by this firm, concluding that they still represented the best value for money. The private sector members, I am advised, remarked that it would be imprudent to forgo the best available advisers on a program of this scale, value and importance merely to reduce the input costs, which are small relative to the project's benefits.</para><para>The fees paid to Shaw Pittman, however, were significant. The scale and importance of initiative required that OASITO sought the highest quality advice from experienced advisers in the field. The worldwide demand for these skills is considerable. Market rates for quality IT outsourcing are, consequently, higher than in some other industries. It was critical that high quality advice was procured to achieve the government's objectives of improved service, cost savings, employment, industry development and investment. Undoubtedly, we will be going over all these issues at great length in Senate estimates. We have been through many of these questions before; I dare say that we will go through these questions again.

Its purpose is to advise the government and the Treasurer on the performance of states in relation to various criteria. The overall objective, of course, is to encourage competition and therefore bring down costs and contribute to a stronger economy overall to the betterment of all Australians. That is the purpose and role of the NCC. Then it is up to the government to take that advice into account in making its final decision.

Certainly the role of the NCC, under the COAG agreement, is providing a significant influence towards the adoption of better policies in that regard.

But the best they can do in this chamber today is stand up and provide an inordinate amount of waffle. I believe there is a concerted effort on behalf of the government to now try to cover up what is an obvious debacle and a blatant misuse and waste of taxpayers' money.</para><para>As many of those who are interested in IT outsourcing would know, there have been tens of millions of dollars wasted as a result of bad advice being provided to consultants with the implementation of this program. Indeed, we find that the departments and agencies which have become victim to it are suffering a terrible bottom line situation as they move to backfill the gap left by the money that has been wasted and spent on the IT outsourcing program. If the government think that tactics of obstruction, of trying to prevent documents coming to light and of standing here and providing no answers to specific questions asked by the opposition are the best ways to handle a government response to an obvious debacle, they are sadly mistaken.</para><para>Credibility is very important to any government, and what we have seen today is an absolute lack of it. There was a very important opportunity for the government to take up the issue of IT outsourcing and to explain to the Senate and to the public exactly what they are going to do. We know now that they are choosing not to clear the air and not to try and solve the problems. They are choosing instead to cover up the damage that they have done, to find a way to obfuscate questions and to avoid providing the answers in this place. There is overwhelming evidence of incompetence for which the minister has ultimate responsibility. These are not just the observations of an opposition consistently criticising a government for bad policy; there are now two reports—one provided independently by Richard Humphry and one provided by the Australian National Audit Office—which clearly expose the government's mismanage-ment.</para><para>The government's response to both of these reports is incredibly telling. The evidence of a cover-up lies in the government's response to the Audit Office report, where the government actively prevented individual agencies—all of whom were critical of this program in the first instance—from responding individually to the issues raised in the Audit Office report. Instead, the department of finance decided to respond with a whole-of-government response and, as such, very little detail was provided as to how those agencies and departments were actually struggling with the policy. That was not good enough, and the government succumbed to further pressure and initiated its own inquiry, the Humphry report. It is the government's response to that which shows that this cover-up has turned into a dramatic exercise in damage control.</para><para>The government's very hasty acceptance of all of the Humphry report recommendations demonstrates that they are in trouble, beyond their ability to cope. Specific examples of the sensitivities of this IT debacle can be found in two areas, which I would like to mention today. They include the issue of cost savings. First of all, the Audit Office exposed the attempt by the department of finance to fudge the costing methodology and the prediction of savings. Once that was exposed, the Auditor-General's office identified a formulation which was more accurate in estimating the savings. But what has not been said in this place is that those savings are indeed not bottom line savings; they are savings in relation to the costs of IT at the time of signing the contract. Just about every agency and department has required IT outsourcing products and services beyond that original scope. Therefore, there are no bottom line savings.</para><para>Finally, there is the use of consultants. We had an answer to a question without notice today that said there was a competitive tender. There was not a competitive tender back in 1996: that original contract was awarded without any tender and without any competitive process—and with what we presume to be the full knowledge of the minister at the time, Minister Fahey.

True, this is the prerogative of the ALP, their right, but we have to look at the big picture.

We are in a time of incredibly rapid change in information technology, and government had to move very quickly in its approach to capture the benefits for Australian industry of this new IT revolution and to deliver these to the government processes. In setting up OASITO, we took an approach which I am sure, if Australia had had the disaster befall them of the Keating government carrying on after 1996, is exactly the approach they would have taken. What is different in the approach we have taken is that we have very quickly instituted a comprehensive review of those processes and we have very quickly acted on the findings of that review. Can you just imagine, if Labor had been involved, what approach they would have taken? It certainly would not have been as upfront, straightforward and corrective as the approach we have taken. Now, as we move to the next stage of evolution of this approach, we are putting it back on certain agencies to operate their own outsourcing initiative. But the key point is: outsourcing continues. The central principle is still applied to the Australian government processes; and all those benefits I have mentioned to export, to local industry, to jobs, to regional Australia, still apply, and probably even more so under this new approach.</para><para>Senator Lundy in her comments said that the change had placed the agencies in a terrible position. Well, this is just a lot of hot air. Senator Lundy is talking off the top of her head. I am a member of one of those agencies—I am on the council of the National Library. Last Friday this matter of outsourcing came before the council. We were informed of the Humphry report findings and of the change in position. Did we find ourselves in a terrible position? Not at all. We said, `All right, we will just proceed down the new path. On to the next item of business.' It was not a great trauma for the agency at all. We have the opportunity now to move on and to really gain the great benefits of outsourcing for government.</para><para>What is Labor's policy on this? I kept challenging Senator Lundy through the whole of her contribution: what is your policy? We do not know, do we? What we have opposite here is a policy lazy opposition. They would have done, in fact, precisely what the government has done. They would have continued outsourcing, they probably would have done it through a body like OASITO, then they would have reviewed it and then they would have moved to a more decentralised approach. They would have done exactly what this government is doing: they would have gained some savings from the process and, moving on to a more decentralised approach, gained much greater savings. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>21318</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is interesting, isn't it, how when we get one-liners rolling off the tongues of leading members of the government we get the rest of the stooges standing up with the cue cards repeating them ad nauseam.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

We get backbench members of the government standing up with the cue cards repeating the one-liners ad nauseam. It is interesting that Senator Tierney should get up and refer to ALP policy. Perhaps it is another example of the coalition simply looking at the ALP policy booklet as inspiration for their policy agenda. They have done it on innovation, they have done it on a range of other policy areas and they will continue to do it. That is why they are so desperate to see what is going to be in our policy agenda for the next election, because they might actually pick up an idea for their own. Let me assure Senator Tierney there is no comparison with the way in which the ALP will treat the issue of outsourcing of the government's IT requirements in the same way that this government has.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The reality is that what has emerged out of the Auditor-General's report and the Humphry report is that the way in which this government has handled IT outsourcing has been an absolute fiasco. There has been the statement made that the initiative has delivered significant savings. However, what people on the other side of the chamber did not go on to say is that there is a significant dispute about the level of those savings and where those savings have come from. Many of the savings purported to have been made under this government's IT outsourcing policy have been savings that have been taken out of departments and agencies in the outline years of the budget in anticipation of savings that would be made on IT—not in relation to real savings that have been made but in anticipation of savings that were suspected to be made out of the IT outsourcing agenda. Many of those agencies have been under significant pressure to meet their commitments in delivery of the government's program and servicing the general public, because they have already had the resources taken out of their budgets that otherwise would have been made available to them, in anticipation of savings down the road as a result of this IT outsourcing agenda. That is an issue you do not hear anyone on the other side attempting to beat up.</para><para>It is true that we should have a significant expectation in our community that the amount of resources the federal government, as a purchaser, expends on IT equipment, services and so forth should be a significant driver of IT industry development in this country. But what did the Humphry report say? It said the clustering of contracts limited access to the government's IT market. In other words, the way in which OASITO put together the contracting of IT outsourcing was in fact an inhibitor upon local industry being able to access IT contracts and being able to get the benefit of it. If there is a significant tragedy in terms of industry development in this country it is in the IT sector. It is well known by participants in the IT sector that they have not had the sort of access to government contracts that could have been available to them and could have been used as a platform to build a viable and significant IT sector in the Australian economy. In fact, the Auditor-General said that they did not come across, in any of the agencies that were examined, where there were specific monitoring mechanisms in place to monitor industry development outcomes as a result of IT outsourcing. And it is significant today that Senator Kemp has suddenly said that we are now going to get the Secretary of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Public Service Commissioner to start to monitor industry development initiatives out of outsourcing. A long way behind the game, Senator Kemp. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Competition Council: Report</title><page.no>21319</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>21319</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Murray today relating to federal grants payments for Western Australia.</para></motion><para>Competition policy in Australia has two strands. The first strand relates to the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission, which was set up and is governed by the Trade Practices Act. The second strand refers to the National Competition Council and the agreements established between Australian governments in the last decade of the last century. I phrase it in that way to remind Senator Hill and others that it is our view that those policies are now based on outdated economic views and need adjustment.</para><para>The Democrats are strongly in support of good competition policy through the Trade Practices Act. In fact, we have recommended even stricter or stronger reforms of market measures than the government is suggesting in its own legislation that is due to come forward. We will support that legislation but attempt to improve it. We also are supporters of the introduction of anti-trust laws.</para><para>When I refer to competition policy in a critical manner, I refer to national competition policy as established through the NCC. In our view, what we have to do is separate out opinion from this linkage with automatic punishment. That is our great concern. It is not that the government is getting advice—although, frankly, we do not see why the NCC should be duplicating or substituting for the Productivity Commission, which is perfectly competent to deal with these issues on a national basis. We are concerned that the National Competition Council is coming to a view on matters and then recommending to the government that $3.8 billion in states grants be withheld as a result of its recommendations. We say to the government: there is a backlash out there which is reflected in millions of Australians being concerned at the consequences of a narrowly defined economic policy that is dedicated to a least cost approach and does not factor in a countable social and environmental balance and the intangibles which should lead to full economic pricing.</para><para>There is that reaction not only from millions of Australians, which should concern the government, but also the Senate inquiry, which was very detailed and very critical on this matter. Recently we had the dairy deregulation outcome, where we saw strong condemnation of the very costly consequences of this kind of policy. We have premiers such as Mr Court and Mr Beattie who have specifically rejected the direction the NCC is taking, based on widespread consultation in their own states. I give as one example Mr Court's views on retail trading hours, which are directly contrary to the views of the NCC and which the NCC is trying to override. The Western Australian government has had full consultation and many inquiries on the matter. I give as another example the comments from the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> today he is reported as saying:</para><quote><para>... Mr Samuel had overstepped the mark in his pursuit of a radical deregulation agenda.</para><para>“This time the National Competition Council president has targeted the taxi industry for open competition, putting thousands of Queensland small businesses at risk,” Mr Beattie said.</para><para>“The Queensland Government has already reviewed the taxi industry, and rejected deregulation ...”</para></quote><para>The point is that the existing policy seeks to override the states, when they have come to a reasonable view based on consideration of all community views, on matters such as pharmacies, taxis, water, agricultural marketing, retail trading hours, railways and liquor licensing. It does not matter if the National Competition Council is going to be retained as an advisory body if that is all it does, but in fact it is turning out to be a quasi-regulator and is almost forcing the government to take a view on states grants which will result in disadvantage to the states. Our view is that it is driven by ideology and its policies are outdated. The NCC should be abolished and you should rely solely on the Productivity Commission when you want these matters to be examined. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAXATION</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>21320</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Return to Order</title><page.no>21320</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>21320</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leaveI wish to respond to an order made by the Senate on 4 October last following a notice of motion moved by Senator Cook that, as Minister representing the Treasurer, I table certain documents within 19 sitting days. On 1 December I made a short statement in relation to this order and I indicated that we were working through the documents to see what the government might be able to make available. I mentioned at that time that Senator Murray had written to me on the day that the Senate made the order. He advised that the Democrats supported the motion but believed that no information should be released which affects the strategic pursuit of tax avoidance and tax minimisation, which names individual taxpayers or which would impede or harm the recovery of substantial tax amounts that are due.</para></talk.start><para>The documents in question are internal management and operational working documents of the Australian Taxation Office. It is therefore not possible for me to comply with the Senate request for a number of reasons. The documents are part of the strategic, administration and corporate assurance processes within the ATO and they contribute to internal review and discussion. Governments have never made such working documents public. In the government's view, disclosure of these documents would compromise the ATO's compliance and enforcement strategies and its internal reporting procedures and would therefore be contrary to the public interest. I am advised in relation to two of the review documents sought that the ATO has already made public what it can make public through speeches and other processes.</para><para> As a responsible government we are committed to the democratic principles of transparent and accountable government. It should not be forgotten that the ATO is accountable to the government, to the parliament and to the Australian people. It reports both publicly and to the parliament in the commissioner's annual report, Senate estimates processes and other parliamentary committee processes. It is also subject to audit process by the Australian National Audit Office and to scrutiny by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. </para><para>Within this strong framework of transparency and accountability, it is important to protect the integrity of the internal workings of the ATO to ensure that it can undertake its statutory and administration role. No doubt that is why, historically, it is unusual for the Senate to order production of the internal working documents of an independent agency such as the ATO. That is why the freedom of information processes provide exemptions for internal working documents and for documents concerning the operations of agencies. That is why Senator Murray took the very important step of writing to me to clarify the basis on which he supported Senator Cook's motion. In the government's view, disclosure of the documents sought would affect the tax office's strategic pursuit, and therefore impede or harm the recovery, of a substantial amount of tax. Therefore, I am unable on this occasion to comply with the Senate's request. </para><para>It is worth noting that the approach taken in relation to this issue is consistent with actions taken by previous Labor governments. In June 1992 Senator Gareth Evans, the then Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, spoke of wrestling with the very difficult and sensitive responsibilities he had, on the one hand, to the Senate and to the public interest to disclose as much material as he reasonably could and, on the other hand, to his country and to other individuals and interests that might be prejudiced by unreasonable disclosure. In December 1993, in relation to another matter, Senator Evans spoke about how making a working document public would undermine the proper functioning of government. He highlighted the fact that working documents may be used in the process of reaching a decision but do not govern or dictate the decision. I consider that position to be the most responsible position, and it is consistent with Senator Murray's letter to me of 4 October.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>21321</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the statement.</para></motion><para>Madam President, I was out of the chamber at the beginning of the minister's remarks and I was not aware that he was going to choose this moment to make those remarks.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—I spoke to your people.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—The minister interjects across the chamber, out of his place, that he spoke to my people.

It is not often that a parliament says to a government, `We would like all of the documents about this case because, essentially, it is in the public interest that we pursue these issues and it is in the public interest that all the documents be on the table so that the parliament, and through the parliament the people of Australia, can form its own views about the conduct of'—in this case—`the government on taxation.' I need not say it because it is self-enforcing, but taxation is a fundamental issue that touches all Australians and, as such, all Australians have an interest in it.</para><para>My freedom of information request identified 1,910 pages, and they wanted to charge me $19,000 in order to have access to them. So when I sought them directly as a freedom of information request, the information was available at a charge. All I had to do was cough up $19,000 and the information could have become public and the community could have been enlightened. But when through the forms of the parliament the information is sought, it suddenly is not available; it becomes `a working document' and a veil of secrecy is drawn over it, obscuring from the view of the public the contents of essential information about the tax system. The first comment that is obvious here is that there is inconsistency in the conduct of the government. When you make an approach at one level it is available at a price, but if the parliament seeks the information it is available at no price and can never be obtained.</para><para>I missed the opening words of the minister's explanation to this chamber, so I am not in a position to respond to all that he has said. However, I will examine the record and see what other excuses he has offered. I was present to hear the concluding paragraphs of what he said, and he referred, inter alia, to remarks by the former Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, in which Senator Evans expressed his concerns about making available to the public documents which were sought by the parliament but which, in his judgment—reasonably, he thought—might endanger the public interest if they were available. That was the tenor of the remarks of the minister. I may not have it word perfect, but that was certainly the impression he sought to convey.</para><para>I make this observation to begin: Senator Evans was, at the relevant time, the foreign minister. The issue that he was contending with was Australia's foreign relations: our relations with countries and interests in the rest of the world. I do not, at this short notice, have an opportunity to check the reference, but I will back it in that the sort of information being sought conceivably could have endangered our national interest and put the security of the realm at risk. Someone as deliberative and as careful as Senator Evans was about the right of the community to know and about freedom of information would have tortured himself to stretch the point if he were in any doubt and would favour the public interest and the right to know if there was an on-balance decision about what should be applied here. But this concerns tax, and it does not concern an individual taxpayer. So it is not possible, from the information we are seeking, to identify an individual and to publicly pry into the privacy of an individual's tax affairs. That is not what we are after. This is about group behaviour and about the behaviour of the government and the tax office. </para><para>We are all taxpayers and the government takes our money and uses it—this government would assert it is in the national interest; I would argue that it has a distorted set of priorities in that it is essentially out of touch with what real Australians think. Nonetheless, the theory is that the government takes the money of individual Australians, aggregates it and spends it in the national interest. A fundamental of taxation and a fundamental right of the individual in surrendering funds to a government as tax is to know that the management of those funds is properly conducted and that the money is spent in a publicly accountable and transparent way. So when we ask for this information, what does the minister say? He says, `I won't tell you.' If he will not tell us, he will not tell the people who are the subject of the taxation.</para><para>This is a crazy situation. This is a government out of control. This is the sort of thing you get in banana republics, when governments are contemptuous of the community and of the parliament, when they sit in their ivory towers and say, `We will take your money but we will not tell you what we are doing with it, and we damn well won't be accountable to how we manage it and what the proper affairs are.' The minister has now left the chamber, which is a mild snub to the interests of this issue— but that is the minister we have grown to know, albeit not to clasp to our bosom as someone we necessarily love; nonetheless, due to the forms of this place, we are required to respect him. </para><para>To cite a reference from Senator Evans, as foreign minister, talking about endangering the national interest—knowing that Senator Evans is a well-known person who stood up for the rights of individuals, who pioneered legislation and argued all through his professional life about freedom of association—and to cover up on taxation, seems to me to be, at best, a very long stretch indeed. If I am wrong about that, if I have misrepresented the government, I will have no compunction about apologising to them for that. But it would be consistent with the behaviour of this government and of this minister—and utterly consistent with the behaviour of Senator Evans over many years—for that to be a reasonable observation to make, that there is indeed some effort here to manipulate the bureaucracy and the language of the bureaucracy and to draw a veil over information necessary to the community.</para><para>I am disappointed in the actions of the government.

In that year, he was elected a New South Wales senator and held this position from 1 July 1965 until his retirement in 1983.

He worked tirelessly to improve the public image of the dingo. Tony Mulvihill was also a passionate environmentalist, with campaigns to save the Cape Barren geese, the hairy-nosed wombat and the Leadbeater's possum among his causes. A plaque was erected in his honour after he battled to have the uranium waste disposal in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory dealt with properly rather than letting it seep into local rivers. He was also instrumental in the erection of a monument in Tumut in 1978 in recognition of lives that were lost in the building of the Snowy Mountains scheme.

Tony Mulvihill was an only child. He was born in 1919 into a working-class family in North Ryde in Sydney. He left school with an Intermediate Certificate. He never managed to get an apprenticeship, but he was a real goer. He became a railway worker. He worked as a fireman, machinist, boilermaker's assistant and a crane driver. He was elected as chief shop steward at the Chullora railway yards.</para></talk.start><para>After the Second World War, he joined the Australian Labor Party. He was a delegate to the Labor Council of New South Wales, representing the Australian Railways Union. While I never served in parliament with Tony Mulvihill, I knew him for 30 years. He was one of the characters and personalities that you sometimes find in politics—most often, I think, associated with the Labor Party. He was a senator from 1965 to 1983. He served on the opposition front bench for two years after Labor's defeat in the 1975 general election, and he served as spokesman on the environment. I think that was very appropriate because Tony Mulvihill was a conservationist. It is probably true that he was the first real conservationist to sit in this chamber. It is also true that at times in the 1960s he was ridiculed for espousing pro-conservation views. He was a great advocate for the establishment of Kakadu National Park and an advocate for the park's protection from uranium waste. He argued the case for the protection of the dingo. As we have heard, he was the patron of the wild dog association. He stridently defended the good name of the dingo to all and sundry. He argued to protect the Cape Barren goose, the hairy-nosed wombat, the Leadbeater's possum and the red kangaroo. In fact, he earned the nickname `the red kangaroo' after campaigning for the protection of that animal when he became concerned about its possible extinction.</para><para>I recall that that nickname caused an amazing fracas in the Labor Party back in April 1977 in Sydney. A throwaway newspaper, called <inline font-style="italic">City Extra</inline>, which was circulating in the inner city of Sydney, libelled Tony on the front page in its first and only issue, as I recall. It was an extraordinary article that said, `To hell with the unemployed.' It claimed that state ALP leaders had ruthlessly adopted a policy calling for a return to large-scale migration of more than 100,000 per year. The article attacked Tony and was quite famous in the Labor Party at the time. People were trying to scrounge copies of this throwaway newspaper. As you can see, I successfully scrounged a copy of it. The journalist, if you can call him that, said:</para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">City Extra</inline> rang Senator Mulvihill to get his side of the story. He said, `Anything you've got to say, you talk to the officers,' and slammed the phone down. We don't know whether he means police officers or what.</para></quote><para>Of course, I know what he meant—he meant the party officers in New South Wales. Tony was saying, `Anything you've got to say about the New South Wales state ALP leaders, refer it to the party officers,' as you would. This became famous because there was a photograph of Tony on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">City Extra</inline> with the caption—this comes back to the issue of the red kangaroo—`Senator Mulvihill, known as the “red kangaroo” in political circles for his erratic, communistic behaviour.' As I said, Tony was libelled on the front page of the newspaper. Sadly for Tony, when he took this libel case—which he won, of course—he found that the publisher of the <inline font-style="italic">City Extra</inline> was a bankrupt, so it was a little bit of a Pyrrhic victory, we would have to say.</para><para>It is also true to say, and should be recorded in this condolence debate, that Tony Mulvihill championed the cause of ethnic minorities from his time in the Chullora railway workshops. His work with the Yugoslav community, particularly in Sydney, was very well known, but he was highly regarded in many ethnic communities in the state of New South Wales and beyond the borders of New South Wales. He chaired the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council. </para><para>I think it is important in a debate like this to also record that Tony Mulvihill was a significant figure in the New South Wales Labor Party in the fifties, the sixties and the seventies. After the split in the mid-1950s, Tony served on the caretaker executive. He was unanimously elected assistant general secretary after Jack Kane was sacked. I think his clashes with Jack Kane in that period were legendary, but it was quite some effort to achieve that office in that way at that time. Along with figures such as Fred Campbell, Bill Colbourne and Charlie Oliver, Tony Mulvihill was a very significant machine figure and did a lot to ensure that the New South Wales Labor Party remained united and to ensure the stability of the New South Wales Labor government. </para><para>John Armitage, who was a close friend of Tony's and a former federal member for Chifley in the House of Representatives, told me some time ago that soon after Tony became assistant general secretary three irate wharfies were menacing the then General Secretary, Bill Colbourne, in room 32 in the Sydney trades hall. Tony's reaction was probably a bit typical: he jumped the counter, grabbed one of the wharfies by the throat and shouted, `Don't you touch my mate!' Times were tough back then and, according to John, this was a very significant incident because it really did a lot to cement the relationship between Tony Mulvihill and Bill Colbourne, which, as I said, made a very significant difference to the unity of the Labor Party in those difficult times. </para><para>Tony Mulvihill fought out his struggles in the Labor Party full bore, as he did with political challenges in this chamber and in the broader community. I remember Tony Mulvihill appearing before an ALP disputes committee in the mid-1970s. I was a member of the disputes committee at that time. Tony laid an internal party charge against an opponent in the Lowe federal electorate council of the ALP. That charge was one of bringing the Labor Party into disrepute.

I cannot remember all of the details now, Senator Hill, but I do remember that it was one of the funniest experiences of my life. Tony was a key stalwart in later years for the Labor Party in the Lowe federal electorate. He engaged in the many tight campaigns that were held in that seat over the decades. He was a tough, tough fighter for the Labor Party. I cannot say that Tony did not hold grudges, because he did hold the odd grudge. In fact, there was one memorable Senate speech when he made it absolutely clear that he was in the business of settling scores. If anyone has not seen Tony's speech of 14 December 1982, page 3492 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, I commend the speech as a good read. Let me quote a little of it. It reads:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>I take the Senate back to my first dealings with—</para></quote><para>a family—</para><quote><para>who lived in Concord. My story has a small beginning. It began on a Sunday morning. I had a fox terrier dog named Jeff. I know that people such as Senator Douglas McClelland who is a dog lover will appreciate this aspect. I went along to my place of worship. The three—</para></quote><para>unnamed, in my contribution—</para><quote><para>boys were in the churchyard. They were always vicious. They took umbrage because my dog followed me into the church. Whatever denomination people are, I do not believe it was the end of the world because that inoffensive dog wanted to follow me into the church.</para></quote><para>According to Tony, one individual was:</para><quote><para>the greatest degenerate of any member of the trade union movement in New South Wales—</para></quote><para>and he—</para><para>laid my dog out with a brick. I picked up a piece of three by two in order to even things up because there were three—</para><para>of them—</para><quote><para>and only myself. It was unfortunate that, with the dog lying in a pool of blood, the father of the boys, who was a policeman, threatened to arrest me. Of course, there was only one victor and it was not me. I carried the dog the half mile to my home. I said to my mother: `One day I will even that up'. </para></quote><para>He did that on 14 December 1982. It is a great read and I commend it to you. He does say in his speech that the facts are sordid, but he completes his speech with these words:</para><quote><para>I conclude by saying that I have kept faith. My dog's honour has been cleared. I say to the ... family: I do not know what part of Sydney you live in now; but I have squared the account tonight.</para></quote><para>And he did, I can assure you.</para><para>Tony Mulvihill was a very colourful character. I actually think it is fair to say in the nicest possible way that he was an eccentric. It is important to remember at times like this what an important figure in the Labor Party and the labour movement Tony Mulvihill was, particularly after the split in the mid-1950s. I will not just remember the odd vitriolic speech he made about those of us on the Left of the Labor Party at the New South Wales administrative committee or the annual conference—one or two barbs over the years were directed in my general direction. I will remember a champion of the underdog, someone I really did come to realise was a person of great courage, a great Labor loyalist and a real personality.</para><para>Tony suffered a long illness before his death, but as you would expect he was a fighter to the end. To Tony's family, particularly to Pam and to his friends, on behalf of the Labor Party we offer our sincere condolences.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>21326</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Democrats I would also like to offer our condolences to the family and the many friends of former Senator Tony Mulvihill. I was working in the Old Parliament House from 1978 till the time we moved up here. I well remember Tony Mulvihill popping into former Senator Colin Mason's office—I used to work for Colin—to mostly discuss environmental campaigns. I would like to mention a couple of those. A few of them have been mentioned already by Senator Hill and Senator Faulkner but there are many things I would like to add. Way back before it was fashionable Tony Mulvihill played a key role in most of the early environmental battles fought in Australia. The one I remember most was the campaign to have Kakadu declared a national park. He was absolutely passionate about it and absolutely determined that Kakadu would be declared a national park, and of course it eventually was. He campaigned to prevent the alienation of public lands. That is something he kept campaigning on after he left parliament. There was never an end to that one.</para></talk.start><para>He was Labor's shadow minister for the environment for two years—in 1976 and 1977. He consistently raised matters relating to the conservation of our endangered species. This was much to the derision of many of his colleagues and many media representatives. He really was a visionary with regard to environmental protection in Australia. The issues he campaigned on then are of course mainstream now, and it is a credit to him that he persisted with those efforts. I remember a survey some years back—I think it was a contingent value method survey—that showed that Australians would have been prepared to dip into their own pockets and fork out something like $25 each to buy and therefore save Kakadu had it not been declared a national park. Clearly, Tony Mulvihill understood very early the deep and abiding sense of care that most Australians feel towards our wilderness areas, forests and threatened species. He was determined to have that recognised by the parliament even though he was ridiculed—Senator Faulkner was right in that. It was not a popular thing to do in those early years, but he was absolutely determined and he was absolutely right. Senator Mulvihill campaigned for the protection of Cape Barren geese, the booby population on Christmas Island, kangaroos and, as we have heard, the dingo.</para><para>Because it is such a famous speech and everybody remembers it I was going to remind senators of the 14 December 1982 speech that Senator Faulkner has just mentioned. Senator Faulkner did it much better than I would, so I would just like to recommend that speech to people as well. If you have not noted that, it is on page 3492 of the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>of 1982. It was an absolute ripper of a speech. Never forgive and never forget was something that really did apply to Tony Mulvihill. It probably does not apply too much to many Labor Party people now, but it sure applied to Tony and he well and truly got back. </para><para>When I heard that Tony had died I was also reminded of the time when he was quite upset with a witness to a committee. That time was popularly referred to around Parliament House as the time Tony Mulvihill tried to table the witness. I do not know what happened to that witness and I hate to think where he ended up.</para><para>There are two things I most remember Tony Mulvihill for. Firstly, for being a campaigner for the environment and threatened species. It is a substantial gift to give to Australia. The fact that Kakadu was declared a national park was largely as a result of what he did and he should always be remembered for that. Secondly, I remember him as a larger than life character whom I know Colin was always happy to see when he popped into the office to have a cup of tea and talk about environmental things. He was also larger than life in the things that Senator Faulkner has told us about—his speech about Jeff the fox terrier—and in his tabling of a witness. They were not the only things he did around here that will never be forgotten. He should never be forgotten because of what he did for the environment and how he persisted through ridicule and everything else. He knew he was right, he was right and he persisted. In the end we have all come to agree with everything he thought back in the 1960s and 1970s. We send our condolences to his family and to his many friends.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>21327</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too would like to associate my National Party colleagues with the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill and the government and to make just a few remarks. Senator Mulvihill left parliament in 1983. I was one of the few people that came in in 1983, so I never had the good fortune to meet Senator Mulvihill, but in my days as a travelling salesman and representative before I came into the Senate I used to listen to the parliamentary debates as I drove around from town to town, and Tony Mulvihill was a very consistent contributor to those debates. I used to listen to him in those days, and in fact I can remember that particular speech that Senator Faulkner referred to—I remember either listening to it or reading about it.</para></talk.start><para>No doubt, Tony Mulvihill was a great ALP stalwart and character, and political parties rely on those characters to go into history. They become a part of the fabric of the political party, and I think it does us all good to have those types of people that we can refer to in the various political parties. He was a great contributor to the ALP in some of those years which must have been pretty hard. In 1974 and 1975, when the Labor Party had a serious loss of members, he no doubt played his role in their reconstruction. I convey to his family our condolences for their loss.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>21328</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise to make some brief comments about the sad passing of former Senator Tony Mulvihill. I of course, like other senators from the Labor Party, particularly in New South Wales, knew Tony Mulvihill essentially through his role in the New South Wales Labor Party. Listening to Senator Faulkner's speech earlier reminded me that Tony obviously taught many of us that invaluable lesson—`never forget!'  Senator Faulkner's remarks about those cases before the disputes committee, which I also served on, came back to me very quickly. Tony was certainly a person who, when he put his energies into something, really did it in a very full and forceful manner, as he did on that occasion.</para></talk.start><para>Whilst as a young member of the Labor Party I knew Tony Mulvihill and watched him get into stoushes at state conferences, I came to know him better after I was appointed to the Senate in 1994. He used to drop into my office in Phillip Street to have a chat and a cup of tea or coffee. He was particularly fond of doing that because my secretary at that time was a woman called Marion Grace, whom I am sure many senators will remember. Marion had worked for many Labor politicians, starting out with Dan Curtin, then working for people like Les Johnson and Tony Mulvihill, and then subsequently Senator Richardson. When I replaced Graham Richardson, Marion worked for me. I have to say that it was a great pleasure for me to be able to sit and listen to Tony chat with Marion about old times and also to hear his advice and his counsel about political issues. He was also quite renowned for sending scraps of newspaper articles, whether they be from current newspapers or previous newspapers, to me and other Labor MPs on a regular basis with his views on the issues of the day or on aspects of Labor history that were of importance to him.</para><para>As has also been referred to, Tony was an active Labor Party figure not just in the New South Wales ALP office and as a senator but also particularly in the Lowe electorate. My wife's grandparents, Michael and May Purcell, who are both deceased now, were great stalwarts of the Labor Party and of the Concord community, which is in Lowe. Tony was a great friend of their family. My wife tells me that, when they were kids visiting their grandparents' place, Tony often dropped in and would go and buy all the children an ice cream, and of course they thought that was a great thrill.</para><para>Over more recent years, I came to know Tony a lot better and had a bit more to do with him. He quite regularly contacted my office and Marion, in particular, to pursue some matter in the immigration area, which he was so involved in and did so much work for members of ethnic communities, even after he left the parliament. He also did of course have those other interests that have been referred to as eccentricities.</para><para>I remember one of the first occasions that he came up to me after I was appointed to the Senate was at a New South Wales ALP annual conference. He said, `I've got to talk to you,' and he grabbed me and took me outside to a Johnno's coffee shop where he proceeded to tell me that he was the patron of the Australian Women's Tug of War Association and that they needed some money. I said, `You have heard of the sports grants?' and that I did not think that that was possible but I would see what I could do. There was Tony enthusiastically supporting the need for more money and support for the Australian Women's Tug of War Association.</para><para>It is a sad loss. Tony was one of those great characters, one of those great figures, of the Australian Labor Party, and that makes his passing one that we all feel deeply. I know that we will all remember him as having made a great contribution to this parliament, to our party, to the Australian nation and to the Australian character.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>21328</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too would like to associate myself with this condolence motion in respect of Tony. I remember him. I have been a member of the party for 26 years so I remember Tony for that length of time. He was never one to care about fashion. Tony was a fighter and a supporter of the underdog, the underprivileged, the minority and those groups that were discriminated against. He was somebody who remembered everything. He never forgot—he always repaid his debts as he saw them, a la Senator Faulkner's reading of his final speech to this place.</para></talk.start><para>He had another love and that was of women's athletics, particularly women's field events in the throwing area, the discus and the shot putt.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—Gael Martin.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name></talker><para>—Gael Martin—that is right. Gael Mulvihill as she originally was; Gael Martin as she later was. He fought very hard for women's sport to get the media coverage that it deserved, did not get, and still does not get, although it certainly has improved. He had a commitment to following the careers of those women in sports which were not the glamour events. He was interested in them and loved to support them. I will always remember him at annual conferences. My late father was an athletics coach, so Tony would feel compelled at each annual conference to come up and give my father and me, if I was around, the latest information on what was happening or, more to the point, what was not happening as far as the appropriate recognition for women's field events was concerned.</para></talk.start></continue><para>He was someone who had an absolute commitment to the ALP, its philosophies and its ideologies. He was loyal to the party at all times. He was usually loyal to the Right faction when I knew him but on occasions he did some things that put you at a disadvantage. I will never forget being proxied in my first national conference—back when we had six delegates from each state or something small—for my first session. I had been given strict riding instructions—as he was the senior person from our side there I was to go with him but always go with the committee. He was on this particular committee but Tony stands up and moves an amendment on which there has to be a vote. My colleague and I, who were both first timers, were saying, `What do we do, Tony?' He said, `You do what you want to do!' The chair was having a great deal of amusement at this and Graham Richardson came flying back into the chamber saying, `What the expletive is going on here?' and we were saying, `What do we do?' So Tony certainly was an eccentric—somebody who would do his own thing and let you do your own thing too. He was somebody who, as I say, had an absolute commitment to the Labor Party and who was always ready to give you information and advice and to remind you of the ancient history of the party. I express my condolences to Pam and the family and to his friends.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>21329</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Greens, I would like to support the motion and also express condolences on the passing of former Senator Tony Mulvihill. I did but know him in passing and was grateful for his parliamentary support for the saving of the Franklin River back at the end of his career and before my career in this place. I have noted his prodigious support of particularly wildlife at a time when it was not fashionable and I concur with Senator Faulkner that he was somewhat of an elder figure or early starter in being a parliamentary representative of the rapidly growing concern for the environment, in particular wildlife, that has been shown by the Australian nation as a whole. Other members have mentioned his particular support for the causes of the dingoes, wombats, seals on the other side of the world in Ireland, Leadbeater possums in Victoria and Cape Barren geese. I think we should recollect that just two decades ago Cape Barren geese were on the verge of extinction—they were down to a couple of hundred. Now they are on menus of certain dining places and they are found from South Australia through to the south-east island outposts of Tasmania—and in great numbers. That did not just happen. It happened because people like Senator Mulvihill spoke up for them at a time when they were indeed facing extinction and needed some breathing space and land in which to be safe and secure and to recover from the brink of extinction.</para></talk.start><para>I note also from 1982 <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, but this time from 18 February, a little of what Senator Mulvihill had to say at the time and I want to put that back on the record:</para><quote><para>Every time I play a game of golf at Massey Park on Exile Bay in my own area, I see the pelicans gliding into the river. I think it was a Senate committee that exposed not only the damage that the Australian Gas Light Co. was doing to that river—</para></quote><para>he is talking about the Parramatta River here—</para><quote><para>but also the fact that State government authorities in New South Wales were not talking to each other. As a result of our vigilance, the river pollution was reduced to an absolute minimum. Pelicans have now come back to the Parramatta River. These are vivid illustrations. I know that Senator Missen—</para></quote><para>and we will remember Senator Missen also as a very great advocate on the other side of this chamber for the environment—</para><quote><para>is on my side 100 per cent on these matters. I am not utopian. I know that in my own State there are occasions when one has to say to the present government: `You will not get all you want for the border ranges national park but you will get something'. The powerful Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment went to Senator Missen's State several times to the forests—</para></quote><para>that is to Victoria. He went on:</para><quote><para>Three years before the Victorian State authorities had given evidence about the Leadbeater possum and forest enclaves of old gums. We were told: `Yes, it will be all right'. Two years later we knew that it was not all right. Senator Melzer, a very active senator from Victoria, and I went back to this area on a sub-committee and the authorities admitted that they had been a bit sluggish. I do not know that the Victorian sawmillers are affected simply because of a few forest enclaves—</para></quote><para>He is referring to the protection of them. Then he had this to say—and I think it is very important, because he equated conservation movements with unions:</para><quote><para>I join with all my colleagues in this place in defence of the cause of conservation by saying that as in everything else there have to be restraints at times. Perhaps I can use a better analogy. Some people—fortunately there are few of them—want to emasculate completely the trade union movement. If that happened I know what would happen to industrial safety conditions for example. The same situation applies to conservation groups. If we did not have them we would not have had the achievements we have seen.</para></quote><para>I think that is a voice we could well do with back here in the Senate. On occasions, I wish he were here with us again. His record stands for itself. It is a very positive one as far as the environment is concerned. In that respect, he is somebody whom we miss.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>21330</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise also to speak on the condolence motion for Senator Tony Mulvihill. Last Friday the New South Wales administrative committee of the Labor Party met, and we also made a similar resolution. There were a number of men there who recalled fondly—and some not so fondly—Tony's contribution to the labour movement and the Labor Party. To follow on from what Senator Brown said, I think I should put it on the record that Tony Mulvihill was a very proud trade unionist. He was chief shop steward at the railway goods yard out at Chullora and he was also a delegate to the labour council.</para></talk.start><para>One of the defining periods in his political life, other than his period of environmental concerns, was well documented in a famous book about the Labor Party entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Split</inline> by Robert Murray. A number of activists in the Labor Party in New South Wales were concerned about the direction of the party—not only in New South Wales but nationally—and that led to a great split in our party. At the time, Tony Mulvihill was involved in a group which became known as the combined branches and unions steering committee. When I joined the Labor Party in 1971, that was the name of the left-wing group in New South Wales. That subsequently changed, and now I think it is called the socialist left. But Tony and another famous labour activist, Kath Anderson, were very much involved in the original steering committee. I think Senator Faulkner men-tioned that a dispute that Tony Mulvihill intervened in between three wharfies and BillColbourne may have started him on the right course. I do not know.</para><para>A number of people who I have spoken to, or members of my staff have spoken to, have given me some interesting anecdotes about Tony. I remember, as president of the party, sometimes having to try to escape around Sussex Street and Goulburn Street. Tony, in his later years, would be prosecuting or persecuting someone for something they had done in a branch somewhere or whatever else, and he would stake out the coffee shop across the road just to see whether you would come out. He would give you a bit of advice on how we were running the party or where we were taking things. But he was, as has been said, a very aggressive man when it came to causes that he was championing or people he was after. I think Senator Ray may recall that in his last speech to parliament he did make it a point to square up. I suppose that was the period of the Irish Catholics within the labour movement, who were never forgotten and never forgiven either.</para><para>Tony was not a flashy dresser, as I think most of us recall. That was not what motivated him. What motivated him was his commitments, whether it was his trade union, the environment or, as has been said, migrants generally and Yugoslav migrants in particular. His colleagues included Johnno Johnson, who is a member of the New South Wales upper house; Garry McIlwaine, who used to be a member of parliament in New South Wales; and Michael Maher. I know they fondly recall their association with Tony Mulvihill and miss him.</para><para>I was advised today that Tony Mulvihill was famous for sending out Mulvigrams. This is what I have been told. Whenever someone or something came up which he did not like, Tony would persecute the Labor minister responsible with a telegram—or what became known as a Mulvigram. If he was not given a response within three days, he would Mulvigram anybody and everybody to let the entire labour movement know of his displeasure. If any material in one of his many Mulvigrams had the potential to be defamatory, he would ask his lawyer for advice and then he would send the Mulvigram.</para><para>There is an excellent obituary piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of Tuesday, 19 December last year written by Cynthia Banham. She says at the end—and I think it is appropriate to quote this:</para><quote><para>When he was 47, Mulvihill married Pamela O'Connell. They later divorced, having had no children, but remained close friends. For most of his life he lived in Concord but when his health deteriorated 18 months ago, Pamela, who lived in Wentworth Falls, found him a place in a Katoomba nursing home so she could visit him.</para></quote><para>I think that should be noted and appreciated.

Very early in my career, he gave me some good advice. He said, `Son, never flash outside the off stump.' It was only a couple of weeks later that I realised Tony never followed this advice himself, as in the case of the saying `Those who cannot do, teach'. I do not think it has been noted particularly today that he had a remarkable recall of political events. It was absolutely outstanding. I do not know if anyone ever sought out Tony Mulvihill for oral history, but I was browsing in the library in about 1982 and I came across the book on the minutes of the New South Wales special conference in 1957. This was after the Labor split. Just to kill a bit of time, I read through it.</para></talk.start><para>I found where Tony Mulvihill voted against the incumbent faction. I thought that this was a good piece of information to have, so I fronted Tony and asked, `Why did you vote in 1957 against the incumbent group in New South Wales?' Thirty minutes later, I had had a complete description of the circumstances of that vote and what led to that vote. Most of us have trouble remembering what we were involved in five years ago in politics. He had a remarkable memory of his own involvement. Not only that, he had a remarkable memory for the history of this parliament. I know of a good trivia question which virtually no-one can get. There has been only one case in this parliament of a father entering the parliament, having had his son serve here for nine years beforehand and then die. I used to trick a lot of people with this question—Bill Hayden and a lot of others. I asked Tony Mulvihill this question one day and he named the two members, Baker, the seats they held and the years they held them. He had an incredible knowledge of the history of this parliament.</para><para>It has been mentioned that Tony Mulvihill was a patron of many causes. Some have been mentioned, but tug of war was one of his great loves. I still have in my Canberra rented residence a tug of war medal that he sent me for some battle I fought in the Labor Party. He decided to reward me by sending me a tug of war medal. He was very pleased that tug of war was once an Olympic sport and was totally confounded by the fact that it was no longer an Olympic sport.</para><para>Tony Mulvihill was a deputy chair in this chamber. I remember watching television one night in the old house. The one thing Tony Mulvihill never ever learnt was that there is a little button that turns off the sound when you are in the chair. He had been in the chair for an hour, the relief chairman came and Tony said: `Thank God you're here. I'm dying for a ...' I delete the expletive. That went right through the building but, fortunately, we were not live to air anywhere else. I had some regret when Tony left, because he definitely had the worst set of ties of any senator. It was sometimes possible to tell where he had browsed that day for lunch. He had these horrible ties. It put a lot of pressure on me and on Senator Boswell when he left—as in which one of us could front with the worst tie. We have been well overtaken now, fortunately, by new recruits to the chamber.</para><para>Once Tony left this place, he missed it. The former member for Lowe Michael Maher very kindly involved him in his office. Tony would come in for a day and a half and do constituency work for Michael. These may seem very generous acts of both Tony and Michael, but it actually doubled Michael Maher's workload. Michael would sit in his office and Tony would be in the office next door, so Michael could hear what was happening. I will give an example of what used to happen: a constituent came in with an inquiry and saw Tony, and all Michael could hear was Tony saying: `You're nothing more than a whingeing Pom. Christ, it was only 10 quid to get out here. That was the worst money we ever spent.' This is in a marginal seat on a knife edge. Then Michael had to go and reinterview all these constituents and try to bring them back across. Nevertheless, Tony did miss this place and he did do that constituency work.</para><para>The worst message you could ever get from Tony Mulvihill in one of the Mulvigrams was that he had admonished someone, because you never knew whether it meant he had written them an abusive letter, made an abusive phone call or gone the knuckle on them. He was a complex individual. He was volatile, litigious and, as Senator Hutchins mentioned, sometimes overly aggressive. Some of those qualities we would not admire in a person, but it all came together to make a very good individual. Whatever his faults were, when you put the package together you found a caring individual who lived life to the full, who was passionate about causes and who really loved political life—the interchange and the sociability of it all. As Senator Faulkner said, despite all the eccentricity, it should never be forgotten that Tony Mulvihill was a serious player. We tend to remember the eccentricity and not the seriousness. I am glad that today Senator Faulkner and others have put on the record that he was also a very serious political player. I offer my condolences to the family.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable senators standing in their places.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>McLeay, Hon.

After attending Scotch College from 1928 to 1939, Mr McLeay enlisted in the AIF in 1941 and served in New Guinea as a gunner for the 13th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, from 1942 to 1943. He joined the Liberal Country League, later the Liberal Party, in 1940. After nine years in the party, he was elected to the Unley City Council, where he served from 1949 to 1970, including as mayor from 1961 to 1963. Mr McLeay held the federal seat of Boothby in South Australia, succeeding his father, former Lord Mayor of Adelaide and Speaker of the House of Representatives, the late Sir John McLeay. He held the seat from 1966 until his retirement from parliament in 1981, which meant that the seat of Boothby was held by the McLeay family for some 31 years.</para><para>During his federal parliamentary career, Mr McLeay held several portfolios, including Assistant Minister to the Minister for Civil Aviation, Minister for Construction and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. He served as Minister for Administrative Services in the Fraser government from 1978 to 1980. As Minister for Construction, he gave great support to preserving and restoring some of the most significant Commonwealth owned historic properties.</para><para>John McLeay resigned from parliament in 1981 and was appointed Australia's consul-general to Los Angeles from 1981 to 1983, during which time he founded the Australian-American Chamber of Commerce in Los Angeles. For this he received a special commendation from the US Secretary of State. He did much in this period to build the business relationship between Australia and California and the United States as a whole. </para><para>He served tirelessly on community committees in South Australia. He founded the Unley Senior Citizens Club and enthusiastically supported both handicapped and pensioner organisations. Apart from what was obviously a lifetime of public service, for which we should all be grateful, John McLeay was also a highly successful businessman, founding the family business of McLeay and Sons Carpets in Adelaide which still operates today. To his wife, Clythe, his three sons, Travis, Robin and Digby, and their families, I extend our deepest sympathies. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>21333</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the opposition, I support the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate on the death of the Hon. John Elden McLeay, a former minister in both the McMahon and Fraser governments. As we have heard, John McLeay was born into the world of politics, with both his father and his uncle being federal politicians, so it was not surprising that John McLeay entered the political arena. He was first elected to parliament in 1966 for the seat of Boothby in South Australia; he succeeded his father who had held that seat for some 16 years. So with John McLeay holding the seat of Boothby for some 15 years until his resignation in 1981, it was quite a significant period that the family was directly involved in the parliament and represented the people of Boothby in South Australia.</para></talk.start><para>John McLeay held several portfolios during his time as a minister, being first appointed to the ministry in 1971 in the McMahon government as the Assistant Minister to the Minister for Civil Aviation. After the 1975 election, he was appointed by Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser as Minister for Construction and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. In 1978, he became Minister for Administrative Services, as well as retaining his position as Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. He held those portfolios until 1980. I think I am correct in saying that in the late 1970s he was the only South Australian minister in the Fraser government. He was well recognised as a very strong and effective representative for the people of South Australia; he was a very dedicated servant in that regard. On behalf of the opposition in the Senate, I offer our sincere condolences to John McLeay's wife and family.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>21334</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Senator Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to associate my National Party colleagues with the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate today. John Elden McLeay served Australia in many ways—in the Army during the Second World War, in local government and then in federal government and as a consul-general in the United States. His service extended over many years and took various forms. He was a minister in the McMahon government and then in the subsequent Fraser government. He held the seat of Boothby from 1966 to 1981, and from there he moved to the consul department in America where he founded the Australian-American Chamber of Commerce.</para></talk.start><para>His public service extended over many years. On top of that, he also was, as Senator Hill told us, a successful small business person in the state of South Australia. I think people who put this amount of time—almost a lifetime—into public service deserve to be remembered in this place. I never knew John McLeay. As I said in the previous condolence motion, my interest in politics led me to listen to a number of political debates and I can remember him making contributions in this place. So I associate myself and the National Party with this motion, and I offer our condolences to his wife and three children and pass on our sympathy to his family in their time of loss.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>21334</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too wish to speak on this motion of condolence for John McLeay. All South Australian Liberals in particular were saddened by his untimely death on 26 December, the day after Christmas. Indeed, the memorial service for John held at Scots College, with which he had a strong association, attracted a remarkably large and very diverse audience, which reflects both the affection in which he was held and the range of interests that he had. May I say that his family and his friends were particularly touched by the fact that Gough Whitlam took the time and trouble to come in the middle of January on a very hot Adelaide day to that memorial service. That really touched his family in particular, and it is a great credit to Gough that he made that trip and expressed his sympathies for the family in that way.</para></talk.start><para>It is particularly interesting that Gough did turn up, because I noticed, in looking through John's parliamentary file, that he was the minister who, as Minister for Administrative Services, announced in 1979 the sale of the former prime ministerial Mercedes-Benz 450 SEL, which was the subject of extraordinary controversy, I recall, when I was at university in Canberra as a student, when Gough was Prime Minister and roaring around town in the Mercedes. Of course, it was a Liberal government that came in and got rid of the Mercedes and replaced it with a Holden. Indeed, I am glad that tradition has continued, because we make them in South Australia. I think it was most appropriate that John was the one who presided over the sale of that particular Mercedes, and it is a great credit to Gough that he was prepared to be there for that memorial service.</para><para>I certainly regard it as a privilege to have known John since I became State Director of South Australia in 1985. I did count him very much as a friend and, indeed, as something of an ideological soulmate, although he was much more controversial than I ever have been or, I think, will be. Again, just looking through some of the headlines with which John is associated, if you start back in 1970, you read: `Communist under the carpet: Barry Wain talks to John McLeay', `MHR renews attack on churchmen', `MP says textbooks are subversive', `No stranger to disputes', `Red outburst: McLeay not sorry'. So he was a man marked by his willingness to be prepared to say what he thought and not be afraid to attract great controversy and the resultant headlines.</para><para>It is also interesting to me, as someone who moved to South Australia in 1985, that he is one of those politicians—and it is something of a South Australian tradition—that was part of a father-son duo in politics. That does seem to be a bit of a South Australian phenomenon, because John's father was a very famous Speaker and, of course, our esteemed leader's father was of course in state parliament; and there were the Downers and the Wilsons. It is something of a South Australian phenomenon that we produce some great father-son teams.</para><para>One of my more enjoyable experiences in South Australian politics has been to have regular lunches with former South Australian federal members of parliament—something that I think we all should do more of. I think we all hope that perhaps we in this place will not be utterly forgotten. I certainly gained great value from a tradition of lunching with the likes of Jim Forbes, Sir Harold Young and, of course, John McLeay. Indeed, the last such lunch we had was last November, when John was clearly in ill health but was, despite that, his normal very feisty and opinionated self and not afraid to express his views about where the South Australian Liberal Party was going, where the government was going and, of course, what was wrong with the Labor Party, and was very keen to make sure we understood his views. It was a wonderful occasion. Of course, we had only some little time earlier lost Bert Kelly from that particular luncheon group: that was a great loss.</para><para>I am very sorry now to have lost John McLeay. He was a fine Australian, as shown by his record of service in the war as a gunner in New Guinea, as a businessman, as a city councillor and mayor, as a member of parliament and a minister and, of course, as Consul-General in Los Angeles. He was a great servant of both the parliament and the nation, and we will all miss him very much.

The National Party, which is supposed to be the late, great party defending the interests of rural Australians, is now stopping this debate from proceeding to a majority. Well, cold comfort, because back in the community, where you are answerable to your constituency, we will make it plain that National Party voters should be Labor Party voters at the next election if they want justice on fuel prices. Despite the fact that the National Farmers Federation has commended and supported the Labor Party in trying to block the 1 February indexation of fuel prices, the National Party, against the interests of its rural and farming constituency, supports higher prices for petrol in the bush. That issue is now beyond dispute, and I will refer back to this part of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to prove what I have said to your rural constituents, Senator Boswell, at the necessary time. </para></talk.start></continue><para>On 16 October last year—nearly four months ago—I put on notice 36 questions to the Minister representing the Treasurer in this place. If those 36 questions were answered, it would enable me, any other senator and, most importantly, any other Australian to work out how much extra tax the government has collected from Australians because of higher petrol prices. For almost four months those questions have sat on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> waiting for an answer, and over that time the government has not deemed it fit to reply. This is a government that waves around its charter of budget honesty. `Let's get the facts out on the table about election promises,' it says. It is a government which is gutless and unable to tell the electors of Australia how much tax they are paying because of higher petrol prices.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—They are hiding it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—They are hiding it; it is indeed a cover-up, Senator Sherry. We think Australians are entitled to know how much tax, and how much extra tax, the government has collected. In the absence of any official forecast, let me turn to what the Australian Automobile Association says the windfall is; that is, the amount of tax collected beyond what was predicted in the current budget. The Australian Automobile Association, which represents automobile associations in the states—the NRMA in New South Wales, the RACV in Victoria, the RACQ in Queensland, the RAA in South Australia, the RAC in Western Australia, and the automobile associations in Tasmania—estimates that the government has put its hand through the petrol bowser and into the pocket of Australian motorists to the tune of $1.34 billion a year. That, they say, is their best estimate of the windfall.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On 1 February this year, this government allowed an indexation of excise on petroleum to go ahead—an indexation valued at 1.56c per litre but, when you add the GST, in reality it is 1.72c per litre or $500 million extra tax payable by Australian motorists through the bowser per year. When you cite it as a litre amount, as the Prime Minister does, it does not sound so great, but when you cite it as a revenue haul to the government—half a billion dollars—it is a significant slug to Australian taxpayers. The government wants to pass it on; we want to stop it, and a few minutes ago I announced that tomorrow, in accordance with the standing orders, I will introduce a bill to do so. Those on the other side of this chamber who affect concern for Australian small business, which is struggling under a bleak outlook for the economy, the threat of recession, the BAS, and the cost weight of higher prices, will have a chance to provide relief for them. And those on the other side of this chamber who affect any concern for Australian families—who are running the kids to and from school, using the family car to go to and from work, and taking the annual motoring holiday in Australia—and for elderly Australians who are reliant on services delivered to their home because they are too frail to go out to hospital or other services, know that the costs of higher petroleum permeate the household budgets of all Australians and push them higher. </para><para>Those on the other side of this chamber who affect concern for country Australians should heed the words of the National Farmers Federation, which supports our bill. They should heed those words, because the GST is a percentage tax and prices in the country are higher than prices in the city. By the application of that tax, country Australians pay more tax than city Australians, and the gap is widening and worsening for country Australians. Those on the other side of the chamber who affect concern for the bush and for regional Australia are the ones who are taxing them more. The GST, applied to petrol, is a tax on distance. Country Australians fill up their tanks more often, travel further, do not have resort to public transport, and pay more taxes on their petrol as a consequence. What did Mr Howard say? Mr Howard, hand on heart in a scripted speech—not ad lib—with forethought and consideration, said, `The GST will not put up petrol prices.' Is that a promise he has kept? It is not, and one of the reasons why the government is now running scared in the regions is that country Australians know that petrol prices are higher under the GST than they were before and that the GST is to blame.</para><para>One of the other elements of the GST that is part of this hidden tax, and another reason why the bill I will introduce will kill the tax is this: from 1 July last year, the GST applied in Australia. On 1 February this year, the amount of excise the government charges motorists at the pump as its partake of petrol taxes rose by the amount of the CPI increase from 1 July last year to 31 December last year. So, for that six-month period, the GST price hike—the GST spike to inflation—is embedded in that CPI increase which applies on 1 February to petrol taxes, thereby starting an upward spiral of inflation based on the GST's impact on prices.</para><para>Last November in this chamber I moved that we set up an inquiry into petrol prices in Australia, and the Liberal and National parties, with the Democrats, voted it down. As a consequence, the Labor Party held their own inquiry. We have not completed it yet, but so far we have been to 34 centres around Australia and heard evidence from 180 different witnesses, many of whom could be described as heartland National Party and heartland Liberal Party voters. Having been exposed to that body of public opinion, I can tell you with some authority that the people of Australia—and particularly people in the bush—are hurting because of higher petrol prices. They do not regard the roads program as a substitute. The roads program is not a substitute.</para><para>The roads program is costed at $1.6 billion over four years. The amount of windfall gain, according to the Automobile Association, is $1.34 billion per year. If the roads program accurately handed back the windfall gain, the roads program would be worth in excess of $5 billion, not $1.6 billion. The mistake Mr Howard has made is to believe that $1.6 billion compensates for something that costs more than $5 billion. It does not. The people of Australia want lower petrol prices and a decent roads program. That is what the NFF says. That is what the Labor Party say. In 34 locations around Australia, that is what 180 witnesses have said to our inquiry as well. If you in government do not heed that voice, then at the ballot box you in government will become you in opposition. You are out of touch now. You have forgotten your base and you are punishing them with higher taxes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>21343</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Is it any wonder that we have seen this unconvincing little performance from Senator Cook?

I tried very hard to read the interview, but it was almost impossible to read because of some of the language. When asked whether he would take the GST off petrol, Mr Beazley said, `I don't think we would give that contemplation.' I am still trying to work out exactly what Mr Beazley meant. The Labor Party are in a state of complete confusion when it comes to the issue of petrol taxation. They have no idea what they want to do. All they are trying to do is to get some cheap political capital from trying to freeze a one-off indexation which protects their fuel excise—which they introduced in the first place and which was not part of Liberal Party policy. They put in place a policy of twice-yearly indexation, and they intend to keep it in place. There was no mention by Mr Beazley of removing the twice-yearly indexation, which was their policy, which they put in place and which they intend to keep in place. There was no mention by Mr Beazley of removing the twice-yearly indexation of fuel excise, adjusted to the CPI. There was no mention by Mr Beazley or Senator Cook of removing the GST component of the fuel taxation. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Labor Party are in a state of confusion. They are telling the government that it should cut petrol excise, but they refuse to commit themselves to a cut in excise as part of the Labor Party's policy. In other words, the Labor Party have a policy and a plan for what the Howard government should do, but they have absolutely no policy or no plan for what they would do in government. Mr Acting Deputy President, I can tell you what they would do: they would retain fuel excise. They would retain the twice-yearly indexation and they would retain the GST. This little stunt by Senator Cook of introducing a private member's bill is exactly that: a political stunt to try to curry some short-term political favour for their own advantage.</para><para>We need to remember when it comes to indexation that, as a one-off, the indexation on 1 February was a four per cent CPI rate—much lower than the anticipated CPI impact. While the Labor Party were in office for 13 years they had 23 indexations of fuel excise. Of those 23, seven were greater than four per cent. Did the Labor Party freeze it? Did they offer any compensation to those people in far-flung Australia Senator Cook says are going to be impacted so much by this four per cent increase? In August 1983, they had a 4.3 per cent indexation and in February 1987 they had a 5.6 per cent indexation. Was there any thought of compensation for country people? Not one little bit. When the Keating government was in power it increased petrol excise by 5c a litre and the wholesale sales tax by two per cent across the board, and there was no attempt whatsoever to remove those tax rises from the CPI for the purpose of calculating excise indexation. So I repeat: the Labor Party have no intention of cutting the excise, no intention of rolling back the GST on petrol if they get into government and no intention of abolishing fuel excise.</para><para>The best way to minimise excise indexation is to have low inflation. Under this government, the inflation average has been under three per cent for the whole period of this government. For the whole of the time that Labor were in government, inflation averaged twice as much as that—it averaged six per cent. That had a far greater effect on the price of petrol than anything that this government has done since 1996, including the impact of the GST. Labor ran inflation at an average of six per cent, and every time there was a rise in the fuel excise rate because of a CPI indexation it went up on average by twice as much percentage wise compared to what has happened since the coalition came into government. Did Senator Cook address any of those issues? When he visited all of these country areas during his own little inquiry into petrol pricing did he say to all those people, `I'm from the Labor Party'?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—Did he say, `I introduced fuel excise. I was a member of the Labor government. I introduced a fuel excise and that is why you pay a fuel excise today'? Did Senator Cook say to these people, `Not only did I introduce the fuel excise, but I made sure that it had a CPI indexation twice every year'? Did Senator Cook and his committee say to these people—this heartland of National Party and Liberal Party people—`I'm from the Labor Party. I introduced the fuel excise and I also made sure that twice every year you had an indexation. Because as a government we were unable to control inflation—we had an inflation average more than twice that of the current coalition government—we made sure that your fuel excise increases were at a greater rate than the current  government'? Did he also say, `I'm from the Labor Party and I now support a GST. We are not going to remove the GST component. I support twice-yearly indexation and I support the introduction of the fuel excise because I was part of a government that introduced it'?</para></talk.start></continue><para>If the Labor Party are going to be genuine with rural Australia, they need to make sure they state all of those facts every time they have a hearing and take evidence. There is no point in just seeking short-term political popularity by saying that, because the inflation rate is four per cent this time—bearing in mind that when they were in government they had seven occasions when it was greater than four per cent but no compensation and no freeze—they want a one-off and once-only freeze. The Labor Party of Australia have to come clean with the Australian people and tell them what their policy would be if they were ever elected to government; otherwise, anything they say in this area cannot be believed and any way they try to gain any short-term benefit politically will be seen by those people as the Labor Party trying to convince them that they are acting in their interest. The coalition government has not changed any provisions dealing with indexation. The indexation on fuel excise was done under Labor's legislation. This coalition government has not in any way changed fuel indexation. </para><para>Mr Beazley went on in the interview to say—and it was almost unintelligible—`If you want to take the excise off petrol then you need to nominate which school you are going to close.' Have you ever heard a more ridiculous statement? In other words, the funding of schools is directly related to whether or not we take the excise off fuel. So, if you take the excise off petrol, you need to nominate which schools you are going to close. The simple fact is that Labor have no intention of cutting the excise, because they are going to need more and more money for all of their big spending promises. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>21345</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats join with the opposition in debating this matter of urgency. I must say that it is regrettable that the government would not allow the amendment to the motion. We think this is important, but there are more important issues to consider when we look at the price of petrol. The Prime Minister said very clearly that the GST itself would not be the cause of any increase in the cost of petrol; yet last July the government increased taxes on petrol by 1½c a litre. That was a breach of a direct election promise that petrol would not rise as a result of the GST. We said at the time that it was a broken promise and a promise that should have been honoured. It is true that oil companies will probably achieve cost savings from tax reform over the next few years and 1.5c a litre could have been clawed back, but that is not going to happen overnight. </para></talk.start><para>The Democrats agree with the Prime Minister that this 1.5c a litre is very small compared with the increases in petrol prices of 20c a litre and more that have been due to the price of a barrel of oil, over which Australia has little control. In fact, this 1.5c a litre works out to be less than 50c a week, about $20 a year, for the average motorist. But, as I said, a promise is a promise and the Democrats did warn some time ago that an adjustment to the excise arrangements would need to be made. Of course the ALP introduced an import parity pricing policy for crude oil discovered after 1975. They did that to encourage the exploration for, and development of, Australian crude oil, as well as to have a handy mechanism for attracting more government revenue. The ALP introduced the indexation arrangements on excise that, on 1 February, added another 1.7c a litre to fuel costs; Labor did not discount the indexation when they increased petrol taxes in 1993. The Democrats do not want to criticise that measure, but it is important to get it on the record just in case Labor might be using this debate to suggest they have always been in there defending the interests of the little Aussie motorist battler.</para><para>I do not want to downplay the importance of affordable fuel prices to people on low incomes or to those who must travel long distances on a regular basis. For those people, increasing petrol costs are a very serious drain on their budget and there is real hardship being felt, particularly in rural areas. The Democrats are acutely aware that people on low incomes cannot afford the latest, most fuel efficient vehicles, and in many cases cannot even maintain their vehicles, which, of course, can deliver significant fuel efficiencies. The problem is that this government, and the Labor government before it, has still not heeded the warnings about the need to reduce the consumption of petrol and other petroleum products. Not only will we have to do this in a greenhouse gas constrained environment; there is not an endless supply of oil reserves. This is presumably why we are digging up shale adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area in order to crush and to extract the oil. That is a very expensive and greenhouse intensive process.</para><para>Other countries have used government policy and legislation to encourage smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles, better public transport and alternative fuels. We have largely ignored those opportunities in this country. Anyone who has travelled to Europe or the UK in recent times will be struck by the absence of large cars. Yet we are still producing them here, still driving them and, of course, the huge increase in the number of four-wheel drive vehicles on the road is taking us in completely the wrong direction in this respect. Australia has a 20 per cent higher use of fuel per capita than other OECD countries because our reliance on motor vehicle transport, both for passengers and freight, is too high, and this is even the case for urban travel. So we cannot find an excuse for ourselves on the basis of distance. Ninety-two per cent of urban passenger transport is undertaken by motor vehicle, and car kilometres travelled in Australia doubled between 1975 and 1995. There are good reasons for Australia reducing its use of oil and finding local alternatives such as natural gas. Only 40 per cent of Australia's oil consumption is sourced locally and it is estimated that, by 2010, Australia will be producing less than a quarter of the current production here. Oil imports could add an extra $4 billion to Australia's current account deficit by 2010.</para><para>The Democrats asked the ALP to amend this motion because we recognise that there is an urgent need for governments to develop much more comprehensive, integrated answers to the problem of increasing petrol costs. The National Greenhouse Strategy says that efficient transport and sustainable urban planning are a major priority for the government and that the government seeks to promote an integrated, best practice approach to transport. These are fine words but we have not actually seen much action on the ground to achieve that best practice. About the only transport related moves have all come out of the tax package as a result of Democrat initiatives and negotiations such as fuel emission standards, gas conversion, alternative fuels grants and the removal of excise for rail and the like. I encourage the government to take a look at the Senate environment committee's report on Australia's greenhouse future. There are numerous recommendations in that report that would not only assist in meeting our Kyoto and National Greenhouse Strategy commitments but also reduce transport costs for all Australians. One point that I would like to draw on is the fact that this would cost taxpayers very little. In fact it would deliver considerable savings.</para><para>Every year in Australia around 90,000 vehicles are purchased by governments for their own fleets. Apart from a small number of LPG vehicles, all are petrol vehicles and the vast majority are, I understand, six-cylinder vehicles. There are no incentives for public servants or parliamentarians to drive small cars or cars that run on alternative fuels. Both the car and the petrol are publicly funded, so fuel efficiency is not an issue. Add to that the large fleet of corporate vehicles on the road whose drivers are similarly not personally affected by fuel costs and you have a very large number of vehicles indeed making up the total number of cars on the road that use more fuel than they should. The greenhouse report suggests that we use tax laws to build in those incentives. It also recommended that rail and public transport should be better funded, that there should be a pool of transport funding and that road and other forms of transport should compete on criteria that are transparent and give the best outcome for the environment.</para><para>But there is another way which could provide an Australian car fleet with cars that are much cheaper to run. CSIRO, in association with Holden, produced the prototype ECOmmodore—a hybrid electric-petrol vehicle that runs on 50 per cent of the petrol that a conventional Commodore uses. It uses a small four-cylinder engine and an electric motor to drive the front wheels. These power sources work in tandem to attain performance levels comparable to those of the current Commodore. The CSIRO was also part of a consortium of 100 Australian companies that developed the hybrid aXcessaustralia concept car, which would produce 10 per cent of the emissions of the average car while reducing fuel consumption by half. Toyota's Prius is also a hybrid car with similar cost savings. None of these vehicles will be made available in Australia in the foreseeable future, in spite of the fact that, as I understand it, Holden could have its ECOmmodore on the production line within a few months and with a relatively small outlay. The reason these hybrid cars are not available to motorists is that there is no incentive in place. The technology is known; we could manufacture them in Australia.</para><para>The Democrats would like to see the Australian government using their buying power—that is, in connection with their 90,000 vehicles every year—to provide that incentive. Taxpayers would save in reduced fuel costs, the small extra cost of the vehicles would be retrieved in their resale after three years, and there are simply no losers in this proposal. Over time this would provide Australians with a considerable fleet of vehicles running on half as much fuel, as well as with the choice that motorists would make. Government fleets could also be converted to natural gas. My new electorate car runs on natural gas, and I would encourage all senators and members to consider making this their choice next time they need to change their car. It is time for us all to be looking at alternatives to petrol. Petrol is getting more costly, with or without the 1.5c per litre excise increase.</para><para>It is our view that is it is time for governments to show leadership on this issue. There are very many useful steps that can be taken both to reduce the costs of transport in the medium and long term and to reduce our reliance on petroleum products.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>21347</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I cannot really let some of Senator Ferguson's comments go. It is a shame that he has left the chamber and is not here to hear the entirety of the debate, particularly given that he is from South Australia and a part of South Australia which is very much regional—in fact, rural. But there was one thing that Senator Ferguson did not tell us; he did not talk about the federal government's promise, the promise that John Howard made. We are signalling here today that we are going to try to fix up not our mess, not the Labor Party's mess, but the coalition's mess. That is what we are here to do.</para></talk.start><para>Obviously the whole situation with regard to petrol, from our perspective—but, more importantly, far more importantly, from the perspective of regional Australians and people who live in rural communities—is this: it is yet another broken promise from this government. The Prime Minister made that promise on 13 August 1998. In his address to the nation—it was not just any old interview; it was actually an address to the nation—he said, `The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.' When he said that, he was obviously giving a non-core promise. A non-core promise: that is a phrase which has gone into the everyday language of Australians. Often—and other senators probably have this same experience—you hear people talking and using the phrase `core and non-core'. Mr Howard may go down in history as the great inventor of the phrase: is that core or non-core? So we have a situation here where, in an address to the nation—not just any old media interview—scripted and well prepared, he made that promise.</para><para>Twice this promise has been broken: the first time when the government failed to deliver on its pledge from the Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, to cut excise by `an amount equivalent to the GST'; and now by signalling its intention not to support the Labor Party's private member's bill to waive the 1 February indexation that has added another 1.7c per litre to the price at the pump. This latest increase is quite out of the ordinary. It is three times the normal indexation average and the highest since 1983.</para><para>The Labor Party in 13 years of government did not pass on an excise increase several times, depending on the circumstances. In fact, there was at least one occasion when we did not do that. We put our money where our mouth was. We did not even introduce the GST.

Despite the Senate's refusal to agree to the Labor Party's petrol inquiry—and two of my colleagues, both Labor senators who are here in the chamber at present were involved in that process—I have to say that I personally found the exercise and listening to the evidence from witnesses very distressing and I have to say particularly in Queensland. Some of the stories we heard were very distressing. We heard stories which I very much remember in, for example, Rockhampton, of truck drivers who were driving more than 100 hours a week in order to try and keep up with costs in terms of repayments on their rigs. We had stories of the Meals on Wheels organisations in regional Queensland that simply could not get people to volunteer to deliver meals, because of the cost of petrol. This is not what we are saying; this is not what the Labor Party is making up: this is what the people of Queensland told us in relation to petrol. We said to them quite up-front—and this is to Senator Mason, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—`Our proposal will only reduce the price of petrol by around 2c; do you think that's enough? Is it worth undertaking this exercise?' They said yes. I came out and was very direct with people—and they said yes. I said, `Well, John Howard doesn't.' He is okay on the price of milk.

If you live in the back of Queensland, as a number of the people we spoke to do, and you drive two and three hours routinely to take your kids to sport, 2c a litre is a lot of money. This is something that is facing average Australians, and regional Australians in particular, every single day of their lives, and I challenge not just simply the 12 who have actually had the guts to come and say something but some of the senators in here to consider what is happening in regional Australia, to vote with their hearts, and to cross the floor and support the Labor Party's private member's bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>21349</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—After being in politics for something like 18 years—I am in my 19th year at the moment—you expect hypocrisy in this house, but today takes the cake.

That is the great vision of the ALP; that is the big picture of the ALP; we are going to save 1c a litre. This urgency motion should have never even got up, because your own leader emasculated it yesterday on 3AW when he said that a Labor Party government would not remove fuel excise, nor would it remove the GST on fuel, nor would it remove the indexation on fuel. And then, when he got into a very hard debate with the radio commentator, he said, `If you took the excise off fuel, what particular school would you like me to close?' Your motion today falls to the floor because your leader does not even support it; that is how ridiculous it is. We are debating 1c a litre. The price of fuel goes up and down. In Queensland, where there is no tax on fuel, it can fluctuate by between 15c and 12c. It can even fluctuate by 5c a day: it can be 5c lower in the afternoon than in the morning. So 1c a litre, while it is important, is not the end of the world.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This government has put $1.6 billion into roads—jobs will be created and the roads will be there forever. That is what this government has done. So you go out there with your mates who are running your Labor Party committee and, no doubt, ring up the local branch of the ALP and say, `Listen, we have a troop coming into town tomorrow. Provide us with a few witnesses.' Of course they will provide you with a few witnesses, and that is what they have done. The ALP committee going out there to investigate petrol prices is just unbelievable.</para><para>The hypocrisy of the situation is this: a year ago this parliament had a discussion on fuel, and we discussed a 6.7c litre reduction and a 17c litre reduction on fuel for heavy vehicles, that is, a 24c litre reduction for fuel going into trucks that service rural and regional Australia and trucks that transport cattle. And where were you people when we wanted to reduce the price of fuel by 24c a litre? You voted against it. You voted against a 6.7c reduction, and then you followed it up and voted against a 17c reduction on heavy fuel. And then you have the rank hypocrisy to come into this place and argue about 1c when you rejected a 24c litre reduction. Do you expect people to support you when you do those sorts of things? You are an absolutely policy-lazy opposition, and you will remain in opposition for many years, because what is your policy on this? You are going to continue with the excise on fuel; you are going to continue with the indexation; you are going to continue with the policy of the GST. You are arguing that we failed to reduce petrol prices by 1c a litre, but in fact you voted against a 24c a litre discount on fuel for heavy transport. Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask you: what validity does this motion carry? It carries absolutely none. Even the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has said that he would not remove fuel indexation, nor would he remove the GST on fuel, nor would he remove the excise on fuel.</para><para>Opposed to that, the Liberal-National Party government has put in $500 million to equalise fuel prices between the cities and rural Australia. If it had been up to us, there would have been discounts on fuel for quarrying, for building, for mining—all these sorts of things—but you rejected that. So don't you come in here crying crocodile tears that we are not going to support a reduction of 1c when you refused a reduction of 24c. If you can sell that message to rural Australia, you will be the greatest salesmen of all time.

And for those attempting to understand his somewhat rambling contribution, it was a series of excuses as to why the National Party stands for higher fuel prices in this country—that is effectively what Senator Boswell was arguing. Also, at the beginning of this debate, Senator Boswell refused leave for the Australian Democrats to amend the motion that we are considering, because Senator Boswell and the National Party are petrified about the issue of high fuel prices as it impacts on the people they supposedly represent in rural and regional Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The nub of the issue, the central issue we are dealing with here today, is the promise Mr Howard made as Prime Minister, as leader of the Liberal-National Party government, that petrol prices would not increase as a result of the GST. That was the commitment that Mr Howard gave in the run-up to the last election. He has broken the commitment, and broken it by considerably more than the 1c a litre that Senator Boswell claims is the increase. It is interesting that Senator Boswell actually admits that Mr Howard has broken his promise, but he fobs it off by saying, `Well, it is only 1c a litre.' It is more than 1c a litre.</para><para>I will explain how much Mr Howard has broken his promise to the Australian people that fuel prices would not go up as a result of the GST and I am going to quote figures not from members of the Australian Labor Party but from the Australian Automobile Association, which has been critical of the Australian Labor Party in the past. The Australian Automobile Association says in its latest publication that since July last year, when the GST was introduced, the Commonwealth fuel excise has risen by 3.6c directly as a consequence of the GST, with rises that included the 1.5c in July last year and then a further 1.1c on 1 February as a result of the latest indexation increase. And the reason that that indexation increase is important is because the considerable majority of the inflation increase in the last quarter resulted from the GST. So the total, Senator Boswell, is not 1c; it is actually 2.6c, on average.</para><para>Senator Boswell talked about some sort of equalisation fund. Down in Tassie where I live, on the north-west coast of Tasmania, fuel prices are close to $1 a litre, Senator Boswell. Yet, with your so-called equalisation fund, in Sydney and Melbourne apparently fuel prices are 10c to 12c lower. I do not know what your equalisation fund is doing but we have not seen any narrowing of the differential in fuel prices in Tasmania.</para><para>The point I make is that it is at least 2.6c a litre higher. In rural and regional areas of Australia, which Senator Boswell and the National Party supposedly represent, it is higher because the base price of fuel is higher and the GST, being a percentage tax, actually imposes a greater burden than 2.6c a litre. In addition, you would think Senator Boswell and the National Party would care about people in rural and regional Australia, because fuel prices there are not just higher but the people who live there drive further. Secondly, public transport, if they have got it, is fairly limited. Where I live, on the north-west coast of Tasmania, the majority of people have no access to public transport. Thirdly, incomes are lower in rural and regional Australia. So the impact in rural and regional Australia of higher fuel prices resulting from the GST is quite devastating.</para><para>What do the National Party do about it? Absolutely nothing. What is very important—and they do not mention this in the debate—is that when the Labor Party was in government it did discount the excise where special circumstances warranted it. The government is fond of saying 23 occasions. On one occasion it did discount it as a result of special circumstances. I cannot think of a better reason as a result of the last inflation increase which was driven by the GST why that $1 billion should not be returned to the Australian people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>21351</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Cook certainly has courage.

So for the Australian Labor Party to get up and say, `We are going to cut taxes,' goes against their philosophy and Senator Cook's greatest contribution to the life of the Australian nation.</para></talk.start><para>This is an important issue. Fuel prices are hurting. Senator Sherry and Senator Mackay are right: in Queensland, where I come from, it is a big issue. The fact is that fuel prices at the pump are set by world parity pricing, the world price of crude oil and the strong American dollar. That's what sets the price of petrol at the pump.</para><para>This is a cheap display of political opportunism and populism by the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party opposed taxation reform because they thought they could win a few cheap votes. That is why they opposed it when they knew taxation reform was necessary. They opposed taxation reform and supported the retention of the wholesale sales tax policy, when they knew it was the appropriate policy for the Australian people. For 20 years, we had a debate about it in this country and, when it came to the crunch, they squibbed.</para><para>Here again we have an issue on which the Australian Labor Party are trying to make a cheap point. Mr Beazley has had five years to work out a policy platform and a policy direction for the Australian Labor Party and he has come up with nothing. His motley crew, the Right of the ALP, the soulless, believe in nothing. The Left believe in everything, but everything they believe in is wrong. The Centre Left, which I think is where Senator Cook comes from, that rare bird of paradise which I understand is nearly extinct, has the cherry pickers or the management consultants of Labor. At best, Labor at the moment are a cheap, poor, anaemic reflection of the Liberal Party. They stand for nothing.</para><para>When I joined the Liberal Party back in the 1980s, we were in opposition. We were in opposition for a while, but no-one ever said that we stood for nothing. We always stood for one hell of a lot, and we changed the policy direction in this country—so much so that 20 years later even people on the Left like Senator Bolkus now adopt the policies that we fought for. That is the greatest thing we did. After five years the Labor Party still stand for nothing. They are a cheap and anaemic reflection of the Liberal Party, standing for absolutely nothing.</para><para>I want to go to a bit of history. Senator Sherry spoke about the Labor Party's performance on petrol when they were in office. Let us go back to 1983. When Labor came into office in 1983, petrol excise was 6.155c per litre. Thirteen years later, when they left office, excise was 35c per litre—an increase of 28c or 450 per cent. Labor introduced indexation in 1983, and not once during their term did Labor compensate motorists for their consumer price indexation increase or their discretionary increases in fuel excise. The thing about the Labor Party is that you do not listen to what they say—they say a lot of things; you do not listen to what Senator Cook or Senator Sherry says—but you remember what they did. </para><para>When they were in office, the CPI increase on petrol was 450 per cent. In contrast with the Liberal Party and this government, on five occasions during their term in office Labor legislated to increase the petrol excise over and above the consumer price index to raise more money, to raise more taxes. Yet Senator Cook says, `We'll take the tax off.' No Australian listening today believes the Labor Party will take off taxes. The Labor Party do not take taxes off. Labor have opposed all the measures, as Senator Boswell said, introduced by the government to help keep fuel prices down. That is what Labor have done. It is not what they say; it is what they have done. They have even opposed our attempts to introduce more competition into the petrol industry, which would have benefited motorists.</para><para>If Labor had succeeded in voting down taxation reform and fuel concessions, firstly, petrol would be around 10 per cent more expensive for farm and other businesses. Secondly, as my friend Senator Boswell said, diesel would be around 24c a litre more expensive for heavy vehicles. Thirdly, diesel would be taxed at around 44c more for rail and for marine transport. It is important to note this: the Commonwealth government, the coalition government, does not benefit from higher petrol prices. The excise rate stays the same. Regardless of whether the retail price is, for example, 90c, $1 or $1.50, the excise remains the same—at 39c per litre. The indexation of the petrol excise does not provide a windfall to the Commonwealth government. In fact, for every dollar of extra revenue raised through indexing excise, around $2.40 is paid out through higher pensions and other government allowances also linked to indexing.</para><para>The point here is clear. Remember what the ALP did when they were in government: not only did they land this country with a $10 billion deficit in their last year in office but there was debt of $80 billion over their last 10 years. Remember what they did on petrol. They raised excise phenomenally—450 per cent during the life of the Labor government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cook's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:09:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.[ </para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

The Program also included a commitment to ensuring that the Corporations Law is user friendly.  The <inline font-style="italic">Company Law Review Act 1998</inline> began that work.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Company Law Review Act 1998</inline> has also improved the efficiency of corporate regulation, and reduced the regulatory burdens on business and other users of the Corporations Law.  The Government considers that the Act has brought substantial benefits for both small and large business.  This has been confirmed by the strong support from the business community for the Act.</para><para>The Act rewrote and improved the core company law rules regarding registering companies, meetings, share capital, financial reporting, annual returns, deregistration of defunct companies and company names, with a view to facilitating business and investment.</para><para>The proposed reforms in the Company Law Review Bill 1997 were exposed for public comment in 1995.  In June 1996 the Government referred the draft Bill to the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities (PJSC).  This provided an additional opportunity for input by users of the Corporations Law.  The PJSC's Report was tabled in the Senate on 18 November 1996.  The PJSC expressed its approval for the general content of the Bill, and made 11 specific recommendations that the Government addressed separately.</para><para>As a result of public consideration, a number of significant changes were made to the Bill by the Government following its consideration by the PJSC in 1996.  However, a number of amendments to the Corporations Law were moved by the Senate during the passage of the Bill, without the benefit of public consultation and analysis by stakeholders.  The Government wished to ensure that amendments passed in this fashion were subjected to public scrutiny and therefore referred the amendments to the PJSC.  </para><para>Accordingly, the reference for the PJSC to examine certain matters arising from the passage of the <inline font-style="italic">Company Law Review Act 1998</inline> was given by the Treasurer, the Hon Peter Costello MP, in July 1998.

The proposed amendment was unsuccessful, and the Government indicated its opposition to the proposal when referring the matter to the PJSC.</para><para>The Corporations Law does not currently mandate any particular form of voting for the election of directors.  That is, companies are generally free to choose voting methods they consider appropriate, with the constitution making provision for the appointment of directors.  Constitutions often provide for the power to appoint directors to be exercised by the general meeting, and boards may be able to make appointments to fill casual vacancies or to bring the numbers of the board up to the maximum allowed by the constitution.  Some companies may rely on the replaceable rules in the Corporations Law, which allow a company to appoint a person as a director by resolution passed in general meeting (replaceable rule, section 201G) unless the company's constitution provides otherwise.  In addition, directors may appoint other directors, subject to confirmation by resolution (replaceable rule, section 201H). </para><para>There are other provisions in the Corporations Law and the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) Listing Rules that affect the election of directors, but generally companies are free to choose the method of voting that suits them. </para><para>A common system adopted by companies in Australia allows each member to cast one vote per share for a candidate for each vacancy to be filled, so that a bare majority of shares is able to elect the board.  In contrast, the system of proportional voting suggested by the Australian Democrats would allow the number of shares held by a member to be multiplied by the number of vacancies (sometimes known as cumulative voting).  The members may then cast their votes among the candidates for directorships as they think fit.  It is one method that could be used to ensure minority representation on the board.</para><para>The Government notes that should a listed company wish to adopt a system of proportional (or cumulative) voting, a waiver of the ASX Listing Rule of one vote per share would be required (ASX Listing Rule 6.9).</para><para>In its Report, the PJSC has indicated that:</para></quote><para>·	The current state of the Law is preferable, where companies themselves decide on the form of the election.  The members of a company may decide if they wish to adopt any form of proportional representation, including cumulative voting, but there should be no compulsion in the Corporations Law for members to vote on a particular system;</para><para>·	Proportional representation has the potential to affect the essential unity and cohesion of a board, with the possibility of factions and dissidents.  Elections for directors are not comparable to those for Parliamentarians;</para><para>·	Proportional voting may be impractical and counter productive.  It strikes at the principle that directors should be generally representative of those with the greatest financial interest in the company, a position usually achieved by electing directors by an absolute majority of members voting;</para><para>·	Proportional representation may affect consumer confidence and have adverse economic effects;</para><para>·	Although proportional representation would increase minority representation on boards, its mandatory or irrevocable introduction would have disadvantages easily outweighing any benefits;</para><para>·	Where there is a perception of unfairness when members vote one by one for directors in cases where there are more candidates than vacancies, the problem could be addressed by any suitable voting system, not necessarily proportional or cumulative;</para><para>·	There is considerable merit in the ASX and the Australian and Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) encouraging education and publicity campaigns with the object of making companies aware of the different voting procedures that are available and may be suitable for the individual circumstances of the company.  This could be a matter for consideration when companies are revising their constitutions.

The greater the number of vacancies, the higher the possibility of minority shareholders securing some representation by focusing their multiple votes on the same one or few candidates.  By contrast, under non-cumulative voting, a majority shareholder, or a majority group of shareholders who vote, could determine all positions of the board.

The Corporations Law makes no reference to whether proxy voting details can or should be disclosed prior to commencement of the debate at a meeting.  Subsection 250J(1A) only requires disclosure before the vote is taken.  CASAC has done an analysis of the arguments for and against disclosure prior to the debate but has not indicated a view on section 250J(1A) in its Final Report.  However, in its Discussion Paper (<inline font-style="italic">Shareholder participation in the modern listed public company</inline>, September 1999), CASAC indicated that the information required to be disclosed under section 250J(1A) is, in any case, inherently unreliable (paragraph 4.36 of the Discussion Paper).  </para><para>Section 250J(1A) provides (as a replaceable rule) that a chair must disclose, before any vote is taken, whether any proxy votes have been received and how they are to be cast.  CASAC's view in its Discussion Paper is that the provision is based upon the assumption that proxies are required to vote the shares according to the terms of the proxy.  Proxies (other than the chair) are not required to vote and directions on voting in a proxy form may quite legally not be followed by the proxy.

In the Government's view, the substitution of the word “could” does not assist the interpretation of the provision, as an earlier and a later appointment can, in certain circumstances, both be validly exercised.  Where a later and an earlier appointment cannot both be validly exercised, section 250A(7) ensures the validity of the later appointment is assumed by the Corporations Law to reflect the appointer's current thinking.</para><para>An example of a situation where both an earlier and a later appointment can be validly exercised is where a shareholder appoints one proxy and then later appoints a second joint proxy.  The appointing shareholder wants the second proxy to be able to exercise half his votes (or any proportion that the shareholder indicates) at the same time as the first proxy is exercising the remainder of the votes.  Where the second appointment does not specify the proportional number of votes that the proxy may exercise, each proxy is able to exercise half the votes (subsection 249X(3), which is a replaceable rule for proprietary companies only).

CASAC has recommended that the 100 member test should be abolished for listed public companies, stating that only shareholders whom collectively have at least 5% of the votes that may be cast at a general meeting should have the power to requisition a general meeting of a listed public company (CASAC Recommendation 2, page 15 of the Final Report). </para><para>The PJSC has concluded that:</para></quote><para>·	The present provision for 100 members to requisition a meeting of the company is inappropriate and open to abuse;</para><quote><para>Currently 100 members who together may hold only a tiny economic interest in a company and be only a miniscule proportion of the company's numbers, may require the company to hold a special meeting, with the costs to be met by the company itself.  The company is also disadvantaged by its directors and managers being diverted from their core functions;</para><para>Section 249Q is not a safeguard against abuse of the requisition power.  It appears that a proper purpose is any matter that is within the competence of the general meeting, and it would be easy to draft a requisition in those terms;</para></quote><para>·	On making the present numerical test a replaceable rule, the PJSC endorses CASAC's preliminary view that requisitioning a meeting is a significant matter of corporate governance, for which a uniform rule is appropriate;</para><para>·	The sole test for requisition of a special meeting should be an issued share capital threshold, which must be met collectively by the requisitioning members;</para><quote><para>The numerical shareholder test or any variation of that is unsatisfactory because such tests do not overcome the basic difficulty that a group of members with an insignificant economic stake in the company may put the company and the other shareholders to the expense and inconvenience of a meeting;</para></quote><para>·	The test of a minimum proportion of issued share capital to be met by requisitioning members is preferable not only as a matter of principle but also for administration reasons - it is simpler to administer and more transparent.  If requisitioning members cannot cross a 5% shareholding threshold, there must be serious doubts their resolution would succeed;</para><para>·	A 5% issued share capital test would be reasonable, given CASAC research that this is compatible with overseas practice;</para><para>·	Large mutual companies such as the NRMA are in a special position and may need different provisions.</para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">PJSC recommendation</inline></para><para>The PJSC recommends that the Corporations Law be amended to provide that the sole test to requisition a special meeting of a company is 5% of the issued share capital to be met collectively by the requisitioning members.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government response</inline></para><para>The Government is a strong supporter of share ownership and shareholder democracy.  However, there must be a balance: companies should not be unnecessarily distracted from the business of wealth creation.</para><para>Without limiting individual shareholder rights the Government is concerned that companies are free to get on with the business of maximising wealth.  The Government believes that companies should not be unreasonably subjected to the substantial cost of conducting a general meeting.  In most cases the current 100 member test is too low, especially for the most traded listed companies (for example, in two recent cases members representing 121 and 166 (or 0.045% and 0.005% of shareholders funds) members sought to requisition a general meeting of members.</para><para>To address the concerns with the 100 member threshold, the Government has developed an alternative proposal to determine the number of members required to requisition a members' meeting under section 249D of the Corporations Law.  However, the Government does not propose to alter the existing rules regarding shareholders' resolutions and statements through the shareholder proposal process.</para><para>The Government proposes to replace the existing 100 member test (section 249D(1)(b)) with a new `square-root' rule.  Under the proposal, the number of members required to call a company meeting would be the square root of the total number of members of the company who are entitled to vote at a meeting.  The proposal involves retaining the proper purpose test currently in the Corporations Law (section 249Q) as well as the 5% of votes that may be cast at the annual general meeting rule (the “5% rule” (section 249D(1)(a)).  </para><para>In contrast to the existing 100 member rule which is fixed arbitrarily, under the square root proposal, the number of members will be proportionate to the size of the company's member base.  It is a fair, objective and simple formulation that links the required number of shareholders with the size of the company's shareholder base, but without sacrificing shareholder democracy.  For instance, in the case of a company with a shareholder base exceeding 1 million members, the square root rule would require 1000 members (at least) to call a company meeting.  For smaller companies, the number of shareholders required would decline proportionately.</para><para>The retention of the proper purpose test will continue to provide a safeguard against meetings being called for vexatious, frivolous or irrelevant purposes, while the retention of the 5% rule will continue to allow holders of substantial parcels of shares to call meetings.</para><para>At this time, the Government does not propose to include a specific mechanism to exclude persons who have become members solely for the purpose of joining in the requisitioning of a meeting (for example, by acquiring a small number of shares).  However, if evidence of abuse becomes apparent then the Government would need to consider measures to disqualify certain shareholders from the ability to join in the requisitioning of a meeting.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Alternatives</inline></para><para>There have been numerous alternatives considered including the removal of the existing 100 member threshold and retaining as the sole test members holding 5% of the voting shares as recommended by CASAC.  This test would be in line with the position in the major capital markets overseas.  However, the Government considers that this test proposes a threshold that is too high in a market that increasingly contains a material proportion of retail investors.</para><para>Another suggestion has been the retention of the current 100 member test modified with the additional requirement that each requisitioning shareholder has a minimum shareholding that has a minimum average market value.  CASAC considers that requisitioning shareholders should have a minimum economic interest in the company, but considered it would be more directly and uniformly achieved through the issued share capital test (para 2.21, page 14 of CASAC's Final Report).</para><para>The Government recognises the merit of a minimum economic requirement policy, but considers that there are also some serious limitations.  A minimum economic requirement would require a requisitioning shareholder to hold shares with an average market value of a certain amount at the time of requisition.  If shareholders were, for example, seeking to requisition a meeting because of a falling share price, potential requisitionists may be required to increase their shareholding in order to qualify.  Requisitionists may be reluctant to “throw good money after bad”.</para><para>A further difficulty with a minimum economic requirement test is that it could not easily apply to companies with non-standard capital and voting shares (for example, such a test could not apply to mutual organisations, where the members have a single nominal value share).  Such a test would require modification to cater for non-standard companies.  There are a very large number of companies that do not have all of their shares quoted, so a test based on market value would necessarily be complex and could involve a difficult and potentially expensive valuation exercise.       </para><para>In conclusion, the Government believes that the square root test strikes the appropriate balance between shareholders rights to call a company meeting in extraordinary circumstances, while lessening the potential for abuse of such a right.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government Proposal</inline></para><para>The Government proposes the following model to replace the current 100 member test contained in section 249D(1)(b):</para></quote><para>·	The Corporations Law would continue to require that a meeting be held for a proper purpose.

Business Australia (IBA) by expanding the functions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation (CDC).</para><para>The Bill reflects the government's commitment to increasing opportunities for indigenous Australians to participate in commercial development.  Participation in business enables more indigenous Australians to escape the cycle of welfare dependency and provides opportunities for employment and the creation of wealth and capital to generate further economic development opportunities.</para><para>In March 1998 the government released a Discussion Paper, `Removing the Welfare Shackles', proposing the establishment of IBA to rationalise existing programmes. A commitment to establish IBA was given in the September 1998 Coalition election statement “Beyond Welfare” and reaffirmed in the 1999 budget statement “A Better Future for Indigenous Australians”.  </para><para>The government is committed to ensuring that outcomes from indigenous business support programmes are optimised.    Accordingly, the government is commissioning an independent review of indigenous business programmes to recommend mechanisms for the most appropriate and effective delivery of such programmes. </para><para>The Bill is also designed to improve current services and contains three key aspects.</para><para>The first aspect is changing the name of the CDC to IBA.  The establishment of a new organisation, with a new name, will provide an opportunity to re-focus business client expectations on commercial objectives clearly differentiated from the broad social and economic objectives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC).</para><para>The second aspect is expressly allowing ATSIC to outsource its commercial functions.   ATSIC will be enabled to use IBA or other organisations to deliver its commercial services, such as the provision of loans, to indigenous businesses.  These changes are designed to encourage a shift in culture surrounding indigenous business support and, in particular, to help bring the public and private sector closer to an effective partnership.</para><para>The final aspect provides the option of appointing a full-time Chairperson to IBA.  Currently the Chairperson of the CDC is appointed on a part time basis.  The option to appoint a full time Chairperson is in recognition of the significant role that IBA will play in stimulating the economic advancement of indigenous Australians and will help to ensure that IBA can maintain and expand the successful joint venture arrangements the CDC has established with a wide range of Australian companies.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to say that an important means for addressing indigenous employment and economic disadvantage is to promote growth in indigenous business.

The intention at the time was to have a single independent tribunal dealing with appeals against administrative decisions across as wide a spectrum of Commonwealth activity as possible.  Despite this intention, a number of specialist federal merits review tribunals were subsequently established.  These include the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal.</para><para>The role of each of these tribunals is to provide independent, external review of administrative decisions made in particular areas of government.  However, each is invested with a range of different powers and modes of operation.  It was therefore appropriate to assess whether the federal merits review system was providing an efficient and effective avenue of redress for individuals seeking review of government decisions.</para><para>Such an assessment was undertaken by the Administrative Review Council in its report <inline font-style="italic">Better Decisions: Review of Commonwealth Merits Review Tribunals</inline>.  The Council is a distinguished body that was set up to monitor the administrative law system and recommend improvements.  The Council urged the formation of a single tribunal to replace a number of existing federal merits review tribunals.</para><para>The Government accepted the recommendation.  It decided to create a strong, independent tribunal that would exercise the jurisdiction of several existing tribunals, and at the same time would streamline merits review, remove duplication and inefficiencies, and improve performance.  To have several tribunals performing a similar review function, but with separate membership, staff, premises, information technology and corporate services systems, is wasteful of resources.  It also limits the range of work available to the members of the various tribunals.</para><para>The establishment of the new Tribunal will be a major development in the field of administrative review.  It demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving and enhancing the Commonwealth system of merits review.  A vast number of decisions made by government departments and agencies on a daily basis affect the rights and interests of individuals.  The Government is committed to ensuring individuals have ready access to independent and high quality review of decisions that is inexpensive, prompt, informal and effective.  The vital task of increasing public awareness of review rights and the availability of external review will be more easily achieved when there is one major tribunal conducting most federal merits review.</para><para>The goal of creating a tribunal that provides individuals with an appropriate review forum and encourages efficient public administration is reflected in the objects set out in the Bill.  These include:</para></quote><para>·	to ensure that the Administrative Review Tribunal provides an accessible mechanism for reviewing decisions that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick;</para><para>·	to enable the Tribunal to review decisions in a non-adversarial way; and</para><para>·	to enable the Tribunal to use flexible and streamlined procedures and a variety of processes, including inquiries and conferences, for resolving issues.</para><quote><para>The Government made several minor amendments to the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill in the House which are reflected in the revised explanatory memorandum.</para><para>The new Tribunal will be headed by an independent President, appointed by the Governor-General as a statutory office-holder.  The President will be responsible for the operation and administration of the Tribunal.  Unlike the President of the AAT, there is no requirement in the Bill that the President of the new Tribunal be a judge.  This is in keeping with the Government's goal of creating an informal, non-legalistic environment in the new Tribunal.  Other members will also be appointed by the Governor-General.</para><para>The Tribunal's six divisions will reflect the main review jurisdictions of the existing tribunals.  The Divisions are the Commercial and General Division; the Immigration and Refugee Division; the Income Support Division; the Taxation Division; the Veterans' Appeals Division; and the Workers' Compensation Division.  Each Division of the Tribunal will be headed by an executive member who will have responsibility for the day-to-day management of that Division.</para><para>In recognition of the different classes of decisions that will be reviewed by the Tribunal, and the needs of particular classes of applicants, specialist procedures will continue to exist for particular Divisions where appropriate.  Practices that have worked well in the separate tribunals will be carried over to the new Tribunal.  However, it is not the Government's intention that the new Tribunal will merely be the sum of its parts.  As far as possible, the Government intends the Tribunal as a whole to develop a flexible, non-adversarial culture, with an emphasis on informality and accessibility.</para><para>Members appointed to the new Tribunal will have a range of knowledge and skills.  It is expected that many members will be chosen from those currently serving on the existing tribunals, bringing their experience and expertise to the new Tribunal.  Members will be appointed to a particular Division, and they may be cross-appointed to other Divisions to accommodate fluctuations in divisional workloads.  The Bill provides for the appointment of a limited number of members as senior members—highly skilled and experienced members suitably qualified to review difficult, complex or particularly significant decisions and to provide intellectual leadership and guidance to other members.</para><para>The Government has carefully considered whether a second-tier of external merits review should be provided.  Second-tier review clearly adds to the time and costs of merits review.  In its <inline font-style="italic">Better Decisions</inline> report, the Administrative Review Council concluded that applicants should not have an automatic right to second-tier review.</para><para>The Government agrees that the merits review process should be finalised as efficiently as possible.  Accordingly, there will not be an automatic right to second-tier review in the new Tribunal.  Second-tier review will be limited to cases that raise a principle, or issue, of general significance where the first-tier review was conducted by a single member of the Tribunal.  It will also be available where parties to the first-tier review agree that the decision involved a manifest error.</para><para>This reform will mean that second-tier review will be available in areas for which currently there is no second-tier review, such as taxation and workers' compensation.  The current right to appeal a decision of the Veterans' Review Board to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will not change: decisions of the Board will be subject to review in the Veterans' Appeals Division of the new Tribunal.</para><para>Appeals from the new Tribunal to the Federal Court will be available, in the same circumstances as appeals from the tribunals being amalgamated.  Transfers of such appeals to the Federal Magistrates Court will be possible to the extent presently provided for.  Judicial review of administrative decisions under the <inline font-style="italic">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</inline> will also continue to be available to the same extent as at present.</para><para>The Government intends that the new Tribunal will develop a user-friendly culture.  To encourage informality and an efficient use of resources, the Government envisages that most reviews will be heard by the Tribunal constituted by a single member.  The President will have discretion to direct that two or three members constitute the Tribunal where the review raises a principle, or issue, of general significance or where additional specialist expertise is required.  The Tribunal will generally give its reasons for decision orally, with written reasons being provided on request or where the Tribunal considers the reasons for decision should be in writing due to the significance or normative value of the matter.</para><para>Departments and agencies whose decisions are under review will not be required to participate in a review, in the sense that they must appear before the Tribunal.  This will not affect the need for departments and agencies to give to the Tribunal information and documentation relevant to the decision under review.  However, it will assist in reducing the formality and adversarial nature of reviews.  When decision-makers participate in reviews, the Bill provides that they must use their best endeavours to assist the Tribunal.  The emphasis is on achieving the correct and preferable decision, rather than on defending the original decision.</para><para>Flexible practice and procedure directions will be a feature of the new Tribunal.  It will be able to tailor its practice and procedure according to the Division within which a decision is reviewed and the type of decision under review.  Other measures to promote economical and quick review will include the use of technology, such as conducting reviews by use of video and telephone conferencing.</para><para>The Government is also keen that the new Tribunal use a variety of processes, as well as informal hearings, in reviewing decisions.  The Tribunal will have a discretion to direct that conferences or inquiries be held at any time during a review to attempt to resolve issues and may encourage the use of other processes, including counselling, mediation and conciliation.</para><para>The emphasis in the new Tribunal on non-legalistic processes will minimise the need for legal representation.  However, there will always be situations where legal or other representation will be warranted, either because of the complexity of the issues or the particular needs of the applicant.  Participants may choose someone else to represent them before the Tribunal if the practice and procedure directions permit representation or the Tribunal agrees and representation is not prohibited by practice and procedure directions.</para><para>The new Tribunal will use the infrastructure of the existing tribunals.  Court-like hearing rooms that are still used in some registries of the existing tribunals will be replaced with meeting or conference rooms.  In addition, the new Tribunal, where appropriate, will use the support personnel of the existing tribunals, retaining valuable corporate knowledge and ensuring continuity in the administration of the federal merits review system.</para><para>In keeping with the Government's aim of improving the quality and processes of administrative decision-making, the Bill will continue in existence the Administrative Review Council.  The Council provides expert advice to the Government on strategic and operational matters relating to the Commonwealth system of administrative review.  In the last twenty-five years, the Council has produced a large number of useful reports on a range of administrative law matters, including the report that recommended the creation of the new Tribunal.  The Bill requires the Council to keep the Commonwealth administrative law system under review, monitor developments and recommend improvements that might be made to the system.  The Government looks forward to the Council continuing its important contribution in this area.</para><para>The<inline font-style="italic"> Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2000</inline> , the cognate Bill to the ART Bill, is also being introduced today.  More than 350 enactments confer jurisdiction on the tribunals that are to be amalgamated and these must all be amended to confer jurisdiction on the new Tribunal and make the necessary amendments that will ensure a seamless transition to the new system.  The Consequential and Transitional Provisions Bill provides the detail on the Tribunal's jurisdiction, how the Tribunal's procedures will be modified for the review of certain decisions and how the transfer of jurisdiction from the existing tribunals to the Tribunal will be achieved.</para><para>This Bill to establish the new Tribunal is a further significant step in the Government's reform of the federal civil justice system, following the recent establishment of the Federal Magistrates Service.  The Government is firmly committed to the continued independence, effectiveness and accessibility of federal merits review.  The Administrative Review Tribunal will be an independent, flexible, accessible, user-friendly tribunal.  It will provide review that is fair, just, economical and efficient and, in the process, improve the quality of Commonwealth administrative decision-making.</para></quote><para>—————</para><quote><para>ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW TRIBUNAL (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</para><para>The Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2000 is a cognate Bill to the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2000.  The latter Bill will establish the Administrative Review Tribunal, or ART, as it has become known.</para><para>Four merits review tribunals—the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT), the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT)—will be amalgamated in order to establish the Administrative Review Tribunal.  The Government is honouring its commitment to the veteran community by retaining the Veterans' Review Board and providing for its decisions to be reviewed by the new Tribunal.</para><para>The establishment of the ART will be the most significant reform to the federal merits review system in 25 years.  The ART will become the Commonwealth's principal merits review tribunal, providing ready access to review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick.  It will operate in a `user-friendly' manner and will have the capacity to tailor its procedures to suit the requirements of particular classes of applicants.</para><para>The Bill being introduced today forms the second part of the ART legislative package.The Bill makes provision for the following matters.  First, it provides for the abolition of the existing tribunals, the AAT, SSAT, MRT and RRT, and for the repeal of the <inline font-style="italic">Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975</inline> and of other legislative provisions that establish and provide for the operation of the existing tribunals.</para><para>Secondly, it contains amendments to Acts that currently confer jurisdiction on the existing tribunals, so that, on the abolition of those tribunals, that jurisdiction is conferred on the ART.  Thirdly, it make specific provision for procedures to be followed by the ART in reviewing specified classes of decisions.  Fourthly, the Bill contains provisions of a transitional nature.</para><para>These include provisions for review by the ART of decisions made before the ART commences operations, where such decisions have not already been reviewed by an existing tribunal.  It also contains provisions for appeals and references from decisions made by the existing tribunals where the appeals or references have not been completed by the time the ART commences operations.  The Bill also provides for the transfer to the ART of matters that, just before the ART commences operations, are before the AAT, SSAT, MRT or RRT.  </para><para>Preparation of the Consequential and Transitional Provisions Bill was a very large undertaking, which involved all departments and many agencies.  The main Bill was therefore introduced in the House before this Bill so that the Parliament and the community could examine the general provisions that will establish the new Tribunal and provide for its structure, membership and procedures.  Several minor amendments to the Bill were made in the House.</para><para>Both the ART Bill and this Bill  have been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The Consequential and Transitional Provisions Bill contains six clauses providing for the following matters: the short title of the Bill (clause 1), the commencement of its provisions (clause 2), the repeal of the <inline font-style="italic">Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975</inline> (`AAT Act') (clauses 3 and 4), the amendment of legislation as set out in the Schedules to the Bill (clause 5), and the making of transitional and savings regulations (clause 6).</para><para>There are 18 Schedules to the Bill.  My comments provide a brief overview of each Schedule.</para><para>Schedules 1 and 2 will replace references in Commonwealth Acts to the AAT and the AAT Act with, respectively, references to the Administrative Review Tribunal and the <inline font-style="italic">Administrative Review Tribunal Act 2000.</inline></para><para>Schedule 3 makes consequential amendments to various Acts.  The amendments are necessary as a result of the differences in structure between the current tribunals and the ART, and differences in terminology between the existing legislative provisions and the ART Bill.  In some circumstances, the amendments to be made by Schedule 3 effect more substantive, though minor, changes to the current review regime.  Those amendments are designed to further the objectives of the ART reforms.</para><para>Schedules 4 and 5 set out procedures for the review by the ART of adverse or qualified security assessments.  The Commercial and General Division of the ART will be called the Security Appeals Division when reviewing such assessments.  Special procedures are currently used for such reviews, and will continue to be required.  They are necessary in order to protect the confidentiality of security intelligence and information used by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in making security assessments and to protect other evidence and documents that may be given to the ART for the purpose of reviewing security assessments.  Present procedures operate well and provide an appropriate balance between the right of applicants to procedural fairness and the needs of security.  Consequently, the schedules make minimal changes to the present arrangements.</para><para>Schedule 6 makes consequential amendments to the <inline font-style="italic">Taxation Administration Act 1953</inline> in respect of the review of certain taxation decisions.  In particular, it provides that the ART Bill is subject to the modifications set out in the Schedule to that Act, which is to be inserted by Schedule 7 of this Bill.</para><para>Schedule 7 adds Schedule 2 to the Taxation Administration Act, to provide for the modified application of the ART Bill to the review of certain decisions made under that Act.  Generally, the modifications will retain existing procedures for the review of taxation decisions.   The Small Taxation Claims Tribunal, currently operating under the umbrella of the AAT, will be retained in the ART.  However, its jurisdictional limit will be changed.  Experience has demonstrated that the amount in issue in the review of an objection decision is not necessarily indicative of the complexity of the matter.  Schedule 7 therefore raises the monetary limit in the Small Claims Tribunal to $15,000 and at the same time imposes an additional requirement that the matter must be able to be conducted quickly or easily and does not raise an issue of general significance.</para><para>Schedule 8 makes consequential amendments to enable the ART to review decisions made by the Veterans' Review Board regarding veterans' entitlements.  Such reviews are to take place in the Veterans' Appeals Division of the ART.  Schedule 8 also provides that the ART Bill, in relation to applications for review of decisions made under the <inline font-style="italic">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</inline>, is subject to the modifications set out in the Schedule to that Act, which is to be inserted by Schedule 9 to this Bill.</para><para>The Schedule to the Veterans' Entitlements Act that is to be inserted by Schedule 9 makes provision for reviews by the ART of decisions of the Veterans' Review Board to be treated as second-tier reviews.  This is because the Board provides first-tier external review of veteran decisions.  Veterans will have a right to review by the ART of decisions made by the Board.</para><para>The retention of the Veterans' Review Board and veterans' rights to a second-tier of review is part of the Government's commitment to the veterans' community. The Government accepts the need for a specialised review mechanism for veterans.</para><para>Part 1 of Schedule 10 makes consequential amendments to enable the ART to review decisions made under the <inline font-style="italic">Social Security Act 1991</inline>.  Review by the ART will replace review by the SSAT and AAT.  Social security reviews will be conducted in the Income Support Division of the ART.  The amendments made by Schedule 10 will incorporate many of the existing features of review by the SSAT into the ART regime.  Part 2 of Schedule 10 makes similar amendments in relation to decisions made under the <inline font-style="italic">Social Security (Administration) Act 1999</inline>.</para><para>Presently, decisions in relation to social security matters are generally reviewable internally, after which an application may be made to the SSAT.  SSAT decisions are reviewable by the AAT.  Under the amendments, after internal review, applications for first-tier review can be made to the ART, after which second-tier review can also be sought on the grounds set out in the ART Bill.  Schedule 10 also provides that the ART Bill, in relation to applications for review of decisions made under the Social Security (Administration) Act, is subject to the modifications set out in the Schedule to that Act, which is to be inserted by Schedule 11 of the Bill.</para><para>Schedule 11 replaces Schedule 3 of the Social Security (Administration) Act, to provide for the modified application of the ART Bill to the review of decisions made under that Act.  Most of the modifications involve changing references to `decision-maker' in the ART Bill to `Secretary'.  This is to take account of the fact that decision-making powers under the social security legislation are vested in the Secretary of the Department of Family and Community Services and then delegated.</para><para>Schedule 12 makes similar amendments to those made by Schedule 10 to empower the ART to deal with the review of decisions regarding family assistance payments.  Schedule 12 will provide for applications for first-tier review to be made to the ART, in the Income Support Division, after which second-tier review can be sought on the grounds set out in the ART Bill.  Schedule 12 also provides that the ART Bill, in relation to applications for review of decisions made under <inline font-style="italic">A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999</inline>, is subject to the modifications set out in the Schedule to that Act, which is to be inserted by Schedule 13 of this Bill.</para><para>Schedule 13 adds a Schedule to the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act to provide for the modified application of the ART Bill to the review of decisions made under that Act.  Most of the modifications involve changing references to `decision-maker' in the ART Bill to `Secretary'.  This is to take account of the fact that decision making powers under the family assistance legislation, as with the social security legislation, are vested in the Secretary and then delegated.</para><para>Part 1 of Schedule 14 amends the <inline font-style="italic">Migration Act 1958</inline>.  These amendments will have the effect of creating a self-contained code for the conduct of immigration and refugee reviews, most of which will be reviewed in the Immigration Review Division of the ART.  This code will effectively replace Parts 4 to 10 of the ART Bill.</para><para>Overall, the effect of the amendments will be to retain the general structure of review presently conducted by the MRT and the RRT.  Currently, most decisions are reviewable by either the MRT (for most visa decisions made under the Migration Act) or the RRT (regarding protection visas).  These types of decisions will be covered by the regime established under new Part 5 of the Migration Act.</para><para>A small number of decisions made under the Migration Act are currently reviewable by the AAT, namely, those relating to business skills visa cancellations, criminal deportation and the refusal or cancellation of a visa on character grounds.  Schedule 14 will bring those decisions within the scope of Part 5.</para><para>Decisions relating to the registration of migration agents, currently not subject to Part 5 of the Migration Act, will remain outside Part 5.  They will be reviewable in the Commercial and General Division of the ART under the procedures established by and under the ART Bill.</para><para>The amendments made to Part 5, and in particular proposed section 353A, adopt the mechanism in the ART Bill requiring the Tribunal to comply with practice and procedure directions made by the Minister, the President or the executive member of the Immigration Review Division.</para><para>The Tribunal's failure to comply with directions will not, in itself, invalidate a decision.  This is the current position in relation to non-compliance with directions issued in respect of the MRT and RRT.  Subject to significant exceptions, a participant will not be entitled to seek review of the Tribunal's decision by the Federal Court under Part 8 of the Migration Act on the basis of the Tribunal's non-compliance with directions.  The exceptions include the following: directions in subsection 353A(4) of the Migration Act: directions regarding a decision to undertake a `review on the papers', the control of appearances, the making of submissions by a representative of the applicant or the Department, and the control of examination and cross-examination.  The proposed subsection also allows for regulations to be made prescribing additional classes of directions falling within the exceptions.</para><para>Proposed sections 362B, 362C and 362D of the Migration Act will allow the ART to end a review without making a decision where the applicant fails to provide information as requested, fails to appear, or fails to comply with a direction.  These provisions will allow the ART to dispose more readily of cases where the applicant does not actively pursue his or her case, and are consistent with the provisions in the ART Bill applying to the other Divisions.  The applicant must be notified that the review has been terminated.  However, the applicant's rights are not lost.  He or she is then entitled to apply for reinstatement of the review.  This amendment is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making in the Immigration Review Division and is consistent with the objectives of the ART reforms and the provisions of the ART Bill applicable to other Divisions.</para><para>A decision by the Tribunal to end a review on this basis will not be judicially reviewable, but a decision not to reinstate the review will be reviewable.  Therefore the onus is on an applicant first to apply for reinstatement before seeking judicial review.</para><para>Part 2 of Schedule 14 amends the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Citizenship Act 1948, </inline>and Part 3 amends the <inline font-style="italic">Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946</inline>, to take account of the fact that the review functions under those Acts will be undertaken by the ART.  Reviews of decisions made under the Australian Citizenship Act and the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act will take place in the Commercial and General Division of the ART, reflecting the fact that such reviews have been conducted by the AAT and not the MRT or RRT.</para><para>Schedule 15 provides for the transitional provisions required as a result of the abolition of the AAT and the establishment of the ART.</para><para>Part 2 preserves the existing entitlements of retired and serving Deputy Presidents of the AAT to pensions under the <inline font-style="italic">Judges' Pensions Act 1968</inline>.  It also gives an entitlement to a pension to Deputy Presidents of the AAT who elected to be covered by the Judges' Pensions Act scheme but who would not have qualified for a pension under that scheme by the time the AAT is abolished.</para><para>Part 3 deals with the transfer of records and documents between the AAT, ART, Federal Court and Federal Magistrates Service and Part 4 makes provision for the final annual report of the AAT.</para><para>Part 5, among other things, preserves a person's right to receive notice of certain decisions made before the AAT is abolished and notice of review rights in relation to them and to apply for statements of reasons for such decisions.</para><para>Part 6 deals with applications for first-tier review by the ART of decisions made before the abolition of the AAT.</para><para>Part 7 provides that the ART is to conduct reviews that were before the AAT and were not completed at its abolition.  Part 8 ensures that the ART can finish exercising certain other powers or performing certain other functions being exercised or performed by the AAT before its abolition.</para><para>Part 9 preserves the effect of decisions made by the AAT and preserves rights to appeal to the Federal Court in respect of AAT decisions and AAT matters that were not exercised before the abolition of the AAT.  It also preserves appeals in the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Service from the AAT which are in progress at the time the AAT is abolished.  Current applications under the <inline font-style="italic">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 </inline>or other review rights regarding decisions made by the AAT, for example, under section 75(v) of the Constitution or section 39B of the <inline font-style="italic">Judiciary Act 1903</inline>, will also be preserved.</para><para>Part 10 contains a specific provision dealing with the continuing effect, after the AAT is abolished, of a certificate issued by the Attorney-General under subsection 38(2) of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979.</inline></para><para>Part 11 ensures the continuing effectiveness of appointments to the Administrative Review Council, and certain other matters, after the repeal of the provisions of the AAT Act providing for the establishment and operations of the Council.  The ART Bill makes provision for the re-establishment and continuing operations of the Council.</para><para>Schedule 16 makes similar provision, in relation to the review of migration decisions by the MRT or RRT, to that made in Schedule 15 in relation to other classes of decisions that were reviewed or reviewable by the AAT.  In summary, existing review rights are preserved, reviews under way in the MRT or RRT at the time the existing tribunals are abolished are to be completed by the ART, and appeal rights regarding MRT or RRT decisions are preserved.</para><para>Schedule 17 makes similar provision, in relation to the review of social security and family assistance decisions by the SSAT or AAT, to that made by Schedule 15 in relation to other classes of decisions that were reviewed or reviewable by the AAT.</para><para>Schedule 18 amends section 20 of the <inline font-style="italic">Federal Court of Australia Act 1976</inline>.  Subsection 20(2) currently provides that where a matter comes before the Federal Court from a tribunal or authority the members of which included a judge, it must be heard by a Full Federal Court.  The amendments made by Schedule 18 will allow certain interlocutory and procedural matters in such cases to be dealt with by a single judge, rather than having to be dealt with by the Full Court.</para><para>This Bill, together with the main ART Bill, represents a major reform of the federal civil justice system.  The new Tribunal will retain the independence and effectiveness of the existing tribunals, while improving accessibility, flexibility and user-friendliness.</para></quote><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carr</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>21385</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Procedure Committee</title><page.no>21385</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>21385</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>21385</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I declare an interest.

This is the last stage of a long-drawn-out process. Though the opposition are supporting House amendment No.1, I indicate that we are extremely disappointed with the way this debate has turned in recent days. What we have before us is basically another deal between the government and the Australian Democrats. In the context of all similar deals in the past, we have the environment being the loser. </para></talk.start><para>Here we go again in 2001. You would have thought that in the break they might have gone back to the electorate and had a bit of a principle recharge. You would have thought that they would have had a signal from the electorate to try and keep this government honest on the environment. They have been giving out some signals during the break. There have been some statements that would have raised some hope in the broader community that the Australian Democrats would stick to some principles when it came to issues such as this. But on day one of the new millennium we start off with the Australian Democrats selling out again. Senator Bartlett, we remember the rhetoric of your predecessors. The principal cause of the Democrats was to keep the bastards honest. They were the self-proclaimed guardian angels of the system. They were purer than the main parties. They would not engage in these private, secret deals; they would stand on principle.</para><para>Those were the stated objectives and the raison d'etre of the Democrats in the past. What we have here, once again, is a junking of all those principles. You have gone and done another deal. In doing another deal, you have sold out the Sydney Harbour lands. You will be letting this fundamentally flawed bill through and selling out on basic principles. What I think really upsets people is that you have devalued the currency of dealing. You have sold out in an enormously amateurish way. It was your leader who said over the break: `Labor and Liberal are getting too close together. We are there providing an alternative.' You are not providing an alternative. On day one in this Senate, in this year, in the last session before we go to an election, you have signalled to the electorate very strongly that you do not provide an alternative for the electorate. At least Senator Brown does; you do not. You provide to the electorate a definition of the Australian Democrats as the sidekicks of the coalition—the third arm of the coalition. From keeping the bastards honest, we now have the `Meg the cheat' party selling out, as we saw last year and the year before, on basic, fundamental issues like the GST and the environment legislation. You are selling out again on an issue like this when you do not have to.</para><para>Let us go to the issues in this legislation before us. We got such statements from Senator Bartlett towards the end of last year:</para><quote><para>Sydney Harbour is NOT—</para></quote><para>with `not' in capitals— </para><quote><para>for sale. The Democrats are willing to pass the amended Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Bill on the condition that all former defence lands in and around the harbour remain in public ownership with adequate public access to all.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>The sale of public harbour foreshore lands is non-negotiable. The passage of the bill is contingent on the `no-sale' clauses we have insisted on and the bill, hopefully, will pass early in the Centenary of Federation year.</para></quote><para>Quite tellingly, he said in his press statement:</para><quote><para>Sydney Harbour is an Australian icon ...</para></quote><para>Indeed it is. But he went on to say:</para><quote><para>... the Australian Democrats have insisted all along that the foreshore lands and islands must not be sold and that public access must be maximised.</para></quote><para>What you have done in your most recent deal and arrangement with the government is to ensure the capacity for sale without parliamentary scrutiny. I will go to that point later on. You started from a position of no sale, then you jumped to a position of sale with some parliamentary scrutiny and now the latest instalment of the deal between you and the government is `forget the parliamentary scrutiny altogether'.</para><para>It would have been good to have started this year with a strong stand on an environmental issue, particularly in respect of the legislation before us today. It would have been good to have forced the government to have accepted a lot more in terms of protection of the land that we are talking about. Given the historical and environmental values of the lands that we are talking about, it would have been great to have forced the Prime Minister to meet one of the commitments he made before the last election, and that was to ensure that this land was not sold and was transferred to the New South Wales regime in trust for the people of New South Wales—in trust for the people of Australia. It would have been good, but in a private, secret deal—the reasons for which we cannot understand—you have basically said to Senator Hill, `Just do us over again.' And in doing so, you have made mockery of your own leader. A spokesman for Democrats leader Meg Lees, on 30 June last year, said:</para><quote><para>Open space is an increasingly precious resource and this a one-off opportunity to protect it. Once it's gone, it's gone.</para></quote><para>`Once it's gone, it's gone.' That is what you are doing here. I will not go through the other quotes. It would be a bit laborious to go through them. But what you have done here has been to flick off the capacity for sale of this land to the minister. Your first set of amendments that we saw were bad enough, because in those amendments you had a clause—and it is repeated here in the circulated amendments today—that allows the `transfer of the freehold interest of any land mentioned in schedule 2 without the written approval of the minister'. Now you are allowing for a schedule 2 and unlike the previous set of amendments you are not insisting that the decision to include land in schedule 2 be made a disallowable decision by either house of parliament. You are allowing the minister to embark upon a process to allow for the sale of land in the subject areas that we talking about—land that has been identified over the years, and confirmed by the Senate environment committee, as land that should be maintained in public hands. Just as a continuing sign of the inconsistency the Democrats show in this area, what they are saying by their amendments is that the minister may be able to start a process to sell the land without public scrutiny but if the minister or the trust was to decide that leases could be granted over the land subject to this legislation, then those leases would be disallowable by the parliament. You are implanting in your legislative prescription for this land an incentive to sell rather than lease. You might shake your head but they are the amendments that have been circulated to us, Senator Bartlett. Under those amendments, leases can be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance; sale cannot be. So not only is it a sell-out but it is one that provides in your package with the government an incentive to government and the trust to sell rather than to lease.</para><para>I suppose for me there is a certain degree of regret in that this is also a missed opportunity again—a missed opportunity to implant in this legislation a statement of vision, foresight and objective that really reflects the true environmental and heritage nature of this land and its true significance. But what we have finished up with, instead of a statement of vision and foresight, is the sort of statement that you would expect from the sort of suburban lawyer that John Howard used to be—a statement from the sort of suburban lawyer that he was and could have been at Wollstonecraft before he came into parliament. We go backwards. We do not show the vision and we do not show the foresight. Once again, we miss the opportunity to celebrate where Australia has come from and where it is going to. In this deal, you basically give the tick to a broken promise and you also give a tick to flawed legislation. We have enormous problems with the deal that the Australian Democrats have done with the coalition government, not merely because of what it does to this legislation but also in that it signals that, on another issue of the environment, the Australian Democrats—no matter how much they try to con their constituents and no matter how much they claim to be a real alternative to the major parties—have sold out once again.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>21401</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think I also, under the heading of the preamble, should make a few preliminary comments as unfortunately we are not going to get far tonight. That was, unfortunately, the usual disappointing, carping contribution that fails to appreciate the historical significance of what we have before us in the Senate tonight. And it is from a background of the ALP's intention to develop significant parts of this land—the land that we intend to give to the people of Australia in posterity for its natural values and its cultural values—for housing. They intended to sell it off for short-term economic gain. In contrast, we are ensuring that future governments of Australia cannot do that. We are offering a new protection for this land for future generations of Australians, something the ALP was not prepared to do. That is the point that Senator Bolkus seems to have totally overlooked.</para></talk.start><para>We could carry out the functions that we are undertaking at the moment—planning, remediation and the like—without this legislation. What we cannot do without this legislation is to transfer the land to a body that will be restrained. We will not be able to sell it off for other objectives. We will have specific purposes and objectives for that land—to restore it, to conserve it and to prepare it for its ultimate transfer, principally to a state government authority, to be held in posterity. I would have thought that anyone who was at all objective would say what a great thing that is, not only for the people of Sydney but for all Australians. But, ever since we introduced this bill with those objectives, all the Labor Party has done is obstruct its passage. One can only speculate as to why. Presumably it is in part because Labor does not want to see the government recognised as the government that was prepared to transfer the Sydney Harbour land for this purpose. Perhaps it is in part because the New South Wales government wishes to control the planning of the processes in relation to this land and Mr Beazley feels he is beholden to the New South Wales government in some way. Goodness only knows what the full agenda of the ALP is, but it is certainly not consistent with the noble goal of this piece of legislation.</para><para>Madam Chair, since the bill was last before us—and you will recall it was substantially amended—the government have sought to make concessions that we believe are not inconsistent with the government's purpose but would nevertheless improve the workings of the trust we have set up. These concessions would give the community a greater role in the planning process for each of the pieces of land, would improve the workings of the trust and would add some further areas of security as well. The requirement to establish a sustainable financial base has been dropped from the functions. This is something that other sides in this place have said might distract the trust from its primary objective in relation to the land. We have met that requirement. We have provided for individual properties to be named in the preamble and for boundaries to be listed in the schedules.</para><para>Listing of the properties was something that the other sides in this place called for constantly. We have provided that all land on schedule 1—which is almost all of the land—will remain in public ownership so that the public, through the schedule process, knows which land can be disposed of and which land cannot be. Land on schedule 2 can be sold only when the approved plan has identified sale as the preferred option and the land has been identified as having significant environmental or heritage values. The same applies to any land not listed on either schedule. The trust must not give security over any land mentioned in schedule 1. The determination of a lease longer than 25 years is now a disallowable instrument. The membership of the trust has been expanded from six to eight, comprising two New South Wales nominees, which was always the case, a representative of indigenous interests, an elected member of an affected council—that is, someone who is a current elected member would be nominated to be on the council—plus the three Commonwealth members and the chairs.</para><para>Some meetings of the trust must now be open to the public. The minutes of meetings will be publicly available. Movers and seconders will be acknowledged in the minutes but how each member votes will not be. Trust members have to declare a pecuniary interest in particular matters at meetings and must not take part in any consideration of or vote on the matter. Management plans will now be called `plans' and their content has been changed to pick up ideas from the Senate's amendments. Plan areas will not require ministerial approval and must cover whole sites, one or more. Public notices have been broadened and plans, draft and final, will be available for inspection. Submissions on plans will be publicly available where appropriate. The minister must seek and consider comments on a draft plan from the New South Wales minister. The minister is required to consider comments from advisory committees. The composition of the community advisory committee is more closely defined to ensure that they include local community and local government. The role of these committees and the trust's obligations to them are defined. The trust is to establish procedures for the committees following consultation with them.</para><para>We have made very significant changes since the bill was last before the Senate in an effort to accommodate the best of the changes that either came out of the Senate debate or were subsequently communicated to us by stakeholders. Since then, we have decided to go even further—thus our proposed amendments and the explanatory memorandum that I tabled a few minutes ago. These extra amendments to the bill are to further accommodate community concerns and to clarify certain clauses. Membership of the trust has increased by one to a total of eight members, including the chair. The Commonwealth will select an elected member of an affected council. The trust must include a condition of transfer of trust land mentioned in schedule 1 or land identified in a plan as having significant environmental or heritage values to ensure that it remains in public ownership. </para><para>In case you are not concentrating, Madam Chair, a condition of the transfer of that land to a state authority will be that they will not dispose of it—not that I do not trust New South Wales, but we nevertheless think it is an extra precaution that could be written into this legislation. The trust is not required to make publicly available submissions on draft plans where releases of a submission might significantly damage the environmental or heritage values of the land, which could be particularly important in relation to indigenous issues. Trust members are not personally liable to civil or criminal action in respect of the trust making a submission publicly available. The trust may undertake other work before a plan is developed but only as long as the work has a temporary impact on the area. The relationship between the trust and the community advisory committees and the process for determining the matters in relation to which a committee is to give advice and recommendations is clarified. The trust will not be obliged to establish a technical advisory committee unless one is actually required. Amendments to the schedules are the result of clarification of land title details and a resurvey by Defence at Middle Harbour, Georges Heights. The other proposed amendments are simply minor corrections to the legal drafting or consequential amendments.</para><para>So you can see how the far the government has gone in an effort to accommodate the wishes of the Senate and to accommodate the concerns of genuine community interest groups—which, I have always acknowledged, passionately believe in this land, and that is great to see—and the particular interests and concerns of the local government councils in the area. What we are putting to the Senate tonight is a bill that has been significantly improved by this process and I think it can provide all the reasonable safeguards that a reasonable person would expect. It will enable the land to be transferred to the trust, which is the major event that needs to take place, and for the trust to continue with its task. There are some exciting developments ahead of us in that area. I think it is only next month that the draft plans in relation to each of the sites are to be published. That is going to be an event of great interest to stakeholders. I understand there are some very exciting possibilities being foreshadowed through that process.</para><para>I urge the Senate tonight to allow the land to be transferred to this independent statutory trust, to support the trust in getting on with its job and to ensure that in this year of our Centenary of Federation this land is repaired, conserved and put in a state that can be enjoyed and appreciated not only by present but also future generations of Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>21403</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Bolkus says it is a new year, but we are certainly hearing the same old tired rhetoric from the ALP.

I want to speak about the proposed takeover by Shell Australia of Woodside Petroleum—a most successful company that ranks alongside BHP, Mount Isa Mines and Western Mining, et cetera, in Australia. It is not as clear cut as one may think. Yes, it does look, superficially or at a cursory glance, as though an overseas company—74 times bigger in capital than Woodside—is taking out another company. But one must remember that Shell already holds a significant minority shareholding in Woodside and that it is proposed to increase that to 56 per cent, or thereabouts, by the transfer of assets into Woodside. But that in itself is not necessarily bad.</para></talk.start><para>Woodside started in Victoria in 1954 in Gippsland. Its title then was Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil NL—the NL stands for `no liability'. In 1963 the Western Australian government in its usual acts of generosity to explorers gave some 367,000 square kilometres of potential gas and oil producing areas on the North West Shelf to Woodside. Subsequently, the company went on to conduct exploration not just in Western Australia and Victoria but also in the Timor Sea, Mauritania, Cambodia, the Gulf of Mexico and Papua New Guinea. But by far the greatest production and exciting areas that Woodside controls are in the North West Shelf. Early last month I read of the proposed takeover by Shell and, being a senator who represents the state of Western Australia in this chamber, I wrote to Mr Peter Duncan, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Shell Australia, who subsequently sent me a letter. That letter outlined some very significant proposals by Woodside in Australia.</para><para>I am unsure as to whether the letter that the good Mr Duncan sent me was explicit enough. It was ambiguous with respect to the transfer of assets. What assets are they? I do not think we have had a chance to have a look at those. Are those assets immediately realisable with respect to production from them? Yes, the answer, in part at least, is that some of them are. But what are they worth? What are the reserves? What is the business that Shell proposes by, in the initial stages, paying out money to acquire the shares and then at some later stage being able to compulsorily acquire back those shares for a given amount? The shares closed tonight at about $14.58 on the Sydney Stock Exchange. They were down by some 40c. I am not sure why the price of the shares would have fallen, whether it is that the FIRB is not going to give its permission for the proposed takeover by Shell or whether in fact it is but that it is not such a good deal seeing that natural gas and petroleum gas have fallen significantly on world markets today.</para><para>I have some serious apprehensions. I have been in the mining industry for a great deal of my working life. I have seen Conzinc Rio Tinto of Australia, entitled CRA, which was controlled in effect because of its share issue by Rio Tinto Zinc, or RTZ, of the UK—certainly the biggest mining house in the world. But because of the recent relaxation in foreign ownership, the global village and FIRB allowing them to come into Australia and the need of Australia for foreign investment, RTZ ultimately took over CRA and swallowed it—the whale swallowed the minnow. It was its own minnow, in effect. But if Shell does the same thing—and I just want to stress again that I am not necessarily opposed to the takeover; I just want more of an idea or certainty about what is going to be of net benefit to Western Australians, not just the shareholders because the shareholders will take whatever they can see is a profit, particularly the boys of the top end of the street, and they will run. I must find out whether Shell is going to emulate RTZ, another company in the UK, which took over CRA, which is now delisted. Is Shell, in spite of its protestations that it is not going to appreciably alter the smaller company of Woodside—only 1/74th of the capitalisation of Woodside—going to let Woodside stay in Australia and stay listed in Australia what is more, as indeed the chairman and CEO of Shell said it would?</para><para>May I give the Senate some idea of the enterprise value, that is, the assets and investments that Shell proposes to put into the deal in order to take over Woodside—once they take back the cash with which they will buy the shares in order to control Woodside, in order to go to the special general meeting which will, as a result, be controlled by Shell and get the meeting to agree to the injection of assets into Woodside. The cash that Shell used to buy the Woodside shares and to control the meeting then goes back to Shell, and Shell injects its assets in the North West Shelf, and other areas. I understand those assets are significantly in the North West Shelf. The North West Shelf is, of course, Australia's biggest producer of oil, gas and condensate—and has been since 1995 when it produced more than the Bass Strait in Victoria. So the enterprise value of the assets to be injected by Shell into Woodside is $7.5 billion or thereabouts. Woodside has $9.7 billion in assets, making a total value for the new project on the North West Shelf of $17.3 billion. The net debt that goes with that, if you aggregate that, gives a total net asset value, or equity value, of $15.5 billion. That takes the share value on the stock exchange per share from $12.97 per Woodside share currently up to $15.53 of net value. If that is the case, it would seem that the closure tonight of less than $14.50 is somewhat remiss, but I have dealt in the market long enough to know that the market is rarely wrong. I am going to ask the Shell Development CEO, Mr Duncan, if he could please explain that discrepancy. </para><para>Further, Shell Development tell me that the alliance agreement between Shell and Woodside, which was implemented in 1998, went some way towards achieving a goal of a takeover but did not secure the desired alignment of companies' interests so that there could be some advantage of merging the synergies—cheaper operating costs or better utilisation of facilities. Mr Duncan, in his letter to me, said, `Bringing these strategic assets under a single management team in Woodside would result in a focus on optimised development strategies which would improve the chances for Australia to win new export markets in the Asia-Pacific region.' </para><para>My problem—and I do not have as much time tonight as I would like to go into it—is this: Shell is a giant of a company. It is the biggest producer of petroleum products, by far, in the world. It is the biggest producer of profits on its petroleum products in the world. Is Shell going to turn off the gas in Australia, or the petroleum, or the condensate that it produces in Australia—which Woodside currently produces and about which Woodside currently can make its own decisions as to whom it sells its production to—because it is strategically desirable for Shell? Shell can use its facilities in the Middle East, in the North Sea, in the northern part of South America or in Siberia, to the detriment of Australia. We have political stability here and this is a very attractive country. The geology is very attractive here, and the strike rate of some of the exploration holes they put down is very attractive too.</para><para>I am not writing off the proposed merger with Shell, but I want the Senate to take note that we need to ask far more questions in this House before anyone should be able to agree to a merger of this magnitude with one of the greatest assets that Western Australia has.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Youth Safety: Big Day Out</title><page.no>21406</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>21406</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I rise to talk about the very important issue of the safety and security of young people attending rock concerts and music festivals. Before I go to that, I wish to offer, on behalf of the federal parliament, deepest sympathy to the family and friends of 15-year-old Jessica Michalik. Jessica died tragically as a result of being involved in a crowd crush at the Sydney Big Day Out last month. It is extremely hard for all parents of children who attend concerts to comprehend this senseless loss of a young life. Equally, it is extremely hard for a young person to lose a good friend in such tragic circumstances. </para></talk.start><para>It is a heartbreaking tragedy, and I believe the death of Jessica may have been preventable. This tragedy has raised many valid concerns about the safety and security of young people attending these large-scale music festivals in Australia. The staging of events, particularly those that attract crowds of 40,000 to 60,000 people, the majority of whom are aged between 15 and 25, places a legal and moral obligation on the promoters and organisers to ensure that every step is taken with respect to their security and safety. </para><para>The Big Day Out has become a cultural institution in Australia and, along with events like Homebake, it is a very important part of the music festival scene as well as being a launchpad for local music and talent. I do not want to see an end to these music festivals; in fact, the opposite: I totally support the continued staging of music festivals and events. I want to see more young people given the opportunity to see their favourite bands and to celebrate in youth orientated cultural events. That said, it is very important that the tragic death of Jessica Michalik not be dismissed as just an unfortunate accident. There are ways to ensure that crowds are safeguarded and the wellbeing and health of fans considered. The only positive outcome that may emerge from the Big Day Out tragedy is that there be an immediate reorganisation of crowd control and security at these concerts.</para><para>The principal complaint levelled at the organisers was the refusal of the Big Day Out organisers to use what is known as a T-barrier for crowd control. This issue was raised by the lead band, Limp Bizkit. This type of crowd management effectively segregates a massive crowd into smaller, more secure enclosures. I understand that this style of crowd management is commonly used in North America and in Europe, where large-scale music festivals are common. A T-barrier is just what it sounds like. It is a barrier that divides the audience closest to the stage into two separate groups by a protruding corridor that extends into the crowd. Importantly, this corridor allows for greater access for security and ambulance officers to help anyone in need.</para><para>According to a web site I viewed on crowd management strategies, this T-barrier is effective because it reduces the lateral crowd surges and provides medical and security people with a better view of what is going on in the mosh pit. As crowdsafe.com point out on their web site, the first rule of crowd management is not to have a crowd larger than you can safely manage. It sounds pretty straightforward.</para><para>In Australia, the management of crowds is the responsibility of promoters and concert organisers, with some local government jurisdiction. The successful management of large crowds requires proper training of staff, well-prepared emergency strategies, adequate communication, alcohol and drug policies, and assessment of the types of acts performing. In the US, there is a code of practice, and it is time we considered a similar approach. I note that Limp Bizkit, the American band that Jessica had gone to see, had been very critical of the manner in which crowd control was organised at the Big Day Out. Limp Bizkit are apparently known for their energetic stage antics, and therefore the promoters of the Big Day Out should have known that extra measures were needed in terms of crowd control. To their credit, Limp Bizkit quit the Big Day Out tour immediately after Jessica's injuries became apparent. Their decisive action ensured that safety came to the forefront in the media treatment of Jessica's death. I want to publicly acknowledge the sincere efforts of Triple J and the lengths they have gone to, both in terms of their condolences they have offered to Jessica's family and their web site, which expresses their concern and sympathy.</para><para>What needs urgent revision is the way promoters and venue operators treat their patrons, many of whom are young, and many of whom are vulnerable in that regard. For example, I have heard that only two ambulances were on hand at the Sydney Big Day Out. If this is true, I call on Messrs West and Lees, the promoters, to urgently address their priorities. During this year's Big Day Out festival, 30 young people were apparently injured and required some kind of medical assistance. Many of these were very young and were quite probably scared and frightened by the experience of being crushed, pushed, shoved and jostled in a large crowd on very hot days.</para><para>This brings me to another point that needs to be addressed by promoters, and that is the access to water. It is simply unacceptable to charge $4 or $5 for a container of water at such a concert, when temperatures are in the high 30s. The risk of dehydration, leading to cramps and loss of consciousness, is very real. I might add that the temperature does not have to be so high for a risk of dehydration to be present—remembering that many of the young people are dancing and working up a sweat, and dehydration can occur very quickly. It is unacceptable and downright dangerous not to have free and ample supplies of water easily and readily available. Simply spraying a crowd with water is not good enough. It comes nowhere near dealing with this issue. The health of young people is far more important than profit margins. Young people do not have a lot of money. With tickets to the Big Day Out and other similar concerts costing $80, many in the crowd would not have had the spare $20 or $30 that it would have required just to keep up an adequate intake of water for that afternoon and evening.</para><para>Let me conclude by urging all music venue and concert organisers to think carefully about their responsibilities and duty of care under the relevant state occupational health and safety legislation and associated public liabilities. I continue to welcome and encourage under-age concerts, youth festivals and music festivals of this type, but I do take this opportunity to caution organisers not to put their profit margins first but to make a priority the safety and security of the young people and, in fact, all people attending the concerts that are their responsibility. For so many young people, in particular, these concerts are a social highlight, a very special event in their lives, and there is absolutely no reason that they should be putting their health at risk by attending them.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Innovation</title><page.no>21408</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>21408</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I rise to address the issue of innovation. The government's innovation statement argues, quite reasonably, that success in the 21st century for this nation, among others, will depend on the innovative capacity of nations, their industries, and their research and educational structures. Innovation, we are also told repeatedly, is the key to future prosperity, not only in high- or new-tech industries; innovation is also essential to the future of our traditional sectors, including manufacturing, agriculture and mining.</para></talk.start><para>So how does the government's proposal stack up against those claims? On research, the initiatives are welcome, although modest and long overdue. Research, the lifeblood of innovation, will benefit from the doubling of the ARC funding, and the increase to research infrastructure is a reasonable start—but it is just a start. The increased investment in the CRC program and the extension of the R&amp;D START program will help build and deepen linkages between research and business—although we do need to see more information as to how SMEs will be further encouraged to embrace the benefits of these programs.</para><para>The modest proposals in relation to education, however, pay little more than lip-service to the centrality of education in underpinning an innovation society. There was nothing that addressed what the Chief Scientist has described as the `significant strain' on the higher education sector. There was nothing to reverse the at least $1.8 billion of cuts made in 1996 and beyond, let alone the $3 billion disinvestment since 1995, if taken as a percentage of GDP. No innovation strategy will be credible until the defunding of higher education is properly addressed and reversed.</para><para>Setting aside the education black hole of this government, the other acid test for the government will be the success or otherwise of their proposed incentives to reverse the significant decline in private investment in innovation and R&amp;D. I hardly need remind the chamber of what has happened since the government reduced the R&amp;D tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. But it is in relation to private investment in innovation and R&amp;D that we see how limited the government's understanding of innovation appears to be, and how limited the government's commitment to encouraging private R&amp;D appears to be.</para><para>Let us start with innovation. At the Royal Society's inaugural lecture on innovation back in 1991, Mr Morita, the late chair of Sony, made the point succinctly when he said: `Science does not equal technology does not equal innovation.' The reverse holds true as well: innovation does not equal technology does not equal science. But this also means that technology transfer does not equal innovation, and innovation does not necessarily involve significant or, indeed, any technological development. That is not to say that innovation cannot involve technological development and/or technology transfer; obviously it can and frequently does. Rather, it tells us that technological development and transfer should not be conflated with innovation.</para><para>The distinctions are crucial. They are crucial for researchers and research users in the enabling natural sciences, humanities, social sciences and arts, who are vulnerable to further defunding if innovation and technology are used interchangeably in funding agreements. They are crucial if we are to develop a reasonably sophisticated understanding of all the inputs, processes and linkages that contribute to innovation; and a reasonably sophisticated understanding is required to guide appropriate policy and funding settings.</para><para>The Innovation Summit Implementation Group report does not give a definition of innovation as such, and I can understand how innovation can mean many different things to different people. It does, though, distribute attributes of innovation throughout the report. Thus, it places much emphasis on culture, as in `the culture of innovation'; on creativity, and, in particular, graduates' creativity; on the centrality of ideas, both creating and acting on ideas; and on valuing human capital, including, for instance, formal recognition in accounting practices. This is a broad but rich view of innovation. It does not confuse technological development or technology transfer with innovation. Nor does it simply reduce innovation to the process of turning an idea into something commercially useful, important as that of course manifestly is.</para><para>It is of deep concern that the government does not appear to have understood this, as the proposed changes to the R&amp;D concession demonstrate. The government proposes to maintain the current R&amp;D tax concession at 125 per cent. This is effectively a cut, however, as the value of the concession has declined with the falling of the corporate tax rate. Following the advice of the Innovation Summit Implementation Group report, it will introduce a 175 per cent R&amp;D tax concession premium for the increment of R&amp;D above a base rate. If this was all that was involved, it would be a perfectly defendable initiative, but the value is more than wiped out by the government's intention to significantly change the definitions and eligibility criteria.</para><para>The government intends to severely curtail the scope of the concession by, firstly, requiring all claims to meet both the innovation and high technical risk criteria, whereas claims need to meet only one of these currently; secondly, narrowing the definition of research and development activities; thirdly, extending the exclusion list in R&amp;D supporting activities; and, lastly, only permitting labour costs to be eligible in the premium concession. Most projects that currently meet the innovation criteria will fail in the new arrangements because they do not involve high technical risk. And the Democrats are most concerned that possibly as many as 90 per cent of currently eligible projects will not meet the new criteria—that is extraordinary.</para><para>Section 73B(2B)(b) makes it quite clear that to qualify as high technical risk projects requires `a systematic progression of work (based on principles of physical, biological, chemical, medical, engineering or computer science)'. This policy, therefore, explicitly conflates innovation with applied science. It will eliminate any projects that do not involve physical, computer, medical or biological science. It is a policy that actively discriminates against private R&amp;D in social sciences, economics, humanities and management, including, for instance, resource management. The innovation group report highlights the significance of research in such areas. They enhance the organisational, management, economic, legal and marketing knowledge that is critical to the success of innovation. This policy flies in the face of that advice by denying that these areas are innovative in their own right and denies the place they play in technological innovation.</para><para>The government's intention to extend the exclusion list means a wide range of activities, including market research, quality control, prospecting, efficiency surveys, tooling-up and trial runs and commercial, legal and administrative aspects of patenting and licensing, will no longer be claimable. These activities are legitimate, indeed necessary, parts of the whole innovation process and may represent up to 90 per cent of the total costs of a typical R&amp;D project.</para><para>The very narrowness of the government's understanding of innovation, combined with the considerable reduction in assessable activities, will effectively operate as a proxy picking winners policy, restricted to the development of international patents in biotechnology and ICT. I should emphasise that government encouragement of significant investments in these areas is welcome and, again, long overdue. I have often spoken in this place about how we need to vastly improve our commitment to developing knowledge based technologies. However, I am concerned that our traditional mining, manufacturing and agriculture industries are effectively denied access to these so-called incentives. Indeed, the proposal actually contradicts the government's claim that `innovation is also essential to the future of our traditional sectors including agriculture, manufacturing and mining'. In these areas, a significant proportion of innovation is incremental in nature and may not be patentable. However, there are significant benefits from R&amp;D in these areas, not least of all in more efficient use of energy and other resources, that is, there are major sustainability issues buried within these changes.</para><para>The net result of the changes to the tax concession is likely to be a further reduction of private investment in innovation and R&amp;D, which, of course, is the worst possible outcome. I fear that the government's lack of commitment to a broad-based innovation drive may be the thin edge of the wedge and that the government will generalise this into other areas with, for instance, their power to determine the balance of basic and applied research in the ARC. If we are to become an innovative society and flourish in the global knowledge economy, then the government will need to go back and thoroughly reassess this strategy, but this time in consultation with business.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Neville, Mrs Joan</title><title>Tucker, Mr Robert Walter John</title><title>Webb, Mr Daniel</title><page.no>21410</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Tucker, Mr Robert Walter John</title><title>Webb, Mr Daniel</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>21410</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On this first day of the sittings of the parliament for this year, I want to briefly mention three very different Queenslanders, but three Queenslanders who each in their own very different way are very significant Queenslanders. They have a common thread, perhaps, in that they all originated from regional Queensland.</para></talk.start><para>Joan Neville passed away on 15 January this year. Joan would not be a household name across Australia, but she was very well known in the Burdekin, where I come from, and most people in the Burdekin would have known Joan. She was one of those unsung heroes of a country town. She had a number of involvements with various community groups, most recently, and perhaps most significantly, her involvement in the Neighbourhood Centre in Ayr looking after people less fortunate than herself. As well, she was a pillar of the Catholic Church. She was very heavily involved in the church and the Catholic Ladies Association. She was also a member of the Soroptimists and of the Forum Club. She was a Lions lady, and she was a past secretary of the Ayr Chamber of Commerce and a past secretary of the Mango Growers Association. She was also a very successful businesswoman, working with her husband in the partnership of the Delta Milk Supply—the milk suppliers to the Burdekin for many years.</para><para>She was married for 39 years to her husband, Pat. They had the children Michael Terrance, Kenneth William, Richard, Kathleen, Francis John and Valma Joan. They were a real regional country family. Joan was very involved in the Liberal Party and was very supportive of me in all the time that I have been involved in public life in Ayr. She was one of those people who make country towns work. She was a very astute person. She did, at times, have a very severe and determined public face—a countenance that frightened many who did not really know her all that well—but behind that severe countenance was a heart of gold and a selfless concern and love for her fellow human being. Joan will be sadly missed in the Burdekin.</para><para>The second significant Queenslander I want to briefly mention is Robert Walter John Tucker, better known to those of us in the Liberal Party as Bob Tucker. On Sunday Bob was selected as the Liberal Party candidate for the federal seat of Ryan. I am sure he will replace the Hon. John Moore and, I am sure, make a contribution to this parliament almost as good as that of John Moore. Things will be said about John Moore later. Bob Tucker was born in Rockhampton in regional Queensland. He is a family man, married to Greer, with several children. He was a retail pharmacist. He won a Commonwealth scholarship that the Menzies government provided to those who could not afford, and who had the ability, to complete tertiary education.</para><para>He achieved a Bachelor of Pharmacy from the University of Queensland and a Bachelor of Science. He worked as a retail pharmacist and a production microbiologist, and he established a pharmaceutical wholesale business servicing some 800 pharmacies in Queensland, northern New South Wales and the Northern Territory. In 1978 he established the Green Spot chemists chain, which is a franchise of some 130 pharmacies very well known up our way. In 1982 he established the Prime Development group of companies and since then he has built and operated a number of shopping centres, pioneered the development of the Brisbane retail showroom centres and rehabilitated large contaminated industrial sites to create high quality industrial, office and warehouse complexes.</para><para>Bob Tucker has a long and distinguished career in the Liberal Party and was for a period of time the State President of the Liberal Party, at a time when the Liberal Party achieved government both federally and in the state of Queensland. He is a very astute person with a good sense of politics. I look forward to him joining us here in Canberra. He is also typical of the sort of people in the electorate he represents: self-made and tertiary educated but involved in community activities. He is the co-chairman of the organising committee of the World Scholar Games for 2002. He is involved in the Order of St John—fund raising for the Mater Children's Intensive Care Unit—and a member of several other clubs.</para><para>He has been treasurer and fete convenor of the Indooroopilly State School P&amp;C. He was involved in the Kenmore Bears Australian Football Club—not, I suspect, through his own endeavours but as a parent of sons who did play. Bob was involved very much in that club and in working with the community to build club facilities. He was also involved with the Sapphires Netball Club in a similar way. I look forward to working with Bob in this place, and I know the Australian nation will benefit from the contribution he will be able to make to this country.</para><para>The third significant Queenslander I want to mention is a 14-year-old boy from Cairns in Far North Queensland whom I first met at the Young Australian of the Year Awards held in the Great Hall in this building earlier this month. He is a singer. Madam President, I think you were there and enjoyed his presentation immensely. I mention young Daniel Webb because the song he sang, <inline font-style="italic">Kids From the Bush</inline>, is so typical of the thoughts and dreams of a lot of young people in country Australia. A lot of young people, because they live in country Australia—because they are born there or because their parents are there for work—do not always have the same sorts of opportunities that kids in the city areas have. He performed magnificently—as did many of the other performers specially brought there that day by Mary Lopez Productions and through the assistance of Qantas airlines.</para><para>Whilst a very talented young person, Daniel is very unassuming. His mother and father, who were with him, were overawed at the star status they received while they were here. I was very pleased to make their acquaintance and take them round the building. It was a delight for young Daniel, as we were walking past the Prime Minister's office, for the Prime Minister to come out and invite them in, unrehearsed and unappointed. He went into the Prime Minister's office and he thought that was great.</para><para>As a nine-year-old, Daniel cut his first CD. At the age of 14—which is what he is now—he has sung the John Williamson song <inline font-style="italic">Raining on the Rock</inline>, on the Qantas <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Australia </inline>CD. Apparently that plays on all Qantas's international flights around the world. The song <inline font-style="italic">Kids from the Bush</inline>—specially written for him by Mark Mannock and put to music by his dad, Laurie Webb—tells of the special hardships faced by country kids when they have to leave their homes and families in search of education and employment. It also tells how they never forget their friends and the family who helped them along their way.</para><para>In the presentation that goes out with the videotape he has recorded, he mentions that famous Australian bush kids include Pat Rafter, Karrie Webb, Brad Bevan, Wendell Sailor and Greg Norman. He is obviously very keen on the sporting greats that have come from country Australia. I think the song that he sings so well and so enthusiastically deserves greater recognition. I would like to read the words of the song, but time will preclude me from doing that. Daniel is a great performer and a great little country Australian. The chorus words of his song typify the aspirations of so many young people from country Australia when they say:</para><quote><para>Kids from the bush we've got dreams,</para><para>A little harder to touch, a little further to see,</para><para>We believe in tomorrow will be what will be,</para><para>Kids from the bush we've got dreams.</para></quote><para>The three people I have mentioned in my speech tonight, all originally kids from the bush, deserve recognition on the first day of parliament this year.

question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Airservices Australia has advised the following:</para><para>(1)	In the Australian Advanced Air Traffic System (TAAATS), radar data is presented on the Controllers Air Situation Display (ASD).  There are approximately 150 of these displays in TAAATS.  The loss of any one display is not usually a significant event.  Air Traffic Controller training includes managing the loss of the ASD.</para><para>There were 35 Service Failure Notifications recording display failure in the period 1 March 2000 to 31 August 2000.  This equates to one service failure per screen every 788 screen days.</para><para>Currently, there is a program of brief periodic removal from service of each ASD.  This is a mitigating strategy adopted to manage short term software constraints.  The timing of removal from service is discretionary and hence is not classed as a Service Failure.</para><para>(2)	Airservices has systems in place to record and report each failure.  Hardware failure is addressed by replacement of the faulty equipment with a spare.  Software faults are captured and recorded.  Each failure is analysed, priority determined, appropriate correction developed, tested and deployed.</para><para> (3)	Not all screen failures lead to an occurrence. However where a failure was involved in an occurrence, even though it may not have caused the occurrence, Airservices reports it to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB).  In the period 1 March 2000 to 3 August 2000, 19 occurrences in which radar screen failures were identified were reported to the ATSB.  These were all classified by the ATSB as category 5 occurrences, which are those occurrences classified as being primarily of statistical interest, and therefore not further investigated by the ATSB.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of Transport and Regional Services: Programs and Grants to the Richmond Electorate</title><page.no>21420</page.no><subtitle>(Questions Nos 2992 and 3001)</subtitle><id.no>2992 and 3001</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>21420</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 5 October 2000; and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 5 October 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	What programs and/or grants administered by the department provide assistance to people living in the electorate of Richmond.</para><para>(2)	What was the level of funding provided through these programs and grants for the 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 financial years.</para><para>(3)	What is the level of funding provided through these programs and grants that has been appropriated for the 1999-2000 financial year.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>21420</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answers to the honourable senator's questions are as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Local Government Financial Assistance Grants</para><para>Local Government Incentive Programme</para><para>Regional Flood Mitigation Programme</para><para>The Federal Road Safety Black Spot Program</para><para>Roads of National Importance</para><para>(2)	Local Government Financial Assistance Grants</para><para>Local Government Financial Assistance Grants to the electorate of Richmond for 1996-1997,1997-1998 and 1998-1999.
