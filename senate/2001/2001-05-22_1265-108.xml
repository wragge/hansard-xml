I think we have already made it clear how that will be brought about. The package will pay 100 cents in the dollar for people with salary continuance policies and disability policies who are Australian citizens or permanent residents; will pay 100 cents in the dollar for personal injury claims where the insured is an Australian citizen, permanent resident or small business; will pay 100 cents in the dollar for claims for a total loss on a primary place of residence where the insured is an Australian citizen or permanent resident; and will pay 100 cents in the dollar for claims where the insured is an Australian not-for-profit organisation. The government will also give 90 cents in the dollar support for other claims where the insured is subject to an income test and where the family taxable income is less than $77,234. It increases by $3,139 for each additional child. A policyholder qualifies regardless of the size of their claim. There will also be a cover of 90 cents in the dollar where claims have been lodged for Australian small businesses that have 50 employees or fewer.</para></talk.start><para>There are a number of other aspects of the claim. Those matters not covered are claims where the insured is not an Australian citizen or permanent resident and claims for reinsurance contracts. We will not be paying insurance mandated by state and territory governments, we will not be paying for any business that is not an Australian business or does not meet the definition of a small business and we will not be paying for claims where the insured was a director, an officer or an associate of a director or officer of any company within HIH three years before its failure, nor will we pay claims where the insured was an individual or an associate of an individual who was in a position to influence or advise the directors or officers of any companies within HIH three years before its failure.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23936</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam President, I ask a supplementary question.

I think Senator Conroy typifies his colleagues, who do not have the slightest interest in this issue. We will come to that in a moment, when we look at what Mr Smith had to say. We also provide close to $90 million in relation to mobile phone coverage. This is clearly a major concern to people outside the metropolitan areas, despite the fact that we have something in excess of 11 million mobile phone subscribers. As a result, those towns which have populations of more than 50,000 and where there is a demonstrated need and ongoing commercial viability will be eligible for funding under that scheme.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Particularly significant for those who want high-speed access to the Internet is the minimum guarantee in relation to data bit rates that will increase what is effectively a 2.4 kilobit rate to a 19.2 kilobit rate, which gives people sufficient bandwidth capability to web browse and to have email and chat services. This generally puts them on a par with those in metropolitan areas. To the extent that they want higher bit rates, they will be able to obtain that from other services, and our digital data service capability is already legislated for.</para><para>The real answer to the second part of Senator Calvert's question is: there is only one risk to all of this package, and that is Labor. Labor has form on reneging on these sorts of policy commitments. Senator Schacht, who is not hereâand who, in any event, will not be here for much longerâwas the high-water mark of this during the last election. Mr Crean is on record in recent times as making all these sliding around promises: `Yes, we will review commitments that are in place and we'll decide whether we can afford them.'

There is again a snide implication that somehow the Labor Party would spend even more. They will not spend one red cent. They have never committed to it; they have always opposed every initiative in this area. They call Telstra Countrywide a sop and they call our Networking the Nation promises bribes. They have been out there and had every opportunity to commit themselves and have done quite the opposite.

The fact that the Australian Federal Police is a first-class law enforcement agency is largely due to the professionalism of the men and women who serve in the AFP.

Since coming to office, we have invested $1.4 billion in the Australian Federal Police. When you look at the press reports by News Ltd papers and also by the opposition spokesman, Mr Kerr, in relation to funding being slashed, you can just see the hypocrisy of this. Look at the fact that in the last four years of the Labor government, new money for the AFP totalled $13 million. Compare that to this government injecting $374 million of new money in the last four years.</para></talk.start><para>What is equally outrageous is the fact that the opposition is trying to say that this government does not have a plan for law enforcement and that it is ad hoc. Let us just look at what we are doing: introducing legislation for the proceeds of crime to be confiscated at a federal level and broadening that to make it easier to access and confiscate the proceeds of crime, particularly in relation to organised crime; new powers to fight organised crime and people smugglers; and modern cyber crime laws to be introduced by this government in view of the emerging trend that we see internationally in hacking into computer systems and computer viruses. Also, the Howard government has committed $50 million to CrimTrac, the national DNA and fingerprint database that will revolutionise the way policing is conducted in Australia.</para><para>This is a strategy for Australia for law enforcement in the modern times we find ourselves in. This is a modern strategy to fight organised and serious crime which the previous Labor government never, ever had. We will continue to support the Australian Federal Police and our law enforcement agencies such as Customs. In fact, over $500 million has been invested on the Tough on Drugs strategy by the Prime Minister. What have we had from Labor? We have had a 10-point `soft on drugs' plan where in the whole document you do not even get one page on education. In fact, you get a rehash of diversionary programs which are being run by state governments across the country. What do you get in relation to law enforcement? You get nothing new in relation to law enforcement and fighting organised and serious crime in relation to drug trafficking.</para><para>The results of our financial investment in the AFP are evident in the drug seizures that we have seen. In fact, there have been 5,000 illicit drug seizures by the Australian Federal Police since the Howard government came to powerâseizures of illicit drugs weighing in the region of 4.2 tonnes. All this has been as a result of the dedicated professionalism of our Australian Federal Police men and women and the funding we have given them to do the job. </para><para>This government is committed to law enforcement, unlike the Labor opposition. So when they get up and say we do not have a strategy, let us see where their strategy is. They do not have one. Let us see where they are going to fund the Australian Federal Police.

The Department of Veterans' Affairs has checked its records and, according to the documents, the 25 Australians who received the dangerous dosage were all commissioned officers.

There is also the special administrative scheme administered by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources. That scheme provides compensation to test participants who have developed multiple myeloma or leukaemia other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia. Since 1995, compensation was only provided if the leukaemia had developed within 25 years since participation. There are, of course, common law claims through the courts.

It is a fact that too many Australians, particularly those opposite, ignore the central importance of the minerals industry to Australia and indeed the international prestige and reputation of Australia's minerals industry. It is the only Australian industry that can be truly regarded as world class. The proposed merger of BHP and Billiton, a merger which, of course, we welcomeâyou wouldn't have a clue what the Labor Party think about it; the Labor Party are absolutely all over the place on this very important merger, as they were and are on the Shell-Woodside issueâwill mean that the world's largest diversified mining company will be headquartered here in Australia.

This world-class status of our industry was underlined by the recent global survey showing that Australia is now the best place in the world to invest in the resources industry. The latest annual American international group world risk survey finds that, for the first time ever, Australia is seen as the least risky country to invest in, ahead of our traditional rivals, Chile, Canada and the USA. </para><para>This result, which is a great result for Australia and one we should all be proud of, is a tribute to our government's determination to make Australia the most attractive place in the world to invest in. Our five years of very good economic management, which will be confirmed by the budget tonight, our tax reforms and, of course, our industrial relations reforms have produced this No. 1 ranking for the first time ever for Australia. I would remind you that our tax reforms take $1 billion off mineral exports. That is the most important thing that is too often ignored about our tax reforms: the way in which we have removed tax completely from our exports, which is going to reduce production costs in the minerals industry by some four per cent. Our industrial relations reforms have been vital to the international competitiveness of the Australian mining industry.</para><para>This otherwise outstanding result is, of course, blighted by the fact that, in this same survey, Australia is ranked equal worst in the world, with Zimbabwe of all places, for the risk of land claims in relation to minerals investments.

It has put an unworkable straitjacket on Australia's minerals industry. The real victims of that shemozzle were Aboriginal Australians, who have suffered not only from the mess created but also from the impact on the mining industry. We did our utmost to clean up the mess that Labor left us. We were opposed at every step by the Labor Party. It was only due to Senator Harradine that we got any changes through the Senate. Labor has continuously tried to prevent the states introducing workable right to negotiate legislation under the amendments that we passed.

He went on to say, `Of course there will be a royal commission,' only to be slapped down the next day by his Prime Minister, who said, `No, of course we are not having a royal commission, because it would get in the way of the ASIC inquiry.' As Mr Hockeyâor Hindenburg, as he is known to his affectionate friendsâstaggered on through last week, we saw his performance get worse and worse. He is a serial bungler. And so, yesterday, the government finally caved in. They finally faced up to what they have had to face up to.

But do not think, Senator Brandis, that you can get away with a royal commission that does not include the actions of the Howard government ministers and advice given to them by APRA and ASIC. Do not think you cannot include the government's handling of insurance industry regulation issues, including a review of the Insurance Act since 1998, and any role played by the political donations of HIH in this debacle.

I thought that surely, in his tirade of ignorance, rabblerousing and political point scoring, he would eventually address the really acute issue: the 28,000 people facing immediate hardship as a result of the HIH collapse. Remarkably, not once in the entire tirade did the policyholders rate a mention. Not once did the people suffering hardship rate a mention from Senator Conroy. Do you know why, Madam Deputy President? Because he is not interested. He skulks out of the chamber; he cannot bear to face the truth. He is not interested in the hardship, he is not interested in the pressing need to alleviate that hardship; all he is interested in is the politics and the point scoring. </para></talk.start><para>Let me put the record straight. This is what the government's $500 million packageâwhich was announced promptlyâwill do. I hope people listening to the broadcast this afternoon will take note of this. The government has announced a package which will pay 100 cents in the dollar for Australian citizens or permanent residents who have salary continuance policies and disability policies. The government will pay 100 cents in the dollar for personal injury claims where the insured is an Australian citizen, a permanent resident or an Australian small business. The government will pay 100 cents in the dollar for claims for a total loss on a primary place of residence where the insured is an Australian citizen or a permanent resident. The government will pay 100 cents in the dollar for claims where the insured is an Australian not-for-profit organisation. The government will pay 90 cents in the dollar for other claims where the insured is subject to an income test where the family taxable income is less than $77,234, and it increases by $3,139 for each additional child. A policyholder qualifies regardless of the size of their claim.</para><para>Secondly, where family taxable income is more than $77,234âincluding $3,139 for each childâthe policyholder qualifies for assistance if the claim is more than 10 per cent of the family taxable income. As well, the government will pay 90 cents in the dollar where claims have been lodged for Australian businesses that have 50 employees or fewer. </para><para>Throughout the five-minute tirade from Senator Conroy, we did not hear a word about that. People listening to the broadcast of these proceedings, had they listened to Senator Conroy, would not have been informed of those measures which are addressed specifically to alleviate hardship in each of the seven categories of cases that I have identified. Rather, they would have heard an unseemly, grubby tirade of political point scoring and rabblerousing. </para><para>Isn't it interesting that, at a time of real crisis and at a time when Australian families and Australian small business people are suffering from the worst corporate collapse in Australian history, one side of politics in this countryâthe governmentâhas addressed itself to the priority of moving swiftly to alleviate hardship by, in a matter of weeks if not days, reconstructing one of the largest corporate entities in Australia to handle the outstanding claims. The other side of politicsâthe Labor Partyâhas taken absolutely no interest in participating in the debate about how these cases of hardship might be addressed swiftly and sensitively; rather, it has played a blame game. It is looking only for the political dividend; it is not looking to the public interest and to the needs and interests of the policyholders. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>23952</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIsn't it marvellous that Senator Brandis comes in here and complains about Senator Conroy for not dealing with one aspect of this matter in his five-minute contribution, when the cabinet of his own government took two months to discuss this matter!

Have a look at an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline> of 20 May headed `HIHâWe're not taking it anymore. Survey reveals public contempt for corporate Australia.'

The polling says we are losing on this one. We had better act.' After two months of doing nothingânot five minutesâthe government says that we had better have a royal commission. To show you just how much this has been driven by the polling, one would have thought that if the government had been giving this serious consideration over the last two months they would have been a lot closer to announcing the terms of reference for a royal commission. But, no, they will tell us about that later. What did Senator Kemp say in question time today? He said, `We will tell you in the fullness of time.' The Australian community needs to know whether the full concerns of Australians will be attended to in the terms of reference of this royal commission. Certainly there is nothing we can glean from the answers presented today which would indicate that there is any more in this package than an eye to the next poll.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government have made a decision that the polling is wrong for them on HIH. How do they get this off the agenda? By saying, `We will agree to a royal commission, but if we can stall a bit on the terms of reference it will not start until later in the year. We can stonewall on every question by saying, âWe have referred it to a royal commission and we are going to put taxpayers' money upâânot the insurance industry's money upââto pay these claims.â This is going to sit there, and hopefully this is going to put a bandaid on this huge wound on the government's credibility until after the next election.' Well, I have got news for the governmentâthat is, the Australian public is extremely cynical, not just about the business community, as this survey indicates, not just about whether business is selfish, which is what this survey indicates, but about this government's motivation for every action that they have taken, because each of those actions have been backflips. They have been in the face of statements that this was not the appropriate course of action. When it was clear that the polls were going against them, this government said, `We had better change tack; we will throw some money here; we will make a decision there; we will do anything to try to hang on to government.' </para><para>But the reality is that you are not going to do it. You have no credibility on this. This backflip is just going to be seen, along with all of the others, as a desperate attempt by this government to get an issue off the table before the elections. Frankly, no-one in Australia will have any confidence that a royal commission, under this government, will lead to the proper answers being found. But I can tell you this: when Labor wins after the next election we will make sure, because you will fix it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>23953</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âHaving listened to Senator Conroy and Senator O'Brien, one can only assume that they do not support a package that actually helps those 28,000 policyholders who have been affected by the collapse of HIH. There was not one word from Senator Conroy, as my colleague Senator Brandis pointed out, about the 28,000 policyholders who have been affected by the collapse of HIH. Senator Brandis reminded Senator Conroy of the fact that he was not concerned about them and then Senator O'Brien got upâand how often did we hear from Senator O'Brien about the 28,000 policyholders? Not onceâand, like Senator Conroy, Senator O'Brien makes his brief contribution and goes out the door as quick as he can go. It is very easy being in opposition. You can make any amount of irresponsible statements and any amount of irresponsible decisions and have no worries about going through the proper processes and arriving at a decision.</para></talk.start><para>When Senator O'Brien talks about a <inline font-style="italic">Herald-Sun</inline> poll where a considerable number of people think there should be a royal commission, what happens? The Labor Party, having the luxury of being in opposition and knowing that they will never have to put into practice anything they say, can say, `We'll have a royal commissionâthat is what we recommend,' whereas those in government who are responsible for putting all of these things into place have to go through the proper processes, which include making sure that you conduct an inquiry into every possible means before you arrive at a decision of what should happen. The government has been proactive all along, but it has to go through these various processes before it can arrive at its decision. </para><para>Minister Hockey on several occasions has proactively sought advice from APRA as to the current situation. Not only that, APRA had advised the government that it did not receive any information from HIH that showed that HIH was insolvent at any time prior to HIH being placed in provisional liquidation. But there was not a word about that from Senator Conroy, who is supposed to be in a responsible position as a shadow minister, and not a word from Senator O'Brien about the issues of what had already taken place and what this government had already done. </para><para>We know that ASIC is now investigating HIH's corporate governance, as it should. We know that it is investigating its market disclosure and its possible insolvent trading, as it should. These things all take time and a proper process. Now, in addition to that ASIC inquiry, the government, in looking at all of the evidence that is available to it, has decided that it should establish a royal commissionânot the day after it read a poll in the paper, like the Labor Party with no responsibility for their actions. The Labor Party can make policy overnight without consultation, but this government, taking everything into consideration, has decided to establish a royal commission. The one thing that this government will not doâwhich Senator Conroy and Senator O'Brien have doneâis pre-empt the findings of any royal commission. All of the comments made by both Senator Conroy and Senator O'Brien are trying to pre-empt the reasons and the findings of a royal commission inquiry. </para><para>As far as I am concerned, the most important people are those 28,000 policyholders referred to by Senator Brandis. They are the people that this government is going to take care of. Senator O'Brien outlined the amounts those people are going to get. I think that it has been a very considered decision by the government to make sure that those who need help the most are the ones who will receive it. And there are some that this government has decided it will not give compensation to. There are some people who are excluded from the package, and I think that it is important that we remember who those people are. Claims where the insured is not an Australian citizen or a permanent resident will be excluded from the package that this government has put together. Claims for reinsurance contracts, or in the nature of reinsurance contracts issued by HIH, will not be included in this package. We will not be paying claims to any insured who was a director or an officer or an associate of a director or an officer of any company within HIH three years before its failure. I think that is a fair sign of the government's integrity in this process, to make sure that those people who require compensation and those who need it most are the ones who receive the compensation from this government. It would do the Labor Party well to put some consideration into some of their statements before they decide they are critical of what the government is doing. I hope that the next speaker from the Labor opposition will tell us whether they support a package of rescue of those 28,000 policyholders. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>23954</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTo me there are two central and important issues amongst the many complex and very important public policy aspects in relation to HIH.

The other aspect is the role of APRA and ASICâthe regulators. There are other issues but I think, front and centre, the role of APRA and ASIC will be an important and critical issue that has to be examined. Senator Ferguson led into one of the critical questions that needs to be askedâ</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>âAnd he is leaving the chamber, too.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âYes, he is leaving the chamber. I notice that he referred to you and to Senator Conroy leaving the chamber. He said that at no time did the minister ever receive any information that indicated that HIH was in trouble. Let us assume that that is correct. We do not know, and perhaps the royal commission will indicate whether Minister Hockey knew more than he says. But if we assume that that is correct, why didn't the minister receive more information? It was the role of APRA and ASIC to inform the minister and the governmentâand, indeed, to inform the public and the policyholdersâabout problems that were emerging in HIH. The problems were so massiveâit is the largest corporate failure in Australian historyâthat it seems unbelievable to me and to most other commentators that APRA and ASIC did not warn the minister and the government and, indeed, the public and policyholders. Why did this occur? We have some evidence and material on the public record. The APRA annual report for the year 1999 said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The transition to the new organisation was not easy for many of them particularly for people who had enjoyed long and stable careers with their previous employer and for those whose jobs were to move from the former ISC's headquarters in Canberra to APRA's head office in Sydney.</para></quote><para>The APRA annual report for the year 2000 said:</para><quote><para>For many staff this involved a major reshaping of the jobs especially the front line supervisory roles. As part of restructuring and processing and consolidation of APRA's head office operations in Sydney a number of experienced staff left the organisation.</para></quote><para>We look at the funding of APRA. The funding for prudential regulation in Australia has fallen from $59.9 million in 1998-99 to a budgeted $51.1 million in 2000-01. APRA and ASIC had much more work to do, yet there was a reduction in funding. In these two important areasâthe maintenance of existing and experienced staff and the budget allocation to APRA and ASIC to carry out its roleâthe government was central in the policy determination that caused these problems. It is the Treasurer of this country, Mr Costello, who insisted that APRA should be located in Sydney. It was the Treasurer of this country, probably helpedâif we can refer to it as thatâby the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kempâwho determined the budget allocation to APRA and ASIC. </para><para>We are criticised because we supported the legislation. Certainly we supported the legislation when it moved through the parliament, but who attempted to take the credit? Who initiated the creation of APRA and ASIC? It was the Treasurer, Mr Costello. I can recall the Treasurer, Mr Costello, before the 1996 election boasting about the need to create a world's best practice prudential regulator. Amongst other things, of course, he referred to foreign debt and the value of the Australian dollar, but this was, front and centre, his policy. </para><para>It is the Treasurer, Mr Costello, who created APRA and ASIC.

The minister says that it is all history, that there is no need for the government to consider this matter again, that it has all been dealt with, that there is compensation available for veterans who served in this area and that effectively the book is closed on this issue. There are a couple of points I want to make. Firstly, I understand the budget will announce some measures which will compensate prisoners of war who were in the Second World War. It seems, if there is compensation relating to the Second World War, which is even earlier than Maralinga, that compensation for this is appropriate in this day and age. A couple of weeks ago, we had the German government announce that it would be finalising its compensation package for the Jewish people who were treated so appallingly during the Second World War. So I cannot possibly accept that this is history and that it is a closed book.</para><para>The worst point in the minister's response was that there was no acknowledgment that in the last few weeks the British government has actually admitted that Australian veterans were deliberately exposed to the fallout from these nuclear tests. Just a week or so ago, we had the shameful situation of governments suggesting that the exposure was just to the clothing and that it was not meant to look at the health effects on the men who were testing that protective clothing. We have been fed lies. The veterans have been put through not only terrible exposure but ongoing illnesses which affect their families as well as them. But this government keeps turning its back on that situation, as did the previous government.</para><para>I referred in my question to the royal commission. I will just read a couple of the recommendations of that commission. It said:</para><quote><para>16.0.3  Most of the people exposed to ionising radiation at Emu, Maralinga and Monte Bello Islands are thus covered by this Actâ</para></quote><para>that is, the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971. It continues:</para><quote><para>However, it is possible to identify other groups of people who are not so covered. These are people who worked at the test sites during and after the nuclear program and who may have been exposed to ionising radiation and who were not in the above categories of employment. This would include, for example, some day workers at the Kwinana construction company who remained at Maralinga after the explosion at One Tree and people employed in salvage operations. A further group of people includes some who were exposed to the Black Mist following the Totem 1 explosion, and the Milpuddie family. </para><para>16.0.4  The Royal Commission believes that access to the benefits of the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971, including the shifting of the onus of proof from the claimant to the Commonwealth imposed by sections 30 and 31, should be extended to include civilians not presently covered by the Act who were at the test sites at the relevant times, and to Aborigines and other civilians who were exposed to the Black Mist.</para></quote><para>Back in 1989, Senator McLean, a Democrats senator, raised this at the first official atomic test anniversary at Monte Bello. He pointed out:</para><quote><para>(ii) that it is estimated that only 12 nuclear veterans of more than 15 000 people involved in the program will qualify for compensation under the Government's recently announced provisions;</para><para>(iii) that Mr Doug Rickard, a civilian whose case was critical in triggering the McClelland Royal Commission, will not be compensated and that this illustrates the grossly discriminatory nature of the recent compensation provisions, and</para><para>(iv) that Mr Ric Johnstone, the first nuclear veteran to fight and win compensation, took 35 years to succeed and will retain, after legal costs and reimbursements, less than $200 000 of the $700 000 awarded to him ...</para></quote><para>The point the commission was making is that the onus of proof should not be placed on the veterans concerned. There is ample evidence to show that, if you were in this area at the time when those tests were conducted, there is a grave likelihood that you would be affected by them.

On 5 October 2000 Senator Forshaw gave notice in the Senate that he intended to move that the order be disallowed. On 12 October the order was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee.</para><para>The Committee received submissions and heard evidence from interested parties and presented its report to the Senate on 4 December 2000.</para><para>The Government response to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report dated December 2000 on the Provisions of the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry (High Quality Beef Export to the European Union) Order 2000 is as follows.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline>. The Committee recommends that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (High Quality Beef Export to the European Union) Order 2000 not be disallowed in the Senate.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline>. Accepted.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline>. The Committee recommends that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (High Quality Beef Export to the European Union) Order 2001, when prepared, allocate quota based on the 1999/2000 performance year, but that future allocations continue on the basis of 100 per cent European Union (EU) shipment records.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline>. This recommendation is not accepted. It overturns the policy intent of the Minister's December 1999 decision, which is only part of the way through the agreed three year period before a review of the process. This recommendation would simply create further uncertainty in both the domestic and EU markets.</para><para>It is clear from the evidence provided to the Committee that over the past three years' trading patterns for the export of high quality beef (HQB) to the European Union (EU) have been similar. Some exporters have consistently shipped beef to the EU while, at the same time, others have consistently sold their quota for their own personal gain.</para><para>To return the tonnage in accordance with Recommendation 2 would involve a significant cost to both producers, who would miss out on their premium, and place EU-listed plants at a commercial disadvantage. Under the arrangements now in place, producers who meet the stringent EU cattle requirements are being paid premiums over and above other cattle types. Those producers who are responding to the requirements of this niche market are being rewarded accordingly. Likewise, those exporters who invest in plants and infrastructure in regional and rural Australia to meet the high compliance costs in exporting to the EU, are now benefiting by not having to purchase quota access rights at a significant financial cost.</para><para>Returning the tonnage to a majority of the Common Interest Group (CIG) members or those who have not shipped would place them at a significant commercial advantage. They would position themselves through commercial instruments to retain the quota access rights on an ongoing basis that would ensure quota premiums are not returned to producers or EU supply chain participants. Clearly this recommendation reinstates non-EU participants back in the market-place, as was the case before the Minister took his 23 December 1999 decision.</para><para>The Cattle Council of Australia (CCA), the Australian Beef Association (AB-A) and the EU accredited processing plants support the continuation of the existing EU HQB allocation arrangements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline>. The Committee recommends that where exporters choose not to reenter the EU HQB market in 2001/2002 through a decision of their own not to meet the EU accreditation standards, their uncommitted quota allocation should be available to EU accredited packer exporters and non-packer exporters currently in the market. Allocations of uncommitted quota should be on the basis of applications to the Secretary of AFFA.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline>. This recommendation is not accepted. If exporters received quota allocated under the conditions identified in Recommendation 2 they would develop commercial contracts with some processors to retain the quota in their name for the future. Further, exporters are invited to apply for quota each year and only those that apply are considered in the allocation process. Exporters that decide not to re-enter the EU market would not therefore be expected to apply and any allocation they might have received would automatically be re-distributed among the remaining eligible exporters. It is quite improbable that anybody would hand valuable quota rights back or sell it for one last time when they could negotiate a deal to retain the ongoing annual quota premium for themselves.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline>. The Committee recommends disadvantaged exporters that applied to AFFA for quota under the exceptional circumstances provision in 2000 should be in a position to withdraw that application. Where disadvantaged exporters do not withdraw that application and in fact receive quota under the exceptional circumstances provision, they should not be eligible for an allocation of quota based on the 1999/2000 performance year (Recommendation 2).</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline>. The first part of this recommendation is accepted. Applicants are able to withdraw their application and there is nothing in the guidelines or the Order preventing them from doing so. However, the second part of the recommendation is contrary to the policy intent of the Minister's decision and the comments made under Recommendation 2 are also relevant.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5</inline>. The Committee recommends that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (High Quality Beef Export to the European Union) Order 2001, when prepared, retain the new entrant provision.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline>. This recommendation is accepted. It has always been the Government's intention to retain the new entrant provision in the order, with 400 tonnes to be set aside in 2001/2002 and 2002/2003.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">CONCLUSION</inline></para><para>The broad intent of the allocation process is supported by the majority of the industry, in particular the producers and processors that actually supply the EU market. Provisions are in place and remain available for potential new entrants to the EU HQB export market. The current policy will remain in place and future allocations will be based on shipped performance to the EU. This will give certainty to the market place and not add further pressure to an already depressed EU HQB market.</para></quote><para>âââââ</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE EMPLOYMENT, WORKPLACE RELATIONS, SMALL BUSI-NESS AND EDUCATION REFEREN-CES COMMITTEE</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">`ASPIRING TO EXCELLENCE: REPORT INTO THE QUALITY OF VOCATIONAL EDUC-ATION AND TRAINING IN AUSTR-ALIA'</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">MAY 2001</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">INTRODUCTION</inline></para><para>The Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee, Aspiring to Excellence: Report into the Quality of Vocational Education and Training in Australia.</para><para>The primary issues raised by the Inquiry deal with quality assurance and the issue of national consistency.

The national VET objectives already encompass that concept.  A Bridge to the Future:  Australia's National Strategy for Vocational Education and Training 1998 - 2003 and its supporting paper Achieving Equitable Outcomes address the issue of equitable access to VET.  The Strategy develops a conceptual framework to social justice and managing diversity and takes a strategic approach including the implementation of targeted responses to equity issues and addressing the issues of resource allocation and incentives.  In addition, in June 2000, the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) Ministerial Council agreed to Partners in a Learning Culture:  Australia's National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Strategy for Vocational Education and Training 2000-2005 and Bridging Pathways:  The National Strategy for Increasing Opportunities for People with a Disability in Vocational Education and Training and Blueprints for their implementation.   These documents provide additional strategies to provide equitable access for indigenous people and for people with disabilities.

The ANTA Ministerial Council agreed in June 2000 to work co-operatively to achieve a fully integrated National VET System.  In November 2000, the ANTA Ministerial Council gave further consideration to the issues of achieving national consistency and adopted the recommendations proposed in the report on Achieving National Consistency in the VET System, including: revising the current Australian Recognition Framework arrangements; establishing a national information web site; enhancing arrangements for consistency of Training Package recognition and implementation and revising arrangements for Training Agreements to reflect a consistent national approach.  Ministers also agreed to the progressive introduction of a National Code of Good Practice for New Apprenticeships from early 2001 and agreed to the appointment of a trouble-shooter for national employers to work with States, Territories and the Commonwealth to facilitate access to New Apprenticeships.  Ministers also considered a  report on nationally consistent legislation following work that was initiated by the Commonwealth Minister and agreed by State and Territory Ministers.  Ministers resolved that the âmodel clausesâ option (whereby the States and Territories would amend their existing VET legislation to include substantially the same clauses developed through a collaborative process) be implemented in the short term with further consideration to be given to the ANTA Board's recommendation that the âcodified legislationâ option (involving adoption by all States and Territories of the same nationally agreed legislation) be adopted in the longer term.</para><para>(b)	The Government recognises that skills acquisition is an integral part of Australia's ability to be competitive in the global economy.  A Bridge to the Future:  Australia's National Strategy for Vocational Education and Training 1998 - 2003 gives skills acquisition high priority, particularly through its first and fourth objectives, equipping Australians for the world of work and increasing investment in training.</para><para>In 1999 the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs moved to address the issue of skills shortages by initiating the National Industry Skills Initiative.  This is a partnership with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), the Australian Industry Group (AiG), the Business Council of Australia (BCA) and the National Farmers' Federation.(NFF).  Industry led working groups were established to enable consultations with the engineering, automotive and electro technology industries. As a result an Industry Skills Forum was held in April 2000 at which the Minister announced industry action plans aimed at tackling the factors underlying skill shortages in these industries.  Task forces have now been formed for these industries and will be reporting to the Minister with further updates in June 2001.  </para><para>Industry led working groups have also now been established for three further industries, the building and construction, food trades and rural industries.

There is wide variation of experiences in on the job training and the Government is concerned that a full prohibition on fully on the job training may limit unnecessarily the provision of the most appropriate training in some circumstances.  The Committee adopted the terms `workplace training' and `on the job training' to distinguish between training that is delivered primarily off the job at the workplace and that which is experienced by an apprentice or trainee through the performance of normal work duties. The report also refers to the further distinction between training that is delivered primarily off the job but which is reinforced in a workplace context and structured workplace learning âwhereby competence is acquired ... through the performance of normal work dutiesâ. To further quote the report âThis may include: the structuring of experience-led learning opportunities in the workplace through such means as job rotation, sequencing of the learner's activities, increasing the variety and complexity of work tasks; and ?training on the job through coaching, mentoring, work shadowing, supervision and job instruction.â </para><para>The Committee strongly supports training which âis competently provided in a real work context, that is, either on the job or in the workplaceâ, and notes that submissions it received indicate that support for the concept of structured workplace training is strong.

This is designed to ensure that awards include trainee wages as well as junior rates. But the choice of which to use should remain with young people and employers.  Young people and employers should not be forced to enter a formal training scheme if they do not want to. Young people and employers who choose junior employment without formal training should not be prevented from doing so by the workplace relations system.

The site is vacant and surplus to Defence requirements. Defence therefore intends to sell the site.</para><para>Madam President, the proposed works are intended to optimise the revenue return from the future sale of the site. A range of site preparation works are intended to reduce uncertainties which may have been perceived by prospective purchasers and thereby increase the range of sale options.</para><para>Once the site preparation works have been completed, it is expected that the site will be used as a residential development.</para><para>The estimated cost of the proposed work is $31.6 million. The work involves an extensive site filling, stabilisation and construction of infrastructure program, the main elements of which include:</para></quote><para>Â·	stripping topsoils and regrading the exposed surface to prevent ponding and enhance the flow of surface water;</para><para>Â·	installing vertical prefabricated band drains from the prepared ground level to varying levels below ground; and </para><para>Â·	forming a fill platform above the one in a hundred years flood level.</para><para>Â·	They also include:</para><para>Â·	constructing an access lane off Silverwater Road for construction traffic;</para><para>Â·	installation of sewer pipe reticulation; stormwater drainage works, water supply pipe; </para><para>Â·	construction of roads;</para><para>Â·	construction of landscaping and water quality control works;</para><para>Â·	installation of power, gas and communications reticulation; and</para><para>Â·	reconstruction of a seawall near the southern boundary of the site.</para><quote><para>The estimated cost of $31.6 million also covers design, site establishment and environmental controls, excavation, treatment, backfilling and compaction of fill, seawall protection works and management of ground water. It should be noted that the estimated cost includes a contingency for both the filling and stabilisation costs and infrastructure costs.</para><para>Madam President, in  all of its reports, the Committee gives specific attention to environmental and heritage issues. In the case of the Ermington project, the Committee was advised by the Department of Defence that the consultants engaged to undertake a flora and fauna assessment of the site of the proposed development had found no endangered species listed under either the Commonwealth's Endangered Species Act or the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act. The assessment also found that the majority of the vegetation on the site consisted of species introduced to the area.</para><para>With respect to heritage issues, no buildings or structures of heritage importance remained on the site.</para><para>Madam President, the Committee is strongly of the view thatâin projects such as this one at Ermingtonâit is essential that the Department of Defence involve the wider community in the works process.</para><para>The Committee is very supportive of the Community Reference Group process undertaken prior to the commencement of the works at Ermington. The Group showed an impressive level of commitment in devising and utilising a program of participation and partnering from the outset.</para><para>Evidence to the Committee from the Residents Committee has provided a snapshot of how a meaningful relationship developed between a proactive, interested community and the landowner, in this case the Department of Defence.</para><para>The Committee is of the opinion that an ongoing community involvement, such as that proposed with respect to the Ermington works, will lend greater legitimacy to an agency's actions and facilitate the implementation of projects. In turn, such consultation should also minimise disturbance to the community.</para><para>Madam President, on the basis of evidenceâboth public and in cameraâpresented as part of the Inquiry process, the Committee concluded that the proposed site works will reduce uncertainties perceived by prospective purchasers and will increase the range of sale options available to the Department of Defence. Additionally, the Committee is of the view that the proposed works represent value for money and have the potential to maximise the revenue return to the Commonwealth from a future sale of the site.</para><para>Further, on the basis of evidence presented to the Inquiry, the Committee concluded that the proposed works have the potential to provide long term benefits to the Ermington community and the Parramatta region.</para><para>The Committee has therefore recommended that the proposed site filling, stabilisation and construction of infrastructure proceed.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to thank the Department of Defence, and in particularly Mr Bernard Blackley and Mr Mathew Beggs for their assistance during the Inquiry. </para><para>Once again I would also like to thank Ian Ireland from the Parliamentary Library. Ian was seconded to the Committee's secretariat last year and has assisted the Committee with other inquiries. We thank him for the valuable advice and the assistance that he has provided us in the conduct of this Inquiry and the preparation of the report.</para><para>I commend the Report to the Senate.</para></quote><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee </title><page.no>23982</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>23982</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>23982</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to return to item 11, `Tabling of documents', and the government responses to committee reports presented to the President since the last sitting of the Senate in Canberra.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>âI seek leave to move a motion in relation to the government response to the report of the Senate Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Committee, <inline font-style="italic">Aspiring to excellence</inline>, which was tabled in November last year.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>I draw to the Senate's attention that this is a government response to a committee report which was, as I said, tabled in November of last year. It is a report that arose from 150 submissions from Australians all across this country. It is a report which represents not just the views of a handful of opposition senators; it is in fact a coalescence of the informed views of dozens of vocational education professionals, industry people, government officials and individuals. It represents the views of people who are in the vocational education systemâstudents, teachers and various peopleâand who genuinely know what is happening within vocational education in this country at the moment. These are the people who have the experience and who know what works and what does not. In a sense, it is those people who really ought to be able to claim credit for this report, because it is very much their report.</para><para>So I was somewhat disappointed to receive the government's response to the committee's report, which essentially sought to wipe off the totality of this experience and this informed opinion with a series of rather trite responses to a whole measure of quite serious propositions that have been put to the government. When the government rejects the recommendations out of hand, it is also rejecting out of hand the very valuable insights of hundreds of people across this country who were prepared to put their views to the Senate and consider in a very careful and serious way the options that should be presented to develop a much stronger vocational education system in this country. </para><para>Remember, it is a system that caters for 1.8 million Australians. Vocational education stands at a critical point in its history. We have seen quite clearly that it has been asked to pay a very high price in terms of the quality of the programs that have been provided as a direct result of this government's policies, which have been to essentially starve it of funding since 1996. It has been instrumental in introducing and developing a policy of growth through efficiencies. We have seen a whole series of measures taken by this government which allow the rorting of the system by, unfortunately, too large a number of private providers. We have seen a series of slapdash measures that have been adopted and resorted to in order to produce a system, in which ever increasing numbers of people are enrolled, without the necessary commitment to quality in terms of the products that are produced by the system itself. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">Aspiring to excellence </inline>provided a considered analysis of the deficiencies and some of the strengths of the current system. The consequence of this government's policies is clearly identified in terms of a decline in quality, as I have already mentioned. This was measured in the Schofield reports and various other reports by state governments across this country. The report also drew attention to the quite extraordinary levels of skill shortages that are now developing within this country as a result of the failureof this government to concentrate on what is really needed in terms of the future demands of industry and of society. We saw, through this report, the need to develop a national code of quality for the system which was underpinned by a legally enforceable regulatory regimeâan enforceable set of standards and procedures together with various performance measures to ensure that we were genuinely getting value for money and that people were not being ripped off by the unscrupulousâto ensure that there is the maintenance of quality and standards which is appropriate to meet the needs of this country for the future.</para><para>We have seen in the government's response that they say employers and businesses are entitled to benefit from operating within an international framework and that that is the whole purpose of the modern economy. They say that one ought to be able to go out into the world and trade without restriction. They do not say that workers are entitled to ensure that they, too, have the opportunity to operate within a national scheme which is able to be measured internationallyâand competitively internationallyâand is of high quality and that the qualifications people earn are in fact respected and accepted right across the country, no matter where people live. Quite clearly, the present system does not allow that to occur. We ought to be looking for a system that actually ensures that we do not have the skill shortages that we currently have and that we do have quality qualifications that genuinely mean some-thing. </para><para>The third issue that the report dealt with was the question of the government's failure to meet its funding obligations and to provide genuine leadership to ensure that it did develop partnerships with workers, industry and state governments to ensure there were proper processes in place so that real needs were actually met through our vocational education system.</para><para>What we have seen in this government's response is quite clearly a neglectful, patronising and evasive approach being taken by this minister. We have seen quite clearly the government's view about what it is not interested in. We see that it is not interestedin ensuring that vocational education professionals are properly represented on the various boards and authorities within the system and that education is given due weight within the system, rather than just a reliance on training. We see that the government is not interested in protecting the interests of students. We see that it is not interested in protecting or minimising the levels of wastage through undertaking proper research into non-completion rates. What we also see is that the government is not interested in guaranteed outcomes in regard to a national system or a quality assurance system within vocational education. We also see that the government is not interested in ensuring that proper leadership is shown and that the appropriate relationships are developed with the state governments, with business and with organisations representing working people in this country.</para><para>We note from this government's response essentially that they have once again missed out on an opportunity to come forward with real policy initiatives. We see a neglectful and patronising style being adopted by the government. They say, `Anything that is worth considering, we are already doing. Whatever is not working, we are not particularly interested in fixing.' As I say, you can read through these recommendations one after another. What you note is that where they are required to take action, they say, of course, `We've got a report into that.' They say, `We do acknowledge that there are weaknesses in the arrangements, but we are looking into that.' There is no commitment here to address those fundamental problems that have been so widely identified across the system. </para><para>On the issue of growth funding, which is probably the most fundamental of all the problems facing the system at the moment, we note that the government's response is a cop-out. We see reports in the paper that there are proposals by this government to provide additional funding for the vocational education system this year, despite the fact that now six months have passed since the end of the last funding agreement. As we go month by month, quite clearly a deep-seated crisis is developing within our TAFE colleges across this country.</para><para>The government have so far offered $75 million in growth funding. Of course, they present it as, in reality, $480 million. As usual, Dr Kemp's tricky and dishonest approach is taken on these questions. What we do not see is any real commitment being made to measure what is genuinely needed in terms of the growth of the system. We hope that perhaps tonight there is an opportunityâin fact, there is one opportunity leftâfor the government to come forward with some measures that will genuinely come to terms with the growth in the system. You simply cannot have compound growth rates, as we have seen in recent times, without additional resources to support them. </para><para>In recent years we have seen growth rates approaching six per cent but what we have seen from the government, on the other hand, is a reduction in Commonwealth funding. When you take out the normal indexation that applies for prices and the rest of it, in real terms this government is providing less money for our TAFE colleges than it has provided in the past. The situation now is thatâand for five years the Labor Party has been saying this is neededâgrowth has to be funded properly. We must move forward to a quality assurance regime that is genuinely national in scope and legally enforceable. This government response is recognition by this government that it is basically not interested. It is not interested in serious reform in vocational education and training. It is not interested in genuinely meeting the needs of the Australian people, be they through business or in terms of citizens as workers. It is certainly not interested in the needs of citizens.

I do not intend to take long or to use up the full amount of time allocated to me, and I will seek leave to continue my remarks at the end of these few comments. Firstly, I want to express the opposition's strong disappointment with the government's response to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report. This report was handed down in December 2000. The report considered an order made by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, in December 1999 when he changed the system of allocation of export quotas for beef into the European Union market.</para><para>The committee had the opportunity through the estimates proceedings last year, on a couple of occasions, as well as through its formal inquiry into the minister's order, to examine in some detail the circumstances surrounding the minister's decision. What came to light was the ineptitude, the lack of attention to detail and, generally, the gross incompetence of the current minister and former ministers, particularly Ministers Vaile and Anderson, in regard to this whole issue.</para><para>The committee brought down a unanimous report. The committee is chaired by Senator Crane, and I notice Senator Calvert is present in the chamber. As an active member of that committee, I am sure that Senator Calvert will recall that the committee was presented with evidence that, firstly, showed there was an unfair retrospective application of the order. The commercial interests of certain companies involved in the beef industry were affected through a retrospective application of changes to the way in which the export quotas would be allocated.</para><para>Secondly, what became evident to the committee through the various proceedings and, as I have said, through the estimates hearings as well was that there was certainly some evidence to suggest that some companies were in a position to have advance knowledge of the government's proposed changes in regard to this system of allocating European Union beef quotas. As a result, there may well have been an advantage gained by some companies over others. We on the committee, in this unanimous reportâI again stress `this unanimous report'âwere concerned about these two issues: that is, the issue of retrospectivity and the issue of potential commercial advantage. We made five recommendations to the government to deal with those two issues as well as the future system that should operate with respect to allocating beef quotas. It is unfortunate, therefore, as I have said, given that it was a unanimous report and that they were unanimous recommendations, that the minister has completely rejected those recommendations that would have addressed these very serious issues that the committee highlighted in its report.</para><para>I have to ask the questionâand it will be interesting to hear the views of Senator Crane and other government members of the committeeâwhy has this been allowed to happen? I compliment government members on the committee on their work on this issue, as on a number of issues affecting agriculture and our rural export industries. We have worked towards unanimity on issues where that can be achieved. On this occasion, government members on the committee as well as opposition membersâand Senator Woodley as wellâwere concerned about the maladministration of this change in the department and particularly by the minister. It is therefore unfortunate that this minister once again has ignored the recommendations of members of his own party who, I dare to say, know more about the issues than he does.</para><para>Finally, I would have thought that, by now, whoever drafted the final government response that has been tabled had paid sufficient attention to detail and learned how to spell my name correctlyâbut maybe that is symptomatic of the careless attitude that has been adopted in regard to this matter generally. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage.</para><para>Leave granted; debate

restricting access to assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment to women who were married and living with their husband on a genuine domestic basis, or living with a man in a de facto relationship was inconsistent with the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act, and as a consequence, was invalid under Section 109 of the Constitution.</para><para>It is the Government's view that it was not contemplated that the Sex Discrimination Act would prevent the States legislating to restrict access to ART procedures to women who are married or living in de facto relationships.</para><para>The Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001 will amend the Sex Discrimination Act to ensure that States and Territories can legislate to limit access to assisted reproductive technology services to married couples (or married couples who are not living separately and apart from their spouse) and de facto couples, if the State or Territory wishes to do so.  The amendments will not, however, permit States and Territories to discriminate between married and de facto couples.  Nor will they permit States and Territories to impose an additional criterion of a specified period of cohabitation for de facto couples.</para><para>The Commonwealth has limited constitutional power to legislate in this field.  It is consistent with the States' responsibilities in relation to the regulation of the provision of medical care and treatment that they be permitted to legislate in the area of ART as they consider appropriate.</para><para>This issue primarily involves the right of a child within our society to have the reasonable expectation, other things being equal, of the care and affection of both a mother and a father.</para><para>The amendment deals with ART services.  ART services are defined to mean services using technology to assist in non-coital fertilisation.  </para><para>The main forms of ART include in vitro fertilisation (IVF), artificial insemination, gamete, zygote and embryo transfers.</para><para>IVF involves a range of procedures aimed at achieving pregnancy where there are issues of infertility.   IVF actually means that ova are fertilised outside of a woman's body to allow the fertilised ova (embryos) to be implanted at some later stage.</para><para>Artificial insemination involves the transferral of sperm into the reproductive tract of a woman to achieve pregnancy.  Fertilisation occurs within the woman's body.</para><para>Artificial insemination is used to achieve pregnancy in women who are fertile, but do not have male partners and who do not wish to become pregnant by traditional coital means; by couples where the male partner is infertile (donor insemination); and in some cases where the woman may not be classified as âinfertileâ in the strict sense but nevertheless has been unable to become pregnant by coital means.</para><para>Artificial insemination is by far the most commonly used procedure by single and lesbian women to achieve pregnancy in the absence of female infertility.</para><para>IVF is generally only utilised by single and lesbian women if pregnancy has not been able to be achieved through artificial insemination.</para><para>The Bill will commence upon Royal Assent.</para><para>When the Bill commences, any provisions of the Victorian and South Australian Acts that have previously been ruled inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act and which are no longer inconsistent with that Act will revive.  The amendment will also ensure the validity of the existing Western Australian legislation to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act as amended.  However, the Bill will not preserve State or Territory laws to the extent that they prescribe a required length of cohabitation before a person can access ART services as this is inconsistent with the definition of âde facto spouseâ in the Sex Discrimination Act.</para><para>If a State or Territory chooses not to legislate in this area, the Sex Discrimination Act will continue to apply.</para><para>The Government is acting to ensure that States and Territories have the power to enact legislation to limit the availability of assisted reproductive technologies to married women and those living in a defacto relationship with a male partner.</para><para>In doing so the Government is doing its part to protect the rights of children to have the reasonable expectation, other things being equal, of the care and protection of both their mother and father.</para></quote><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Denman</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23988</page.no><id.no>S292</id.no></debateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 4 April.</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>23988</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>23988</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendment to be moved to this bill.

We received them just before this session. Considering the time involved so far in the process and the recent recess of the parliament, it is a pity that these amendments have been so late in coming forward. Considering how much the Labor Party value transparent processes and full consultation, I would say that they suffer from `do as I say and not as I do' syndrome.</para><para>I would like to initially respond to questions that were asked earlier in this debate by Senator O'Brien in relation to maximum residue limits. I will refer to those as MRLs. Senator O'Brien first asked what the government plans to do to fix the problem of having two sets of MRLs that sometimes contain discrepancies. The senator is correct in identifying that the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, the NRA, and the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, ANZFA, are responsible for maintaining the MRL standard and the Food Standards Code respectively and that both these gazetted standards establish MRLs. The NRA and ANZFA have worked closely to harmonise their processes for determining MRLs. For example, the agencies last year signed a memorandum of understanding establishing an agreed protocol for the assessment of dietary intakes of agvet chemical residues. The agencies are required, however, to work within the bounds of their legislation. At present, it is only after an agvet chemical has been registered for use that ANZFA begins its process to have an MRL promulgated in the Food Standards Code.</para><para>The main cause of discrepancies between the two sets of MRLs is the time taken for the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council to become the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council and for that council to agree to enter an MRL in the Food Standards Codes once an MRL is entered into the MRL standard and a chemical is registered for use. The ANZFA Act prescribes consultation requirements that must be followed before any variation can be made to the Food Standards Code. These requirements must also be followed for MRLs.</para><para>I note that the amendments proposed by Labor to require all ministers to respond in relation to all standards and variations before they can be gazetted could lengthen the delay in rectifying any discrepancies. The limited number of discrepancies that exist between the two standards tend to exist on a rolling basis, with those corrected by decisions taken by the ministerial council being replaced as new registrations or permits are granted.</para><para>The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestryâthrough AFFAâand the Department of Health and Aged Care, together with the NRA and ANZFA, are currently investigating the best ways of harmonising the MRL setting processes. With legislative amendment the probable outcome of this exercise, it is important that the issues be properly considered and sustainable processes established.</para><para>Senator O'Brien stated that one quarter of discrepancies between the MRL standard and the Food Standards Code relate to temporary MRLs associated with permits issued by the NRA. In establishing a temporary MRL, the NRA must satisfy the same legislative criteria as it would in establishing any other MRL, including that the use of a chemical in accordance with the permit would not be likely to have an effect that is harmful to humans. After issuing the permit, the NRA provides information to ANZFA to enable an MRL to be included in the Food Standards Code. As with chemical registrations, the discrepancy will only exist until the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council has agreed to an MRL being promulgated in the Food Standards Code. Although discrepancies are generally short lived and do not compromise consumer safety, ideally they would not occur at all. This is an issue we have already identified as needing to be resolved.</para><para>Senator O'Brien also asked what would happen if there was a case against a person, an organisation or an entity for the possible misuse of an agvet chemical in the form of a residue above the MRL established in the MRL standards but below that established in the Food Standards Code. If a residue was found at a limit below that established in the Food Standards Code but exceeds the level in the MRL standard, generally this would indicate the misuse of the agvet chemical. However, there may also be situations where the NRA has reviewed an agvet chemical and decided it can be used in a way that is still efficacious but results in lower residues. MRLs in the MRL standard reflect the most recent assessment of agvet chemicals undertaken in Australia. Following a review with such an outcome, the NRA will amend the MRL standard as appropriate and suggest to ANZFA that the MRL in the Food Standards Code also be lowered. Until the ANZFA processes have been finalised and the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council has agreed to the lower MRL, the higher level will remain in the Food Standards Code.</para><para>Some jurisdictions reference the MRL standard for control-of-use purposes, and others the Food Standards Code. In the situation Senator O'Brien described, it would be up to the agency responsible for regulating control of use in the jurisdictions to follow up the matter. Senator O'Brien noted that the discrepancies between the MRL standard and the Food Standards Code may have implications for farmers implementing quality control programs. In these cases, it is more likely that agvet chemicals with MRLs that are higher in the MRL standard than in the Food Standards Code will cause concern. In these cases, use of an agvet chemical in accordance with its registered label or permit may result in residues above the MRL established in the Food Standards Code. This outcome supports the need for the four agencies to conclude their investigations and to recommend corrective actions to harmonise or to rationalise MRL setting processes in Australia.</para><para>Senator O'Brien also asked me a number of questions relating to Australia's data submissions re MRLs to Codex. Are Australia's data submissions re MRLs to Codex based on MRLs from the MRL standard or the Food Standards Code? What is the official MRL standard Australia uses in dealing with Codex? If this is the Food Standards Code, how do we explain the difference between the two standards that we apply domestically? Are there situations where the data is submitted to Codex, presumably including national registered users as defined by the NRA, but the actual MRL is determined by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority? Can that situation occur under the current system? If that is the case, what does the government plan to do about it? </para><para>I would like to respond to these questions as follows. As Senator O'Brien is aware, Codex works with a mandate to protect the health of consumers and ensuring fair practices in food trade. I have been advised by Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Australia, AFFA, that Australia submits data to two FAO and WHO expert committeesâthe Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues, the JMPR; and the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, JECFAâwithout formal reference to either the MRL standard or the Food Standards Code. These committees use the raw data submitted to draw their own expert conclusions on proposed MRLs. AFFA has also advised me that Australia does not have an official standard in dealing with Codex. In debate on MRLs in Codex meetings, interjections from the Australian delegation are aimed at ensuring that the standards set by Codex take into account the needs of consumers and producers in Australia as well as other member governments.</para><para>Data is provided by JMPR and JECFA without reference to the MRL setting in Australia. Australia would be submitting data only where a national registered use existed. I point out that Australia is an active contributor to Codex and its related activities. These include the JMPR, the JECFA and the Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Food, all of which consider maximum limits for residues of agvet chemicals. Australia is also actively involved in the Codex committee on analysis and sampling, which is closely linked with the residue considerations. All in all, I believe Australia is very well regarded for its technical and administrative competence in Codex fora.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>23990</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to make a couple of comments in response to the earlier remarks of the parliamentary secretary regarding the opposition's amendments. Senator Tambling expressed his disappointment that the government had only just become aware of the opposition' s amendments. I think the parliamentary secretary doth protest too much, to quote the bard. Firstly, the parliamentary secretary would be aware that the issues covered in the opposition's amendments are the very issues that we raised in the committee report on the <inline ref="S292">Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001</inline>, which was tabled in April this year. In that report of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, the opposition detailed a range of areas of concern in this legislation and that we intended to move amendments to address those deficiencies in the legislation when it came before the parliament. That is the first point. The government has been on notice since the hearings of the committee, and the report, of the issues of concern to the opposition.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, I am advised that representatives of the oppositionâparticularly my colleague Mr Griffin in the other chamber, who is the opposition parliamentary secretary to the shadow minister for healthâhave been in fairly regular contact with the government on the issues to be addressed in our amendments. That is the normal course of events, as the parliamentary secretary knows, particularly when we are endeavouring to convince the government and other parties of the necessity to amend the legislation in order to improve it. So Senator Tambling is wrong again. Whilst he may not have seen the actual text of the amendments, he and the government have been made well aware of the position that has been adopted by the opposition and which is now contained within our circulated amendments.</para><para>The third point I wish to make is that I recallâand no doubt Senator Tambling took the lead from my remarks back in Aprilâthat it was the opposition who complained about the undue haste with which the government was seeking to bring this legislation on and have it dealt with. Indeed, my recollection is that the legislation committee met on a Thursday afternoon by leave of the Senate to consider this very important billâa bill that changes the structure of the Australia New Zealand Food Authorityâand we had to provide a report to the Senate virtually within 24 hours. That was the time given to the opposition to prepare its minority or dissenting report on this most vital piece of legislation. </para><para>We met the government's timetable on that occasion. We expressed our concerns about it, but we did whatever we could to meet the government's timetable. So I want to place it firmly on the record that the opposition is not terribly impressed when the parliamentary secretary comes in here on the first day of these sittings and starts to complain about the opposition'sâon his allegationâfailure to advise the government of what its amendments are. The government has been on notice for some time about our amendments, and I think we should now get on with the debate in the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>23991</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise on behalf of Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, who is this evening in the budget lockup and who was keen to see through the passage of this legislation. The <inline ref="S292">Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001</inline> amends the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 to implement arrangements for a new food regulation system. This system is set out in the intergovernmental Food Regulation Agreement, agreed to by members of the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, on 3 November 2000. The new food regulatory system was developed by a senior officials working group of COAG and was formed in response to the Food Regulation Review Committee, chaired by Dr Blair. One of the important findings of the Blair reviewâand one argued by the food industryâwas that the current system is perceived as inefficient, not least of all because of inconsistencies in the regulatory approaches of the states, territories and local governments. </para></talk.start><para>This bill establishes a new statutory body, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, FSANZ, which is based on the existing ANZFA. The bill separates the new responsibility for policy direction, which will be the domain of a new ministerial council, and the setting of food standards, which will be the responsibility of FSANZ. The Democrats acknowledge that this bill goes some way to addressing problems in the current regulatory environment identified in the Blair review. However, while it is important to eliminate unnecessary impediments to business, the core purpose of food regulation is and must be health and public safety. Senators will be well aware that inadequate government response to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSEâmad cow disease, as we perhaps better know itâin Europe has significantly heightened public concern as to the robustness of food regulation. Public concern in Australia is also apparent in relation to genetically modified foods and food labelling requirements. </para><para>The government asserts that the new system provided for in this bill strengthens the focus on public health and safety. The Democrats believe this assertion is not without its merit in some respects. However, as outlined in our supplementary report to the committee inquiry and in Senator Stott Despoja's speech in the second reading debate, we believe the bill is flawed and cannot be supported in its current form. Accordingly, we intend to move a number of amendments today to ensure the primacy of public health and safety is upheld in the new system. In brief, our amendments go to, firstly, strengthening the basis of risk analysis; secondly, requiring public notification of variations or new standards; thirdly, changing the proposed structure and representation of the new board to better reflect the primacy of public health and safety; fourthly, refining procedures for appointment of the board members, such that merit is the governing principle; and, fifthly, making transparent any academic and/or research associations or interests of board members. The Democrats are aware that the opposition also has a raft of amendments which it intends to move. I would indicate at the outset that there is some considerable overlapping between the Democrats' and the opposition's amendments on these particular issues and we are supportive of the opposition's amendments. </para><para>Mr Temporary Chairman, I note on the running sheet that, in terms of amendments to be moved, we now have, with your consent, Democrat amendments Nos 1 and 2 as they appear on sheet 2198.

We are particularly concerned that the legislation be at arms-length from the industry that profits from the development and sale of food to the Australian and New Zealand communities. We are also particularly concerned thatâand I say this through contact with the New Zealand Greensâthere be parity in the process by which this legislation goes through a review by the parliaments of both nations, in the defence of consumer best practice and best outcomes.</para></talk.start><para>I would flag that the nature of the amendments, which are not yet on the running sheet, is that, insofar as the council is concerned, the Greens would want put into the legislation that it ought to be the health ministers of the several states on both sides of the Tasman who are on the council. We are concerned that, with the way things are goingâcertainly in this countryâwe will see ministers going onto that council representing industry, not the health interests, the consumers' interests. We think that this should be made explicit insofar as the passage of the legislation is concerned.</para><para>You will note that the amendment we are moving would effectively withdraw the suggested membership of the board from industry. Time and again under this government we are seeing those who have a profit motive, a direct gain, going onto boards that are there are to look after the public interest. It should not be that way. We want to see that board made up of health and food experts, consumer representatives and advocates from the community and, of course, representatives from the relevant government departments, but we do not believe it is a place for industry representatives. They already have a huge impact on the body politic. As you know, Mr Temporary Chairman Chapman, industry representatives are very powerful lobbyists in a way that consumer advocates cannot be. They donate to political parties in a way that consumer organisations and the public cannot, and very often the public is unaware of the impact that has on outcomes of the political process. So we believe it is extremely good practice to ensure that those who have a pecuniary interest are not represented on boards that are looking after the public interest.</para><para>I will be watching the passage of this legislation and, consequent to questions I was asking about the Reserve Bank board earlier in the day, if the board is to contain industry representatives, they should declare all pecuniary interests on the public record. That would be a very poor second best. I believe that, if industry representatives are going to sit on boards such as this, they should sever their ties from the industry that pays them their livelihoods and therefore presents a conflict of interest when they go onto a board such as this.</para><para>Finally, when the report is presented, I will be moving an amendment that will ensure that the New Zealand parliament is fully acquainted with this legislation as well. This is the Australia New Zealand Food Authority that we are dealing with; it involves both sides of the Tasman. The Greens in New Zealandâand there are seven of them in the New Zealand parliamentâare concerned that there is no parallel legislation going through that parliament. They are concerned to see that that does occur. I am also concerned to see that it occurs and that we put a rider on the presentation of the report that the bill awaits the presentation of parallel legislation in the New Zealand parliament before we pass it here.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>23993</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move opposition amendments Nos 4, 1, 2 and 39:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(4)	Schedule 1, page 8 (after line 14), after item 37, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">37A  After section 10</inline></para><para>Insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">10AA  Council may issue policy principles</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	The Council may issue policy principles in relation to the development of food standards. </para><para>	(2)	Before issuing a policy principle, the Council must be satisfied that the principle is consistent with the objectives set out in subsection 10(1).</para><para>	(3)	Policy principles are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the <inline font-style="italic">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</inline>.</para><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 36, page 8 (line 8), omit âguidelinesâ, substitute âprinciplesâ.</para><para>(2)	Schedule 1, item 37, page 8 (lines 12 to 14), omit âguidelinesâ (wherever occurring), substitute âprinciplesâ.</para><para>(39)	Schedule 1, item 171, page 45 (line 14), omit âguidelinesâ, substitute âprinciplesâ.</para></quote><para>I will respond to the remarks of Senator Brown at a later stage, when we come to his amendments. We believe these amendments will improve the legislation, particularly as they will allow for policy principles developed by the ministerial council to be scrutinised by the Senate. Our approach with these amendments is similar to that which occurred in respect of the gene technology legislation, passed late last year. In this case, the amendments will also ensure that the Senate and the Australian public have a role in scrutinising policy principles developed by the ministerial council. In the instance where it is evident that these principles conflict with the objectives and the spirit of the objectives of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, the Senate will have the power to disallow them. That is particularly the case, importantly, in the overriding objective of this organisation, which is the protection of the health and safety of the public.</para><para>As senators would be aware, most disallowable instruments come into effect immediately and are then open to parliamentary scrutiny. They cease to have effect if they are disallowedâthat is, there is no hiatus in the operation of the law. This also means that the scrutiny of disallowable instruments is, in practice, flexible enough to deal with urgent cases, so this process will not compromise any policy principles related to urgent matters that affect public health and safety.</para><para>The reasons for our proposed amendments are twofold. Firstly, they address the very real public concern about the expansion of the ministerial council to include ministers with portfolio responsibilities outside the health area. This concern has been stimulated by events recently, and over recent years, in the United Kingdom and in other European countries in relation to the handling of the BSE disaster. Some in our community do not trust that ministers who come to the table representing interests other than healthâsuch as industry, trade and agricultureâwill be able to develop a policy framework that puts the protection of human health and safety ahead of the particular interests that they ordinarily represent. It is important that that is not only done but seen to be done, because, as we are all aware, public confidence in food safety regulation is paramount.</para><para>It is our understanding at the moment that all the lead ministers on the ministerial council, including the Commonwealth minister, represent health portfolios. Unfortunately, there is no legislative or other guarantee that this will be the case in the future. In fact, it is quite possible that, some years down the track, we could see all of the lead ministers, from the various state jurisdictions as well as the Commonwealth, representing other portfolio responsibilitiesâtrade, small business, agricultureârather than the primary area of health. As the establishment of the ministerial council is a matter of an agreement between the states and the federal government, we cannot have any direct influence on that agreement. Nevertheless, we believe that our amendments will provide a safety net to ensure the primary focus remains on health.</para><para>This public perception about conflict of interest may just be that: a perception. But, as I said earlier, public confidence in what is done as well as in what is seen to be done is vitally important. If our agriculture and trade sectors are to operate successfully, Australians must have complete trust in their food safety regulator and those who steer its direction. As I am constantly reminded as a member of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, there is probably nothing more important to our agricultural industries than ensuring that the product we produce, export and consume is safe and, hopefully, healthy. Perceptions are important and, of course, that was a matter of great debate and concern in respect of the gene technology legislation. </para><para>The second reason for our amendments is that there is currently no direct, or even indirect, means of public input into the policymaking process of the ministerial council. That contrasts with the situation under the gene technology legislation. Under the government's proposal, the ministerial council will develop policy with the assistance and guidance of the Food Regulation Standing Committee. That committee is comprised entirely of bureaucrats. While the Food Regulation Agreement and legislation allude to the establishment of a mechanism for the provision of stakeholder advice to the council, the standing committee and the board, the proposal remains woolly, to say the least, and proposes that a majority of industry and non-health interests be represented. Our proposed amendments in relation to policy principles will address these concerns.</para><para>Given the confidence of the Howard government and the states that the expanded ministerial council and the lack of legislative guarantee that health ministers will remain lead ministers will not compromise the FSANZ's objective of protecting public health and safety, I cannot see any reason why there should be an issue with the additional proposed safeguard that we are putting forward in our amendments. If all of the ministerial council's policy decisions are going to be in line with the objectives of Food Standards Australia New Zealand, there will be no need for the Senate to disallow any of the principles that are developed and enunciated. Nevertheless, we believe that the ultimate safeguard should be there. Since, as I have already stated, the process that we are proposing will not interfere with the operation of the law until and if the principles are disallowed by the Senate, there can be no concern about causing undue delay to the implementation of decisions of the ministerial council. </para><para>Finally, the Howard government considered that this very process was appropriate for the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, and that office shares with Food Standards Australia New Zealand the overriding objective of protecting public health and safety. We submit that, if it is good enough for a provision for disallowance to be implemented with respect to gene technology, it is also appropriate that it be inserted as an amendment to this legislation with respect to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>23995</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis group of amendments would, I suggest, remain the core sticking point for the government. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure scrutiny of the ministerial council's policy guidelines. The reason this scrutiny is required is that the IGA did not make the health ministers the lead ministers on the council. As we heard in the Senate inquiry, there is considerable concern that the council could be dominated by agriculture or trade ministers. We acknowledge that, in the first instance, jurisdictions have nominated health ministers as their lead ministers, but we stress that this is merely contingent and makes no claim on future arrangements. Given the significance of FSANZ for ensuring health and public safety, we Democrats are not satisfied that these arrangements are appropriate. Therefore, we regard the opposition's amendments as a workable safety net.</para></talk.start><para>While we appreciate New Zealand's concern that the Senate should be in a position to disallow policy guidelines, we do not believe that this mechanism represents any danger to FSANZ, provided they act in accordance with the objectives of the act. Our position is quite clear on this. If the IGA reconsiders its position and makes the health ministers from all jurisdictions the lead ministers, we would then be happy to withdraw support for these amendments and not press them when they came back to this House, if that were to be the case. I would like to put on record that we Democrats have been less than impressed by the scaremongering on this issue by the health department. While it is unusual for us to highlight the actions of a department as distinct from the government, we feel that it is warranted in this case. On that basis, we would support amendments Nos 4, 1, 2 and 39 as presented by the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>23995</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak briefly on opposition amendments Nos 4, 1, 2 and 39. Pauline Hanson's One Nation agrees with the principles set out in amendments Nos 1, 2 and 39 to amend the act where it refers to `guidelines' by substituting `principles'. However, we have problems with the opposition's proposed amendment No. 4. Amendment No. 4 sets out to make those issues disallowable instruments for the purpose of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.</para></talk.start><para>I do not disagree with the process of federal legislation that has regulations produced under the head of power of that act, provided that the act refers to the Commonwealth legislation and is specifically restricted to the responsibilities of the federal government. But where a piece of federal legislation within its content allows the states to have an input into that legislation and where the states take up that opportunity and put forward their recommendations under that legislation, I do not believe that the Senate should have a right of veto over those regulations or, in this case, over the council making policy principles. We only have to look at the situation that we are in in relation to the Native Title Act. This federal legislation allows the states to put forward their own legislation which complements the federal legislation.</para><para>I believe it is the right of state governments, which have been elected by the constituency of that state, to be able to put forward legislation and wrong for this Senate to have a right of veto over that legislation put forward by the states. This is what the opposition's amendments are directed towards. The legislation will allow, in this case, the councilâand the minister or the opposition can correct me if I am wrongâwhich is made up of representatives of those states, to put forward policy principles or guidelines. I believe it would be wrong for the Senate to have a right of veto over those decisions. I convey to the opposition that, if amendments Nos 1, 2 and 39 were put forward separately from amendment No. 4, I would support them. I would not support amendment No. 4.

It flies in the face of the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of New Zealand establishing a system for the development of a joint food standards treaty.

I would also point out that the gene technology arrangements, on which these amendmentsâthe detail of which I note we were only made aware of at 2 o'clock this afternoonâseem to be based, are fundamentally different from the food regulatory arrangements in important respects. Let me point out three: firstly, the Gene Technology Act does not affect another sovereign nation. The inclusion of this amendment would disenfranchise the governments not only of Australian states and territories but also of New Zealand. Secondly, while the Gene Technology Act is more a matter for Commonwealth responsibility, Australian food safety is a constitutional responsibility of the states and territories. Thirdly, under the gene technology arrangements, the Gene Technology Ministerial Council may make both policy principles and policy guidelines.</para><para>The Labor amendments have attempted to reflect these arrangements with minimal consultation with states and territories in the legislation so that the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council, despite the intergovernmental agreement making clear that it is to make only policy guidelines that are non-disallowable, can now make disallowable policy principles. The passage of these amendments would be ignorant of these important distinctions. It would be ignorant of the Food Regulation Agreement 2000. If ever put into operation, by itself it would likely lead to the disintegration of the system. I am therefore very surprised that these amendments would be proposed by the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>23996</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support the amendments.

But the Senate is a place where the public can have an input if they think things are going off the rails. Democracy is fragile, but I support it to the nth degree. A review by the national parliament of the outcome of an authority like thisâand I believe the same should pertain in New Zealand and so do the Greensâought to be a very reasonable and basic democratic principle.

During the Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearings, a number of organisationsâin particular, the Australian Consumers Association, the Public Health Association and the Dieticians Association of Australiaâcalled for the precautionary principle to be included in the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act through amendments to the ANZFA Amendment Bill 2001. That request has been supported publicly by various other organisations as well as groups such as Gene Ethics.</para><para>Senator Greig's amendment, which has just been rejected by the Senate, was based on the Rio declaration wording. Whilst we in the opposition have strong support for that declaration and that principle, we have particular concerns about merely reflecting it in the way that the Democrats sought to do in their amendment. Indeed, our track record on this issue is a good one in that it was the Labor opposition that sought to amend the original gene technology legislation last year to include reference to the precautionary principle. So we certainly support the need for precaution in matters concerning health and safety of humans and the environment. We want to ensure that such safeguards are enshrined in our legislation but we want to do so in a way that is internationally acceptable and unambiguous.</para><para>We are cognisant of the fact that the precautionary principle itself, as elucidated in the Rio declaration, is very complex and essentially environment focused. We do not wish to see that principle therefore lose its currency or be devalued by being amended without due consideration to fit differing situations. Whilst the European Union has stated that a version of the precautionary principle must be taken into consideration in decisions relating to environmental and health issues, it is unclear what wording will apply and how this will or must be implemented by individual countries or whether it must be included in their legislation.</para><para>To date, we have been unable to find the precautionary principle itself, as worded in the Rio declaration, in any other international legislation relating specifically to food safety. Whilst the proposed European food agency has a food specific version, it is not yet operational and this version, as it applies to food safety, remains untested. Versions of the precautionary principle are, however, included in two international documents that cover food matters. They are: firstly, the biosafety protocol, which has not been ratified by Australia and which deals with the international movement of live modified organisms; and, secondly, the World Trade Organisation's sanitary and phytosanitary measures agreement, commonly referred to as the SPS agreement.</para><para>According to advice provided to us, ANZFAâthe Australia New Zealand Food Authorityârecently applied SPS article 5.7 to address potential hazards in relation to human health posed by BSE. The application of precaution in risk management in the context of food safety was also discussed at the 15th session of the Codex Alimentarius Committee on General Principles in April 2000, and further discussion was proposed for the 16th session in April this year. Unfortunately, while the official minutes of that meeting have not been posted as yet, it is understood that the preliminary talks to finalise wording for the 16th session this year broke down and no consensus was reached. The issue is not expected to be reconsidered for a further 18 months.</para><para>Given that an acceptable food safety related form of the precautionary principle, as elucidated in the Rio declaration and the Gene Technology Act, has not been enacted in international or national legislation that we are aware of, and that the WTO's SPS agreementâto which Australia is a signatoryâis specific to issues of food safety and supports a precautionary approach, the opposition therefore proposes an amendment based on the wording from article 5.7 of the SPS agreement to be added to section 10 of the ANZFA Act 1991. That is the impact of our amendment No. 3. This internationally accepted wording allows that, where there is scientific uncertainty in relation to protecting human health and safety, the authority can take legislative or regulatory measures to restrict or prevent an application until such time as additional information is available on which to make a final decision. In doing so, though, Australia must be able to show that such measures are not put in place as a means of unfairly restricting tradeâthat is, that they are not purely protectionist measures.</para><para>In summary, given that, firstly, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, like the Gene Technology Regulator, has the protection of human health and safety as its overriding objective; secondly, there will be overlaps between the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator and Food Standards Australia New Zealand, particularly in relation to genetically modified food; thirdly, there is a need to ensure consistency between our domestic regulators; fourthly, the Gene Technology Act includes an appropriate version of the precautionary principle; fifthly, the wording put forward in this amendment reflects an international WTO agreement to which Australia is a signatory; and, sixthly, ANZFA in the past has used its powers under that agreement to protect human health and safety, we would put forward that there should be no reason whatsoever for the government or the Senate not to support our amendment No 3. Our amendment will certainly strengthen the health and safety objectives of Food Standards Australia New Zealand, and do it in an appropriate way.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>24001</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â`Let us take our directions from the World Trade Organisation, not world's best practice.'

It is a pity that we do not have an opposition that is able to rise to world's best practice and say, `Well, the Europeans are moving in this direction, let's beat them to it, along with New Zealand. Let's set the standard and implement the precautionary principle.' Instead of that, let us go to what the World Trade Organisation has set down. When you read the weasel words involved, it says that if there is not enough information the authority can add or subtract whatever information is available to whatever decision it wants to make on this and that the absence of information is not to be an impediment to allow on to the market a foodstuff about which there are concerns. The precautionary principle says that you should find out first; you should make sure that it is safe before you do that. This says that if there is doubt about it and you do not have good enough information, you can go right ahead and put it on to the market. You can look at the information that is available and check it, but go right ahead. That is nothing like the precautionary principle.</para></talk.start><para>There is the argument, and no doubt the government has the same position, that this might harm trade. But the Europeans are at least moving towards taking a lead, yet again, in a matter of public health and safety and the environment that will set the standard. Where a country does that, it is advantaged because its standards in relation to the production of foodstuffs and the marketing of them are higher than elsewhere. The argument being used here is that those higher standards will be used to block Australian foodstuffs going on to markets elsewhere.</para><para>It is an attractive argument for those who want to see business at all costs and the consumer left to beware. But it is an argument that falls down if you are looking at implementing public safety as the primary rationale for this legislation. Here we see business opportunity being substituted as the primary rationale, and that is why the Democrat amendment should have been adopted and why Labor should have supported that amendment.

It basically says, `Go and get the information to make sure that something is safe, if you don't know.' The problem with this amendment is that it does not do this, and even Senator Harris's amendment still does not say that you have to go and find out. The word `may', of course, comes into this: the authority may, if it wants to, take sanitary or phytosanitary measures on the basis of available pertinent scientific information; and, of course, it may notâjust as well. That is the classic `Leave it to the authoritiesâtake it out of the hands of the parliament, which should be explicit about these things, and give it to the authorities. Let's use the words that the World Trade Organisation prefers, because big business prefers them.' I am not going to support that. However, as usual, we are left with whether we would accept something that is better than nothing. The government is going to support the opposition in this matter.

These are not necessarily health related issues, but they relate to the health of the industry itself and the need, we believe, for continued quarantine measures in that regard. Australia has the opportunity, through the WTO and the negotiations on the SPS agreement, to continue to push to strengthen that agreement where it is appropriate.

The real question here though is not that Australia can say that we will not do it. The question now is: how fragile is our ability to do that?

That is why the matter is contentious and difficult. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Here we are with a you-beaut arrangement, Senator Forshaw tells us, which is going to lead to us saying that, where there is not best scientific evidence available, under this amendment, the authority may provisionally adopt some measures on the basis of pertinent scientific information, or it may not; and in such cases the authority must take all reasonable steps to obtain the information necessary for a more objective risk analysis. It has to get that informationâit does not have to act on itâto do a risk analysis and a review of the sanitary and phytosanitary measures. It has to get the information for that review to be undertaken within a reasonable period of time. If you look at this, what it has to get is the information necessary for some future review to be done within a period of time. It does not have to act upon that information if it does not want to. And why does it not want to? Because these weasel words are part of the international arrangements that successive Australian governments are falling into. They allow big business to get around very clear strictures which should be laid down by Australian parliaments in particular when it comes to consumer protection. </para><para>What we should have here is the precautionary principle and what we are not getting here is the precautionary principle because Labor and the government do not want it. The argument now is that we do not want to go down that path because the World Trade Organisation does not like it either. When you read that, the next thing you read is that the multinational corporations do not want the precautionary principle anywhere. Is that not true? Senator Forshaw might be able to cite some multinational corporation that said, `We want the precautionary principle because we are principled. We want to take necessary precautions when it comes to whatever it is we are selling into the market.' Let us have a newsbreaker here and let us hear from Senator Forshaw where that company exists and where that company has said that.

Nevertheless, I believe that the SPS wording in this amendment will clarify Food Safety ANZ's ability to implement emergency measures and to develop standards within its general powers to identify any potential risks to human health. In such circumstances, this creates an obligation for Food Safety ANZ to undertake further monitoring and revision of the identified risk as evidence becomes available. While this is not the precautionary principle, it is a strengthening of Food Safety ANZ's objective which, when coupled with the authority's primary objective to promote public health and safety, should be seen as an undertaking to increase proactive protective measures against increasing incidents of food safety issues, particularly overseas food borne pathogen, and should be interpreted and implemented as such.</para></talk.start><para>The SPS wording has been tested in Australian food regulation through ANZFA's emergency measures, announced on 5 January this year, to restrict beef imports from approximately 30 European countries. The action did not extend to an ideally precautionary approach; however, the recognised unknown scientific certainty of the risk of dairy products from countries with native cases of BSE was not acted upon, even when it was announced that the scientific studies undertaken by the Phillips inquiry into BSE in the UK were flawedâas was the case with resultant findings that deemed that individuals consuming milk or milk products from an infected animal are at negligible risk of the human variant of the disease.</para><para>A precautionary approach would recognise that it will be another three years before the outcome of the redesigned scientific experiments assessing risk of the infected milk will be known, and that the community should be protected until the extent of the risk is resolved. This is the preferable approachâto guarantee the safety and quality of our food supply, ensuring clean and green produce for Australians and a clean and green advantage for our exports. Our beef industry in particular is already reaping the rewards of this in export markets that are more and more willing to pay premiums for world's best produce.</para><para>We should be aiming for a guaranteed world's best practice food supply and safety system instead of a lowest common denominator approach through harmonisation and compliance with Codex Alimentarius negotiations and standards based on free trade concerns rather than on the highest achievable protection for our health and our environment.

These powers enabled the state health ministers to prevent attempts by the Howard government to water down requirements for labelling of genetically modified foods at the behest of the powerful industry lobby.

The Australian Food and Grocery Council came before the Senate committee and questioned the need for the Senate committee to even be inquiring into the provisions of this bill. I recall the debate during the inquiry, and the suggestion was that the Senate committee was wasting its time looking into the provisions of this bill. Mr Hooke was under a misapprehension also. He apparently was under the impression that the ministerial council's power to amend all applications would be maintained. That was certainly the tenor of his evidence to the committee. He insisted during his evidence to the committee that there was no proposal in this bill to remove that power to amend. Surprise, surprise! Mr Hooke found outâas indeed I think all before the committee found outâthat that was what had happened as a result of the government's proposals in this bill. On that test alone, it was very fortuitous, a valuable piece of work and a valuable exercise of the Senate committee's time to have had that public hearing and to have provided an opportunity for the committee and others to pick up the fact that we were not under any misunderstanding or misapprehension and that, indeed, the government was, through these amendments in this bill to the head legislation, removing the power of the ministerial council to amend applications.</para><para>We propose to reinstate the ministerial council's power to amend all applications and proposals at the time of the second review where it deems it appropriate to do so. I am sure the government will agree with the views of its senior bureaucrat and the views of the Senate committee and will support our amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>24007</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="S292">Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001</inline> reflects the intent of the Food Regulation Agreement, which was to enable ministers to either approve or reject a draft standard or variation after Foods Standards Australia New Zealand has conducted a second review. This was to provide for a sensible balance between ministerial responsibility and accountability through a transparent policy setting and an evidence based setting by the FSANZ board. I think there are issues of expectation here that sometimes go beyond what was originally intended. We will certainly be taking note of those cautiously. The opposition's proposed amendments are contrary to the Food Regulation Agreement.

It begins the largest defence modernisation and upgrade program in over 25 years. It strengthens our borders in the fight against plant and animal disease. It overhauls the operation of our social welfare system. It invests in our health system, in our natural environment and in our most important resource of allâour people.</para><para>And this Budget will strengthen our economy. Most of all it will cut taxes. Tax cuts will bring benefits to business, investors, the young and to older Australians.</para><para>This Budget will cut taxes next year by over $5 billion.</para><para>And the Budget the Treasurer is presenting tonight is in surplus for the fifth consecutive yearâa cash surplus of $1.5 billion.</para><para>Over the last 5 years we have worked hard to secure the nation's finances, first to get the Government to live within its means and then to pay back Labor's debt. At the end of this budget year we will have repaid nearly $60 billion of Labor's $80 billion debt spree.</para><para>As we pay off those debtsâas we get the debt monkey off our backâwe save on interest payments. Today the Government's interest bill is $4 billion per annum less than it was under Labor. That $4 billion of savings can be invested in better things like health and education.</para><para>Madam President, last year's Budget cut income tax for every Australian taxpayer. It abolished wholesale sales tax and replaced it with GST. Every last dollar of GST has been paid to the State Governments. GST now funds the salaries of their policemen on the beat. It pays the salaries of all the teachers in all the classrooms of all the state education systems.</para><para>If we had not cut income tax last July a worker on average earnings would be paying a top tax rate of 43 cents per dollar today. Tax reform brought that down by a third. Today that worker on average earnings has a top tax rate no higher than 30 cents per dollar.</para><para>And tax reform cut tax on transport. Without tax reform Australia's 75,000 truckies would be paying 27 cents a litre more tax on their diesel pushing up the cost of all transport.</para><para>Without tax reform individuals would be paying twice as much tax on their capital gains as they are required to pay today.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Further Tax Cuts</inline></para><para>And tax reform means that from 1 July taxes can be cut further.</para><para>On 1 July this year the company tax rate will be reduced again this time from 34 to 30 per cent. This will cut tax for business by around $2 billion per year.</para><para>On 1 July this year Financial Institutions Duty (FID) will be abolished. This will benefit the 12 million Australians who are currently taxed when they deposit money in their bank accounts and taxed when they make payments on their credit card and taxed when they make their mortgage payments. The abolition of Financial Institutions Duty will save those individuals and other taxpayers about $1.2 billion per year.</para><para>From 1 July this year state stamp duties on listed shares and other quoted securities will be abolished. They will be abolished because The New Tax System pays the money to the States to abolish them. This will save around $675 million per year for the 5.7 million Australians who hold shares and the 7 million Australians who have superannuation funds invested in shares.</para><para>On 1 July this year low income Australians who own shares that pay franked dividends can get a lower tax rate. They can claim a refund of the tax paid on the shares which is over and above their own personal tax. This will save them over $500 million per year in tax.</para><para>On 1 July this year The Simplified Tax System will commence and allow eligible small businesses to do their tax accounting on a cash basis with simpler depreciation and trading stock rules. It will reduce tax payable by small business by over $1 billion in the first three years.</para><para>And tonight, the Treasurer is announcing further measures that will reduce taxes for business.</para><para>From midnight tonight registered business will be able to claim full input tax credits on the purchase of motor vehicles. This was to be introduced from 1 July 2002, with an entitlement to half credits from 1 July 2001.</para><para>But the Government has decided to pull this forwardâa tax cut of over $600 million in 2001-02. This measure is taking effect from midnight tonight because the economy can benefit from itâit will stimulate investmentâand because the Budget can afford it.</para><para>As an example, a business that buys a $35,000 car tomorrow will pay $3,200 less in tax than it would today. A business that buys a large interstate trucking rig with a value of $330,000 would save $30,000 in tax.</para><para>The Budget also provides other tax measures of benefit to business. New capital gains tax concessions will be introduced for listed investment companies.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Tax Cuts for Older Australians</inline></para><para>Madam President, tonight the Treasurer is announcing measures to further cut income tax for older Australians. </para><para>Before the Liberal/National Parties were elected in 1996, older Australians who had saved for their retirement and who did not receive a pension began to pay income tax once their income passed the tax free threshold of $5,400. They paid more income tax than pensioners even when they had the same income.</para><para>We thought that wasn't fair. So one of the first things this Government did in 1996 was to put the self-funded retiree on an equal tax footing with pensioners. It raised the tax free threshold for older Australians to $11,185. A qualifying self-funded retiree did not pay income tax on his or her income below that amount.</para><para>With the introduction of the New Tax System these thresholds were increased. But tonight, the Treasurer is announcing that the Government will go much further still. We will lift the low income aged persons rebate with effect for the current financial yearâthat is backdated to 1 July 2000.</para><para>The increase the Treasurer is announcing tonight will mean that in the current financial year qualifying single self-funded retirees and age pensioners will have an effective tax free threshold of $20,000. That is they will pay no income tax unless their income (including pension) exceeds that amount.</para><para>The effective tax free threshold for a couple on equal income will be lifted to $32,612. Qualifying couples will pay no income tax until their combined income exceeds that amount.</para><para>In addition the Medicare levy threshold for senior Australians will be lifted from its 1999-2000 rate of $13,550 to $20,000 so a senior Australian pays no tax and no Medicare levy until he or she earns above that amount.</para><para>The combined effect of these measures and tax reform means that a senior Australian on an income of $20,000 in 1999-2000 paid tax of $2,688.25. This year they will pay nothing. Senior couples on $20,000 each in 1999-2000 paid tax of $6,140. This year they will pay tax of $2,179.50, a combined tax cut of $3,960.50 or over $75 per week.</para><para>Because these measures are to apply to the current financial year, eligible senior Australians will receive the benefit of these tax cuts by way of a tax refund as soon as they lodge this year's income tax return.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Acknowledging Older Australians</inline></para><para>Madam President, the tax cuts the Treasurer has announced will benefit self-funded retirees and age pensioners who have additional income.</para><para>The Treasurer is now announcing a benefit for those on the full or part age pension. The Government has previously legislated to fix the age pension at 25 per cent of Male Total Average Weekly Earnings, and on 1 July last year it increased it 4 per cent and is maintaining it 2 per cent higher in real terms. But tonight the Treasurer is announcing an additional payment for all those who receive income support and are over age pension age including service pensioners.</para><para>The Government will pay each person who receives a pension or part pensionâthis covers qualifying people with incomes up to $29,263 for a single and $48,880 for a coupleâa non-taxable lump sum of $300. After the Treasurer has finished this Budget speech the legislation to make this payment will be introduced into the House of Representatives. If the payment is to be made with the fortnightly pension payment next month it needs to pass the Parliament by Thursday. Any delay by the Opposition will mean the payment cannot be made next month. There are 2.2 million people eligible for this payment.</para><para>The Government is making this payment because the economy can benefit from it, the Budget can afford it this financial year and, most of all, our older Australians deserve it.</para><para>Madam President, on 1 January 1999 the Government dramatically widened eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. The card enables holders to purchase pharmaceuticals on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for $3.50 instead of the general rate of $21.90. After 52 prescriptions all other scripts in a calendar year are free. From 1 January 1999 the income limit for eligibility for the card was raised from $21,000 to $40,000. Tonight the Treasurer is announcing that on 1 July 2001 it will be lifted further with an income test of $50,000 for singles and $80,000 for couples. This is expected to extend the card to an additional 50,000 older Australians.</para><para>Further, older Australians who hold the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card will be extended the same concessions as pensioners on telephone costs. They will be entitled to a Telephone Allowance of $17.20 per quarter as from September. The Commonwealth will also open negotiations with the States with a view to extending other pensioner concessions to Health Card holders over time.</para><para>For the first time the Government will also introduce twice a year indexation for those on Commonwealth superannuation pensions in line with the Consumer Price Index from 1 January 2002. This will assist those on such pensions to keep up with the cost of living.</para><para>Assistance will be provided to Australians seeking to maintain their superannuation savings in the years immediately prior to their retirement. Accordingly, superannuation assets are to be exempted from means tests for people aged between 55 years and the age pension age. This means they can receive income support without first expending part of their superannuation.</para><para>In recognition of the unique circumstances of their captivity, the Government will make a one-off payment of $25,000 to former Australian Prisoners of War of the Japanese, and to civilian internees and detainees of the Japanese. For those who are no longer alive, payments will be made to their surviving spouses.</para><para>Compensation in similar amounts has been made by the Governments in Britain, Canada and New Zealand to their Prisoners of War. The Parliament will be asked to appropriate this sum before 30 June. No amount of compensation will ever make up for the pain and the loss these diggers suffered. But our nation should make a statement of recognition and thanks.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Australians Working Together</inline></para><para>This Government has begun a whole new approach to welfare and work. We have introduced mutual obligation: the obligation of the community to help those not in work and the obligation of those not in work to contribute to the community.</para><para>This has led to the very successful Work for the Dole program, where eligible people on benefits put back into the community and receive the chance to do useful work which will improve their skills and help them re-enter the workforce.</para><para>In this Budget the Government is making a substantial investment of $1.7 billion over 4 years to improve the way our income support system works. The object is to help those of working age move from welfare to work and to give them assistance to do so.</para><para>Even though employment opportunities have improved in the last 5 years, we don't want people to be left behind. We don't want people to drop out of looking for work and we don't want the system to discourage participation in the workforce. The package of measures contained in Australians Working Together balances these objectives. It has major new incentives to take up work and reasonable requirements for people to take the opportunities on offer.</para><para>The new assistance includes over $700 million to help people find jobsâmore places for Job Search Training and more places in Work for the Dole. Training Credits of $800 will be introduced for people who do Work for the Dole and community work. They can use these credits to pay for training which will qualify them for better jobs. Importantly $147 million more assistance will be provided for people over 50 who are out of work and want to re-enter the workforce.</para><para>A new Working Credit initiative will be introduced to allow those out of work the right to accumulate up to $1000 of earnings without losing income support. This removes a disincentive to take intermittent jobs or short term work which could open the door for them to get long term employment.</para><para>New requirements will be introduced to standardise arrangements for all job seekers aged up to 49. From July 2002, those not in work will receive Job Search Training after three months unemployment at the latest, and will be required after six months to do community work, study, or some other activity which for those aged up to 39 can be Work for the Dole. Parents on income support will be helped to prepare for a return to the workforce as their children approach teenage years through annual interviews with Personal Advisers. From July 2003 parents whose youngest child is in high school will be required to do the equivalent of one day a week of community work, part-time paid work, study, or training if they are receiving parenting payment.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Australians Working Together</inline> will deliver the right balance of assistance, incentives and obligations to help all Australians move forward. It will be a major overhaul of our income support system.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Strengthening Australia's Health System</inline></para><para>This Budget aims to improve the health and medical care of Australian families. With an additional $900 million we are enhancing Medicare, increasing health services in rural and regional Australia and introducing 5 initiatives to treat common health problems that affect Australian families.</para><para>The Government is committed to maintaining and improving Medicare for the benefit of all Australians. In this Budget the Government is increasing rebates for GP services, in particular for longer consultations which will assist the treatment of complex and chronic conditions.</para><para>Second, the Government is taking direct practical measures to boost health services in rural and regional Australia by:</para><para>Â·	Providing $104 million over four years to assist GPs in rural Australia to employ practice nurses. Practice nurses support GPs by providing a range of medical services, managing chronic disease treatment, doing health assessments, and providing clinical support on minor surgery. </para><para>Â·	Funding 100 Rural Nursing scholarships of $10,000 per annum to educate rural students at a rural campus. Rural students are more likely to end up serving patients in rural and regional areas. An additional ten scholarships will be provided for indigenous students or Aboriginal health workers to undertake nursing education.</para><para>Third, this Budget introduces 5 initiatives to address health problems which affect Australian families. It targets treatments for asthma, mental health, diabetes, cervical cancer and alcohol education and rehabilitation.</para><para>Â·	Asthma affects over two million Australians, including one in four primary school children and one in seven teenagers. The Government will establish a 3 stage program for GPs to intervene early to diagnose asthma, develop a care plan and review that plan with the patient. If we treat asthma early we can minimise the risk of hospitalisation for sufferers, particularly our children. </para><para>Â·	The Government will allocate $120 million over four years to improve the quality of care given by general practitioners to those suffering a mental illness which will help them and the families who suffer with them. This funding will be used to educate and train GPs on mental health issues and will provide support for GPs to deliver quality mental health care. </para><para>Â·	Amongst Australians over 25, 3 in 100 have diabetes and know it, 3 have it and don't know it and another 16 are likely to develop it later in life. This Budget introduces an Integrated National Diabetes Program which will provide incentive payments to GPs to improve the diagnosis and management of people with diabetes.</para><para>Â·	A new program will be introduced to increase screening for cervical cancer among high risk women. General practices which reach overall screening targets will receive additional funding. And this is designed to identify problems early and reduce risks before it is too late.</para><para>Â·	The Government will also provide $115 million over four years for a new Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation to help prevent alcohol and other substance misuse. Alcohol abuse is a problem that causes suffering in many families and the Government's new measures are designed to address it.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Building Australia's Resources</inline></para><para>In January this year the Government released an Innovation Action Plan for the future called <inline font-style="italic">Backing Australia's Ability</inline>.</para><para>It is a plan to build Australia's human resources, to support university research infrastructure, to invest in major national research facilities and finance the establishment of world class centres of excellence in biotechnology, and information and communications technology.</para><para>Backing Australia's Ability will encourage R&amp;D and commercialisation of new ideas. Backing Australia's ability added 5500 targeted university places over 4 years and tonight the Treasurer is announcing that the government will in addition, fund up to 1800 undergraduate student places in regional higher education institutions from 2002. This will increase access and participation in higher education in regional Australia.</para><para>In November last year, the Government announced additional funding of $1.6 billion over five years to rebuild Australia's road network. The majority of the funding ($1.2 billion) is being distributed to local councils to build local roads. The remainder is being spent on the National Highway and Roads of National importance such as the Scoresby Freeway in outer Melbourne. This investment in roads is building Australia's infrastructure.</para><para>In December 2000, the Government announced an assistance package of $216 million over two years for farmers and businesses in the flood-ravaged cropping zones of New South Wales and southern Queensland. The package helps those people get back on their feet. As a preventative measure, the government is providing an additional $31 million over four years to implement flood mitigation works to reduce the risk and damage caused by floods.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Safeguarding Australia's Natural Environment</inline></para><para>It is vital that we conserve our environment and natural resources.</para><para>Environmental degradation poses a long-term threat to our quality of life, the quality of future water supplies, and the fragile environment we share as Australians.</para><para>This Government established Australia's first Natural Heritage Trust of $1 billion. Tonight, the Treasurer is announcing that the Government will invest a new $1 billion to extend the Natural Heritage Trust by five years to 2006-07.</para><para>This Trust is the largest ever Government investment in Australia's natural environment.</para><para>It provides a long-term, integrated and comprehensive approach to the conservation of Australia's land, vegetation, biodiversity, coasts and oceans.</para><para>This new investment builds on the $700 million provided over seven years for the <inline font-style="italic">National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality</inline> announced in October 2000. The National Action Plan is the first comprehensive strategy to address salinity and water quality problems in Australia. To work this plan will require cooperation between all levels of government.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Protecting Australian Agriculture</inline></para><para>Madam President, we have seen the damage caused in other countries by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.</para><para>Australia's farmers are the best in the world. We must help them to stay that way. We must protect our country from the risk of plant and animal disease.</para><para>Tonight the Treasurer is announcing a dramatic upgrade in the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, the Australian Customs Service, Australia Post and airports to strengthen Australia's quarantine protection against foot and mouth disease and other risks to our environment and agriculture. An additional $593 million over five years will be used to increase the inspection of mail and cargo entering Australia. We will increase the inspection of passengers and their baggage so that all passengers from all countries that could bring this disease have their baggage inspected. We will work to minimise undue delays for passengers arriving in Australia but we think these steps are necessary.</para><para>To meet these necessary costs, the Government has decided to increase the Passenger Movement Charge by $8 to $38 and continue the policy of full cost recovery for Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and Australian Customs Service programs involving cargo and seaports.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Building Australia's Defence</inline></para><para>Protecting our borders against plant and animal disease is important. One of the principal responsibilities of any national government is the defence of the nation and national security.</para><para>In his last Budget the Treasurer reported on the outcome of Australia's contribution to peace and security for the people of East Timor. With that experience behind us, and an appreciation of how quickly events can unfold and the uncertainty in our immediate region, the Government commissioned the most specific and detailed defence plan put together in the last 3 decades.</para><para>After reviewing that plan, we have budgeted for the largest and most comprehensive investment in our defence capabilities for any Australian government in peacetime. Additional funds totalling $27.6 billion are planned over the next 10 years in addition to previous budgeted funding. This will allow major capital investment projects including the purchase of Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft, the upgrading of the Collins class submarines to high level capability and an increase in the capacity of land forces through the maintenance of six battalion groups.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Economic Outlook</inline></para><para>The Australian economy is forecast to strengthen in the year ahead, with a rebound in growth to around 3Â¼ per cent in 2001-02 reflecting sound fundamentals and ongoing benefits of reform.</para><para>Following a very sharp downturn in the second half of 2000 residential construction, aided by the First Home Owners Scheme and low interest rates, is expected to contribute strongly to growth in 2001-02. Growth will be supported by household consumption, business investment and net exports.</para><para>The average unemployment rate is forecast at 7 per cent in 2001-02 which is around current levels. Unemployment has substantially fallen under the 5 years of Liberal-National Government, with over 820,000 jobs created over our term in office.</para><para>In addition, inflation is expected to decline as the one off increase in the price level caused by tax changes washes out of the index. The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP will remain well below its average level of the last decade.</para><para>Australia's growth performance over the second half of the 1990s has been exceptionally strong. And our policy of economic responsibility, budget balance and debt repayment has kept interest rates low.</para><para>High interest rates turn the dream of homeownership into a nightmare. Nothing helps Australian families more than cutting their largest bill, their monthly mortgage payment.</para><para>When the Government was elected the home mortgage interest rate was 10.5 per cent. Today it is 6.8 per cent. A family on an average mortgage of $100,000 has had their interest payments cut by over $300 a month.</para><para>A return of failed policy which brought the high interest rates of the past would be paid by every family, every month, on every mortgage payment.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Concluding Comments</inline></para><para>The first Commonwealth budget was delivered by Sir George Turner 100 years ago.

It is good advice today. We are still in the early stages of our career as a nation. We are still building in defence, in welfare reform, in tax reform, in innovation, in agriculture, building health care to help our families.

In 1997, Networking the Nation was established by the Commonwealth government for the distribution of the $50 million Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund as a result of the first part sale of Telstra. This was additional to the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust fund, of which Tasmania received 10 per cent. In June 1999, the Commonwealth government announced that an additional part of Telstra would be sold and the resulting funds deployed as a social bonus package. Tasmania was allocated $150 million for a range of specific telecommunications and electronic service delivery related projects, some of which have been supplemented with funds from other sources.</para></talk.start><para>So where has all this money been spent and where has it been delivered? Funds have been used in a variety of ways to cover health, business, culture and tourism or to provide computer access right across the state. Large and small amounts have been allocated, ranging from $2,000 to conduct surveys into proposals to more than $1 million to establish projects such as the Telehealth Tasmania Network. Tonight, I could not possibly describe all the great things that are happening in Tasmania as a result of this fundingâindeed, a brief outline of the allocations for this state covers some 94 pagesâbut I would like to detail some of the programs that illustrate the wide range of benefits which have flowed to Tasmanians.</para><para>The first example is in the business world. TECC, the Tasmanian Electronic Commerce Centre, is based in Launceston. The company's aim is to assist Tasmanian businesses to realise the advantages and opportunities of e-commerce. It does this in a number of ways. It provides an awareness raising, support and advisory service to businesses and supports e-commerce infrastructure and technology developments. It also assists with research and development issues. A wide range of businesses have benefited from TECC's assistance. One example is Muir Engineering, which designs and manufactures state-of-the-art deck machinery and anchoring systems for vessels of up to 100 metres. Muir Engineering exports its products to some 40 countriesâin fact, 40 per cent of its sales go to the international marketâso, for this company, an online presence is vital.</para><para>Tasmania is recognised as a producer of high quality arts and crafts. A marketing association has been formed which, with the aid of a grant from TECC, is developing a plan to use the latest information technology to promote and market the work of Tasmanian artists. Other groups which benefit include the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Growers Association; the Hazell Bros Group, which is involved with transport and earthmoving equipment; Online Outcomes, which runs training seminars to assist businesses to understand and develop effective business web sites; and a bakery chain.</para><para>The University of Tasmania maintains strong links with the TECC in terms of research, both commissioned and collaborative. With an increasing number of honours and postgraduate level students participating in e-commerce research projects, the body of knowledge surrounding this important topic is growing and providing useful results. The TECC devolves funds to businesses to enable them to engage professional web page designers to develop their Internet presence. The TECC has a large register of web designers and other computer professionals listed on its web site, and this generates further business for these providers. The cash flow-on effect to the Tasmanian economy is, therefore, quite considerable.</para><para>The next example is the realm of health care. The Telehealth Tasmania Network is a quite different story. Over three years, a statewide network of over 50 Telehealth facilities is being developed to promote more equitable access to health services for rural and regional Tasmanians. This will provide improved access to specialist services, a wider choice of health services and providers and enhanced links between rural and remote GPs and their patients. This program is well under way. The Tasmanian Department of Community and Health Services, which manages the program, had a stand at the recent Agfest rural exhibition to promote the program, which attracted a lot of interest from interstate visitors. Telehealth has calculated that, in fares alone, some $30,000 per month is being saved by Tasmanians as the service provides an electronic, face-to-face service with nursing practitioners and carers, general practitioners and specialists.</para><para>One of the areas in which Tasmanians see some real hands-on services is the more than 60 online access centres around the state, which provide the general public with access to computers and the Internet. These centres have been established in school buildings, in public library buildings and in other places. They are managed by a volunteer board, part-time paid coordinators and many volunteers. These facilities enable many people who would otherwise not go near a computer to learn and use word processors, the Internet and email. A surprisingly large number of older, often retired, people as well as the young can develop and expand their knowledge of and interest in their hobbies, which includes anything from bonsai to sport to family history. Many small businesses, including farmers, can also learn about computers and their benefits.</para><para>Another program that has recently received funding does not sound as grand as some of the others I have mentioned but will also have a flow-on effect. A recent survey of Tasmanian historical societies identified a strong interest on the part of the members to establish an Internet presence in order to liaise with other societies and the general public. For instance, it is estimated that some 10,000 Australians are researching their family history and many of these people like to visit the region where their ancestors lived and worked. By putting information and images on the Internet, the local history societies reach out to these other researchers and can provide descendants with a reason to visit their area. This program has the funds to assist societies to purchase equipment such as computers, scanners and digital cameras, enabling the society members to scan pictures, photographs and maps and to send them right across the world.</para><para>One of the growing areas in tourism, especially in Tasmania, is ecotourism. With so much of our population living in big cities, this type of holiday experience is growing in popularity. Through electronic commerce, the initiative for the Tasmanian tourism industry has enhanced the capacity of small adventure and ecotourism businesses in the north and west of Tasmania to develop interstate and international markets and has provided a model for other business clusters. Some 50 small companies offering 300 different tours have been helped to market their products. These companies, some of which did not even own a computer, now have web pages providing information on available tours. The would-be holiday-maker can choose from various options, such as sea kayaking, scuba diving, trekking, hiking and abseiling and then view the details of what is on offer and make an online booking.</para><para>The bottom line of all these projects is that so many people in Tasmania have benefited from the Commonwealth government's injection of funds into the IT world, whether it be through health services, cultural activities or business. There have been many other benefitsâfor example, for schools and for television viewers in black spot areasâand there has been improved access to mobile phone services. The spin-off for the Tasmanian economy has meant more than just buying some computers and hiring computer professionals. It has far reaching effects for all Tasmanians, and we can thank the Liberal-National coalition for the funding initiatives which have flowed from the part sale of Telstra.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Industrial Relations: Petkar Pty Ltd</title><page.no>24017</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>24017</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to relay tonight how the government's industrial legislation has really left young people in particular but the work force in general vulnerable to the unscrupulous dealings of many employers in the country. I refer particularly to a group called Petkar Pty Ltd in South Australia, who run a series of shops under the banner of IGA in Dulwich, Malvern and Walkerville. In March this year Mr Franklin, the proprietor, offered his employees an Australian workplace agreement. Mr Franklin had hoped to get all his employees to agree verbally to the AWAs so he could start paying the rates in the contract straightaway. The basic premise of the AWA was that employees would go from being casual employees under the South Australian retail industry award to being permanent employees under the AWA.</para></talk.start><para>On first thought, that is quite a credible thing for an employer to doâto take his employees off casual rates to make them permanent. But not so in the case of Mr Franklin's company. The permanent employees under this agreement, or the AWAs, had a two-hour minimum shift, no penalty rates, no guaranteed hours and no leave entitlements, such as sick leave, annual leave, parental leave, bereavement leave, carers leave and so on. They are all gone by the dealings of our friend Mr Franklin. This compares to the award entitlements for permanent employees of three-hour minimum shifts, penalty rates for late nights, Sunday and public holiday work, minimum weekly hours and paid sick leave, annual leave, bereavement leave and carers leave. It is somewhat of a contrast.</para><para>The story gets worse. The employees did not sign the AWA. One asks oneself why. Because of this, Mr Franklin posted on the noticeboard a notice which said, in part, `I believe that you have all decided to act together rather than as individuals, which is what the agreement was intended for,' and, `Penalty rates must end to keep the shop competitive, and this has been my sole intention from the outset.' He put his own welfare ahead of those whom he sought to employ. The AWA was then amended to increase the base rate by 50c and to add a 150 per cent rate for public holidays. Fifty cents was the increase that he was going to offer. It would go from no penalty rates on public holidays to 150 per cent, when the rest of the community was of course enjoying at least 250 per cent. He also offered to allow for unpaid annual leaveâquite a novel idea!</para><para>At a meeting on 19 April to present a revised AWA, Mr Franklin said he believed staff had deliberately delayed signing the AWA so they would still be paid their award penalty rates over Easter and Anzac Day. This is a fellow who has no morals himself and who is now trying to accuse his employees of being immoral by taking what they are rightly entitled to. Franklin went on to say that this process was not meant to be one of negotiation: `You do as I say and you keep quiet. The alternative is that you lose your job.'</para><para>His adviser, an interesting character who had originally crafted the AWAs, was one Mr Rob Wallace. He was present at the meeting and said that even if employees nominated a bargaining agent the employer was under no obligation to bargain. Someone is not reading this act right. Not under an obligation to bargain? That is what it is all about. Mr Wallace told the meeting he had now accepted a position with the Office of the Employment Advocateâthis is a really nice to-do! So he was no longer the employer's bargaining agent. He was telling them that the employer had no obligation to bargain, but he had already taken a position with the Office of the Employment Advocate. What an immoral soul this one is. Mr Wallace is known to have contacted, well after his appointment, the Malvern store to speak with Mr Franklin. It was long after he commenced with the Office of the Employment Advocate. I do not know exactly what they spoke about, but I very much doubt that he was giving Mr Franklin any tips for the races on Saturday.</para><para>I really believe that this is a situation that the government must investigate. It must investigate the conflict of interest between the Office of the Employment Advocate and the dealings with the company run by Mr Franklin. As one might expect, fortunately a number of employees joined the SDAEA, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, and a number appointed the SDAEA as bargaining agent for the dealings with the AWA. The union correctly sent a letter to the company on 4 May. A notice was stuck on the noticeboard that day from Mr Ian Cannon, who had now been appointed by Mr Franklin as his bargaining agent. So he could have a bargaining agent, but his employees could not. This is where it becomes more and more immoral in that this company could treat employees in that way and get away with it. This company is corrupt in its dealings. It gives no rights whatsoever to the employees, it has flat rates that abolish penalty rates, leave entitlements have gone and there are no guaranteed hours.</para><para>Rob Wallace originally crafted the AWAs and then took a job with the Office of the Employment Advocate, yet he was still giving advice to this company and he was giving wrong advice. The employer has misrepresented the Office of the Employment Advocate by saying that it had pre-approved the AWAs when the OEA could not have done that without seeing work patterns, rosters et cetera. The employees were lied to not only by the employer but also by a person who had become an officer of the OEA. This is where the government's industrial relations policies have got it wrong and where they are discriminating against workers in the Australian work force today. </para><para>Mr Franklin and managers have applied duress to employees by effectively stating that no shifts would be offered to those who do not sign AWAs. The managers at the various stores went to individuals and told them that they would not be offered shifts if they did not sign. Mr Franklin has basically refused to negotiate or bargain with the legitimately appointed bargaining agent. Only because of action in the Industrial Relations Commission in South Australia have the shifts and the income of those who have not signed AWAs been protected. Franklin did not even want to negotiate with the assistance of the Industrial Relations Commission.<inline font-style="italic"> (Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Sport and Tourism</title><page.no>24019</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>24019</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast week it was revealed that the Federal Police closed their file on their investigations concerning alleged electoral rorting by the member for Lindsay and sports minister, Jackie Kelly. These allegations surrounded the conduct of the member for Lindsay in relation to the 1999 Penrith City Council elections, as well as the electoral enrolment of a former member of her staff, Mr Nick Berman. I believe there still remain a few unanswered questions in relation to these allegations.</para></talk.start><para>Madam President, you may recall that in January this year Mr Berman and Penrith City Councillor Steve Simat, both former members of Mrs Kelly's staff, were called before the Pyne committee of inquiry. In his statement to the committee, Mr Berman said:</para><quote><para>The Commonwealth Electoral Act is grossly inadequate in that the act allows elections to take place based on electoral rollsâthe integrity of which cannot be guaranteed.</para></quote><para>That is perhaps the truest statement Mr Berman made in his appearance before that committee. </para><para>While Steve Simat was still employed by Mrs Kelly, he stood successfully for the Liberal Party in the East Ward of the Penrith City Council elections in September 1999. Before the Pyne committee, Councillor Simat admitted to organising an elaborate front party scam to direct preferences to the Liberals in East Ward to secure his election. He admitted it. It is in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>for senators to read. Councillor Simat, while in the employment of the member for Lindsay, organised an elaborate front party scam to assist in his election to Penrith City Council.</para><para>The candidates for the Marijuana Smokers' Rights Party, Joe and Paul Matosin, were Young Liberal members from Rossmore, while Adam Brown, who also ran for the No Badgery's Creek Airport Party was from the Willoughby Young Liberals. In order to run for these shonky front parties, on 3 August 1999âconveniently, the day before the rolls closedâthese three candidates declared their electoral enrolments at 3 Avon Place, St Clair. This property was co-owned by Mr Stan Celar, who ran for the No Badgery's Creek Airport Party, and his wife, Liliana Djuka, who was also Councillor Simat's niece. Councillor Simat masterminded this entire scam while he worked for the member for Lindsay. The member for Lindsay was the president of the Liberal Party's local government conference in Penrith. This conference discussed all the strategy and tactics that went into the Liberal's 1999 council election campaign, including its preference strategy. Either the member for Lindsay was up to her eyeballs in this affair, or she was being manipulated by these tricky, shonky and scheming Young Liberals like Councillor Simat. Mr Berman was accused of falsely declaring his enrolment at the member for Lindsay's house prior to the 1998 federal election. Mr Berman was able to explain away that allegation before the Pyne committee by saying that he was `effectively living nowhere between February 1998 and May 1998'.</para><para>But what he has not been able to explain is why, during the period he was enrolled in Penrith, he appeared in the phone book as living at Parramatta. Later on, when Mr Berman's ambition led him to Normanhurst in Sydney's northern suburbs to run for the Liberal Party in Hornsby Shire Council, his change of electoral enrolment form was completed on the same day as those of Mr Paul Matosin and Adam Brown, on the day before the electoral rolls closed. When asked, Mr Berman refused to confirm or deny whether or not he had ever seen or witnessed the enrolment forms of these candidates, or if he knew whether or not they had been witnessed in the member for Lindsay's office. He said he could not recall.</para><para>As you can see, Madam President, there are still a number of questions that remain unanswered. I would like to publicly challenge the member for Lindsay to answer these questions. The closing of the Federal Police file on her should not signal the end of the affair. These questions need to be answered, because of the member for Lindsay's refusal to front up before the Pyne committee of inquiry into electoral fraud and answer questions from the committee.</para><para>The first question is: if the member for Lindsay had nothing to hide, why did she and her supporters in the Liberal Party so strenuously avoid having her answer these allegations before the Pyne committee? Why did she not come forward to assist the committee in its noble task of examining the integrity of the Australian electoral roll? Secondly, will she explain why the phone book address of her former staffer, Mr Nick Berman, contradicted his declared electoral enrolment, which was at her place of residence? Thirdly, will she also explain why Mr Berman contradicted her statement in the House of Representatives on 4 December last year, when the member for Lindsay seemed to suggest that Mr Berman had lived with her only while he was living in Lindfield, before moving to Parramatta, and that he had mistakenly failed to change his electoral enrolment when he moved to Parramatta? Both of them cannot be right. The member for Lindsay must clarify this issue.</para><para>Fourthly, will the member for Lindsay confirm or deny that she, Mr Berman or Councillor Simat witnessed the electoral enrolment forms of Paul and Joe Matosin and Adam Brown? Will she confirm or deny that these enrolment forms were witnessed in her electorate office in Penrith? And the final question is this: it is undeniable that, as the president of the Liberals' local government conference in Penrith, the member for Lindsay would have had knowledge of the front party scam that was being organised out of her office. Does the member for Lindsay think that just because the Federal Police have closed her file she has somehow regained the trust of the people living in her electorate? Her involvement in this shonky affair has seriously undermined her claim to be a clean non-politician of western Sydney and it has shown her up for what she really is. Over the coming weeks, I will be seeking full and honest answers to these questions from the member for Lindsay, but I will not be holding my breath.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Sport: RecLink</title><page.no>24020</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>24020</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is appropriate that on budget night I am here to talk about the lack of sporting opportunities available to those in our society who are not included in or encompassed by mainstream programs. The Howard government has now had six budgets in which to correctly balance the needs of elite sport with the needs of community based and participatory activities. It is most unfortunate then that it has squandered yet another opportunity to deliver wide-ranging sport and recreation programs for all Australiansânot just the elite and not just those in capital cities.</para></talk.start><para>This government is well known for its meanness, and that is evident in its approach to sport and recreation. This time last year we witnessed $16 million being slashed from the sport budgetâthe fifth funding cut in five years. Whilst Labor have publicly welcomed the restorative funding for sport in this year's budget, we also point out that the government has, in effect, put back into the system what has been ripped out since 1996. The Howard government has not been generous to those in most need of assistance. It has cut back on areas where recreational and sporting programs offer something positive to people and communities who have suffered under this government. Whilst we have generally supported today's announcement of increased funding for sport, it does not in any way compensate for the years of short-sighted cuts and the axing of critical sports programs. Indeed, it has not escaped the opposition's attention that a significant proportion of the restorative funding is in the out years and that it will not be realised by the Australian sporting community in the coming financial year.</para><para>That said, today's budget shows that the coalition has failed to capitalise on the nexus between physical activity and improved wellbeing, which should be the cornerstone of any sport and recreational policy. There is a mountain of evidence available showing the direct correlation between the provision of participatory activities and improved individual and community wellbeing. There is substantial documentation, both anecdotal and analytical, demonstrating that mental and physical health, antisocial behaviour, criminal activity and drug and alcohol abuse can be alleviated and improved through participation in sporting and recreational activities. In other words, governments can address social and health problems not just through traditional means but through alternative approaches which assist those people who, for complex reasons, do not easily fit in with the sometimes restrictive limitations imposed by sporting bureacracies.</para><para>Tonight, I want to talk briefly about a very important and significant initiative that is doing a tremendous job in addressing this much neglected aspect of community sport and community wellbeing. On a recent visit to Melbourne I was privileged to visit RecLink, an organisation that provides sporting and recreational opportunities for homeless people and those with mental illnesses and drug and alcohol related problems. RecLink is essentially delivering sport and recreation programs to Australians who, for want of a better term, fall through the cracks of mainstream society.</para><para>RecLink originated in Melbourne in 1990, with the aim of providing recreational activities to people who experience social disadvantages. These disadvantages include homelessness, unemployment, substance abuse and addiction, poverty, alienation, behavioural disorders and mental illness. The philosophy of RecLink is that everyone has the right to access recreational activities and enjoy the benefits that come from that participation. RecLink is a great vehicle for enjoyment. It provides opportunities to rejuvenate the human spirit, to create friendships, to motivate and develop skills, and to deliver all the consequent benefits that derive from increased fitness. Since 1990, RecLink has expanded to include 60 agencies in Victoria, and it now provides about 16 sporting and recreational programs. RecLink has also expanded into other states, particularly South Australia, where similar programs are provided.</para><para>The most important aspect of RecLink is that they work with many other agencies in the pursuit of providing meaningful and invaluable opportunities for their community. For example, RecLink in Victoria work with agencies such as the Sacred Heart Mission, Outreach, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, crisis accommodation agencies, youth homelessness groups, inner city health centres, the Salvation Army and many other services dedicated to helping those in need. With the generous assistance of these charity groups and agencies and the involvement of key sporting organisations such as the AFL, RecLink are able to offer an incredible range of activities for people who would otherwise not be given the chance to be part of a community and participate in activities that make an enormous difference to their mental and physical outlook.</para><para>Mr Peter Cullen, who runs the Victorian RecLink program, has worked tirelessly to provide an incredibly diverse range of activities. On my visit to RecLink I saw proudly displayed photographs and images of people with social and physical challenges who were playing basketball, football, tenpin bowling, cricket, lawn bowls, golf, swimming and squash in a very innovative program called `Come and try events'. As Peter Cullen has pointed out, RecLink's successful growth is a measure of the value which participants place on the unique opportunities offered to them. In the last year alone, the number of membership agencies has risen from 45 to 60. They have also managed to increase their focus on women, and their innovative programs have made significant inroads in addressing the shortfall in opportunities for women.</para><para>The enormously significant contribution RecLink is providing to those most at risk deserves recognition and support from local, state and federal governments. It was both heart warming and humbling to find out that most of the people involved with RecLink do so in a volunteer capacity. They give of their own time, and in many cases their own money and resources, to help expand RecLink's operations in linking up potential participants and people who want to be involved in sport and recreational activities and giving them the means to actually do so. They do this with a generous spirit that is sadly lacking from many governments in terms of sport and recreation, not the least being the coalition federal government. RecLink only survive because of the generous efforts of their activity coordinators and the willingness of many welfare agencies to commit staff to help RecLink. I found RecLink to be one of the most inspiring examples of the meaning that sport and recreational activities can add to people's lives. It was very clear to me that they contributed greatly to improving the quality of life of particularly those homeless people in inner city Melbourne where this Victorian RecLink was established.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nugent, Mr Peter Edward</title><page.no>24022</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>24022</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the Government in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to say a few words in memory of our late friend and colleague Peter Nugent, who prematurely and suddenly died a little while ago.

He was also a true liberal. He was committed to individual freedoms, to enterprise and to the wellbeing of those not as well off. He understood the proper role of the state in relation to those who needed the support of the state. His life was very much a life of service, through the Royal Air Force and then for some years in this parliament. But in the middle of that career he also successfully entered business, which I think demonstrates his broad capacities.</para><para>I think he will be remembered by many of us for a number of particular attributes. Those of us who were privileged to be at his funeral were struck by the mass of people who attended because he had affected their lives in some way. They were not the sort of people who were attending the funeral because they thought they should attend the funeral. They were there because they had a personal memory of Peter. When we started to explore their stories with some of them afterwards, we found a myriad of different stories of people who had needed help, of minorities, and a whole range of different circumstances. They had turned to their local member of parliament. Their local member of parliament had made the effort and had so helped them that, when he died, they actually wanted to attend his funeral and, in their own way, record their appreciation. I found that really quite striking.</para><para>The second thing for which many of us will remember Peter was his passionate commitment to human rights, often for causes at time when they were less fashionable. He was never one to get on the bandwagon. If there was somebody suffering he would be out there trying to provide assistance. I remember him in that capacity, particularly as chairman of our Amnesty International parliamentary group.</para><para>The third area for which I think he will be particularly remembered was his commitment to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. It was a genuine commitment that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders should be treated with respect, that their traditions and cultures should be properly understood, and that we must grow as an ever more tolerant society, particularly accepting of differences. He was our shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs for some time. He played a lead role in the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation for some six years. He demonstrated on those issues his commitment to these people and his abhorrence of anything that might be described as racist.</para><para>So there he wasâa special man with special qualities which many of us would like to be remembered for. We will miss our friend and colleague Peter. I take this opportunity to send my condolences to his wife and family.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nugent, Mr Peter Edward</title><page.no>24023</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>24023</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to make some brief comments in this adjournment debate on the untimely death of my friend and our colleague Peter Nugent. They will be brief comments which, quite honestly, I wish it were not necessary to make. In 1989, when I was engaged in the then frenetic activity of being the Federal President of the Young Liberal Movement in Australia, my then Vice President, Chris Molnarâthe Victorian Young Liberal presidentâspoke to me incredibly enthusiastically about this guy who was running in Aston and about the great campaign they were running. Chris's enthusiasm on Peter's behalf was remarkable. He spoke in very glowing terms of his candidate for the then very marginal seat of Aston. Obviously Peter's reputation for marginal seat campaigning grew, evidenced by his re-election in 1993, 1996 and 1998. As my leader, Senator Hill, said, from the breadth of representation at his service in his electorate, his great commitment to Aston was quite clear.</para></talk.start><para>I came through that political period to know of Peter's interest in foreign affairs and trade issues, particularly in China and in Asia more broadly. He was also interested in indigenous affairs in this nation. He had a passionate commitment to the wellbeing and the future of indigenous Australians and also to human rights. He was a very regular traveller to the broad Asian region; in fact, he returned from a visit just days before his death. Those who accompanied him on that visit remarked upon it in very favourable terms. </para><para>It was most particularly since my appointment to the Senate in 1997, and more recently since the 1998 election, that I had what I regard as a very important opportunity to work closely with Peter. I admired and respected him. I valued his friendship enormously. Along with many of my colleagues, I will miss his very sharp wit, his wisdom and his advice.</para><para>I was the enthusiastic secretary of his foreign affairs and trade backbench committee. This is not a job that people always take on with great enthusiasm, but working with Peter was an absolute pleasure. His display of his enthusiasm, his interest in the variety of issues he could possibly explore and the knowledge that he could impart were very important to those of us who joined with him on that committee. I am also a member of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, of which Peter was chair. In that capacity, and as chair of the parliamentary group for Amnesty for a very extended period, Peter demonstrated his respect for human rights, which, as Senator Hill said, was a driving force in his political life.</para><para>On issues like constitutional reform and mandatory sentencing, I regarded Peter as a leader in the debate in our party, in the parliament and also in the community. On a personal note, his unwavering commitment to true liberalismâto the principles that guided his workâwas a model that many of us could only hope to follow, given that we are often caught up in the occasional political morass that passes for party politics in Australia. I learnt an enormous amount from my friend and colleague Peter Nugent. In many ways I would describe him as one of my mentors in this place since I came here, gently pushingânever easy to do with meâadvising and suggesting. I valued that advice and judgment, and I will miss it.</para><para>I was enormously moved by the words of the member for Kooyong, Petro Georgiou, at Peter's service. I think he summed up very eloquently the thoughts unspoken, and perhaps difficult to express, of many of us at the time. After a recent political skirmish in which Peter took a great interest in my fate, I was pleased to be able to say that I left the process with my self-respect and my integrity intact, not always an easy matter in this business. Peter's political career was marked completely by decency and integrity. </para><para>For Carol and for their families this is obviously a loss most keenly felt. I know that little is consoling at this time, but they must be proud of his achievements, his contribution and his passionate adherence to his principles. I am enormously proud to have worked with Peter and very honoured to have been a friend.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nugent, Mr Peter Edward</title><page.no>24024</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>24024</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to express the condolences of the Australian Democrats to the Nugent family and to the Liberal Party of Australia for the loss of an exceptional man and an exceptional politician. Not only has the Nugent family lost a compassionate and decent man but the Liberal Party has lost a true defender of its social conscience. Peter Nugent was a person who took pride in defending the rights of people who could not defend themselves. He was willing to defend them in a sometimes hostile parliamentary and party room environment. In Peter the Liberal Party had a member who was willing to go against his party to represent the views of those people who elected him, despite how unpopular such a position might have been. Peter was a supporter of reconciliation, a passionate human rights advocate, a champion for an official apology to the stolen generations, a defender of individual rights against the state's willingness to interfere and a member of parliament who was determined to be anything other than a time server.</para></talk.start><para>Some of the descriptions of Peter may well have led you to believe that he should have been a member of the Australian Democrats. On his election to the House of Representatives in 1990, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper said, `Mr Nugent thinks politics is about people and politicians should find out what people think.' He was keen to be a true representative of the people. It is most unfortunate that Peter left us before we all had the chance to learn the lessons that he had to teach and before he had the opportunity to exert greater influence over the way in which we do our business.</para><para>Perhaps more important than party aspirations is the legacy that Peter Nugent left his family, his party and the parliament. After one is gone, the real impact of their legacy is found in its ability to stand the test of time. The legacy that Peter left his family was respect. He was a man in whom his family could rightly express a great deal of pride. He was well respected by all sides of politics, well respected in his electorate and well respected more broadly in the Australian community. He did not bring his profession into disrepute.</para><para>Compassion is the legacy he left his party. From his work on the Human Rights Subcommittee of the parliament's Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, to his close and intense participation on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, compassion was evidently his modus operandi. In the face of destructionist politics from the likes of One Nation, Peter Nugent stood and defended the rights of many disadvantaged Australians well before many others decided it would be popular to do so. It was not politics that drove the decision to stand up and be counted on such an unpopular issue at the time; it was compassion. Peter leaves behind the legacy to take up the challenge to wear his clothes of compassion.</para><para>From the obituaries and the statements following his death, it is very clear that his legacy to this place is one of integrity. It appears that everyone in this place who had the pleasure to work with Peter liked and respected him for the decent manner in which he conducted himself and the manner with which he dealt with the obvious conflicts between his personal positions on social issues and those of his party. Across the political spectrum and out in the wider community, his deeds more often than his words spoke to the people in a way few are able to. He did not rubbish the party, nor did he recklessly attack those people with whom he disagreed. He was reasoned but passionate and committed without being dogmatic.</para><para>In this election year, we could do no greater honour to the legacy of Peter Nugent than to remember his lessons of respect, compassion and integrity in the work we do. His family, his party and our nation have lost a great man. But, hopefully, we will not lose the lessons he has left all of us to learn.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nugent, Mr Peter Edward</title><page.no>24025</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>24025</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to pay respect to the late Peter Edward Nugent, the member for Aston.

It had to be one of the things I least expected to hear on the news. Peter Nugent was elected the same year I was. We both belonged to many of the same groups, most of which have been mentioned here tonight: the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group, on which he served as chair for quite a while; the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade; and also, and particularly, the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Peter was also the chair of the Human Rights Subcommittee for quite a while as well. He was a very good chair. I read in one of the obituaries that he once said that the way that you can judge a society is by how they treat their minorities. He was very concerned about how any minorities are treated within Australia and, in fact, in the world. He was always prepared to show that concern, always prepared to listen and always prepared to speak up for people. </para></talk.start><para>Peter was not a saint, and I do not think we should assume that he was. Anyone who has travelled on a delegation with Peter will be aware that, if you were 30 seconds late to leave, he would be standing in the foyer of the hotel tapping his foot and looking at his watch, and you knew that you were in trouble. We often hear on the loudspeaker system that members of a certain committee are reminded of a meeting taking place somewhere or other. Peter is the only chair I know who would ask for that to be done before the meeting had even started, to make sure that people were there on time. He was absolutely dead keen on punctuality. I must say that it often drove me totally crazy. But, even though he was not a saint, he was a very good and a very decent man. As Senator Payne said, I am very proud to be able to say that he was my friend. Peter stood up for those who were least able to stand up for themselves, even when his views were not popular in the party room. He knew that speaking out probably was not doing his career much good, but he still did it. </para><para>I think it was pretty obvious at his memorial serviceâwhich I must say I was very moved byâthat everyone who spoke very much respected Peter. You would have to include the Prime Minister in that. It was very obvious from the way the Prime Minister spoke that he had great respect for Peter. The tributes at the service were lovely, and certainly no less than Peter deserved. One of the speakers at the service was Peter's daughter, Deirdre. She spoke really well. It was my favourite of the tributes. Everyone who knew Peter and spoke with Peter over the years would realise how proud he was of all his childrenâhis three children and his three stepchildren. He was always telling you what they were doing, who was doing what exam and what his grandchildren had done. He was immensely proud of them. I know they are aware of thatâand they should beâbut they should also be aware that he was quite happy to tell everybody else about how proud he was of his children. </para><para>I would like to express my condolences to Peter's wife, Carol, who I am also proud to say is a friend of mine, to his children, Deirdre, Greg and Barry, and to his stepchildren, Nicholas, Victoria and Sarah. I was speaking to Carol at the Melbourne sittings of the parliament and she was very touched that a seat had been left for him and that a rose had been put on the seat. She said to me, `I just hope he knows that people realise and always have realised how important he was and what he did, and I just hope that he can hear it now.' Carol, I am sure he can and I must say that I am very sorry he has left. I think he will be a great loss to this parliament and to Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nugent, Mr Peter Edward</title><page.no>24026</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>24026</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI met Peter over 10 years ago, when he was the candidate for Aston. I regret that I was not able to attend his funeral as I was engaged in parliamentary responsibilities visiting Papua New Guinea to look at our aid program there, and I am sure he would have preferred me to be there than to be at the service. But it is not the sort of thing for which you can send an apology or the sort of thing that you can explain to people why you were not there. But I am sure that Peter, of all people, would have realised and thought it more appropriate for me to continue my trip to PNG and to look at the enormous work that has been done under the AusAID program. I know he would have been very interested in what I had to say when I got back, as he was a member of the foreign affairs committee.</para></talk.start><para>As I said, I met Peter 10 years ago, when he was a candidate for the 1990 election. I had been helping to look after the then eight seats that we did not have. I became involved in campaigning with him. He was an incredibly cooperative colleague. He welcomed me and other senators into his electorate. As a senator you almost need a passport to get into the electorate of some House of Representatives members, and I can see colleagues on the other side smiling at that. But Peter was really very expansive in his hospitality; he shared his electorate. They are also our electorates and sometimes House of Representatives members forget that, but Peter never forgot that. He promoted the role of his parliamentary Senate colleagues and he promoted the role of the Senateâagain, something not all House of Representatives members do.</para><para>He brought to bear his extensive life experiences, which came from a mixture of the Royal Air Force and business. He brought that experience to his role as a House of Representatives member. His constituents were incredibly well served by an outstanding member. He represented them, he responded to them and he reacted to their concerns and needs. Both here and in the other House people have spoken extensively about the stands he took on issues of principle; he was not going to be moved when he believed there was an issue of principle. As people have said in the other House, he did not bend to the wind of what might be thought to be public opinion.</para><para>He paid incredible attention to detail. He was a stickler for ensuring his constituents' letters were answered and that their concerns were addressed promptly. We have never had a complaint about Peter saying, `Well, I wrote him a letter and I never heard back.' He was very responsive in that way. He was a fine example of the sort of person who represented his electorate with dignity, diligence and devotion. The people of Aston were very well served over the past decade with Peter Nugent as their member. Despite his assiduous attention to detail and his assiduous attention to his electorate, he was not parochial; he had a much wider view. He had a very strong commitment to human rights. He had a very strong view about Aboriginal reconciliation and was very prepared to express that. He played a very active role in his shadow ministry portfolio in that area.</para><para>Peter also realised the importance of developing Australia's international relationships. He was a very active chairman of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group. He approached that role and the various things that happened in that role with equal enthusiasm. The visit of a Chinese dignitary was important and we as members of the friendship group were invited. Peter made sure that the Chinese delegation would meet all of us. He was equally enthusiastic about the annual ping-pong competition between the federal parliament and the Chinese embassy. I think it surprised us more than anybody that we won the last combat we had against the Chinese embassy. I was very proud to be a part of that ping-pong team. I do not claim that ping-pong is one of my great abilities. But Peter played a very good game of ping-pong and I think that, as the leader of our team, he was instrumental in our winning that ping-pong match. </para><para>Peter was able to mix the challenges of being a member of parliament, from diplomacy to ping-pong diplomacy, equally. I think that is something that all of us do not always achieve. I think Peter was able to mix them together and to achieve an outcome that was important for Australia and important for our relationship internationally. Others have elaborated on his achievements over the 10 or 11 years he was in parliamentâhis various roles on committees such as the National Crime Authority committee, and I will not go over those.</para><para>From a personal point of view, I have lost a strong supporter. Peter constantly had the interest of the coalition team on his agenda. I featured quite regularly in his newsletter and had a column in his newsletter. He was not afraid of sharing with his Senate colleagues. I have lost not only a strong supporter but a friend and an outstanding colleague. It cannot be said of all of us in this place but Peter was one who was able to wear both the hat of a politician and the hat of a parliamentarian, and he knew when to wear whichâsomething to which we all ought to aspire.</para><para>Aston has lost a tremendous representative. The parliament has lost not only a politician but a fine parliamentarian. I wish to be associated with the messages of condolence and to offer my condolences to Carol in her loss, to his children and his stepchildren, and to his extended family. Sometimes we forget the staff and friends of a person who has died. To his staff and friends I offer my deepest sympathy and condolences. I hope that many of us will take a leaf out of Peter's book in knowing where the role of a politician and the role of a parliamentarian begin and end.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nugent, Mr Peter Edward</title><page.no>24027</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>24027</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to pay my respects to Peter Nugent. As chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I wish to pay tribute to Peter's contribution to that committee. It is no accident that Peter was chair of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. As many people in this chamber are awareâas all of his colleagues in the lower house knowâPeter's greatest contribution to this parliament was his attitude towards human rights and, as mentioned by Senator Patterson and others, towards Aboriginal reconciliation. Peter was a very strong advocate of the things, ideals and issues that he believed in strongly. I guess it is no secret that I did not always share Peter's views on many of those issues, and neither did many of his colleagues. But one strong point of Peter's was that, regardless of other people's opinions, he was always prepared to speak his point of viewâeven if he was in a minority and sometimes if he was the only one who had a particular point of view. He never shied away from controversy within his own party, and I think that he earned the respect of every one of his colleagues because he was outspoken and because he was prepared to stand up and say what he believed in.</para></talk.start><para>During his time on the Human Rights Subcommittee, Peter made an enormous contribution to many of the inquiries that took place. One that I remember was the handover of Hong Kong and issues related to that. There was another inquiry in recent times on issues of the freedom of religion and belief in Australia. At the time of his death, we were in the process of completing a report on our visits to detention centres around Australia. It is a fact that, on the very day that Peter died, he was due to receive a draft report on those visits. It has fallen to me as chairman of that committee to complete the report, and I am very pleased to know that Peter's work will be continued by my colleague Senator Marise Payne, who tomorrow will take over his role as chair of the Human Rights Subcommittee. I am sure that she will do so in the same vein that Peter did. His contribution to that committee and to those inquiries meant that, as in the Liberal Party, there was a very wide variety of points of view. We claim to be a broad church, and Peter was one of our party who was prepared to state his point of view and to work for whatever he believed in. </para><para>Peter will be missed in the parliament. He was never shy about saying anything, and he will be missed because of the energetic contribution that he made. He sometimes provided a sounding-board for others, and he provided a personal viewpoint that sometimes enlightened others. It is with sadness that we have to get up tonight and pay our respects to Peter. I would like to express my condolences to Carol and to his family, and I want Carol to know that the enormous efforts that he put into the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, particularly as chair of the Human Rights Subcommittee, were appreciated by all he came into contact with, on both sides of the parliament, and that will be his lasting legacy.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nugent, Mr Peter Edward</title><page.no>24028</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>24028</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to incorporate a speech by Senator Ellison regarding this matter of condolence.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><quote><para>Tonight I wish to pay tribute in the Senate to Peter Nugent who passed away on 24 April 2001.  </para><para>He is survived by his wife Carol and his three children and to them I extend my condolences and those of a grateful Liberal Party.</para><para>Peter Nugent's life was one of service to the public.  </para><para>As a member of the Royal Air Force for 24 years Peter achieved the rank of Squadron Leader.

There were occasions when it was necessary for this parliament to be represented in the Asia-Pacific area, and Peter was always prepared to put himself out to go to a meeting to represent this country and to develop his interests and his friendships with the people there. There will be many in those countries who mourn his passing and would have been, as we were, deeply shocked at the suddenness of his death. He certainly has made a great contribution, and I join with senators who have spoken this evening in offering my condolences to Carol and the family.</para></talk.start><para><inline

The election policy stated that `CrimTrac will allow police forces across Australia to speedily access and share information to solve crimes and catch criminals.'

Moreover, independence enables ITSA to focus on its particular role of administering and regulating the personal insolvency system in Australia and giving effect to the statutory role of the Official Trustee under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 and the Customs Act 1901, and other special trustee services to Government agencies.</para><para>(c)	At 9 February 2001 the cost of establishing ITSA as an independent agency totalled approximately $195,000.

In the 99/00 ATSIC Annual Report, at page 76 under ATSIC's Output 222 Legal and Preventative Services, there is an extensive outline of the performance of the ATSILS and associated initiatives of other organisations funded under this output. As of 1 July 2000, ATSIC has revised its external Program/Output reporting structure and the future reporting of the legal aid output element will be found in Annual Reports under the new Advancement of Indigenous Rights and Equity Output group.</para><para>Locations of ATSILS offices and sub offices as well as ATSIC funding to ATSILS from 1998/99 to 2000/01 for the provision of legal aid services are at Attachments A1- A6. Funding for subsequent years has not as yet been determined as the ATSIC Board is not due to formulate next year's estimates until April 2001 for the Minister's subsequent consideration after the government's budget is handed down in May.</para><para>The current funding levels will be increased as a result of the recent Treasurer's announcement (Press Release No 22 of 31/3) to provide additional funding to Aboriginal Organisations who are affected by the amendment to the FBT legislation with respect to the capping of salary packages by Public Benevolent Institutions. Officials from various agencies are currently formulating the mechanics of calculating and disbursing this additional funding. It is expected however that such extra funding for the last quarter for 2000/01 will not be actually released to organisations until early in the 2001/02 financial year. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services have been informed of these arrangements.</para><para>It is also foreshadowed that current 00/01funding levels (adjusted for FBT impact) to ATSILS are expected to remain the same except for an annual inflator adjustment.</para><para>Under the 99/00 Output 222, the total expenditure by ATSIC was $58.787m. Of this the ATSILS received $37.159m for the provision of legal aid services. In addition to the funding of 25 ATSILS to provide legal aid, ATSIC also funded:</para></quote><para>Â·	Two Legal Services Secretariats to advocate on broader Law and Justice issues,</para><para>Â·	Two Deaths in Custody Watch Committee,</para><para>Â·	Five Aboriginal Justice Advisory Committees,</para><para>Â·	The establishment of twelve Family Violence Prevention Units, and</para><para>Â·	Various Prevention Diversion and Rehabilitation initiatives including the successful Night Patrols in some Aboriginal communities.</para><quote><para>In regard to outsourcing, ATSIC's Program funding for a range of service delivery (including legal aid) is generally provided to Indigenous-owned community organisations. Consequently these organisations are in essence third party service providers and therefore ATSIC contends that its service delivery is already outsourced (to third party service providers).</para><para>As the funder of third party service providers ATSIC continually strives to achieve efficiency and enhanced quality of services being delivered to its constituency. In 1996, the ATSIC elected arm of NSW determined that the provision of legal aid services in NSW should be `Regionalised' thus providing greater accountability to the Regional Councils by the ATSILS. At the same time ATSIC took into account general government policy in regard to outsourcing and contestability considerations. This resulted in a state-wide tender process for the provision of culturally appropriate legal aid services to Indigenous people in NSW.</para><para>The tender assessment resulted in six Aboriginal organisations being selected to provide legal aid services. They continue to do so to the present time and are likely to do so in the immediate future. The ability to provide culturally appropriate effective services and cost efficiencies were two primary criteria in the assessment of the tenders which included responses from mainstream legal firms.</para><para>To date the NSW competitive tendering arrangements for the provision of regionalised legal aid services has not been expanded to other States. However the continued operational financing of all ATSILS is subject to a rigorous annual assessment of submissions from applicants to ensure that the legal aid providers have the corporate governance and administrative capacity and infrastructure to provide quality and culturally appropriate legal aid services to Indigenous people. This process in itself is a form of competitive consideration for the provision of culturally appropriate services.</para><para>ATSIC's priority at this stage for existing ATSILS has been to implement a range of reforms which includes the adoption by ATSILS of national minimum and Best Practice service standards and associated quality service initiatives. ATSIC has reported regularly to Cabinet on these reforms, which are consistent with and in some cases exceed reforms to the mainstream legal aid sector introduced by this government.</para><para>More details on the progress of reforms being effected to ensure enhanced quality service delivery by the ATSILS can be found in ATSIC's 99/00 Annual report, pages 76-90. As foreshadowed in the report, ATSIC has undertaken a study of the contestability continuum.</para><para>To date only one existing Indigenous legal aid provider has been formally advised that outsourcing, i.e. a contestable tender process, may be considered in future. This is the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement in South Australia. Natural Justice and Administrative Law principles require that ATSIC give current providers adequate notice of such possible consideration.</para><para>This consideration in South Australia is a direct result of the South Australian ATSIC elected arm wishing to consider all options for the provision of legal aid services to its constituency.</para><para>If a tender process is determined for South Australia the existing provider, ALRM, would be able to submit a tender.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Attachment A1</inline></para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid"

In his media release on the review conference the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated âI particularly welcome the unequivocal commitment of the Nuclear Weapon States to the total elimination of their nuclear arsenalsâ.</para><para>(b)	The Government places a high priority on further progress towards nuclear disarmament, but accepts the political reality that reductions in nuclear weapons - leading to a world free of them - will only be achieved through a series of incremental and reinforcing steps. </para><para>The Government is committed to full implementation of the outcomes of the 2000 NPT Review Conference, including the package of nuclear disarmament measures. At the 2000 UN General Assembly, Australia was pleased to support the Algerian NPT resolution, the âNew Agendaâ resolution, and the Japanese nuclear disarmament resolution (which we co-sponsored), all of which helped lock in the NPT review conference outcomes. </para><para>The Government believes that for the present the primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament lies with the two states with the largest nuclear arsenals - the United States and Russia. </para><para>The Government will continue to make clear to the United States and Russia its expectation of further action towards the elimination of nuclear weapons. The Government also welcomes and encourages unilateral nuclear disarmament action taken by the smaller nuclear weapon states. </para><para>An effective non-proliferation regime is essential to further progress towards nuclear disarmament. The Government will continue its active support for the vitally important reinforcing steps through which all countries can contribute to an environment favourable for nuclear weapons elimination.</para><para>Australia is a strong supporter of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and will continue to work to secure CTBT entry into force. In late 2000, Australian posts overseas made a further round of representations to key countries urging early signature/ratification of the CTBT. Australia took the lead in tabling the CTBT resolution adopted by an overwhelming majority at last year's UN General Assembly. Australia is taking an active role in arrangements for a high-level conference to be held in New York in September to promote CTBT entry into force.</para><para>The Government will continue to press for an immediate start to negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. Pending a start to negotiations the Government is working on a number of issues that will arise in the context of negotiating an FMCT, including an approach to verification. The Government will also continue its efforts to achieve universal application of the Additional Protocol developed to strengthen the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards system. </para><para>(c)	No. It would be premature to speculate on the impact national missile defence (NMD) could have on progress towards disarmament. The United States is yet to take firm decisions on the type of missile defence system it intends pursuing, but has made it clear that it is committed to consulting its allies and other key states, notably China and Russia, on its missile defence plans.</para><para>(d)	The Government is not prepared to speculate on hypothetical situations.</para><para>(2)	(a)	The Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap has supported and continues to support arms control and treaty verification initiatives.

We have urged China to avoid contributing both to vertical and horizontal missile proliferation and other activities which may undermine strategic stability.

DASFLEET is unable to provide accurate data on actual fuel consumption against distance travelled. </para><para>(9)	The GMH-A recommended retail cost of factory fitted dual fuel (LPG /ULP) systems is $2,394. Added to this would be the opportunity cost on capital invested. Studies of leased national fleets across Australia, indicate that cars must travel over 80000km on LPG before this option becomes financially viable. As DASFLEET vehicles are on a 2 year/40000km option, the costs to Defence of leasing vehicles on either LPG or CNG would be higher than petrol driven cars.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of Finance and Administration: Fleet Vehicles</title><page.no>24090</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3452)</subtitle><id.no>3452</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24090</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 27 February 2001.</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	How many cars does the department have in its fleet.</para><para>(2)	(a)	How many new cars will be purchased or leased in the 2000-01 financial year; and (b) can details be provided of the make, size and horsepower.</para><para>(3)	(a)	How many new cars were purchased or leased in the 1999-2000 financial year; and (b) can details be provided of the make, size and horsepower.</para><para>(4)	How many cars in the fleet are fuelled by liquid petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG) and petrol.</para><para>(5)	Does the agency use its own LPG or CNG refuelling stations; if so, how many are there of these.</para><para>(6)	Does the agency have a policy or strategy to reduce the fuel consumption of its car fleet; if so, can details be provided.</para><para>(7)	What is the fuel efficiency rating of all cars in the fleet.</para><para>(8)	How does the actual fuel consumption and mileage compare with the rating.</para><para>(9)	Nationally, what operating savings would have been achieved for the 1999-2000 financial year if all cars in the fleet were run on: (a) LPG; and (b) CNG.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>24090</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Acting Minister for Finance and Administration has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	The Department had 57 cars in its fleet as at 27 February 2001.</para><para>(2)	(a)	Leases for 14 were commenced in the 2000/2001 financial year to 27 February 2001.</para><para>(b)â

The remainder run on either petrol or diesel, with the exception of one, which is a dual fuel vehicle.</para><para>(5)	The Attorney General's Department does not use its own LPG or CNG refuelling stations</para><para>(6)	The Department utilises monthly Fleet Profile and usage reports to monitor fuel usage and also, through DASFLEET, offers driver training courses to improve driver efficiency and fuel consumption.</para><para>(7)	The fuel efficiency ratings for all the vehicles in the Department's fleet are included in Attachment A. The Australian Greenhouse Office has advised that commercial and four wheel drive vehicles weighing 2.7 tonnes and higher are not subject to fuel efficiency ratings at this stage.</para><para>(8)	The annual energy report produced by DASFLEET is used to compare actual fuel consumption and kilometres travelled against the fuel efficiency rating for each vehicle. In most instances they compare favourably. In instances where this is not the case, action is taken to address the problem on an individual basis. </para><para>(9)	Because of the fluctuations in the price of petrol and LPG it is difficult to determine what operational savings, if any, would have been achieved during the 1999-2000 financial year if all the vehicles had been run on LPG. Any savings made would have been offset by higher lease rates which apply to gas converted vehicles. I understand that CNG is still being developed and is not yet available as a commercial fuel.</para><para>Attachment A

This is part of a broader strategy to improve the management of property and, more importantly, to reassess the value of the material in the collection in order to provide better access to the material of confirmed archival value. The Archives will continue to maintain a presence in each State capital providing improved facilities for both the public and the collection.</para><para>(2)	(a) and (b)	As is entirely proper for any significant collecting organisation, the Archives reassesses its collection to identify and dispose of records of no continuing historical or administrative value.

The Archives does not set quotas or targets to quantify how much of the collection is no longer retained.</para><para>Resources saved from the storage, documentation and care of material appraised as having no ongoing value will be devoted to enhancing access in various ways, including developing a far better knowledge of the collection, improving the information available about it, and large-scale digitisation.</para><para>(3)	There will be no job losses in these States in the foreseeable future as a result of relocations of National Archives of Australia premises.</para><para>(4)	The National Archives of Australia's Service Charter, which is available on the Archives' website, details the standards of service that apply to those seeking access to the Archives collection. For those unable to visit an Archives reading room to undertake their own research, the Archives is committed to answering inquiries about material in the collection within 30 days. If a response will be delayed beyond 30 days inquirers are advised of the reasons for the delay. All researchers who contact the Archives by phone or email are informed of the 30-day response time.

Once registered, reference inquiries are sent to the office holding relevant records for response. </para><para>Researchers do not necessarily know which of the eight offices of the Archives hold records relevant to their research.

The consultants identified two distinct FFRS client groups, with Group A consisting of farmers who do not want to leave farming and Group B consisting of farmers wanting to exit farming. One additional sub-group, Group C, represented FFRS participants who want to exit farming but who would not be eligible for the re-establishment grant because they own farm or non-farm assets above the program's threshold of $167,500. </para><para>(b)	The following proposed issues for consideration from the report focusing on both administrative and client group issues were accepted and have been incorporated into the FFRS successor - the AAA Farm Help - Supporting Families Through Change program:</para></quote><para>Â·	Consideration be given to an end of program follow-up with individuals to assess outcomes of advice given, actions planned or undertaken and changes to viability. </para><quote><para>The implementation of Centrelink case management of AAA Farm Help customers and the development of activity plans by farmers on the scheme will ensure farmers receive appropriate guidance and support while on the scheme and that their adherence to advice is monitored and followed up. The Restart Re-establishment Grant Scheme Amendment 2000 No.3 and the Farm Household Support Amendment Act 2000, which commenced on 18 December 2000, provide for the requirement that farmers whose farms are assessed as not viable under the mandatory advice session must develop and act in accordance with an activity plan. The activity plan must be developed to either assist the farmer to exit farming or improve the farm's viability. A farmer with a viable farm has the option of the development of an activity plan to assist with planning for their future. A post program assessment of farmers as they leave the program, currently under development, will assess program outcomes through individual analysis.</para></quote><para>Â·	Extend the time to sell the farm. </para><quote><para>The Restart Re-establishment Grant Scheme Amendment 2000 No.3, of 18 December 2000, allows ministerial discretion to be exercised in special cases when the sale of the farm occurs after the 12-month period allowed, due to circumstances beyond the farmer's control.</para></quote><para>Â·	Allow farmers who have lost control of their farm enterprise to be considered eligible for FFRS. </para><quote><para>This issue was addressed prior to the mid-term review in the Restart Re-establishment Grant Scheme Amendment 1999 No. 1, which enables farmers who lose control of their farm access to AAA Farm Help under certain circumstances. Since 21 July 1999, a farmer can either enter into a voluntary foreclosure agreement or an arrangement under Part 10 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 after they commence on the AAA Farm Help program and prior to selling the farm and not be precluded from the grant. By entering into an arrangement voluntarily, a farmer can be seen to be in control of decisions regarding exiting the farming industry.</para><para>However, it is the intention of AAA Farm Help to be an incentive for farmers to leave non-viable farms and exit out of the industry before their assets become severely depleted. The situation where farmers lose control of their farms and subsequently wish to access the scheme as a `last resort' option is inconsistent with the intention of the scheme.</para></quote><para>Â·	Consider the asset limit with a view to raising the limit, partly to address the older farmer who may want to leave farming and is likely to have accumulated a higher asset base than the younger farmer.</para><quote><para>In recognition of this recommendation, on 1 July 2000 the Restart Re establishment Grant Scheme Amendment 2000 No.2 provided for an increase to the asset threshold to obtain the maximum re-establishment grant from $90,000 to $100,000. The asset threshold was limited to this amount as the scheme is targeted towards farmers who are in severe financial difficulty. It is reasonable to expect that farmers with assets higher than the asset limit set for the re-establishment grant should, like other members of the community, first rely upon their own resources before seeking taxpayer-funded assistance.</para></quote><para>Â·	Farmers deciding to exit farming should be encouraged to access career training and education and advisors should promote this requirement more actively.</para><quote><para>Re-establishment grant recipients and their spouses have access to the retraining grant, which provides up to $3,500 in financial assistance to assist with the costs of re-skilling for work within other industries. The grant has been available since 18 December 2000 and is provided for in the Restart Re-establishment Grant Scheme Amendment 2000 No.3.

Farmers must provide a bank certificate from a financial institution to verify that they can no longer borrow against their assets to be eligible for the program.</para></quote><para>Â·	The consultants recommend that farmers who do not want to leave farming be moved to another program such as FarmBis.

Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	(a)	In an interview conducted by my Department with the Sri Venkateswara Temple Association (SVTA) on 28 February 2001, it became apparent that they may not have been making superannuation payments on behalf of the workers. Failure to provide superannuation contributions would be a breach of the <inline font-style="italic">Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act</inline>, which came into effect in July 1992.</para><para>(b)	On 5 March 2001 my Department wrote to the Sydney office of the Australian Tax Office (ATO) providing details of the apparent breaches and seeking comments on the matter. My Department has followed this up and been advised that investigations have not yet been finalised.</para><para>(2)	(a) 	One of the requirements for approval as a business sponsor is that the business is operating lawfully in Australia. Sponsors are required to provide a certificate of their business registration, company extract or equivalent as evidence of satisfying this requirement. </para><para>The registration of companies and their directors falls within the <inline font-style="italic">Corporations Act 1989</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Corporations Law</inline>. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) is responsible for administering this Act, including monitoring and enforcement. Under section 201B of the <inline font-style="italic">Corporations Law</inline>, persons must not act as a director (or manage a company without Court consent) for five years if they have been declared bankrupt or if convicted of offences under company law, such as insolvent trading or breach of duties as a company director. Directors must also be over 18. Bankruptcy information is maintained by the Insolvency Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) on the <inline font-style="italic">National Personal Insolvency Index </inline>(NPII). As the watchdog of the <inline font-style="italic">Corporations Act</inline>, ASIC is responsible for taking action against persons acting as directors where the company is in liquidation or where fraud is suspected.</para><para>Associations (as opposed to companies) are registered with relevant State government authorities, rather than ASIC. For associations to be registered, they are required to lodge financial documents, such as annual statements and details of office holders. The SVTA is currently registered with the NSW Department of Fair Trading. Their records show that SVTA has been registered since 1983.</para><para>In the absence of conflicting advice, officers of my Department accept a current business registration certificate, or equivalent, as proof that the sponsor meets registration requirements to lawfully operate as a business. My Department has contacted the NSW Department of Fair Trading seeking their advice on the checks they make regarding office holders of associations registered in NSW in general, and any adverse information they hold regarding Dr Janarthanan.</para><para>(b)	Departmental databases were checked as part of the sponsorship approval and revealed no adverse information on the sponsor. Regulation 1.20D(2)(d) of the Migration Act requires that, for a sponsorship to be approved, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) decision-maker must be satisfied that ânothing adverse is known about the business background of the applicantâ. Where there is doubt regarding the ability of the prospective sponsor to meet this criterion, current policy states that the decision-maker should make direct checks on the employer's standing with bodies including ASIC (and ASX and ATO).</para><para>(3)	On 28 February 2001, officers of my Department interviewed separately the Indian workers and members of SVTA. As a result of the information obtained, my Department wrote to the NSW Department of Industrial Relations seeking their views on whether there had been a breach of industrial relations laws, in this case believed to be the <inline font-style="italic">Building Tradesmen (State) Construction Award</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">NSW Industrial Relations Act 1996</inline>. My Department also wrote to the ATO seeking their advice on whether taxation laws may have been breached.</para><para>My Department has also contacted the Country South District Office of WorkCover NSW over this matter. They have been supplied with details of the complaints, and are conducting investigations into possible breaches of occupational health and safety (OH&amp;S) and workers compensation laws.</para><para>Although relevant agencies have yet to confirm actual breaches occurred, given admissions by the sponsor, my Department wrote to the sponsor on 8 March 2001 advising them that it appeared they had breached their sponsorship undertakings in relation to the 8 workers. They were requested to provide a response within 35 days as to why their sponsorship status should not be revoked under s137B of the Migration Act 1958. No reply was received within the 35-day limit. My Department is now considering options for resolving this case.</para><para>(4)	(a)	Although over 30,000 overseas workers come to Australia each year on long-stay temporary business visas (subclass 457), only 12 cases of alleged exploitation have come to the Department's attention in 2000/01, either as a result of regular monitoring activity, or reports from unions and others in the community. For January and February 2001, DIMA Business Centres undertook 39 site visits and cancelled 97 visas. DIMA is currently compiling monitoring data for March 2001.</para><para>(b)	All employers who sponsor overseas workers sign an undertaking that they agree to meet certain responsibilities in relation to overseas employees they sponsor, including financial responsibility for obligations to the Commonwealth (such as payment of tax and superannuation), compliance with Australian industrial relations laws and conditions of employment, and responsibility for medical and hospital costs.</para><para>My Department processes around 10,000 business sponsorships a year. Enforcement of laws and other statutory requirements including those relating to employment is similarly the responsibility of the relevant government agency. Where possible breaches of industrial relations laws, OH&amp;S requirements and other legislative breaches are identified, these are referred to the relevant agency. To assist in this, my Department undertakes targeted monitoring of employers, including site visits, to provide additional assurance that employers are honouring their sponsorship undertakings. My Department also works closely with the community and unions to ensure overseas workers are only employed when they have an appropriate work right, and that employment is in accordance with Australian awards and conditions.</para><para>(5)	In July 2000, I announced a review would be conducted into the Temporary Residence Program (including the 457 visa category) to examine ways to further streamline entry and enhance integrity of this program. Public submissions to the Review were invited through advertisements in the national press, and a discussion paper was forwarded to a range of stakeholders, including employers and major users of these visas, employer organisations, unions, relevant Government departments and other interested groups. Almost 100 submissions were received, including from unions such as the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU). </para><para>The review will be finalised soon and I will be making announcements on the outcome of this review in due course.</para><para>(6)	The state of the labour market is taken into account in the 457 visa category. Procedures under this category are designed to strike a balance between the needs of business in Australia to quickly bring in overseas personnel with skills and experience that are not readily available locally, while safeguarding job opportunities for Australian citizens and permanent residents.</para><para>Labour market testing is required under the 457 category unless the position to be filled is considered âkeyâ, is on the Migration Occupations in Demand List (MODL), or is for less than 12 months. âKeyâ activities are those that are essential to the business operations of the employer, and include specialist skills. The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB) develops the MODL to identify and target skilled occupations that have a continuing Australia wide labour shortage. The MODL takes a longer term view of the Australian labour market, rather than reacting to short term fluctuations.</para><para>In addition to labour market testing requirements, to be approved as a business sponsor of overseas temporary workers, the business must demonstrate that:</para></quote><para>Â·	they are lawfully operating in Australia;</para><para>Â·	there would be benefit to Australia in terms of employment creation, expansion in trade, development of international business links or improved competitiveness;</para><para>Â·	they have a satisfactory record of training Australians or else will be introducing new technology; and</para><para>Â·	they have a satisfactory record of compliance with immigration laws.</para><quote><para>These arrangements have worked well. Over 85 per cent of visa category 457 entrants are granted to people to fill professional and managerial positions. The expanding ICT industry alone accounts for a quarter of these visas.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education, Training and Youth Affairs Portfolio: Grants or Payments to Employers</title><page.no>24139</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3544)</subtitle><id.no>3544</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24139</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 2 April 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(a)	What Commonwealth monies have been paid, during 1999 and 2000, by the department, under any program, to the employers listed below; and (b) what liabilities does the Commonwealth have to any of these employers during 2001:</para><para>Ararat Abattoirs (Aust) P/L; Australia Meat Holdings; Barossa Fine Foods; Bindaree Beef (Inverell); CMG, Rockhampton; Cargill Foods Australia; Cargill Meat Processors P/L; Cooma Abattoir; Essex Oaks P/L; Fine Meats P/L; Fletcher International, Dubbo and Mt Barker; Cowra Abattoir; Chapmans; Chisholms; Conroys (Pt Pirie and Adelaide); Frews, Stawell and Kyneton; Gateway Meat; A J Green and Sons; Glenloth Meats; Gundagai Meat Processors; Hardwick Abattoir; Hurstbridge Abattoir; Lobethal Abattoir; Killarney Abattoir; Perfect Pork; Metro Meats; Midfield Meats; Myrtleford Abattoirs P/L; Mt Shank; G&amp;K O'Connor; Penny and Lange; Q Meat; Ryans Quality Meats; Southern Meats (Goulburn and Harden); SBA Foods; Tatiara Meats; and Teys Brothers. </para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>24139</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Department is able to provide information (below) on Commonwealth New Apprenticeships Incentives payments made to the listed organisations for the calendar years 1999, 2000 and 2001 (to 6 April 2001).

The majority of the ACCC's investigations of potential contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 are initiated as a result of persons contacting the ACCC and providing information about potentially unlawful conduct. If the ACCC was to disclose the names of complainants, it is likely that in future persons would be significantly less inclined to contact the ACCC and provide details of potentially unlawful conduct for fear of publicity or possible retribution.</para><para>(2)	No.</para><para>(3)	No.</para><para>(4)	(a)	Mr Hassett was formally interviewed by the ACCC on 23 June 2000, not 2 June 2000. Prior to Mr Hassett's formal interview, the ACCC specifically interviewed 21 commercial interests or business people in this matter and made inquiries with a number of other parties.</para><para>	(b)	For a complaint to be a matter that is likely to lead to ACCC involvement in seeking a resolution, enquiries need first to be made by the ACCC to determine if the alleged conduct was an isolated instance or if it was part of a wider pattern. The ACCC's enquiries quickly uncovered further alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act by Commercial and General Publications, and based on this the ACCC determined that the allegation warranted full ACCC investigation. Out of fairness to Mr Hassett, the ACCC had to be satisfied that there was a sufficient evidentiary basis before contacting him and alleging contraventions of the Trade Practices Act.</para><para>(5)	The ACCC is very concerned about the practice of `telephone blowing' and has taken action under the Trade Practices Act against a number of persons and businesses engaging in this form of conduct, which usually involves asserting a right to payment for placement of an advertisement in a publication without a reasonable basis for asserting such a right. Apart from actions taken directly by the ACCC against `telephone blowers', the ACCC also refers allegations of `telephone blowing' to the State Consumer Affairs or Fair Trading agency in the State where the `blowing' originated for follow-up and possible prosecution, where appropriate.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Community Development Employment Program</title><page.no>24150</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3559)</subtitle><id.no>3559</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24151</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 4 April 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the Community Development Employment Program (CDEP):</para><para>(1)	How many places under this program are currently allocated to the Northern Territory.</para><para>(2)	How many places are allocated to each town or community in the Northern Territory.</para><para>(3)	What is the annual CDEP funding to each town or community in the Northern Territory.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>24151</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	As at 1 April 2001, 8,262 (or about 24%) of the 34,175 Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) scheme participant places available nationally are allocated to the Northern Territory.</para><para>(2)	ATSIC Regional Councils allocate CDEP places to CDEP Organisations.

In the attached table you will find the 2000-01 current funding allocations for each CDEP organisation operating in the Northern Territory. CDEP funding consists of two components, CDEP Wages and Oncost funding. The final amount of funding for CDEP wages will depend on the daily number of participants each CDEP had on their project throughout 2000-01. The amount shown for CDEP Oncost funding represents recurrent needs, capital injections and one-off initiatives. The local ATSIC Regional Council determines the level of CDEP Oncost funding to each CDEP organisation. CDEP Oncost funding is not strictly linked to the places currently allocated to each CDEP organisation.</para><para>Table 1: CDEP Organisations operating in the Northern Territory in 2000-01.

question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	The Commonwealth makes a significant contribution to support the work of schools in improving the learning outcomes of all young Australians and will provide approximately $311 million in 2001 under the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes Programme. In 2001 the Northern Territory share of this funding is expected to be approximately $5.38 million.</para><para>The Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes Programme was introduced in 2001 and combines funding formerly provided under the Commonwealth's literacy and numeracy and special education school support fixed and per capita programmes. The objective of the programme is to improve the learning outcomes of educationally disadvantaged students, particularly in literacy and numeracy, and the educational participation and outcomes of students with disabilities, including students with an intellectual disability.</para><para>State and Territory government and non-government education authorities are responsible for the detailed administration of this funding. They have the flexibility to decide which students and schools have the greatest need for support and to direct funds accordingly.</para><para>In addition to funding provided under the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes Programme, the Commonwealth will provide $82,000 to the Northern Territory under the Special Education - Non-government Centre Support Programme. The objective of this programme is to improve the educational opportunities, learning outcomes and personal development of children with disabilities who need services provided at or in connection with non-government centres.</para><para>(2)	No. The Commonwealth funding is supplementary. State and Territory Governments have primary responsibility for school education and it is expected that they would be providing funding to support the education of students with a disability.</para><para>(3)	(a)	In the Northern Territory government, Catholic and independent education authorities are responsible for the detailed administration of the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes Programme in their sectors. These authorities are the Northern Territory Department of Education, the Catholic Education Office Northern Territory and the Association of Independent Schools of the Northern Territory.</para><para>The breakdown of funding under this programme by sector is provided in question 3 part (b) of this answer.</para><para>The Northern Territory Department of Education is the sole agent for administering funding provided under the Special Education - Non-government Centre Support Programme.</para><para>	(b)	In 2001 funding provided to the Northern Territory under the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes Programme is expected to be approximately $5.38 million. Of this, the expected approximate amounts for each agency are $4.03 million for the Northern Territory Department of Education, $0.91 million for the Catholic Education Office Northern Territory, and $0.44 million for the Association of Independent Schools of the Northern Territory.</para><para>(4)	The financial and educational accountability and reporting requirements for education authorities administering Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes Programme are as for Commonwealth Programmes for Schools more generally.</para><para>Funding agreements between the Commonwealth and education authorities specify that funds must be spent in accordance with programme guidelines and contain accountability and reporting requirements.</para><para>Financial accountability requirements are for a Financial Accountability certificate signed by an authorised person to be provided by 30 June of the year following the programme year for which the funds were provided.</para><para>Educational accountability is largely met through participation in the preparation of a national report on the outcomes of schooling (the Annual National Report on Schooling in Australia or ANR), including the provision information for inclusion in the ANR addressing the performance information requirements set out in the regulations to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Assistance) Act 2000.</para><para>Funding provided under the Special Education - Non-government Centre Support Programme for a particular year must be acquitted by 30 June of the following year.</para><para>(7)	Participation by funding recipients in the evaluation of outcomes of financial assistance, as required by the Commonwealth Minister, is an educational accountability requirement.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cairns International University Pty Ltd</title><page.no>24155</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3562)</subtitle><id.no>3562</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24155</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 5 April 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	What is the current status within Australia as a higher education institution of Cairns International University Pty Ltd.</para><para>(2)	Does this entity award degrees in Australia; if so, at what level.</para><para>(3)	Does it enjoy accreditation with any Australian education authority; if so, with which authority.</para><para>(4)	With reference to the Minister's previous advice that the word `university' is protected under the Corporations Regulations and that protocols exist when applications are made to use this word: (a) has Cairns International University Pty Ltd applied to use the word `university'; if so, what was the decision of the delegate for the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation at the Department of Treasury; (b) was the Department of Education Training and Youth Affairs consulted, either formally or informally; (c) was the Queensland Office of Higher Education consulted; and (d) if no application has been made, what action has been taken to curtail the use of the word by this company.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>24155</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Queensland Office of Higher Education has provided the following information in relation to questions 1 to 3, and 4(d):</para><para>(1)	Cairns I.U.
