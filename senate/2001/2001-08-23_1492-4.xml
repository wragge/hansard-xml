I wish to indicate that the government will support this motion on the basis of its support for the ongoing development of women's sport in Australia. Sport is an integral part of our lives and our culture. However, it is a fact that, whilst women's sports like netball enjoy very high participation rates in the community, they have traditionally received little national media coverage, particularly on television. The government, and particularly the Minister for Sport and Tourism, Jackie Kelly, strongly advocate the widespread benefits of sport and fitness and recognise that the ABC's television coverage of women's sports has lifted the profile of these sports, just as the ABC's television coverage has lifted the profile of other sports not mentioned in this motion, like VFL, club rugby and lawn bowls. </para></talk.start><para>The government does wish to put on record that, whilst it supports this motion, it does not wish that support to be construed as either pre-empting the ABC's current review or putting any undue political pressure on the ABC regarding this matter. The independence of the ABC is a matter that the coalition government considers to be very important. Whilst we do not always agree with everything the ABC says or does, the ABC's statutory independence protects it from undue political interference, particularly in regard to programming. I know that Labor has no interest in preserving the political independence of the ABC, but, given the Democrats' longstanding commitment to this important principle, I consider that the last paragraph of this motion could have been better worded. Notwithstanding that concern, the government supports the motion in the interests of supporting and promoting the development of women's sport in Australia. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>26441</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee</title><page.no>26441</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Extension of Time</title><page.no>26441</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Calvert</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tierney</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That the time for the presentation of the report of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001 be extended to 18 September 2001.</para></motion></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISABILITY SERVICES AMENDMENT (IMPROVED QUALITY ASSURANCE) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>26441</page.no><id.no>S330</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>26441</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hill</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to improve the quality of employment services and rehabilitation programs provided for people with disabilities, and for related purposes.</para></motion><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>26441</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>26441</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as followsâ</inline></para><para>Reform of specialist disability employment assistance and rehabilitation services is critical to meeting broader objectives for welfare reform.  People with disabilities, including those with greater support needs, should benefit to the maximum extent possible from employment opportunities available to the wider community.  The proposed new quality assurance system given effect by this bill is a key element of the Government's plan to improve employment outcomes for people with disabilities. </para><para>As part of the Australians Working Together package announced on Budget night, the Government is providing more than $17 million over four years for the new quality assurance system.  This will provide the platform to enable disability employment assistance services and rehabilitation services to deliver quality outcomes.  The new system will benefit people with disabilities, as consumers and their carers.  It will also benefit Government (and, therefore, the Australian taxpayer), as a purchaser of these services.</para><para>The specialist disability employment assistance and rehabilitation programs addressed by this bill are just one part of a range of Commonwealth programs to help people with disabilities find and keep employment.  Services are typically provided under contract by charitable, non-profit agencies with the exception of rehabilitation, which is provided by CRS Australia.</para><para>Currently, service quality is self-assessed annually by each agency and audited every five years by the Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services.  The current system was designed around an expectation that services would progress from minimum applicable standards to higher standards.  This simply has not happened.</para><para>The current system was discussed in Assuring Quality, a 1997 report by the Disability Quality and Standards Working Party, which comprised key representatives of the disability sector.  Of particular concern was the lack of a transparent and universally applied accreditation and certification system to provide an assurance of quality.  The current system also lacks incentive for service improvement and transparent structure for complaints and referral system.  The new quality assurance system responds to these concerns.</para><para>The new quality assurance system is the product of a great deal of time and energy committed by the disability sector and the Government.  A consultation paper was widely distributed, public consultations held around the country and targeted consumer focus groups set up.  The new system underwent a successful trial last year and enjoys support from the industry.</para><para>Under the new system, there will be a shift to a system that is industry owned and supported, that is outcome focused and that fosters a culture of continuous improvement.  A key component is also the critical role people with disabilities will play as technical experts in the audit teams.  The existing training and support for people with disabilities will be refocussed to support this role. The new system is based on a well-established system of accreditation and certification that uses international standards of best practice.  Industry-based certification agencies will be accredited by an independent, internationally recognised accreditation authority.  The skilled audit teams managed by those agencies will then certify disability employment services against the disability standards and associated key performance indicators.</para><para>Provision of rehabilitation programs by the Commonwealth will also be audited against the standards and associated key performance indicators and certified under the new system.  All disability employment services and rehabilitation programs will be treated consistently.</para><para>After a three-year transition period beginning on 1 January 2002, only those existing disability employment services that fully meet the standards will attract Government funding and only those rehabilitation programs the provision of which meets the standards will be approved.  However, there will be a range of incentives and support to help services make the transition to the new system and continue to improve.</para><para>Newly established employment services will have up to a year to reach full standards.</para><para>The new complaint and referral system will form the final component of the quality assurance system.  Work is underway with the disability community to have it introduced from 1 July 2002.</para><para>This bill provides the formal structure to put the new system to work.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the 2002 autumn sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>26442</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee</title><page.no>26442</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Extension of Time</title><page.no>26442</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hogg</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That the time for the presentation of the following reports of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee be extended to 27 September 2001:</para><para>	(a)	second report on the examination of developments in contemporary Japan and the implications for Australia; and</para><para>	(b)	the disposal of Defence properties.</para></motion></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AUTHORITY</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>26442</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolkus</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That there be laid on the table by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill), no later than immediately after questions without notice on the next day of sitting, the report prepared by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on water quality targets in the catchments feeding into the Great Barrier Reef region.</para></motion></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>26443</page.no><id.no>R1340</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>26443</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>26443</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>26443</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><para>This bill contains amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act) to provide that following elections, public funding for the Liberal Party is to be paid to the agent of the Liberal Party of Australia (Federal Secretariat), rather than to the State and Territory Divisions of the Liberal Party (that is, those State and Territory Divisions of the Liberal Party which are constitutionally linked to the Federal Secretariat - NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, WA, TAS and the ACT). </para><para>However, the agent of the Federal Secretariat of the Liberal Party may lodge with the AEC, prior to polling day, a written notice that sets out the proportion of the public funding to be paid to the agents of the State and Territory Divisions and the proportion of the public funding to be paid to the agent of the Federal Secretariat.

While the majority of offences in legislation in the Health and Aged Care portfolio will operate as they always have, without amendment, there are some that will require adjustment.  </para><para>Amongst the most significant amendments is the express application of strict liability to some offence-creating provisions. Under the Criminal Code an offence must specifically identify strict liability, or the prosecution will be required to prove fault in relation to each element of the offence. This is necessary to ensure that the strict liability nature of some provisions is not lost in the transition to the application of the Criminal Code's general principles. If relevant offences are not adjusted in this manner many will become more difficult for the prosecution to prove, therefore reducing the protection which was originally intended by the Parliament to be provided by the offence.</para><para>The Bill will similarly improve the efficient and fair prosecution of offences by clarifying the physical elements of offences, amending inappropriate fault elements and by clarifying provisions where the defendant will bear a burden of proof.  Several provisions in portfolio legislation require a defendant to bear an onus of proof which is unnecessarily difficult and inconsistent with the statutory preference in the Criminal Code.  The opportunity has been taken in this Bill to amend these provisions so that where the defendant must bear a burden of proof, the defendant will need to point to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility rather than prove a matter beyond reasonable doubt. </para><para>Further, where a provision in the Health and Aged Care portfolio legislation is duplicated in the Criminal Code, this Bill will repeal that provision. </para><para>This harmonisation of offence-creating and related offences in Health and Aged Care legislation with the Criminal Code is an important step in the Government's program of legislative reform that will achieve greater consistency in Commonwealth criminal law. </para><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the 2002 autumn sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>26444</page.no><id.no>R1321</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>26444</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>26444</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>26444</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><para>The bill continues the Government's commitment to improving the learning outcomes of educationally disadvantaged students, particularly in the key areas of literacy and numeracy.  </para><para>This bill provides for the 2001-2002 Budget measure, that announced $33.3 million over the period 2001-02 to 2002-03 to continue strategic assistance in schools and support literacy and numeracy research.

Many offence provisions in the Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs portfolio legislation predate the Code and their meaning and operation may change following the application of the Criminal Code if the appropriate amendments are not made.  Those provisions must be harmonised with the Code to preserve their current meaning and operation, and to ensure compliance and consistency with the general principles of the Criminal Code.</para><para>This Bill harmonises offences in the Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs portfolio legislation by making a number of largely technical amendments.</para><para>First, the Bill makes it clear that the Criminal Code applies to offence provisions within the portfolio legislation.</para><para>Second, the Bill clarifies whether certain offences are strict liability offences - that is, an offence where the prosecution does not need to prove any fault on the part of the defendant.

The Code envisages that offences will comprise three physical elements - conduct, circumstance or result - each of which attracts a corresponding fault element.

This will ensure conformity with the policy underlying the Code that defendants should bear only an evidential burden. </para><para>Fifth, the Bill removes parts of offences, such as aiding and abetting and the defence of lawful excuse, which duplicate the general offence provisions in the Criminal Code.

To avoid calling a quorum, I have a response to a question asked by Senator Ferguson, and it is probably timely to get that on the record while the others make their way to the chamber. Yesterday, Senator Ferguson asked about the circumstances where information about commission or other remuneration would be required to be provided. I would like to add some more information because I know there are a lot of people whom Senator Ferguson represents who have some concerns in relation to this matter. We hope this information will allay at least some of those concerns. The bill will only require commission disclosure in relation to risk insurance products when personal advice about these products is provided to a retail client. Information about remuneration, including commission that will be received by the providing entity, must be disclosed where:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... that might reasonably be expected to be or have been capable of influencing the providing entity in providing the advice;</para></quote><para>This test will apply regardless of the number of products to which advice is provided. Commission disclosure is not required if no personal advice is provided to a retail client. It is appropriate to addâand the advisers can tell me if I am wrongâthat the minister is appointing two members of the industry to the organisation committee that is writing the regulations. We are very keen to ensure that the industry is represented throughout the entire phase. I hope that satisfies Senator Ferguson's inquiry.

Section 92A of the FSR bill, as it is currently drafted, only requires that a market licensee do all things necessary to ensure that the market operates in a way that promotes the objectives of fairness, orderliness and transparency to the extent that it is reasonably practicable to do soâin particular, to the extent that these objectives are consistent with each other. By contrast, the Corporations Act requires that a securities exchange must, to the extent reasonably practicable, do all things that are necessary to ensure that each stock market of the exchange is an orderly and fair market. </para><para>Accordingly, I believe section 792A, despite inserting a requirement of transparency, is a watering down of the obligations on market operators. Merely to promote the objectives does not place a sufficiently positive obligation on the market operator. I support the requirement that a market be transparent, and interpret that to mean that information on prices and other corporate information be disclosed to the market in an efficient, timely and equal manner. At a time when there are a large number of retail investors, this is an important obligation and it will assist in developing their confidence in transacting on the market. Similarly, it will assist in maintaining the reputation Australia enjoys for market integrity. I do, however, see the change in the language in describing the obligations of market operators as a backward step. I do not see the change as merely cosmetic, as this change was described by a Treasury officer when giving evidence to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities. If the intent is not different, as was the evidence given to the committee, I do not see why this amendment cannot be supported. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>26448</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe understand this amendment will be carried so we are not going to die in a ditch over it, nor send the bill backwards and forwards. The only problem with thisâI think the intent of it is fineâas I think everyone would admit, is that there is tension between the concepts of fairness, orderliness and transparency. Of course, in an ideal world, you try to have all of them working all at once, but it is unlikely that all three will be simultaneously satisfied. The practical reality is that, if you are running a market, using your best endeavours to see all three concepts happening at once is probably the best you can do, but we are not going to say any more than that. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>26448</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe opposition have appropriately qualified their amendment.

They relate to the increase in the ownership limit of the Australian Stock Exchange from five per cent to 15 per cent, with which we have no disagreement. This bill does not deal specifically with the Australian Stock Exchange, but refers to bodies corporate with Australian market licences or Australian clearing and settlement facility licences as specified in the regulations for the purpose of section 850A. As the bill is presently configured, voting power on those licences is limited to 15 per cent unless the minister approves a higher percentage for a particular body. </para><para>The amendment we circulated proposes to simply remove the minister's discretion to approve a percentage of higher than 15 per cent. We took the view that increasing the ownership percentage limit from five to 15 was acceptable and helpful to the organisation concerned, but that any increase beyond 15 per cent should require the minister to come back to the parliament with an amendment. The parliament could then judge the request on its merits at the time. It is obvious why we would wish it to come back to the parliament; this will always be an issue of the national interest, and that was our concern.</para><para>However, we have listened to arguments from the government concerning some practical consequences of that and we have reached a compromise, which hopefully will be accepted by the Senate, which has resulted in the amendment now before us. Our primary concern is with the Australian Stock Exchange. The original five per cent ownership limit was placed in the legislation which facilitated the demutualisation of the exchange and was done so for good reason, which, I remind the Senate, had cross-party support. It cannot be in the public interest for the exchange to be controlled by one entity. The minister will have the power to approve ownership limits of greater than 15 per cent in relation to other markets or clearing and settlement facilities of national significance. I am quite sure, though, that if ever those other facilities were to grow to a certain size then we may need to review this issue, but that is not necessary at present.</para><para>In the case of the ASX, the minister will be empowered to make a regulation prescribing a higher level of ownership. That regulation will be disallowable but, in accordance with our amendment, will not take effect until the period for disallowance has lapsedâwhich is a critical point, and I am grateful to Senator Conroy for bringing to my attention the dangers of an instrument being disallowable but applicable until such time as it is disallowable. We may be criticised for singling out the ASX for special attention or for a special disadvantage. Our response to that criticism would be that the ASX is not just another company; it serves the national interest and additional parliamentary oversight is therefore warranted. We regard it as having particular importance in terms of the national interest because it has a statutory regulatory authority. That is the key difference between it and the other clearing and settlement agencies. Therefore, parliament has to be very careful with regard to whose hands ASX falls into and how its share register is managed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>26450</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI indicate Labor's support for those amendments, as outlined by Senator Murray. As he has indicated, there is a substantive difference between the ASX and the other institutions that are covered by this bill. There has been some discussion and some concern about the potential for conflict of interest in a number of areas. The ASX is rightfully expanding into a number of market services, which brings it into conflict with companies that are listed on its own market. I note that it has taken steps to address this potential for conflict but it is an area that is growing in importance. Having the ASX monitoring and supervising companies that it is in competition with does place it in a very difficult position.</para></talk.start><para>But, more importantly, as Senator Murray said, the ASX is a coregulator. We have a coregulation model and, while we support all sensible attempts to improve the liquidity of the Australian marketâbecause we are a relatively small market and the ASX has helped us punch above our weightâthere are concerns about equity swaps with other markets and mergers. Alliances are being considered and they have, by and large, the support, I think, of all political parties to allow us to maintain a strong position within the world capital markets. However, allowing an equity swap with a company or with another governmentâsuch as with the Singapore Exchangeâbrings into question who is going to be in control of our listing rules, who is going to be in control of market supervision of Australian companies and who is going to help protect Australian investors. The Singapore government has a very different approach to corporate law. I hope that the alliance that is being talked about can come off, subject to the proviso that Australian investors continue to receive the protection of Australian Corporations Law when they invest in productsâand not believe that just because they are investing in a product that is on an alliance market that they are receiving all the same protections. There are some very sensitive and important issues at stake here. While the ASX continues to have those coregulatory requirements and provisions, it has to be conscious that the parliament will continue to view it slightly differently to other companies that are listed on its own exchange. </para><para>While I do not think that this is a perfect solution, it is a reasonable solution. My preference would have been for the ASX to have to come back and get legislative changes into the future. We hope that the government are willing to accept this as a reasonable compromise. We hope that the ASX understand that we in no way want to inhibit their business, but while they remain a coregulator parliament will always take the role of the ASX much more seriously than the roles of some of the other organisations that are dealt with in this legislation. We hope we have reached a reasonable compromise that the government can accept and that the ASX are willing to live with, and we hope that the government are, in the end, prepared to accept this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>26450</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think it comes down to the use of language: probably the correct language for the government to describe our position with is that we are not particularly happy with the amendment but we are happier than we were a couple of days ago. There is, of course, a tension between the proposal and what the government would like. We clearly would prefer the minister to have the power to approve the breach of the 15 per cent in special circumstances. The suggestion that Senator Conroy made that you have to come back and alter the legislation is less desirable than what we have been faced with hereâthat is, effectively a delay of 15 sitting days, which all of us here know can, at certain times of the year, extend to an extraordinary length of time. Clearly, the undesirable feature of this amendment, which should be placed on the record, is that it can cause an enormous delay and therefore uncertainty, particularly for the Australian Stock Exchange.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian Stock Exchange has a wide degree of cross-partisan support as a very successful exchangeâan exchange that, when you look at what has happened since that demutualisation bill went through this place a few years ago, has set a huge example for financial regulators around the world. It was a bold move, championed by Maurice Newman and Richard Humphry. A lot of the members of the Stock Exchange were very happy with Mr Newman and Mr Humphry when they were able see their share values fly. I noticed that in the Stock Exchange building in Perth, where my office is, the number of Jaguars and Porsches increased significantly shortly after the passage of the legislation. I remind my friends in the Stock Exchange in Perth that none of them have bought me lunch yet!</para><para>I should not be flippant about it: it has been a great success. Some of the concerns that were expressed at the time have proved to be unnecessary. Senator Conroy has raised a couple of issues that the Stock Exchange is very cognisant of, but it has been an extraordinarily successful player which, to use Senator Conroy's term again, has allowed Australia to punch way above its weight. The last time I was briefed by the exchange we still accounted for about two per cent of the world capital markets and our regard in the international financial circles and the securities market circles is much higher than that. We are a very successful financial centre. We have built on that reputation over recent years, and I think the Corporations Law reforms and the financial sector reforms have helped. But we do not want to see the exchange hamstrung in its manoeuvring and its strategies to stay ahead of the game. The sorts of activities that Maurice Newman and Richard Humphry are undertaking in relation to alliances with other exchanges in the Asia-Pacific basin are to be encouraged. They are looking outside the circle. They know that in this global time of significant change you cannot stand still. Some people look at stock exchanges and think that they are an institution which will never change, but in this global era with its massive changes in how people are transacting business and moving money around using web based systems the concept of an exchange has already changed forever and will keep changing very rapidly, so they need to be flexible.</para><para>Between the concept of having to come back here to seek a legislative change and the concept of coming back here and seeking the change through what is effectively delegated legislation, the Democrats' proposal is far more desirable from the government's point of view. In practiceâto make the Democrats' argumentâif a change did need to be made, if a breach of the 15 per cent did need to be made, then ultimately the game could move on anyway if it were made clear by the major political parties that it was not likely to be disallowed. So, to use my previous phrase, this is an amendment that the government would prefer not to have to have in the legislation but it is one that we can live with.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>26451</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to make one final comment.

The first is that shadow minister Conroy and the alternative government, the Labor Party, have acted pretty honourably in supporting these amendments. As they have an aspiration to be the government and for shadow minister Conroy to sit in Minister Hockey's seat, they have given up a chance for extra power. So, for those who accuse politicians of always being power hungry, in this case they have shown that they are not, so that is a point that needs to be made.</para></talk.start><para>The second point is that there are precedents for government delaying decisionsâor in this case the parliament delaying decisionsâin the national interest. The most obvious are the Foreign Investment Review Board's decisions. As we know, there was a recent example in my own state of Western Australia, where the Shell-Woodside takeover was subject to national considerations and took many months. Therefore, I think delays are sometimes necessary for national interest matters to be considered. The parliamentary secretary does make the right comment: if there was an emergency takeover that was necessary or something self-evidently had to happen, I am quite sure all parties would allow the instrument through. Only in those circumstances where there might be extraordinary considerations could there ever be a threat that the regulation would be disallowed. I expect no great difficulties there. In practice, I would expect the companies concerned to have a pretty good feeling about what the political parties' shadows in these areas would feel about these issues. </para><para>The last point I make regards the ASX, and I think if they read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> they should be very well aware of the points made by me and by Senator Conroy. At some stage, they are going to have to decide whether they want to be a corporation in the normal sense of that word, and the commercial sense, with full access to all the commercial opportunities available to corporations, or if they want to be a regulator. The two cannot live together. If the ASX ever seeks the route which leads to becoming a full corporation with the full freedoms normally allowed to a corporation, the parliament and the government of the day are going to have to reconsider where the regulatory authority presently carried by the ASX should rest. I think it is very important that both the Senate and the ASX understand that that observation is behind some of the remarks and judgment made today.</para><para>Amendments agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>26452</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move amendment (3) on revised sheet 2330:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(3)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 162 (lines 4 to 7), omit paragraph (a), substitute:</para><para>	(a)	do all things necessary to ensure that the financial services covered by the licence are provided efficiently, honestly and fairly; and</para></quote><para>I believe that the inclusion of the words `to the extent reasonably practicable' in section 912A is not necessary and may interrupt the judicially established interpretation of the requirement to provide financial services efficiently, honestly and fairly. The courts have held that those three words are to be interpreted compendiously, such that the requirement would only imply that the licensee act efficiently while having regard to the dictates of honesty and fairness, act honestly while having regard to the dictates of efficiency and fairness and act fairly while having regard to the dictates of efficiency and honesty. This interpretation would appear to balance any conflict between the terms and exclude the need for the qualifying words `to the extent reasonably practicable'. Indeed, it was suggested by one law firm in their analysis of the bill that, if this paragraph is not amended, it could imply that a licensee may not have to act honestly if that is not reasonably practicable. Similarly ASIC said, `It would be difficult for us to contemplate a situation where we would tolerate anyone saying that it was not practical for them to act honestly.' ASIC have also stated that they would consider the surrounding circumstances before taking any enforcement action against the licensee. In fact they have admitted that, if there is a minor non-systemic thing, they do not take action. The qualification `to the extent reasonably practicable' is not appropriate in the circumstances of a financial services licensee who deals directly with clients. It should be removed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>26452</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI indicate that the Democrats are persuaded by the opposition's arguments.</para></talk.start><para>Amendment agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>26452</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe opposition opposes schedule 1 in the following terms:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(4)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 183 (line 3) to page 189 (line 23), Division 7, <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para><para>(7)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 234 (line 31) to page 238 (line 18), Division 5, <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para></quote><para>These items all deal with the declared professional body provisions in the FSR Bill. The declared professional body provisions would create a self-regulatory system which is inconsistent with the objective of the bill. ASIC has also stated in its statements on the draft FSR Bill that the introduction of statutory recognition for self-regulatory bodies in financial services would be a significant development in Australian financial services regulation. ASIC is concerned that it may not reflect international trends and may be at odds with the theme of the recommendations in the final report of the financial system inquiry. Australia is to move in the direction of declaring professional bodies, when the major jurisdiction that has tried this approach, the UK, is now moving away from that. A number of submissions from ASFA, SIA, ASX and the Insurance Council of Australia in relation to the draft FSR Bill also stated opposition to the declaration process or recommended that ASIC consult with all relevant and interested parties before making any declarations. Other submissions, such as those from IFSA and AMP, regard it as essential that the standards imposed on such bodies result in the members of declared bodies being subject to exactly the same conduct disclosure and competency requirements as licensees.</para><para>ASIC also raised a number of regulatory concerns. Most notably, ASIC said that the introduction of declared professional body provisions may create a number of problems or gaps in regulatory coverage and is likely to be resource intensive both for ASIC and the participants involved. I note that a number of changes were made to the declared professional body provisions from the draft bill, but they still do not impose a uniform system of regulation, which is the design and, I believe, the benefit of this legislation. I also note that a number of professional bodies for which these provisions were designed have expressed concerns about the provisions, and so I believe that these provisions should be removed. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>26453</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not want to hold things up, but it is important to know that the government believes that the declared professional body mechanism would allow bodies such as accountants and lawyers the opportunity to provide a wider range of financial product advice than would be permitted without this amendment.

In relation to the items concerning the hawking of managed investment products, section 736 of the Corporations Act currently prohibits unsolicited meetings and unsolicited telephone calls to offer securities. `Securities' is defined to include both shares and managed investments. However, the <inline ref="R1256">Financial Services Reform Bill 2001</inline> will amend the definition of securities that applies to section 76 so that managed investments are no longer caught by section 736. I appreciate that the FSR Bill will introduce a prohibition on unsolicited meetings that will apply to managed investments. This was an amendment introduced by the minister on 28 June and which I supported. However, it does mean that, whereas previously there was a prohibition on unsolicited telephone calls in relation to managed investment schemes, under the FSR regime that will not be so. This is not acceptable.</para><para>The Senate's Economics References Committee has been inquiring into the mass marketed tax effective schemes. The committee has heard about how aggressively these managed investment schemes were marketed. Whole towns, such as Kalgoorlie, were targeted. Promoters were relentless in marketing these schemes. Many investors in those schemes are now in financial distress. Further, the minister has said that he wants to help these investors. In a press release on 11 April 2001, the minister said:</para><quote><para>Many of the investors having difficulties with these schemes say they were given misleading advice by promoters and advisers.</para><para>ASIC has assured me that it will continue to take action wherever possible to protect investors in these schemes.</para></quote><para>Without this amendment, the government will have made it easier for promoters to prey on investors. They will have made it harder for ASIC to protect investors. The government will be insisting that promoters market these schemes by allowing promoters to make unsolicited calls to investors. This amendment is not draconian; it merely restores the current situation. It should be supported.</para><para>In relation to the item concerning the way cold calling is conducted, this amendment does not prohibit telemarketing. Many businesses employ telemarketing techniques and it would be inappropriate to ban such techniques. However, where aggressive and unsolicited calls are being made in relation to financial products, there is potential for consumers to be coerced into products which are not in their best interests. It is appropriate then that the manner in which unsolicited calls can be made be regulated. These amendments also enhance consumers' rights to privacy and the benefits of disclosure and reflection. ASIC has called for this amendment, but I understand that the government has refused until today to respond to the increased instances of cold calling. In its submission on the draft bill, ASIC indicated that pressure selling can lead to disastrous consequences for consumers and that it was appropriate that there be specific regulatory requirements for cold calling activities. Since then, there have been a number of instances of cold calling which have been brought to the attention of ASIC.</para><para>In answer to a question taken on notice in estimates in November 2000, ASIC replied:</para><quote><para>There are several examples of cold calling and unfair sales pressure that ASIC is aware of, and in some instances has taken action against. There are several scams where cold calling is used as a selling technique. For example, ASIC is aware of a number of overseas entities cold calling investors within Australia, seeking to sell unlisted shares in overseas companies, and ASIC has also received complaints about unfair sales pressure in relation to insurance products.</para></quote><para>I also understand that other jurisdictions have regulations in the form I am proposing today. In particular, the UK has rules on cold calling that are tougher than I am proposing. A number of consumer groups are also concerned about an absence of regulation on the conduct of cold calling and, in a submission to the joint parliamentary committee, the Australian Consumers Association said:</para><quote><para>Pressure selling and cold calling remain a matter of concern to consumer and investor organisations. Community legal workers have reported an increase of the targeting of lower income consumers by promoters of investment services and financial products. Consumers with limited knowledge of available products, costs and implications of these commitments are placed under significant pressure to commit to services which are often poorly suited to their needs and expensive. This has potentially disastrous outcomes, particularly where there may be a long time lag between the purchase and the consumer realising that the product is unsuitable or inappropriate. More broadly, cold calling and pressure selling techniques continues to be a consumer protection problem for the community. As an example, ASIC provides a warning to consumers about cold calling on life insurance products, financial advice services, Internet offers on investment products and overseas investment offers. The range of these warning indicates the widespread nature of pressure selling in Australian financial services. </para></quote><para>These amendments are needed and should be supported.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>26456</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe do support them, and I think Senator Conroy has made good points in relation to a number of those activities. We will also seek his support when it comes to cold calling in relation to mergers and acquisitions, because we think many of the points that have been made relate to the same sort of pressure that is put on existing shareholders when takeover activity takes placeâwe will obviously deal with that further down the running sheet. But the same sort of pressure tactics are applied by quite often the very same people in the very same call centres when one company is seeking to aggressively take over another company. The points, which are to be supported, that Senator Conroy has made very eloquently in relation to thatâand that is why we are supporting the hawking provisionsâand the activities that he described in relation to managed investment schemes, particularly in Kalgoor-lie, one of my favourite cities, are absolutely accurate. They were disgraceful and despic-able tactics by people who, in many respects, were quite immoral and unethical.</para></talk.start><para>Very similar tactics are used in relation to takeovers with high pressure sales tactics, and I would welcome the opposition's support for our provisions to ensure that those activities are monitored through telephone taping, which is something that stockbrokers seek to use when they are recording their transactions with their customers.

I hope that the Australian Labor Party will see that to be consistent they should support our amendment which is further down the running sheet.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>26456</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think it is important that I add my words of support. I want to congratulate the government on taking the view they have, and I particularly want to congratulate the Labor Party on these amendments because I think it is an excellent improvement to the law. The managed investments scheme scandal has been an eye-opener for all parliamentarians who have taken an interest in the issue. I think what has not been well enough understood sometimes is that there is sometimes, too, a distance between the designer of the product, the producers of the prospectus, the owners of the product and the methods of selling that are used. In some cases the selling is outsourced, and then highly improper pressure selling techniques are used. The consequences for taxpayer investors is that they become victims. </para></talk.start><para>The importance of that, in my view, is as follows. At present, the circumstance of a taxpayer having their tax deduction disallowed, as per their self-assessment, is being put into part 4A circumstances where they get up to a 50 per cent penalty tax imposition and there was up to a 14 per cent compound interest rate imposition. I accept that, in all cases where a self-assessed tax deduction is disallowable, it should be disallowed. That is quite clear on the face of the law and the interpretation of the law that the ATO apply. To my mind, it is absolutely appalling that somebody who is a victim of cold calling or pressure selling techniquesâwhich essentially turn their situation of advice into a highly improper and, I think, sometimes fraudulent, misleading and deceptive circumstanceâshould, on top of having a tax deduction legitimately disallowed, then have to pay a penalty tax and a compound interest penalty as well. Therefore, the establishment of the circumstance whereby ASIC can identify persons subject to a particular scheme or mass market investment approach as having been victims of an improper and misleading circumstance should therefore allow a relay on to the tax office that in those circumstances, for that scheme, these people were victims of a scheme and that, whilst it is all right to disallow their tax deduction, they should not be hit with penalty taxes and compound interest. That is the route I would go with this and I think this is a very important improvement on the law. So, again, my congratulations to the Labor Party and to the government for adopting this approach.</para><para>Amendments agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>26457</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leave âI move Democrats amendments (3), (4) and (5) on sheet 2327, revised sheet No. 2:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(3)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 316 (line 15), at the end of subsection (1), add:</para><para>	; and (l)	if the product has an investment componentâthe extent to which environmental, social or ethical considerations are taken into account in the selection, retention or realisation of the investment.</para><para>(4)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 316 (after line 31), after subsection (2), insert:</para><para>	(2A)	For the purposes of paragraph (1)(l), products which have an investment component include superannuation products, managed investment products and investment life insurance products.</para><para>(5)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 317 (after line 8), after section 1013D, insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">1013DA  Information about ethical considerations etc.</inline></para><quote><para>		ASIC may develop guidelines that must be complied with where a Product Disclosure Statement makes any claim that environmental, social or ethical considerations are taken into account in the selection, retention or realisation of the investment.</para></quote><para>I have dealt with some of the arguments surrounding this during my speech in the second reading debate, but I want to briefly recap.

Amendment (4) clarifies that the types of products where disclosure is mandated are superannuation products, managed investment products and investment life insurance products. </para><para>I mentioned during the second reading debate that I wanted to achieve two things in relation to ethical investments: firstly, to promote a market for ethical investments and to promote awareness of their availability and, secondly, to ensure that, as the market develops, consumers are provided with accurate and not misleading information about the investment products. It is that first objective which is covered by amendments (3) and (4). Amendment (5) on sheet No. 2327 deals with the second objective, the requirement to disclose whether ethical considerations are taken into account or, at the very least, raise awareness of ethical investing. I suspect there are a lot of ordinary investors out there who do not even know of the availability of these sorts of products. In passing, I should say that I think the majority of Australian companies listed on the Stock Exchange and other products about would fall into the categories we regard as ethical.</para><para>Amendment (5) is about ensuring that claims by promoters that they are selling an ethical investment are true as predicted over the coming five years and beyond and that more and more marketing value becomes attached to ethical investments, as it has overseas. I would remind the chamber of the figure I gave yesterday, which is that the current figure in the United States invested in these products is estimated to be $US2.16 trillion. If I could make an analogy with the Australian Made symbol, some years ago that symbol started to become valuable, and not long after that occurred regulations had to be put in place to clarify what could be reasonably labelled Australian Made; otherwise, you had situations where the logo was placed on items where very little of the production work occurred in Australia.</para><para>As I mentioned during the second reading debate, there is an information imbalance between the promoters and investors. If a promoter claims that the company's investment choices are made, taking into account environmental, ethical and other non-financial considerations, where is the investor to go to confirm that claim? It will be up to ASIC to have a look at the ethical investments that are presently on offer and to evaluate the sorts of criteria for disclosure that their prospectuses makeâin other words, to provide a guidance note or guidelines. From that evaluation, I envisage they should be able to draft suitable guidelines on what should be included. There is a function that governments, particularly this government, have consistently given ASIC and that is the discretion to devise guidelines which accord with the flexibility that is required in the market.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>26458</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move opposition amendments (1) and (2) on revised sheet No. 2337 to Democrat amendments (3) and (5):</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Paragraph 1013D(1)(l), after âwhichâ, insert âlabour standards orâ.</para><para>(2)	Section 1013DA, after âthatâ (second occurring), insert âlabour standards orâ.</para></quote><para>These amendments seek to just round out some aspects of the word `ethical'.

One common complaint was that there has been no consultationâa significant change and yet no consultation. A further complaint was that the amendment was unworkable, it was cast too broadly, but most importantly the Law Council suggested that it would not help prosecutions. Ms Farrell told the committee:</para><quote><para>I used to be a prosecutorâor was for a couple of years anywayâand certainly having a piece of evidence like that is useful from a prosecution viewpoint but if you are dealing with call centre operations where you can be getting hours and hours and hours and hours of tape over a period of weeks or months, actually finding it is sometimes hard and query whether or not finding the particular thing that you are looking for is sometimes harder ... but if you are not looking for complaint driven investigation, if you are looking for ASIC to find it, it is never going to happen. It is not a useful deployment of ASIC's resources.</para></quote><para>A further complaint was that it would stifle takeover activity. The Securities Institute of Australia remained concerned that this requirement would stifle takeover activity, that it would lessen the discipline exerted on management by the threat of a takeover and be a disservice to shareholders. A further complaint was that it would be extremely costly and that it ignored the safeguards already in place on the telemarketing of information in relation to takeover bids. But the one complaint I did not hear was that of a shareholder who was complaining of being misled in a takeover. I asked the Australian Shareholders Association; I asked various consumer groups. They could not give an instance of any complaint. </para><para>As a result, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities unanimously recommended that the provisions in relation to the recording of telephone conversation takeovers be deleted. The chairâand I am sorry that he is not here in the chamber todayâconcluded that, given the degree of concern expressed about the inappropriateness of the proposal per se, the committee believed that the government should review the objectives of the proposal and consider what alternative approaches would marry better with the present operating features of the industry. He said that this proposal was ill conceived and should not form part of the Corporations Act.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>26459</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have already made some remarks in relation to this.

That is exactly what the government want to do. We want to put more stress on incumbent boards. It is one of those areas of irony or confusion, from the opposition's point of view at least, that this is a government that gets accused of being in bed with the top end of town but it is actually the top end of town which oppose mandatory bids. They do not want control to be able to pass without full-on market bids. They love full-on market bids. They love getting all of the lawyers in. They love all of the money that is involved and they want to reduce stress in relation to takeovers. The government stands committed to mandatory bids and follow-on, which we believe will create far stronger market control and will therefore ensure that shareholder value is focused on more. The Australian Labor Party's view in relation to this amendment seems to be confused.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is unashamedly a consumer protection measure. I think Senator Conroy's remarks are accurate to the extent of reinforcing the fact that this is not a widespread activity, but this measure gives ASIC the power to do this in the event that it occurs. I think the argument in relation to hours and hours of tape does not stand. Clearly, this will be a complaint based mechanism. If there is a complaint in relation to this sort of activity taking place it will give ASIC the opportunity to review the tapes around that time. You will be able to focus in on the activity that has taken place. The great thing about this provision is that if it is successful there will not be a complaint, because people will know that any behaviour that provides pressure on shareholders is unlikely to occur since they know that if there is a complaint by a shareholder then ASIC will have this power to move in and quickly get the evidence that it requires.</para><para>It is a good measure. It is unashamedly pro-consumer and it is a desirable thing. As someone who has championed takeover reform in Australia, I tend to disagree with some of the Securities Institute's argument in this regard. I think this measure will actually assist in building a much better, fairer, more open and honest takeover regime in Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>26460</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is one of those issues on which I have been tugged hither and thither during the inquiry and the report process. I must say I have actually been influenced quite considerably in my attitude to the need for consumer oriented regulation by my experiences of the mass marketed investment schemes. I do not want to get too emotional here, but when you have, as I have, held the hands of sobbing people who had enough money to invest in these things you as a parliamentarian recognise the need to ensure that investors, who in the large part are not experienced and are unsophisticated in terms of financial products, have as many safeguards as possible in the market.</para></talk.start><para>The issue we must look at is whether we are being consistent in this matter. It is an issue that I had to address when I was looking at the risk disclosure area, for instance. The arguments were strong that they should be excluded. But in the end I agreed with the government that you are better off to have full disclosure on a consumer based approach. The fact is that large numbers of Australians who in decades gone by would not have been shareholders, would not have been investing in securities, would not have been investing in financial products and would not have had access to or be accessible by the market are now just that. When they are taken advantage of, the consequences for them are quite considerable.</para><para>I really cannot stress enough the impact of a place such as Kalgoorlie, where the consequences of getting involved in schemes and then having the weight of the Taxation Office descend upon them has resulted in marriage break-ups, asset loss and, in some sad cases, suicides; so quite a deal of community pain. It is for that reason that I think that in any situation where pressure selling can occur either in person or over the telephone we have to be careful. In the same way as I thought the motivation by Senator Conroy of his previous remarks was on the button really in terms of consumer protection, I think that I need to shift my position on this. I have been affected, frankly, by my circumstances over the last month or so, and I think the more protection and safeguards that we can provide on the consumer side through our regulators the better.

There is something quite remarkable about this budget measure because it is shown in Budget Paper No. 2 at zero costâthat is, nothingâyet the description of the measure says that it is to be used `to improve the learning outcome for educationally disadvantaged students, particularly in the key areas of literacy and numeracy'. So we have a budget measure about improving literacy which costs zero. This sums up perfectly Dr Kemp's big claims, based on smoke and mirrors, about literacy.</para></talk.start><para>During the estimates, I asked the department about the mystery of the budget measures which are costed at zero. They provided me with a detailed answer but did not actually say that the funding in this bill had been provided for the forward estimates but not appropriated, although I take it that that is basically what has happened. Over the past five years the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, has made determined efforts to convince everyone that he discovered literacy. It is for that reason that I foreshadow an amendment to the motion that the bill be read a second time. According to Dr Kemp, no governmentâor the one that he was a member ofâhas ever had a passing thought about literacy.</para><para>In the Working Nation plan, the former Labor government allocated $2.6 million in 1994 to a national school English literacy survey which was to collect nationally comparable data on literacy achievement. Labor also provided funding to specific early literacy programs. The national school English literacy survey was duly conducted in August and September 1996 in both government and non-government schools. The results were published in `Mapping the literacy achievement' and the introduction to the report at page 6 summarised the findings. The findings were that four per cent of year 11 and 12 students were assessed as being below the range of achievement estimated in the draft benchmark for reading, and six per cent were below the required range for reading. I have a copy of that survey. It is quite clear to me that that is what the statistics indicate. However, discussions between the Commonwealth and the states about appropriate benchmarks were continuing at the time. Clearly, they were not results that the minister wanted to hear, so he went out and commissioned a separate report, <inline font-style="italic">Literacy Standards in Australia</inline>, which classified students as being below or above an arbitrary line; that is, a pass or a failâall or nothing.</para><para>The problem was that the author of that report, Geoff Masters from the Australian Council of Educational Research, indicated that the way in which that report was subsequently used was clearly not in the manner in which he had intended. Geoff Masters indicated that the findings of that report were based on a draft literacy standard that was arbitrary and had not been finalised in national consultations. This is the report that this minister constantly claims saw 27 per cent of year 3 students fail to meet the minimum acceptable standards.</para><para>Looking at another document which we received through the Senate estimates process, we see that the Commonwealth department also conducted its own survey in 1999. This DETYA survey showed that the number of students who were achieving DETYA's benchmark was 86.9 per cent. We therefore have three separate sets of figures which go to this issue of so-called literacy benchmarks.</para><para>I think that we are entitled, when debating bills like this, to recall the manner in which Dr Kemp has sought to peddle his distortions on literacy and numeracy. Who could possibly forget his appearance on the <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> program on 14 September 1997. Who could forget that, at the time, his erstwhile political colleague, the Victorian Liberal Minister for Education, Phil Gude, called him a `spin doctor' and accused him of `political grandstanding'. We also recall that on 15 September 1997 Mr Gude was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> as saying:</para><quote><para>He ought to do the right thing . . . own up to the fact that he's manipulated the figures in a most dishonest and disgraceful fashion.</para></quote><para>It was on the same day that Mr Gude was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> accusing Dr Kemp of using the literacy issue for his own career advancement. Mr Gude's words were:</para><quote><para>I don't doubt the good doctor wants to get into the inner Cabinet, but this isn't the way to do it. Dishonesty is never the right way of getting a promotion.</para></quote><para>On 24 September 1997 in a media release Mr Gude referred to Dr Kemp's actions as `typical schoolyard bully stuff'.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Paul (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Calvert)</inline>âOrder!

What I will say is that the minister is not fulfilling the Prime Minister's guidelines to be accurate and fair in his dealings with the public, because we clearly have a situation where he has claimed in the revised explanatory memorandum that, just as we had this mysterious growth in the number of students that were not meeting the benchmark in 1996, those not achieving the minimum standard has suddenly fallen to 14 per cent. So we have this mysterious growth to 27 per cent suddenly falling to 14 per cent. I am quite taken aback by this, because I notice that not only does this government seek in this document to bring forward distorted and misleading figuresâand quite clearly totally inappropriate figuresâbut it is prepared to do it to every schoolchild in this country.

This is a document that clearly is a lie. It is costing the Australian taxpayers dearly and this sort of thing should not be undertaken by any government. What we saw in this document was the claim that 27 per cent of year 3 students failed to meet acceptable literacy standards in 1996. It goes on to cite a new survey in 1999 which has used a differentâyet, of course, nationally agreedâbenchmark which found that almost 87 per cent of year 3 students met the required standard for reading. So it is quite apparent that this government is not even able to get its line straight on these things. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I see that Senator Kemp is now in the chamber. I am sure he could talk to his brother about the gross waste of taxpayers' money and the peddling of political propaganda to the children in this country. The minister has clearly not been honest and truthful in the way in which he has presented this information. Literacy does require additional support and we are supporting the bill. But we are also saying that the use of this literature is not appropriate and that the way in which this process has been handled needs to be attended to by the Senate, and an amendment at the second reading stage of the bill addresses these issues.  </para><para>The Labor government had the Disadvantaged Schools Program, on which $67 million was expended in 1996, and the English as a Second Language Program, on which $68 million was expended in 1996. These programs were essentially relabelled as literacy programs. Last year we saw the State Grants Act incorporate literacy funding into the new and even larger bucket to contain funding for special education. So what the government has basically done is claim that there is a large sum of money being made available for literacy, but it has essentially rebadged older programs which were aimed at helping students with particular needs. The government has done that for base political motives. We cannot let the debate on literacy go by without having a look at it in a broader political context. </para><para>An increased amount of funding has been provided to non-government school students and a number of schools have been faced with a situation where the amount per capita for students with disabilities has not been included in last year's bill. The real problem here is that the government once again has had to correct its own errors in the way in which these bills have been presented to the parliament. We have seen it with the establishment of state grants funding. We see it with this measure. We see it so often that one really has to ask what level of competence is being displayed here. It seems abundantly clear that the minister is not competent to do his job properly. It is a sad situation when the Senate constantly has to come back and correct the minister's mistakes in the legislative program. It is for that reason that this motion is being moved in the second reading. </para><para>What really troubles me is that this government has lost sight of what education ought to be about. It ought to be about making sure that there is agreement about the key priorities for education. There ought to be a debate within this country, but there also ought to be agreement about the assumptions that underlie our education system. This government has lost sight of those basic roles that the Commonwealth ought to be fulfilling. I think education is the keystone of the structure of Australian society. We have seen that schools have been funded. I think the values reflected, and the policies and the rhetoric around schooling provides the background around which school education takes place. You cannot get away from that basic proposition. </para><para>Young Australians grow into adulthood in a world which is crucially shaped not only by their parents but also by the educational system in which they participate.

In a multicultural society we ought to be able to ensure that everyoneâno matter what their religious background, their social class, or their genderâ gets a fair go. That is simply not happening under this government.

In South Australia the completion rate is 49 per cent for people mainly from working-class backgrounds compared with 73 per cent for boys in higher socioeconomic groups. In Tasmania the comparison is a 58 per cent completion rate for boys from working-class backgrounds and an 88 per cent rate for people in higher socioeconomic groups. </para><para>Frankly, this is unacceptable but, under this government's policies, we are going to find a continuation of this. In fact, we are going to see an acceleration of the unequal and divisive policies. We are going to see a situation where the financial circumstances are such thatâwhile government will claim there is an increase in spending for schools as a wholeâin terms of the spending for the government school system, there is no increase at all. Under figures presented in answers to questions from Senate estimatesâE71, if you want to quote thoseâyou will see there has been a concentration of extra spending to the non-government school system for the 31 per cent or so of those mainly category 1 which have little need for extra help. According to question E75, Commonwealth expenditure for government schools is 0.28 per cent.  </para><para>In 1996, the percentage share of direct Commonwealth funding for schools was 41.5 per cent, which is total expenditure. That is now down to 35.7 per cent of total expenditure going to schools in the government school system. That figure will now reduce, according to the latest figures I have from the department, to 33.4 percent of the Commonwealth government's outlay for schooling. It will have moved from 41.5 per cent in 1996 down to 33.4 per cent by 2005. </para><para>Quite clearly, this is a deliberate policy position of this government. We have seen that this government seeks to reduce the public role in education. It is right across the board, not just in schools. We see it in the TAFE sector and the higher education sector and it has the same result. The effect of the government's inequitable policies are a poorer quality, less opportunity for innovation and very bad news for ordinary citizens in this country. This is a government that favours the wealthy and the privileged. Its education policies demonstrate that comprehensively.

I rise to talk on the <inline ref="R1321">States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2001</inline> and support Senator Carr's amendments to this bill. I think it is important we recognise that literacy is a matter that needs to be dealt with in this country. I do not think it is overstating the fact that, for a lot of people, education has been a passport to the future. For generations of men and women from working-class backgrounds, it has been their opportunity to realise their potential. That is why I am concerned about the rhetoric and the actions of the government in relation to the process of this bill. Let us think back 100 years when those opportunities were not available to all men and women, to our great-grandparents or great-great-grandparents. Those opportunities are now available to all people, essentially because of the process of Labor governments throughout the last century. </para></talk.start><para>Our forebears had the opportunity to fulfil their potential as a result of the introduction of compulsory secondary and primary schooling. Under the Whitlam government, we had an opportunity to go to university free of charge. This progress in education has substantially occurred because of the opportunities that have been made available because of the election of Labor governments. As I said, that has meant that people from working-class or low socioeconomic backgrounds have had the opportunity to fulfil their potential. That has been their passport to the future. I am grateful that I had that opportunity, like many people of my generation. My parents and grandparents did not have the opportunities that I had. Those opportunities occurred because of the reforms in education.</para><para>The aim of this bill, as outlined so articulately by Senator Carr this morning, is to provide additional funding for literacy and numeracy programs for the years 2001-02 and 2002-03, in line with the literacy and numeracy benchmarks for years 3, 5 and 7 approved by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments in April of 2000. I will comment on the government's record. During the 1996 election, the coalition announced that it would address the issue of literacy. However, in 1994 the Paul Keating government commissioned the national school English literacy survey which compiled data on rates of literacy in Australia. The survey found that four per cent of year 3 students were assessed as being below the draft benchmark for reading. Not happy with those results, upon coming into office, Dr Kemp recommissioned the 1994 report and arbitrarily set a much higher benchmark for literacy. The literacy standards in Australia<inline font-style="italic"></inline>report found that 27 per cent of year 3 students failed to meet the standard. Dr Kemp got the result he wanted. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âFancy having high standards!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name></talker><para>âYour brother got the result he wanted. I suppose that is what you wanted. You wanted to demonstrate to people that there is a difficulty in public education in this country. That is what the government wanted to do: they manufactured a crisis so that they could solve it. I am not sure that the measures in this bill will solve the government's so-called crisis. The survey commissioned by the Keating government in 1994 found that only about four per cent of year 3 students were in that predicament. I suppose when you commission a report, you have to expect the results that you want and, as I said, Dr Kemp manufactured the crisis to serve his own political agenda. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Following agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories on the formulation of national standards of testing in April 2000, the 1999 year 3 reading national benchmark results indicated that 87 per cent of year 3 students achieved the new benchmark. Where do we stand? In 1994, it was four per cent. In 1999, it was 87 per cent under the Kemp agenda. The national benchmark results in April 2000 show 13 per cent. So a number of figures have been presented to determine the national benchmark for literacy and numeracy. I think it is very poor form of the government to run out to the community and say that there is this difficulty in public education in this country. I do not think anybody would stand in this parliament and say that we could not improve our game or that we could not do more for our young people to improve their literacy and numeracy, but to manufacture a crisis so that you can get stuck into public education and deprive it in the way that you have in your bills and redistribute funds from needy government and non-government schools into the hands of the category 1 schools is atrocious. </para><para>With this redistribution of wealthânot from the top to the bottom but from the bottom to the topâa number of the elite schools in Sydney and Melbourne, and wherever else they are in this country, will be able to purchase polo fields, put up more sports gymnasiums, put in more pools, sponsor more rugby sides or something like that. I have no idea what they will do but, as has been outlined by Senator Carr, I do not believe that the young men and women at these category 1 schools will be more disadvantaged than their fellow students at other schools.</para><para>This bill merely repatches and repackages existing programs and claims a funding boost for literacy. In 1997 the government diverted funding from the Disadvantaged Schools Program to the English as a Second Language Program, wrapped it all up together and called it the literacy program. Last year literacy and special education were combined and wrapped up into a strategic assistance program. On budget night, the ministerâthat is, Senator Kemp's brotherâclaimed that the government would provide an extra $36.9 million to literacy programs over the next four years. This so-called extra funding is provided for in this bill. However, closer inspection of the budget papers reveals that the additional expenditure for literacy programs over the next four years is zero. There is no funding increase at all in this bill because the existing levels of funding are merely being maintained. Let me repeat: there is no extra funding in this bill for literacy programs over the next four years. </para><para>The government's concern about literacy and numeracy in schools, in public and private and non-government education schemes, is just cant and hypocrisy. Where are they? What are they doing? They are trying to redistribute the wealth that we have invested in education, not from the top to the bottom but from the bottom to the top. If we are successful in winning power shortly, which I believe we will be at the next election, we have put on record what we will do. As I said, we support the bill because it supports literacy programs. When the Keating government was in power and launched the original survey into literacy levels in 1994, the Labor state governments also undertook and supported a significant number of literacy programsâfor instance, in New South Wales, literacy rates are among the highest in the country. </para><para>Labor does, however, oppose the crisis manufacturing that the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, has engaged in over the past years, with his claim that close to one-third of Australian children cannot read or write. Do you really believe that, Mr Acting Deputy President? This minister has been trotting around the country, and has been reported in newspapers, on television and on radio, trying to manufacture a crisis in education and trying to undermine the support and the integrity of education in this country. Do you really believe that one-third of Australian children cannot read or write? That is rubbish. If I could swear, I would swear, because it is not true.</para><para>We established, through our surveys in 1994 and in 2000, that this is not the situation. It is a reflection of this government that they are sticking by this, because it is really manufacturing a crisis. It is undermining the integrity and the strength of the education system. We believe that Dr Kemp and the government should not mislead the Australian public when it comes to disclosing the amount of money they are putting towards literacy programs. They should not claim that they have increased funding when they have merely maintained it. As I said earlier, and I emphasise again, this is not increasing funding for literacy; this is just maintaining the levels for the next four years. There is so much bunkum from this government and from Senator Kemp's brother, Dr Kemp, who is in the House of Representatives, that I am sure some apologist from the government will get up and give some sort of response to our claims.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âLucky we got the good brother!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name></talker><para>âHe has a good brother, does he?

There are undoubtedly areas, in places of low socioeconomic backgrounds or migrant backgrounds, where there are some difficulties. When we get into power, we will call them education priority zones and we will target needy government and non-government schools with additional funding and additional literacy programs. We will not put a bandaid on it. We will not run out and discriminate. We will not run out and try to undermine or take to task the government and non-government areas that are in difficulty. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We will also fix up literacy by attracting more quality teachers to the profession. We will do this by funding 1,000 new teacher scholarships to encourage the best year 12 students to go into teaching. We will also provide funds for reskilling and for professional development for teachers to improve the quality of teaching in schools. We will also set up a learning gateway: a learning Internet site that will allow parents to help their children to learn at home. We will also direct more funds into urgent capital works for schools. We are going to pay for all of this when we are in government. We will redirect the $105 million that the government is giving to the country's 58 wealthiest schoolsâlike King's Schoolâto needy government and non-government schools. King's Schoolâwhere a number of coalition members wentâis going to get, under the government's formula for category 1 schools, an extra $4 million. I cannot imagine why King's School would need another $4 million. I have no idea what the school fees are, but I can only imagine that they are quite high. Maybe Senator McGauran or Senator Kemp could tell usâthey probably went to similar schools in Melbourne so they could tell us how much the school fees are.  </para><para>Can you imagine King's School in Sydney needing $4 million? Are they going to fund extra teachers? I doubt it. They probably have the best because they pay higher wages. Are they going to fund more computers? No, they probably have the best. What are they going to do with the $4 million? I can only imagine that it might pay to fit out the cricket side, it might pay for the jerseys for the rugby side or it might pay for some excursion to Switzerland or somewhere like that. I have no idea what the extra $4 million will do for the King's School. But I can imagine that in places like St Marys or Mount Druitt or Penrith or Campbelltown or Camden that that $4 million will be well spent trying to assist young children at school who may need assistance in literacy and numeracy. That is what we will do with the money. We will redirect that money to the places it is needed. It will not be used to provide rugby jerseys or cricket gear or overseas trips for people who are well-to-do. That is a big difference between us and the coalition. </para><para>I cannot imagine how some of the knockabout men and women I know who are members of parliament on the coalition side could stomach what has occurred in relation to the way they have funded this states grants bill. I cannot imagine how, in their party room, they let this go through. I know that the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, is an old King's boy, and I suppose he stood over his National Party colleagues. I know a number of them, and they are not bad peopleâand that includes you, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert. I cannot understand why you would let this redistribution go ahead. I cannot understand how you could let King's School get $4 million when there are areas that you would know of that are crying out for assistance. All we are doing for students at the King's School is paying for their jerseys or paying for a polo field or paying for some gardener to keep up their many cricket fields.

This additional funding will be provided through the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes program and grants for the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies and Projects Program. As Senator Hutchins has already pointed out, it is not at all clear whether this is additional money or not. Since 1996 the government has had a great record of finding ways to try to demonstrate that additional money is being spent, particularly on government school education, but when you look at the finer print, when you look at the details, it is often illusory, to say the least.</para></talk.start><para>It is also a drop in the bucket compared with the $700 million that was handed out to non-government schools at the end of last year. Thirty-three million dollars is not to be sneezed at but it pales in comparison to $700 million. It is also a drop in the ocean when you talk about per capita funding. I do not have the stats for how many students we now have in schools, but my expectation is that this would amount to not much more than $10 per capita. Even if it were $20 or $30, it is not a lot when you talk about addressing the very serious problems, for some students, of literacy.</para><para>The government's amendments provide for an additional $190,000 for targeted assistance for educationally disadvantaged students in 2001 and an additional $2.7 million for non-government school students with disabilities over the program years 2001-04. Those amendments were originally moved in the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, which the Democrats voted against in July this year partly due to the increase in establishment grants for non-government schools. Again, it is a very small amount of money: $190,000 for targeted assistance for educationally disadvantaged students. I remind the government that since they broadbanded and somehow made disappear the money that used to be out there for disadvantaged schoolsâmoney which amounted to a great deal more than $190,000âa lot of schools are not now able to do the sort of work that they were doing with students prior to that time. I visit schools on a regular basis and I know that many schools were able to use that disadvantaged schools funding in a very effective way. The government should be condemned for seeing that it disappeared. </para><para>The Democrats will support this bill even though we have serious problems with the government's approach to the literacy issue and, in particular, with the way in which benchmarking is distorting learning in our schools. I have been calling for more funding for literacy programs ever since I have been in parliament. In my first speech, I identified the problems of some students in literacy. As I said, we have also been drawing attention to the link between socioeconomic disadvantage and learning problems and difficulties; it is not absolute but it is certainly there in statistically significant evidence.</para><para>Dr Kemp wants us to believe that under his government literacy and numeracy standards have improved significantly. As Senator Hutchins mentioned, we all remember the manufactured crisis where Dr Kemp said that a third of year 9 students could not read. We know that he was selectively using a longitudinal study which was not intended to look at literacy for year 9 students but rather was a much more complex test. He entirely misled the Australian public by saying that the results of that equated to a third of year 9s not being able to read. In fact, it was a comprehension study, a longitudinal one, and the students in that had very impressive results. The minister says of this legislation:</para><quote><para>... there is not another government in the last two decades in Australia that can claim to have made any progress whatsoever against literacy and numeracy, whereas we can claim to have halved it in the early years and to have continued to make further progress. </para></quote><para>What the minister has sought to do over recent times is to compare the results of the 1999 year 3 national benchmark with the 1996 National School English Survey. Even the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest </inline>were not fooled by thisâI should not say `even'; they are never fooled by anything. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest </inline>said:</para><quote><para>These results have been heralded as a significant improvement on the results of the National School English Survey conducted in 1996. However the degree of improvement since that survey is debatable, given that two reports from the same survey produced significantly different results, ranging from four per cent of Year 3 students achieving below an estimated range of achievement for reading to twenty-seven per cent not achieving against the required standard.</para></quote><para>It is obvious that the problem is that Dr Kemp is comparing apples with pears. The equating mechanism used to compare literacy and numeracy benchmarks for the 1999 report was not in place for the National School English Survey in 1996. Dr Kemp is, to say the least, creative in the way he chooses to use numbers. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 16 August this year said:</para><quote><para>The much-touted national benchmarks for indicating competence in literacy are simply an exercise in number crunching. The benchmarks introduced by Kemp do not show the complexity of literacies children are involved with each day.</para></quote><para>We have all seen the calls, whether from the Victorian state government last week or from Dr Kemp or from other governments around the country, for simplification of the curriculum and a return to basicsâ literacy and numeracy.  Those of us in this place who have been teachers, and I count myself as one, know that students learn in different ways and that you cannot simply get rid of subjects that might have been used to improve literacy, while setting before a group of students the same task that they might have seen previously and not cottoned onto. I would argue that students learn in very different ways. A student might learn literacy through a civics class or through an arts class. It is not always the case that the only way children learn is through an English or mathematics class, and it is an insult to teachers to suggest that this is the case, that students are not learning to communicate either verbally or in written form except through English classes.</para><para>There was a very good letter in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> about a week ago from an assistant principal in Victoria, pointing out that literacy is not something new. Just because governments of one persuasion or anotherâ and they are both guilty of thisâsay we need to improve literacy, that does not mean it is a new idea. This is central to schools' and teachers' objectives and has been for many years. Sometimes ministers for education like to suggest that they are the only ones who have ever thought of this, but there are teachers out there in schools for whom this is a very high priority, and they work very hard to achieve it. There are lots of innovative ways of tackling numeracy and literacy issues, but there are no easy answers. It is not just a question of benchmarking and testing. Some students may cotton on very easily, and some are reading even before they get to school, but for some it will mean very intensive work. We are not talking about a homogenous group of students for whom Dr Kemp's benchmarking and testing will work.</para><para>In fact, the government's focus on benchmarking is having a profound effect on teaching in Australian schools. Many of the schools I have visited have told me that a substantial amount of time is now spent preparing students for these tests and ensuring that performance targets are met. This means that, instead of learning new skills and ideas, our students are learning how to pass these tests. Last time we debated this question, there was a threat that schools would be financially penalised if they failed to achieve performance targets. We all said at the time that this was an absurd notion: if a school had poor numeracy and literacy results, it made no sense to remove funding from that school. What it needed was more funding rather than less. </para><para>Even so, there is considerable pressure on schools and teachers to meet those standards, even though students living in different, poorer socioeconomic areas, with parents who are non-English speakers, for example, are going to have a great deal more difficulty in meeting the standards set by students from wealthier, English speaking homes. If you do not have disadvantaged schools funding, then you do not have that acknowledgment that there are difficulties in teaching some students in some areas. </para><para>It is my concern that, in efforts to ensure that standards are met, we are overlooking individuals and their specific circumstances and needs. We are not, for instance, paying enough attention to students with specific learning difficulties and learning disabilities. I have said many times in this place that it is estimated that one in every 10 Australian students has a learning disability, and yet the specific needs of these students across the board are largely overlooked. Learning disabilities were defined by the National Institute of Health in 1993 as disorders:</para><quote><para>... that affect people's ability to either interpret what they see and hear or to link information from different parts of the brain. These limitations can show up in many ways: as specific difficulties with spoken and written language, coordination, self-control or attention. Such difficulties extend to school work and can impede learning to read, write or do maths.</para></quote><para>I have said many times that, unless we are able to identify these children and then direct substantial resources towards assisting them, we are unlikely to significantly improve literacy levels in this country. It does not matter how many times you benchmark and test or how many times you tweak that testing in order to get the right result, if you are not identifying those students and helping them specifically with their disability or their difficulty, you are not going to improve literacy levels meaningfully in this country.</para><para>This is not just a funding issue. We do need to have teachers who are trained in identifying learning disabilities and we do need to use best practice in dealing with those students. However, in many of the schools I have been into, they have decided that it is necessary to have class sizes of two, three, nine or 10 students in certain categories of learning disability. Therefore, we need the flexibility to have very small class sizes, so that there can be a one-to-one relationship.</para><para>The very narrow definition of `disability' adopted for special Commonwealth and state funding means that assistance is virtually non-existent in many states. It is up to the schools themselves to scratch the funding together from wherever they can get it. Many parents are obliged to go outside the school system to find that funding for identification. Some of them do not know why it is that their child is not learning at the same rate as their peers and, very often, they are obliged to pay quite large sums of money to have that assessment done. It can cost $250, $300 and even $500, I have heard. In most states, there is not a way for this identification to take place. In some states there is a way, and there is good work being done, but, by and large, it is falling back on to parents to, firstly, identify the problem and then work their way through the system to make sure that their student is properly helped.</para><para>The Democrats support the extension of funding to non-government schools for students with disabilities. Bringing the per capita grants for non-government schools in line with government funding is a reform that should have been introduced long ago. Whilst many private schoolsâparticularly Catholic systemic schoolsâdo take students with disabilities and students that are difficult to teach, other schools do not. It is high time that we removed any argument that schools might be able to mount for not taking students with disabilities.</para><para>The Democrats will be supporting the second reading amendment put forward by Senator Carr, although item (c) is not the most critical issue to us with regard to funding for non-government schools. We think the whole SES structure was ill advised. I urge the ALP, when and if they come to government, to not just look at category 1 schools and pull back that $145 million. This is an issue of fairness, both within the non-government sector and between non-government and government sectors. Clearly, the SES funding model is wrong and we should review it and find a fairer, more equitable system for funding both government and non-government schools. We agree with a thrust of it and we do condemn the government, like the ALP, but I put on the record that item (c) is a clumsy way of approaching what is a very poor attempt at a better funding model for non-government schools.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>26481</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1321">States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2001</inline> provides for some $36.9 million for literacy and numeracy funding.

The reason this minister has sought to score political points from literacy is that he has created in his own mind a complete and utter fiction. After recognising the problems associated with poor literacy and numeracy skills, the Keating government set about rectifying the problem; they set about doing something about it. The first obstacle was a lack of information about literacy levels. As well, there was a problem in that any information that existed within the state education system was not comparable. In 1994, the Keating government commissioned a study into national literacy levels. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government senators interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>009D2</name.id><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name></talker><para>âWhilst my colleagues on the other side are calling out that we have no policy, they have adopted exactly what we had in 1994, but they put a different name to it. So it is no good saying that there is no policy on this side; they use ours anyway. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Keating commissioned study was designed to collect national comparable data on literacy. The Howard government received the report in 1997. The report showed below average reading skills were held by only four per cent of year 3 students and, similarly, only six per cent had below average writing skills. Dr Kemp was immediately dissatisfied with this and sent the report to the statistical equivalent of a re-education camp and demanded reprocessing of the data using arbitrary benchmarks set by him: `Here's the answer I want, boys. Now, you create a document that tells me why I've come up with it, but don't come up with what the truth is.'</para><para>Not surprisingly, figures for below average reading blew out to 27 per cent. Dr Kemp engineered a false crisis to score political points at the expense of students in the poorer schools of our country. This is a fact confirmed when they kept the literacy and numeracy program that was already in place, albeit with a new name. Labor's policy is what they kept. Dr Kemp has done nothing whatsoever to contribute to the solutions this country needs to improve its literacy and numeracy skills. Instead, he has simply rebadged Labor initiatives and cynically manipulated statistics to score some cheap political points. Phil Gude, a Liberal from Victoria, said Dr Kemp:</para><quote><para>... ought to do the right thing ... own up to the fact that he has manipulated the figures in a most dishonest and disgraceful fashion.</para></quote><para>The importance of education in our economy will only ever increase. That is why it is so essential that we get it right. The critical importance of education in our future has yet to be grasped by this government. The strategic thinking of this government is poor and backward. It is not just the federal Labor Party expressing contempt when we talk about the lack of initiatives by this government but also our contempt for the manipulation of these literacy figures of Dr Kemp's. As well as the Labor Party, a former Victorian Minister for Education and Dr Kemp's own Liberal colleagues from Victoria are condemning him. It is a sad day for Australian education when they are dumped with a minister as inadequate as he is.</para><para>During the 19th century the use of coal and the emergence of railways drove a massive acceleration in economic growth. The use of coal provided a revolution in industrial techniques and processes. Railways provided a new and much quicker communications system. These two developments, the use of coal and railways, opened up the world to an industrial revolution. Nearly two centuries later, it is the ALP that recognised that a new revolution was and is under way. Information and research and development are the coal of this revolution and our schools, universities and research units are our mines. Telecommunications systems are our new railways, providing such incredible developments in communications that they are opening up our world to an information revolution. Education, training and research and development are assuming a strategic importance close to that held by resources and land in the past. As education becomes more important in this economy, it becomes increasingly important that everyone has the basic numeracy and literacy skills to take part in developing the economy.</para><para>The real point is that the states have been carrying out these types of tests for some long time. If you look at the results of these tests that have been carried out by the states over many years, there has not been much of a change. But there has been a modest improvement in the last few years in the literacy performance of students in Australian schools. The reason for the modest improvement in some areas in some states is not that the minister for education manipulated the figures from a survey conducted in 1996; there is no manipulation there. It is that some governments have actually been putting extra resources into addressing the literacy problems. They have been doing the hard work, unlike Minister Kemp. In some of the states they have developed reading recovery programs. They are not rebadging old models; they have been forward thinking and they are doing something about it.</para><para>There are fewer parts of the economy for people to fall back on if they fall behind in their education skills. Those of us with children in schools today know the effects of that: if one child falls behind because the teacher is spending more time with those who are less academically skilled, the whole class falls behind. The money is not being directed to properly address the crises we have in our schools, but the government relies on a Labor policy. If we do not get this right people will be doomed to be left behind from as early as primary school, and it is a long time in Australia since that has been the case. Even my own state of South Australia, which is pathetically behind the other states in education, has realised that it is too late to identify students with literacy problems by the time they enter high school. It has realised that you cannot let it go too long.</para><para>We have to make sure that we are identifying students with literacy problems as early as possible. One of the great privileges we as members of parliament have is in getting to visit schools and to speak to some of the teachers who are there every day changing students lives and opening up opportunities for them for the future. One of the sad things we get to do is to hear the teachers, the principals and the parents continually telling us that students have problems with literacy and numeracy because the funds and the programs are not there to properly address what has been occurring. And this government has its ears closed to the tragedy that is currently facing us.</para><para>It is so disappointing that Dr Kemp insists on playing ridiculous games, manipulating figures, scoring cheap political points and simply rebadging old programs. It is disappointing because the future is in education. Labor has addressed that in where it is going. This government is only tagging along, hoping to pick up something from it. Labor knows where it needs to go. Mostly, it even knows how to get there. It is just a matter of this government recognising the urgent need to do something about it, and this government has not recognised it. This government is lazy and will not do anything about it because it does not want to do anything about it. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âIt is going the way of roll-back; it is dreadful!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>009D2</name.id><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name></talker><para>âI may not have had Senator Kemp's luxury education, I may not have gone to one of those privileged schools, but it is very clear from listening to him in the chamber today that my education was more thorough and taught me more than that of his.

The government's claim is that over the next four years it will be spending almost $1.4 billion of Commonwealth funds to address literacy. The problem is that the minimal extra funding is simply rebadging the old model and the disadvantaged schools will be no better off. It is even wrapping up into the English as a Second Language Program some of the special education program money and claiming that it is going to do something about literacy. This government has done nothing and intends to do nothing for those who are disadvantaged in their learning skills.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is why the Labor Party is proposing to establish education priority zones and put extra Commonwealth funding into schools that need the most helpânot the category 1 schools but the schools out there that need the most help. It is through programs like education priority zones that Labor will direct real extra dollars into the schools that need extra help, whether they are needy government schools or non-government schools, because that is the way to make a difference. You do not make a difference performing in the way this minister for education is: by simply rebadging Labor's old policies.</para><para>Let me make it very clear that the federal Labor Party support basic skills testing. No matter how many times the current federal minister for education makes the claim that we do not, we do support itâ even though we know that it is not a perfect measure for student performance. Every day teachers are making assessments about the progress of their students. Those of us with young children know that that is happening, because we talk to the teachers. Those in this chamber should know, too, as they go around the schools and are told this by the teaching staff and the parents. The skills test is really a very crude measure of the performance of students, but it does provide some extra information that can be useful to the teachers in better serving the needs of their students.</para><para>The difference between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party is not whether or not we support basic skills testing but whether, unlike the government, the Labor Party support providing extra funding to do something about literacy and numeracy. The government needs to stop reannouncing measures to do something about the past. It has to look to the future. It has to announce something that is decent. It has to announce something that is going to assist students and our community into the future. The Labor Party will do that; the Liberal Party is incapable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>26484</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is very appropriate that we are here today debating the <inline ref="R1321">States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2001</inline>, because it enables the Senate to get onto the real issues that are concerning people out there in the electorate. Of course, one of those issues is education. This debate provides an opportunity to demonstrate that when it comes to education, and particularly to education funding, this current government has a disgraceful record and, of course, it is going to find that out when the election is called in the next couple of months. I want to congratulate Senator Carr on his very appropriate second reading amendment. Whilst this government has endeavoured in this legislation to distort the arguments about literacy and about funding for literacy and numeracy education, the second reading amendment draws attention to the real issues that face the country in respect of education. Senator Carr's amendment:</para></talk.start><quote><para>		... condemns the Government for:</para><para>	(a)	misusing the issue of literacy for political advantage;</para><para>	(b)	manipulating statistics about literacy achievement; and</para><para>	(c)	providing $145 million to wealthy category one schools which could have been better used improving literacy for students in government and needy non-government schoolsâ.</para></quote><para>That is where the real focus of this debate needs to be: on those issues that have been raised in the opposition's second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr. As other speakers from the opposition and Senator Allison from the Democrats have said, when it comes to education generally, this government has a disgraceful record. Whilst it claims that it has increased funding, it has in fact reduced funding, particularly to the public schools sector.</para><para>Whilst the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs stands up, as he did yesterday, and claims that the government has provided record funding for tertiary education and for universities, the real facts are completely the opposite, as the vice-chancellors have pointed out. Those that manage the universities and know the real situation say that there is a crisis of funding in the tertiary education sectorâ all due to this government's massive cuts since it came into office in 1996. The little things that the government has done to redress some of the problems it created have come about because of pressure from the education sector and pressure from the opposition for it to roll back its own policies. But of course there is still a major problem. There is a lot to be done, and the only way it is going to be achieved, clearly, is if there is a change of government. </para><para>The government claims that this bill is intended to improve schooling outcomes particularly in regard to literacy and numeracy. The government and the minister have tried to trumpet up their proposals by claiming that there will be $36.9 million provided over the next two financial years for numeracy and literacy funding. But, as we know, that is not new money. That is merely a continuation of the funding programs that were previously in place. The government and the minister have been caught out, as they have been caught out time and time again. Their backbenchers know they have been caught out and have complained about it.</para><para>As the President of the Liberal Party, Shane Stone, said, the public and indeed members of the government believe that this government is sneaky, mean and tricky. I want to concentrate particularly on those characteristics of meanness and trickiness because that is what this minister has engaged in. As previous speakers have pointed out, Minister Kemp created a bogus issue, claiming that up to one-third of students in year 3 in this country could not effectively read or write. He used a survey and distorted the figures deliberately to create a crisis which he then said he would set out to resolve. Talk about scare tactics! That has got to go down as one of the monumental scare tactics ever perpetrated on the Australian public by any minister of a government.</para><para>I remember the headlines in the papers when he made those assertions, and I can recall the concern that parents had about whether or not it was true. Of course, it was not true at all. It was a gross misrepresentation of the real position. I certainly would not deny that there have been and continue to be concerns about literacy and numeracy standards. If you believe in education and if you believe in improving education, you always have to strive to do better, and you can always do better. At the same time, it is disgraceful to suggest, as Minister Kemp did, that there was a crisis of literacy to that extent. That was an attack upon the dedication and the professionalism of the teachers in our state and non-government schools throughout this country. We all here are witness to the fact that our teachers throughout this country deliver first-rate world standard quality education. They do it despite the funding constraints that are put upon them by government. They have had to continue to do that in the face of massive education cuts that this government introduced in 1996 and subsequently.</para><para>Minister Kemp is exposed as being tricky and sneaky, as Shane Stone, the federal President of the Liberal Party, acknowledged in his famous memo. It is clear that, on the standard of numeracy, Minister Kemp failed and he failed badly. It is probably an appropriate suggestion that he is the one who needs to return to school and learn how to add up, read the figures correctly, interpret them and reflect them in his public statements, because he clearly distorted those figures for political purposes.</para><para>In the area of literacyâan area that, as many senators and members know, I am particularly interested in, as someone who in an earlier life studied literature and took a great interest in it; and I wish I had time to read more than I do todayâI am reminded of one of the novels that I studied at school and at university: <inline font-style="italic">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</inline>. Huck Finn was a young, largely uneducated boy, but he saw through the tricksters and the fraudsters that he came across in his journeys. I invite Minister Kemp to get a copy of that great novel out of the Parliamentary Library and to sit down and read it. If he has not got time to read the entire book, he could at least read the chapters where Huck came across the bogus king and the bogus duke and their outrageous, outlandish claims. As I said, Huck saw through them. He saw that they were tricksters and fraudsters, and I think that is a pretty good description of the sorts of activities that this minister has tried to perpetrate with respect to claiming a crisis in literacy and numeracy in this country.</para><para>What do we also have from this government? The things that they will not address and tackle are the massive problems they have created through, for instance, slashing TAFE funding by $240 million since they came to office, forcing higher repayments for students on HECS loans, cutting $60 million from funding to public schools as a result of the enrolment benchmark adjustment, a reduction of $170 million for rural and regional universities during their government, massive cuts to student assistance schemes, amounting to up to $500 million; and neglect for research and investment, an approach that was even condemned by the government's own Chief Scientist. So this government's record on education generally is disgraceful. Of course, we have seen where their priorities lie: with devoting greater resources to the elite schoolsâthe category 1 schoolsâthan to the public school sector.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âSenator Calvert interjects and says, `This is the politics of division.' Raising this, Senator Calvert, is not the politics of division. The politics of division has been deliberately created by Minister Kemp and this government, because they have deliberately and consciously allocated a greater and increasing proportion of budget funds to the wealthier schools at the expense of the poorer schools. That has been a major change in the approach adopted for education funding in this country since the sixties and seventies. I have to recognise that, under previous Liberal governments, it was never that bad. We had a policy position in this country where schools funding was determined on the grounds of equity, fairness and need. This government has removed the principle of need and promoted the principle of greed. If you do not understand that, Senator Calvert, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, you are going to learn that lesson in a couple of months time.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will finish by returning to the bill itself. It is quite clear that the real issues are addressed in Senator Carr's second reading amendment. I urge the Senate to carry that amendment, because it draws attention to the real problems in education, not the bogus ones that have been created by the tricksters and the fraudsters, as represented by this government. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>26486</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAt the outset I will start where Senator Forshaw left off in relation to Catholic schools and make it very clear to the Senate that this government has delivered nearly $9 billion for Catholic schools in forecast funding for the next four years. This includes increased funding from 1998 of approximately $1.2 billion. In fact, what the Senate should remember is that Labor denied this funding until the last minute through its delay of the states grants bill last year. I will come to that later on in the furphy that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr poses in relation to funding of $145 million being taken from category 1 schools.</para></talk.start><para>Let us just dwell on the Catholic schools for a moment. It is Labor that is in fact attacking the Catholic schools in this country. You have only to look at the destructive decision by the opposition to vote down the innovation bill. That decision has already denied just over $26,000 to the Jubilee Catholic Primary School in Gaven in Queensland. In fact, it is now committed to denying funds to Lumen Christi Catholic College at Pambula Beach, St Angela's Primary School in Kellyville and St Andrews Catholic College in Cairns. So there are three Catholic schools which are now in the course of being denied funding because of the opposition's tactics, and you have one Catholic primary school in Queensland which has already been denied over $26,000 due to those tactics. Labor now has to explain those actions and also explain to the 1.3 million parents of students at Catholic parish schools why it will not pay new Catholic schools the funds to which they are entitled under a law that Labor supported as recently as last year. So last year you had Labor supporting it; this year you do not. This is money for new Catholic schools which Labor is saying no to.</para><para>You have members of the opposition like Senator Hutchins saying that the government is not supporting Catholic schools. That is totally hypocritical when you look at what Labor has done. As the Good Book says, `Ye shall know them by their fruits'âby their actions, you shall know what they really mean. What you have seen is an opposition which has denied funding to a Catholic school and which is intent on denying further funding to new Catholic schools. That is something those opposite cannot escape from. Catholic schools are smartâthey realise where the game is played and they realise what the opposition has done in denying it funding and in the actions that it took in voting down the innovation bill which would have set in train right now funds going to Catholic schools. But the opposition voted it down. That is what it thinks of Catholic parish schools: taking an action in the Senateâin this very chamberâto deny money to Catholic parish schools. It is fair to say that those Catholic parish schools are not wealthy schools. In fact, the parents who send their children there make great sacrifices to send their children to a Catholic school and largely come from an income bracket which is not at the top end of the scale. Yet you have a Labor opposition, which purports to hold itself out as being a party for the workers and the average man and woman in Australia, denying funds to Catholic parish schools.</para><para>Let us have a look at this second reading amendment which has been moved by Senator Carr. It tries to resurrect the old furphy that was raised some years ago in relation to literacy and numeracy. The first two parts of the amendment try to say that the government beat up a problem in relation to literacy and numeracy for political advantage. Of course, the parents of Australia know better. They know that there was a problem with literacy and numeracy in this country. You just have to look back to 1995 at the analysis from the longitudinal survey of Australian youth by the Australian Council for Educational Research which revealed that 30 per cent of 14-year-old students in year 9 did not have adequate basic literacy skills. That was not Dr Kemp, it was not this government and it was not the Liberal Party; it was the Australian Council for Educational Researchâa thoroughly respectable bodyâwhich conducted a survey that revealed that 30 per cent of 14-year-old students in year 9 in Australia did not have adequate basic literacy skills. </para><para>The reaction across Australia and in my visits to many schools shows that parents agreed fully with that and thought that much had to be done in relation to literacy and numeracy, and they have supported wholeheartedly the measures taken by this government. In fact, you have to remember that these figuresâwhich the amendment says are a furphy in that we have misused these for political advantage and we have manipulated the statisticsâare entirely consistent with the analysis against draft benchmarks of data from the 1996 national school English literacy survey which showed similar numbers of year 3 and year 5 students who had not reached a minimum acceptable level of reading achievement. So we have another respectable analysis of literacy levels endorsing what the Australian Council for Educational Research revealed in its 1995 report.</para><para>You have to look here at the motive behind the amendment. Senator Carr is trying to belittle the good work done by this government and Dr Kemp in relation to literacy and numeracy. We have achieved national benchmarks. We have also achieved the ability, for the first time ever, of parents to know how their children are measuring up against these national benchmarks. As we now have this national data at the state level on literacy and numeracy achievement against standards, parents have the right to know about this information. But, of course, it is an unfortunate state of affairs that the majority of state Labor governments have not seen their way clear to allowing Australian parents to know how their children are measuring up against these national benchmarks. In fact, the only two governments that have allowed parents this crucial information are the ACT and Western Australia. It has to be remembered that, if it were not for the efforts of the Commonwealth government and Dr Kemp, parents in Australia would never have had this opportunity. You have to ask why these state governments are blocking this information from parents. </para><para>In a recent evaluation of the Western Australian literacy and numeracy assessment, it was confirmed that parents appreciated the addition of information about their child's performance against national benchmarks to the information they already received from the state's literacy and numeracy testing program. Parents saw the information from the program as a mechanism to help raise literacy and numeracy standards in schools. This comes from a Labor state government in Western Australia which has allowed this information to go to parents. This has revealed that parents want to know this information, yet it is being denied to other parents across Australia. But, of course, you have to remember that this information would never, ever have been available to parents in the first place had it not been for the efforts of this government in addressing the outrageous situation which existed in relation to literacy and numeracy in this country. Yet you still have Senator Carr trying to say that this has been a beat up, a furphy and something that the government has used for political ends. If improving the literacy and numeracy skills of Australian youngsters is a political end, then it is one that this government wholly applauds. We will continue to pursue the improvement of literacy and numeracy standards in this country across the board. It is essential that young Australians be given the skillsâthese essential communication skillsâin order for them to carve out a better life for themselves and to make a contribution to the Australian community.</para><para>As a result of this innovative action by this government, we have seen some results. There has been a major improvement in literacy outcomes over the period since the national school English literacy survey conducted its analysis in 1996. National data released by the ministerial council of education ministers in 1999 revealed:</para><quote><para>Achievement against the literacy and numeracy benchmarks shows that the percentage of year 3 students not achieving a minimum acceptable standard had fallen to some 30 per cent. For those in year 5 in 1999, around 14 per cent were also not achieving the minimum literacy standard for students in that year of schooling.</para></quote><para>So what you are seeing is an improvement, because we are addressing the problem. If we had let that problem alone, if we had swept it under the carpet like the previous Labor government had done, you would have lost a generation of Australians in relation to literacy and numeracy. You would have let them go and it would have been very difficult to have recovered that lost ground. In the last part of his second reading amendment, Senator Carr states that the Senate condemns the government for:</para><quote><para>(c) providing $145 million to wealthy category one schools which could have been better used improving literacy for students... </para></quote><para>I have just been outlining what this government has done for literacy and numeracy in this country. Senator Carr is calling on us to do more yet, at the same time, he is saying that we have been beating up the figures in relation to the need for extra funding for literacy and numeracy in this country. Senator Carr has to make his mind up. Do we have a problem or don't we? Did we do the right thing or didn't we in addressing this problem? He cannot have a two-way bet now; in fact, he is having a three-way bet. In relation to the $145 million allocated to category 1 schools, last year the Labor opposition tried to amend the states grants bill so that that money would go to students with disabilities. After that, the Leader of the Opposition stated that they should spend this money on capital works for government schools. Now we have Senator Carr saying that the money should be spent on literacy. You can only expend $145 million once. You cannot spend it three times. </para><para>Last year the Labor opposition said that it should have gone towards funding for disabled students, then the Leader of the Opposition said that it should have gone towards capital works for government schools, and today Senator Carr said that it should go towards improving literacy for students in government and needy non-government schools. Where is it going to go? How many times can you spend $145 million? Do they know what they want to spend it on? In the space of nine months, on three different occasions, they have said that they want to spend it on three different things. They have to make up their mind. Where do they want this money to go? You have only got one shot on it. Senator Carr, you have got to make your mind up. You have got to get your education policy clear. You have got to let the people of Australia know where you spend the money. Is it going to go towards disability funding, or is it going to go towards capital works, or it is going to go towards literacy? On the issue of literacy, you say that we beat it up out of all proportion and try to manipulate it for our own ends. You say that we do that and then you say, `But we still need to spend money on literacy.' The logic there escapes me and I am sure it escapes all those who are listening. </para><para>This government remains committed to having a strong government and non-government school sector. The increased funding that we have put into education demonstrates just that. By our actions, you know our commitmentâbecause of the money that we have put into government and non-government schools. For the opposition to say that we have not supported Catholic schools is outrageous when the opposition, by their own nefarious tactics, have cut and stopped funding for Catholic parish schools. We believe that funding should be applied across the board in relation to literacy and numeracy, and we have done just that. Back in 1995-96 we recognised the problem and we acted on it. That is why you have seen national benchmarks. That is why you have seen an improvement in relation to literacy levels. And that is why, for the first time ever, Australian parents are able to gain accessâshould Labor state governments allow them toâto information on how their children are performing against national benchmarks. That is a right every Australian parent should have, and we thoroughly believe that. It is over to the states and the territory governments who have not done this to give a good reason as to why they have not done it. I am sure that the parents in those states and territories who have not been allowed that information would have a lot to say as to why they would want to know how their children are fairing.

But, based on the fact that this was information about education which was vital to communicate to people in the community, I will answer the question. Senator Carr's question was on how many pamphlets went out. I will have to take that question on notice.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>26489</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very disappointed. I was hoping to finish the committee stage of this bill by 12.45 p.m. I trust that the officials will be able to find the answer to that question, but they are indicating that they cannot do it today. That is a tragedy. Perhaps they will have time over the weekend to find it, if it cannot be done today. I am more than happy to accommodate the department, because I know how hard they work. I am sure the weekend is a reasonable length of time for them to find an answer to a very simple question: was this political propaganda sent out to 2Â½ million Australian children and, through them, to their families, and did it cost $275,000? How often has a government sought to send out these sorts of pamphletsâyou call them information; I call them political propagandaâ in this way? How often has the Commonwealth of Australia sent, through the children of this country, material that is highly contentious and quite clearly political in its nature? How often has the Commonwealth of this country sought to use the children of Australia as part of a political campaign?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>26490</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think that answer was given in the Senate estimates.

My young Seamus, at six years of age, is entitled to a broad political education, but I think it is unreasonable that you use him and all the other hundreds of thousands of six-year-olds to foist this sort of nonsense onto the schools of this country.

The government introduced a billâthe innovations billâ on which the Senate passed a motion that it should be split because it sought to bring in an omnibus bill linking highly controversial measures with others that were not so controversial. It was inappropriate for that to occur. With that in mind, the Senate obviously thought it necessary that there be separate bills. The government, by the way, has agreed to that, by reintroducing the various measures as separate bills. I think the minister ought to at least acknowledge that the government was completely wrong on that, as it is completely wrong in the distribution of propaganda such as this and in using the children of Australia to advance it.

As Mr Ferguson, the shadow minister, told the other place, the opposition supports this bill. The changes to the various pieces of legislation contained in this bill are largely facilitative and technical in nature. Firstly, in relation to amendments to the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Act 1989, the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims allows a shipowner or salvor to set limits for the amount of damages they can be required to pay for damage caused by their ship, shipowner, salvor or their employee or agent. The limits are set out in the convention. These limits were amended by the protocol of 1976 to increase liability limits and to provide a simpler method for future increases of liability limits. Schedule 1 of the bill will amend the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Act to amend the 1976 liability protocol. </para></talk.start><para>The Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981, which is known as the intervention act, gives the Australian Maritime Safety Authority important powers to take measures to protect the sea from pollution by oil and other substances discharged from ships. Section 9 of the intervention act relates to the taking of measures under the 1973 protocol. An annex to this protocol lists the polluting substances, other than oil, that pollution prevention measures can be taken in relation to. Schedule 2 of the <inline ref="R1274">International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline> amends the intervention act to implement the list of these substances approved by the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organisation in July 1996.</para><para>Schedule 3 of the <inline ref="R1274">International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline> amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, which is known as the pollution prevention act. This implements MARPOL 73/78, which is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Shipsâas amended by the 78 protocol. The amendments include a range of changes: the removal of the requirement to include the text of conventions in schedules to the act; the implementation of amendments to MARPOL 73/78 on categorisation of liquids, pollution by packaged substances and disposal of garbage; the introduction of changes to incident reporting arrangements; the provision for Australian Federal Police officers to be inspectors under the act, which will avoid the need for separate paperwork and approval at the time of incidents; and provision of the power to AMSA officers to require the discharge of waste from a ship to a reception facility. </para><para>The bill also makes a range of amendments in relation to penalties and offences under the pollution prevention act. It is now providing that any person, rather than just the owner and the master, who is responsible for unlawful discharge is guilty of an offence. This requires the owner of a ship to report an oil pollution where a master has not done soâensuring that the owner or master of the ship is guilty of an offence if the pollution damage resulted from their negligenceâand provides that the same penalty applies to the discharge of harmful substances in all parts of the act.</para><para>Schedule 4 of the <inline ref="R1274">International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline> amends the Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act 1963, known as the cables and pipelines act, to reflect the terminology of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, rather than that in the superseded 1958 convention. The amendments provide that the act applies to the `exclusive economic zone and the high seas', as defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, rather than the `high seas', as defined in the latter. In some cases, the protocols being facilitated by this bill have not taken effect. They are waiting for sufficient international signatories and the commencement dates in the bill, as I understand it, provide for this.</para><para>As I advised at the start of my speech, the opposition does not view the <inline ref="R1274">International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline> as contentious. In fact, we agree that the changes are necessary to implement international conventions that are important to maritime and shipping safety regulation. The opposition is totally committed to the safety and efficiency of the shipping industry, and we believe that Australia has a key role to play on the international scene to ensure that world shipping is safeâin the interests of the environment and national interests of all nation states. Australia has an intrinsic vested interest in this objective because of our geographic isolation and the fact that we are an island totally reliant on shipping and aviation services to access other markets.</para><para>Another important part of our international obligations in relation to both maritime and aviation matters relates to search and rescue. These obligations are spelt out in the National Search and Rescue Manual. The manual was derived from the relevant international and domestic agreements. These international organisations include the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is known as ICAO, and the International Maritime Organisation. The International Maritime Organisation focuses on shipping matters, including the administration of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Seaâknown as SOLAS. The IMO is also the organisation that coordinates and issues international procedures for search and rescue at sea. Australian Search and Rescue, which is known as AusSAR, has a critical role to play, both in international search and rescue and in domestic search and rescue. </para><para>Senators would have noted that the domestic role of AusSAR has received a considerable amount of attention in this chamber in recent times. That interest has focused on the search for the fishing boat, the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret J</inline>, and the role of AusSAR in that search. The international obligations placed on AusSAR by the convention to which we are a signatory are very importantâbut the domestic search and rescue role of this organisation is no less important. On Tuesday, I asked for an explanation for the failure of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, to answer certain questions that I placed on notice. Those questions went to both the domestic and international role of AusSAR. Those answers have now been provided, and I thank Senator Ian Macdonald for his assistance yet again.</para><para>The question on notice 3784 related to the missing yacht, appropriately named, <inline font-style="italic">Aimlis</inline>. I have been advised that a distress signal from this yacht was first detected at 1.28 a.m. on Tuesday, 26 July. That signal was detected by Taupo Maritime Radio, New Zealand, but AusSAR initiated a response to the distress situation. Question 3715 related to a missing cruiser known as <inline font-style="italic">Just Cruisin</inline>. I was told, in that answer, that the cruiser last made contact at 1.53 p.m. on Friday, 6 July. That contact was with the volunteer coastguard at Mooloolaba. The cruiser advised that it was en route to Tangalooma, on Moreton Island. It was not until 10.31 p.m. on Tuesday, 10 July that the Sydney water police advised AusSAR that a vessel was overdue on the North Coast of New South Wales. </para><para>The Queensland police then requested, by facsimile, that AusSAR assume coordination of the search, and AusSAR agreed to take control of it. The transfer of coordination became effective at 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, 11 July. The basis for accepting the transfer was that the search area spanned part of the Queensland and New South Wales coastlines and the coordination of the three authorities would be best handled by AusSAR. The responsibility for the search was then transferred back to the Queensland authority, taking effect at 5.30 p.m. on 13 July.</para><para>The approach taken by AusSAR in relation to <inline font-style="italic">Just Cruisin</inline> provides a sharp contrast to the approach taken by AusSAR to the search for the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret J</inline>. The last contact with the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret J</inline> was on 9 April. The Tasmanian police then contacted AusSAR on 13 April to advise that the boat was overdue and to seek assistance with the search. I understand that, while a request for assistance was not clear, it was obvious that the Tasmanian police needed help. I understand further that the contact made by the Tasmanian police on 13 April was interpreted by AusSAR as a request for assistance. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Just Cruisin</inline>, AusSAR accepted the request from the state authority to take over coordination of the search. That takeover came into effect at 2.15 p.m. on 11 July. </para><para>In the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret J</inline>, I understand that AusSAR told the Tasmanian police that they would have to complete their initial search, exhaust their search effort, or find the search beyond their capacity before AusSAR would consider taking over the coordination of the search. Those resources were well and truly exhausted by 15 April but, following a second request from the Tasmanian police for AusSAR to assume control, the police were told that the search area was too large and it was not worth searching further in the absence of new intelligence. In contrast, the justification for AusSAR taking over the coordination of the <inline font-style="italic">Just Cruisin</inline> search was that the search area spanned two state coastlines, New South Wales and Queensland. I am told AusSAR was, therefore, better placed to manage the search effort. The last time I looked, Bass Strait has on one side the Victorian coast and on the other the north coast of Tasmania. It, therefore, could have been possible for AusSAR to coordinate search resources from both Victoria and Tasmania, as was done for <inline font-style="italic">Just Cruisin</inline>. </para><para>In response to the second request for assistance from the Tasmanian police, I understand that AusSAR responded saying that the boat had been missing for six days, the search area was very large and therefore an extension of the search could not be justified. According to the answer that I have been given, AusSAR took over the search for <inline font-style="italic">Just Cruisin</inline> five days after the last contact with the vessel. This is just short of the elapsed time that AusSAR relied on to deny the Tasmanian police assistance with the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret J</inline> search. </para><para>The opposition is the sole party with commitment to a sustainable, safe and efficient shipping industry for Australian exporters and importers. Mr Anderson is committed only to the lowest common denominator, not to a sustainable industry. As we have witnessed in many sectors, the lowest cost service is not usually the best. Too often we see safety standards eroded or undermined to get that cost down. As Mr Ferguson told the other place, the shipping policy of the Howard government has been one of taking risks with the quality of shipping, Australia's environment, Australia's defence and Australian industry in the narrow pursuit of the bottom line. It is important to remember that the coastal shipping trade is part of the domestic transport task in the same manner as trucking, rail and domestic aviation services. It is, therefore, difficult to understand why the minister has never released the industry-government working party report into the competitiveness of the Australian shipping industry. Only one reason comes to mind, and that is the fact that the report did not say that cabotage should be abolished. </para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> reported in 1999 that an analysis by Access Economics in the hidden report showed that the government's policy of eliminating cabotage without genuine reform would carry significant economic costs. This is exactly what is happening. The Howard government is undermining cabotage without genuine parallel reform and inflicting significant damage on all interstate transport industries and operators as a result. </para><para>The Australian Shipowners Association submission to the current Senate hearing on a different bill also provides an interesting statistic. In 1998-99, vessels operating under the single voyage permits and continuing voyage permits carried 15.1 per cent of the total Australian interstate and intrastate transport industry freight task. In simple terms, that means the operators moving 15.1 per cent of Australia's domestic freight do not have to pay Australian award conditions. In the majority of cases, these operators are also receiving direct subsidies from their nation of origin. In fact, the submission outlines 10 acts of the Australian parliament that do not apply to foreign shippers or in some way favour their operation over Australian operators. How can Australian companies compete with that? How can that be described as a fair go?  </para><para>The Howard government has a shipping policy that directly assists overseas operators to avoid the same laws and obligations that Australian transport operators are required to meet. The impact of this is showing, as foreshadowed to the minister in the report which is buried, I believe, on his desk. He is removing cabotage by stealth without appropriate reforms or policy direction and the expected economic damage is being inflicted. The Australian public and the shipping industry are paying the cost. In 1996 there were 69 vessels in the Australian fleet. In the year 2000 that had dropped to 49 vessels. Again, to quote the Australian Shipowners Association submission, since 1995-96 inclusive the average net annual disinvestment in Australian shipping was $4 million in real terms, compared with a net annual average investment of $292.8 million between 1989-1990 and 1994-95. Those dates are inclusive.

To that end, we had two minor concerns with this legislation. The first was identified by both the Parliamentary Library researcher and also staff working with me, and it was to do with item 15 of the bill. Item 15 replaces a requirement to retain with a prohibition on discharge. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> says:</para><quote><para>It will be an offence under <inline font-weight="bold">proposed section 10 </inline>to discharge oil residues into the sea, where that would be an offence under <inline font-weight="bold">proposed sections 9(1) </inline>and <inline font-weight="bold">9(1B</inline>), unless the discharge is made to a reception facility.</para></quote><para>We share the mild concern of the library researcher, who argued:</para><quote><para>Two unintended consequences may arise from the drafting of <inline font-weight="bold">proposed section 10</inline>. First, it is possible that the section permits the discharge of oil residues into the sea where the discharge is being made to an onshore reception facility. Second, it is possible that the section permits discharge of oil residues between vessels at sea or elsewhere onshore.</para></quote><para>That may not be the intention of the drafting, and I suspect that it is not, but it remains a mild concernâ and we Democrats would like to see that better drafted.</para><para>A second concern we had with the legislation is that it provides that an inspector has the discretion to require discharge of materials into a specified facility. Our particular concern with that is that the proposal does not require any set of standards, whether environmental or other standards, in relation to that procedure, and is therefore very open-ended.</para><para>In response to both those concerns, I have had briefings with the department and spoken directly with the minister's office with the view to some amendments that will alleviate our concern with the unintended consequences referred to in the explanatory memorandum, and also to see whether we could tighten the legislation a little to ensure that an inspector would only require discharge when he or she has a reasonable belief that discharge into a specified facility is necessary in order to avoid a risk of discharge at sea. So, to that end, I understand that there is an agreed informal arrangement that, if those concerns of the Democrats can be alleviated and accommodated with an amendment which would have cross-party support to progress the passage of this legislation, we Democrats will happily lend our support to that and ensure that this legislation is passed quickly in the non-controversial section provided for on Thursday next week. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>26496</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1274">International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline> amends four acts to give effect to matters in international marine conventions.

As I said, when I think of fundraising, Senator Ray, those are the sorts of issues that I think of. When I think of you, Senator Ray, I think of a man who has spent five years totally immersed in muckraking.

The Howard government has been able to do so much better than the previous Labor government in relation to funding of hospitals because it has been able to deliver sound economic management in this country. When Labor was in office, taxes were high, deficits were high and interest rates were high and Labor simply could not afford to fund hospitals in the way that they should have been funded. By contrast, we have been able to run budgets in surplus and we have, therefore, been able to invest in public services such as hospitals in an unprecedentedly high manner.</para></talk.start><para>When Labor was in office instead they ran up debtsâsome $80 billion of debt in their last five years of office. And who was the finance minister at that time, as the books of the nation slipped further and further into the red? Mr Beazley, the now Leader of the Opposition, who aspires to be the next Prime Minister of this country. This is the same Mr Beazley who in the last few days was somewhat loose with the truth in relation to health matters. That might not have come as a surprise to some people, because if they remember his record as finance minister they will remember that he was somewhat loose with the truth then as well. What did he say about the books being in surplus? He said the books were in surplus, when he was finance minister before the 1996 election, whereas they were $10 billion in deficit. How could there be a more blatant misleading of the Australian people than that? He said, `The books are in surplus,' when they were $10 billion in deficit. The only other alternative explanation is incompetence.

This government has been prepared to make some very hard decisions to protect the vulnerable, because they are in fact the first who are hurt by weak economies and governments who go on opportunistic spending sprees. </para></talk.start><para>In contrastâbecause Senator Watson asked me whether there was agreement on this matterâMr Beazley, when finance minister, was quite the opposite; he was weak. Government debt skyrocketed from $55 billion to $96 billion, government spending on interest blew out from nearly $3 billion to nearly $8 billion and interest rates increased to over 10 per cent. That is why I say that Mr Beazley is not fit to be Prime Minister. Why? Because he demonstrated in his time as finance minister a fundamental flaw: weakness. You should not be a finance minister if you do not have the strength to keep finances under controlâif you do not have the ticker to do the job. If you are a weak person, if you do not have the ticker, you certainly should not be applying for the Prime Minister's job. </para><para>Given his appalling recordâthat is, Mr Beazley'sâI was somewhat stunned to read excerpts of a speech Mr Beazley made, which he is advertising as a policy announcement, on what he calls Kim Beazley's policy page. It turns out that Mr Beazley would have us believe that he, the man who was too weak to control spending as a finance minister, will be strong enough to control it if only the Australian people will just give him one more chance. To put the weak in control is a laughable notion. The speech begins with the somewhat pontificating remark, `I begin with fiscal responsibility.' He should have added `which I never exercised when I was finance minister'. It continues, `It is essential that governments live within their means,' and he should have continued with `which we never did when we were last in government'. He says now that it is essential to live within your means, but the Labor Party never did when they were in government. He goes on in the excerpt of the speech, which, as I say, is on Kim Beazley's policy page, `Better living standards for everyone.' What a joke is that, compared with Labor's last time in office! He goes on to point out how important it is to live within your means to keep interest rates down and the standard of living up. I agree; the government agrees. The trouble is that those opposite never practised it when they were in government. And then there is this gem: Mr Beazley's golden rule, the first point of which is `governments must not borrow to finance current spending'.</para><para>Hello! Here we have the man who last let spending get out of control saying that he will now control itâ the finance minister who had the biggest debt now committing himself to balancing the budget. How stupid does he think we are? How vulnerable does he think we are? This is like Skase lecturing on corporate responsibility or Bill Clinton saying that he never even met Monica Lewinsky. The Australian people are not that gullible.

I acknowledge the work that Senator Eggleston has done in relation to Coastwatch and his keen interest, having regard to the fact that he has spent a lot of time in the north-west of Australia. Yesterday, a report was handed down by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit which found that Customs Coastwatch operated as a highly effective body in detecting and intercepting unauthorised arrivals. This committee have taken extensive evidence and sat over a period of time investigating Coastwatch and have come up with a clean bill of healthâan endorsement, in factâfor what Coastwatch was doing.</para></talk.start><para>You have to look at what the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, did when he was Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence and looked into Coastwatch back in 1984. He found that Coastwatchâor a coastguard thenâwould be cost ineffective and would duplicate services. That is precisely what the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit found yesterday. It said that a stand-alone coastguard would duplicate services and be cost ineffectiveâprecisely what the Leader of the Opposition found in the early eighties. Yet what do we have the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition coming up with? In January 2000, when they were under pressure to come up with policies, they said, `We'll have a coastguard.' They pulled it out of the air and said, `We'll have a coastguard.' And what did the minority opposition members say in the committee report yesterday? They said, `We'll have a coastguard.' This is despite the fact that in today's monetary terms it would cost $2 billionâand that comes from the Leader of the Opposition himself when he looked into this in the early eighties.</para><para>The question arises: where are you going to get $2 billion from? You are going to get $2 billion by taking it from other law enforcement agencies and other areas of Customs and Defence. But the Leader of the Opposition has said that it will not cost $2 billion. He has gone back on what he said in that report when he looked at this previously. He is saying that it will cost only $220 million, but that is at odds with what his fellow ministerial colleagues have said. They have said that they are going to purchase between 12 and 15 specialist vessels. That is going to cost $850 million.</para><para>It is like the three hospitals that we had yesterday from Senator West and Senator George Campbell. We have got three different versions here today on coastguard and Coastwatch. The coastguard is going to cost $2 billionâthat came from the Leader of the Opposition in that report in the early eighties. But no, it is going to cost $850 million, and that came from opposition spokesmen such as the shadow minister for fisheries, Mr O'Connor; the shadow minister for Customs, Mr Kerr; and the shadow spokesman, Mr McMullan. They all said it was going to cost $850 million. More recently, you have got the Leader of the Opposition saying $220 million. They do not know what they want and they do not know how much it is going to cost.</para><para>What the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit said yesterday was that Coastwatch was workingâit was effective. The minority report was designed to prop up the opposition's totally flawed policy on a coastguard. They also tried to beat up black flights. They said that there were a lot of unauthorised flights, and they relied on anecdotal evidence. Of course, Defence said that they detected only four possible unauthorised flightsâblack flightsâover 10 years.

They want to build their case on evidence which is non-existent. They simply want a name change, which is going to cost $220 million.

Let me make a couple of observations, Senator. Companies often wind up for a variety of reasons that may have nothing to do with solvency issues. For example, historically there are more companies wound up through company shareholders voluntarily deciding to wind up a solvent company than for any other reason. If you examine the ASIC figures for the total number of companies under external administration, the proportion of companies under external administration compared with total company registrations has not altered a great deal in the last five years. The average for the last five years, I am advised, is 0.70 per cent of registered companies being placed under external administration in any given year. In 2000-01, the figure is 0.71 per cent, which is almost the same for the coalition's period in office. By comparison, the average of registered companies placed under external administration in Labor's last five years was one per centâit was higher than in the coalition's five years!

We are putting a lot of effort into implementing the former Labor government's policy of establishing a proper repository for low level radioactive waste in this country. We have the cooperation of the South Australian Liberal government to ensure that does proceed in the central north of South Australia. We would also appreciate the cooperation of parties like the Democrats in ensuring that we can properly store Australia's store of intermediate level radioactive waste in a purpose-built facility, the search for which we have now commenced. It is critically important that we manage and properly store our radioactive waste in this country and not leave it lying around where it has been for some 40 to 50 years due to the inattention of those like those opposite who had 13 years to deal with this problem and did not.

Is it also the case that between 40,000 and 50,000 of those forms are still to be returned, a nonreturn rate of more than one-third of all forms issued?  Did your department include a reply paid envelope for people to send those forms back?  Is it true that people are finding it simply too complex and difficult a task to answer the up to 90 questions on the forms?

Can the minister advise the Senate:  does the government consider it appropriate for an IVF company in Sydney to be engaged in pre-implantation diagnosis of an embryo to see whether it is male or female for the purposes of transferring only that embryo of the right sex for family balancing purposes?  If the government considers that that is highly inappropriate, what action is  it taking to ensure that taxpayers' money is not being spent through Medicare on that service?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator HARRADINE</inline> - Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.  It is a simple question and it is still not answered.  I asked that question before:  do we - all of the government and all of the opposition, the Democrats and the whole of this chamber - not believe that sex selection for family balancing purposes and the transfer only of the desired embryo for the right sex is inappropriate and should be condemned?  Don't we all agree with that?  It is discrimination.  All I am asking is:  what is the government doing about it to ensure that taxpayers' money at least is not going into that?  That is either a yes or a no - yes, we are doing something about it to ensure that public moneys are not going into that disgraceful, discriminatory action.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator VANSTONE</inline> - The Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:  it is not the role of the Commonwealth government to decide the appropriateness of pre-implantation genetic testing services.  The appropriateness of these services and the responsibility for enacting legislation relating to this testing lies with the State and Territory governments.  In relation to in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), three States (Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia) have legislation and the remaining States have stated their intention to enact legislation in the area of assisted reproductive technology (ART).  The Commonwealth Government through the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has recommended that all States and Territories implement consistent legislation to regulate ART.</para><para>At present, there is no Medicare item number available for pre-implantation genetic testing and there have been no submissions from the profession to the Medicare Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) for these services to be included on the Medicare Benefits Schedule </para><para>The IVF company in Sydney informs all patients that no rebates are payable and charges patients the full cost of treatment.</para><para>Furthermore, pre-implantation genetic testing for sex-selection or any other reason unrelated to a specific medical condition would not be payable under Medicare as it would be prohibited under the Health Insurance Act 1973 as this would not constitute a clinically relevant service.  Responsibility for pre-implantation genetic testing for sex-selection available through the private sector lies with the State and Territory governments and is subject to the laws of the particular State or Territory in which the service is performed.</para><para>âââââ</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLUCAS</inline> - My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care.  Is the minister aware that the most recent Medicare statistics show a further decline in the bulk-billing rate and that over three million fewer services a year are being bulk-billed now than when the Howard government was elected?  Don't the same statistics also show that the average patient cost to see a GP has gone up 35 per cent, from $8.32 to $11.21?  Don't these statistics show that under a Howard government it has become more and more difficult to see a bulk-billing doctor and more and more expensive to see a doctor who doesn't bulk-bill?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLUCAS</inline> - Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.  Is the minister aware that the most recent Medicare statistics show a 30 per cent increase in the average patient cost for specialist medical services since the Howard government was elected?  Isn't it true that average patient charges have increased from $13 in 1996 to $17 in 2001?  Aren't these increases part of the Howard government's policy of pushing more and more costs on to patients, just like in America?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator VANSTONE</inline> - The Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Bulk-billing</inline></para><para>It is always tempting, as has the honourable senator, to use the best combination of statistics to make a political point.  In this case, the honourable senator has mistakenly asserted that the number of all bulk-billed services has fallen since the Government was elected, when the reality is that they have risen.</para><para>According to Medicare statistics in 1994-95, the last full year of the Keating government, the number of all bulk-billed services - GP (unreferred attendances) and specialist - was 130.8 million.  In 2000-2001, the number of all bulk-billed services was 152.7 million.</para><para>In growth terms, this represents an increase of 16.7 per cent over the period.  It is therefore incorrect to suggest that there are fewer bulk-billed services overall, because the reality is that there are many more.</para><para>Similarly, GP bulk-billed services moved from 77.3 million in 1994-1995 to 78.1 million in 2000-2001, having declined from a peak of 82.6 million in 1996-1997.  But it is also true to say that the overall number of GP services has fluctuated over the same period, from 98.5 million in 1994-95 to 100.6 million in 2000-2001, peaking at 103.1 million in 1997-98.   In other words, while the trend for GP bulk-billing is disappointing in that it has fallen slightly from a very high peak, it is more or less keeping pace with the slight fall in the last few years, in the overall number of GP services being provided.  There is no bulk-billing crisis. </para><para>Looking at specialist services, 53.5 million such services were bulk-billed in 1994-95, and 74.6 million in 2000-2001, an increase of 39.3 per cent.  Over the same period, overall specialist services rose from 89.6 million to 113.3 million, an increase of 26.5 per cent.  What is interesting to note is that the percentage growth, over the period, in bulk-billed specialist services well exceeded the comparable growth in all specialist services. </para><para>In metropolitan areas, GPs are continuing to bulk-bill an average 85 per cent of services because of competition between GPs to attract and retain patients.  This has been because competition is a key to practitioner bulk-billing - this hasn't been a recent discovery, it's been an underlying assumption of the Medicare structure all along under Labor and Coalition governments.</para><para>The Government, from day one, has been committed to bulk-billing.  It would have been very easy for us, as an incoming government in the face of the 1996 black hole left by the Leader of the Opposition, to have taken the scalpel to bulk-billing, but we didn't.  We didn't because we recognised that the greatest possible availability of bulk-billed GP and specialist services is a key to fair access to medical services for all Australians, but particularly for those most vulnerable in our community.</para><para>The point that the Government makes in response to the Opposition's sudden concern about bulk-billing is simple.  Under this Government the numbers of bulk-billed services have always exceeded Labor's best efforts.  What the Opposition paints as a crisis is really something of a success story for good policy and good management by the Howard government.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Patient charges</inline></para><para>The figures that the honourable senator quotes for patient contributions for GP and specialist services otherwise appear to be correct as published, except for some creative rounding up instead of rounding down.  The Government is not hiding from these statistics.  But the honourable senator has been disingenuous in her use of those statistics because of one simple fact - they represent actual rather than constant dollars over the period.  Between 1994-1995 and 2000-2001, the Consumer Price Index rose by 16.1 per cent, and 11.4 per cent between 1995-1996 and 2000-2001.  This accounts, for a start, for nearly half of the apparent growth in reported average patient contributions per service. </para><para>Another significant component is accounted for by the difference between the MBS benefit and the MBS schedule fee for any given service.  What the honourable senator presumably is actually concerned about are patient contributions exceeding the schedule fee, but Medicare statistics indicate that schedule fees have been observed for around 80 per cent of services right across the last decade.  The number of services that attract any fees in excess of the schedule therefore is relatively small, and the number of services attracting highly excessive fees is even smaller still.</para><para>It also needs to be noted that the recorded patient contribution figures themselves may not always be absolutely correct, because they reflect what amount has been charged the patient, not necessarily what the patient has actually paid.  The Government is aware that many GPs and specialists discount their fees for accounts settled promptly: where, however, the fee has not been paid by the time that the Health Insurance Commission has been notified of the charge, the nominal fee will be reflected in the statistics, exaggerating the average patient contribution across all services.</para><para>The Government is not happy with any apparent excess in patient charging, but there is no easy solution.  The bottom line and biggest single driver of bulk-billing and patient charging is competition: where there are fewer GPs or specialists available to provide a service, the greater the incentive for the doctor to use their market advantage to charge fees above the MBS schedule.</para><para>Relative lack of competition is also a major reason why bulk-billing by specialists tends to be proportionally lower than for general practice, and why patient contributions - when they are charged - are often higher than they ideally should be. </para><para>The Government agrees that deterring excessive patient charging is a major challenge, but instead of doing nothing we are meeting it in a range of ways, including:</para><para>Â·	Providing $300 million over the next four years for an increase in patient rebates for GP services as part of its commitment to ensuring that the work of GPs is more appropriately recognised, and that GP MBS remuneration is improved;</para><para>Â·	Through our Rural Health: More Doctors, Better Services strategy providing a range of opportunities for GPs to practise in rural and remote Australia, and attracting more doctors to practise in local rural and remote communities generally; </para><para>Â·	Working with medical colleges, State governments and universities to support a high quality and accessible medical workforce, with an adequate supply of GPs and specialists to meet community needs; and</para><para>Â·	Most importantly, we are moving to close the gap between for in-hospital specialist services, so that privately insured patients are not out of pocket for medical bills associated with a episode of hospital care.  At latest count, the proportion of in-hospital private patient services covered by no-gaps arrangements is 69 per cent and rising.</para><para>On the other hand, the Opposition offers nothing.</para><para>There is no secret Government agenda to make it either more difficult to see a bulk-billing doctor, or more expensive to see a doctor who doesn't bulk-bill.  This is a figment of the Opposition's fervid and poll-driven imagination.</para><para>Medicare is in excellent shape, and its value to the Australian people has improved under this Government as more services are delivered and community demand for quality and clinically effective medical services is met. </para><para>Rather than try and score creative political points Labor should put more time and energy into explaining how they can do better.  If they are going to do the usual Labor thing and throw money at a perceived problem, the Opposition should tell us where the money's coming from, and assure Australians they won't roll back Medicare as they seem to want to roll back everything else.</para><para>âââââ</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator FORSHAW</inline> - My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, representing the Minister for Health.

In relation to the Main Camp private rulings, I have a piece of correspondence from a Geoff Taylor, that I received today. He raises two issues: firstly, that a Mike Parusel, a Queenslander and one of the cooperative investment project contact group, rang him today informing him that he is working in Perth. Mr Parusel is a man who was audited by the ATO over four months in 1995 in relation to his investment in two projects. After they had approved what he had done, Mr Parusel went ahead on that basis and invested further in those programs. The question is: why shouldn't he? He had the ATO officers there; they gave him a favourable ruling, so he again invested in those projects. The ATO have now changed that ruling. Secondly, Mr Taylor goes on to say:</para><quote><para>I have now received a notice of intention from the ATO to reassess in relation to a project for which I have claimed no deductions for the upfront expenses.

The guest of honour was the Treasurer, Mr Costello. After the dinner, Mr Macfarlane and his crew, on the advice of Liberal Party headquarters, defrauded the tax office. Mr Costello found out and failed to take appropriate action. </para><para>On 23 November last year, the Liberal Federal Electorate Council of the electorate of Groom held a fundraising dinner in Toowoomba, with Mr Costello as the guest speaker. Tickets for this `gala night of political insight and fine dining' were $80. Leaked minutes of the Groom FEC executive have revealed an elaborate scheme hatched by the Liberal Party to defraud the tax office of GST revenue. What a rotten show the Howard government runs. At the time of the dinner, the Groom FEC was not registered for GST, meaning it did not collect GST nor could it claim GST input tax credits. This means, under the Liberal's own GST legislation, that Groom FEC could not seek a credit or refund from the tax office for GST it paid on any goods or services it purchased. </para><para>Evidence contained in the minutes, and other information leaked from the Queensland Liberal Party, show the Liberals arranged it so that the catering bill for the function would be paid by the Queensland Liberal Party headquarters, a registered GST entity which subsequently claimed a GST input tax credit. The catering bill was originally, appropriately, paid by the Groom FEC but this payment was later retrieved from the caterer to allow the Liberal Party's headquarters to pay the amount, thus swindling the tax office. In other words, this scheme is aimed at having the Australian taxpayer make a contribution to the re-election campaign of the Minister for Small Business, Mr Macfarlane. </para><para>Mr Macfarlane was present at the meetings at which this fraudulent mechanism was discussed and imposed on the FEC treasurer against her will. Her objections were recorded in the leaked minutes. The treasurer of the FEC, Ms Margaret Watts, later resigned over this issue. The minutes also show the FEC sought advice on the issue from a firm of accountants. The advice concluded that the arrangement should be overturned, that the money should be paid back and that `we further express the view that the Commissioner of Taxation could attack these transactions'. The minutes also reveal that the matter was brought to the attention of the federal Treasurer, Mr Costello, and that Mr Costello carpeted the small business minister, Mr Macfarlane, over the issue. Did Mr Costello take any action to refer this GST tax avoidance to the ATO or did he arrange for the evaded GST revenue to be paid back to the tax office? </para><para>There is evidence that this scam was used in relation to at least two other Queensland Liberal FECs. The then Queensland Liberal state director, Mr Graham Jaeschke, asserted that this GST fraud was put in place on the advice of the federal Liberal secretariat. You have got to ask: how far up the line does this scam go? The actions of the Groom FEC Treasurer, Ms Watts, led in February this year to the federal director of the Liberal Party, Mr Crosby, advising that the mechanism was `not feasible' and should be shut down. If Mr Macfarlane and Mr Costello cover up a breach of their new tax system by their own political organisation, in my view they should be sacked.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator Brandis</name></talker><para>âMadam Deputy President, I draw your attention to standing order 193(3).

There is also, in the political field, a question of arrant political hypocrisy. The focus is on the Treasurer, Mr Costello.

We know, from these minutes and from his words, that he was `carpeted' by the Treasurer. That implicates the Treasurer. If the Treasurer carpeted him over this, as he has explained to the FEC, then the Treasurer knew what the incident was. It raises these questions that have to be answered. Was the Treasurer a coconspirator with Mr Macfarlane? If he is not that then is he, after the fact, complicit in the event of this alleged fraudulent activity?

Although those inquiries have been brief and incomplete, they have revealed these facts to me. First, before the beginning of the 2000-01 financial year, the Liberal Partyâlike, I dare say, the Labor Party, other political parties in this country and voluntary associationsâtook advice as to how its GST obligations were to be complied with. That advice was then circulated to all units of the Liberal Party in Queensland and in other state divisions of Australia. That is no secret. Senator Faulkner, I should hope that the Labor Party also took steps to ensure that its procedures for GST compliance were intact and in conformity with the new legislation. The Queensland Liberal Party certainly did.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On 23 November, as opposition senators have said, a fundraising function was held by the Groom FEC. An issue arose as to the treatment for GST purposes of the proceeds from that function. The relevant fund was placed into a bank account so that advice could be sought as to how it was to be treated. That advice was obtained and, following the advice, the Liberal Party's obligations under the GST law were entirely complied with. It is deeply dishonest to try to twist a situation where there was a genuine question as to how an obligation was to be complied with. In good faith, that money was set aside while professional advice was sought. It is deeply dishonest to try to turn that into an allegation that the people who took caution to seek that advice and who, when it was obtained, complied with that advice and with their legal obligations were in some sense seeking to avoid them. The very reverse is true.</para><para>To suggest that taking conscientious steps to seek advice as to how legal obligations under the tax laws are to be complied with amounts to seeking to avoid those obligationsâwhich is what we have heard from Senator Ray, Senator Hogg, Senator Cook and Senator Faulknerâis deeply dishonest. I would hopeâ although I would not have much confidenceâthat, if in the early days of the GST law an issue had arisen within the Australian Labor Party as to how it ought to comply with its obligations arising out of a fundraising function, it too would have taken the steps that the Liberal Party in Queensland in the Groom FEC took to set the moneys aside, to seek professional advice as to what the obligations were and then to fulfil them. That is all this amounts to: a great beat-up to deflect attention from the dishonesty of the Leader of the Opposition as revealed in the parliament during the course of this weekâthat and nothing more. Compliance by the Liberal Party with its obligations, on adviceâthat is all this amounts to. Those who have sought to twist it, to distort it into something else, ought to hang their heads in shame. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>26519</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â The crux of this is: you cannot claim GST inputs back if GST was not imposed on the original charge. If you did not put GST on the admission tickets to this dinner, you cannot claim back the GST inputs. What happened was that the treasurer of Groom FEC paid the bill to the caterers, quite appropriately. He was then forced to withdraw that payment. It was all channelled through head office for only one reason. Cheques were exchanged between Groom, head office and then on to the caterer; it all resulted in head office harvesting about $890. Talk about perverting the government's tax laws for a miserable amount. However, this does come from a state branch that held a raffle a few weeks ago, cancelled it because they did not sell enough tickets and then pleaded not to refund anyone; so they are really into small beer here. That is what it was about, and it was a combination of the state office and certain elements of the Groom FEC. I am not alleging that Mr Macfarlane was an initiator of this, but it is quite apparent that at some stage he became aware of it, because one of the FEC meetings was apparently held in his own home. What then happened is that he had to inform Mr Costello that this was going on, and Mr Costello apparentlyâaccording to the minutesârebuked Mr Macfarlane. </para></talk.start><para>What was their duty of office at this stage? I think it should have been to immediately, on behalf of both of them, refer the matter to the Commissioner of Taxation or to the Federal Police. That would have been a safer course of action. However, the natural inclination of all politiciansâwhich they should try to resistâis to cover things up and hope they will never come out. But they should not have tried to heavy local officials, because they are the ones who may eventually get charged with trying to pervert the tax act. It is not fair to treat local voluntary officials in this way.</para><para>We heard Senator Kemp say today that he did not know anything about this, and I think he is telling the truth. However, he is representing the Treasurer in this chamber, and it is legitimate for us to ask questions as to whether tax avoidance or evasion or whatever you like to call it is occurring in this instance, especially when it comes from a Liberal Party that put the legislation through this chamber and has talked in glowing terms about getting rid of the black economy and about how this is less manipulable than other tax systems. Yet they are into it. It seems to be systemic in the Queensland branch: it happened in the Lilley FEC and where else we do not know.

I understand that the Tucker factionâthe out faction, if you likeâis extremely upset with this particular rort. The moment they express a bit of concern about it, what happens? Mr Tucker gets stripped of his preselection for the coming election. The rank and file get bowled over, and so the Tucker faction has to go to court to get proper preselection procedures put back in. It is not good enough to punish Mr Tucker because he will not go along with tax dodging rorts. Good luck to him; I at least admire the fact that he is not prepared to. But, of course, all the members of the Carroll faction were in this like big brown dogs. The fact is, though, that it is for peanuts.

Indeed, the issue at hand is the very integrity of the government's Federal Road Safety Black Spot Program. </para><para>Organisations seeking funding through this program are required to meet the terms of the eligibility criteria detailed on the Department of Transport and Regional Services' web site. As you would expect, those criteria go very directly to the issue of road safety and how safety can be enhanced or safety hazards removed through this capital works program. Also on the web site are the factors that the federal minister is required to take into account when assessing which projects receive funding. The first dot point on the web site documentâthat is, the first test the minister is required to take into account when assessing which projects may receive fundingâis whether the project meets the criteria for the program. That is point number one. Given the specific nature of this program and given these criteria, one would expect funding to be accurately directed to areas of highest risk, as shown by, for example, high average casualty rates. One would expect that, if a section of road was in need of funding but did not meet the terms of this program, its proponents would be encouraged to look to other road funding programs for money. It is essential that people who seek funds through the black spots program can be confident that their application will be, as should others, properly assessed against the criteria. It is also essential that, of the projects meeting these criteria, priority is given to funding the worst trouble spots. This should be a program with very little flexibility and even less ministerial discretion. It should not be a pot of money to meet the short-term political needs of the transport minister or of his office. It should be a pot of money to address the high risk points in the national road system and it should be aimed at saving lives.</para><para>The reason that I am seeking access to this material is because I am concerned that in relation to this particular black spot projectâthat is, project N00752âvery few, if any, of the criteria were in fact met. That is not to say that the section of road in question, which is the Delegate to Delegate River Road section, did not need upgrading. I understand that it did. I also understand that the funding that has been made available has not done the job that is required either. What was required, in fact, was a commitment by the government to fund and upgrade the road from an appropriate program. I sought access to this material by way of a freedom of information application, but access was refused to all but a few documents. I will come back to those documents shortly. I also placed a number of questions on notice in relation to the black spots selection criteria and the extent to which this project met those criteria. Those questions are numbered 3672 through to 3681. Those questions were placed on notice on 2 July and are now overdue. I would appreciate the minister chasing those answers for me, but that is another matter to which I may have to come back on another day.</para><para>As I said, the reason that I am pursuing this matter is because I understand that project N00752 did not meet the black spot program criteria. I have been advised that the recommendation that went to the then minister, Mr Vaile, was that the application for funding not be approved. I understand that the application was only progressed because the department was pressured by the then minister's land transport adviser. I understand that Mr Vaile ignored that departmental advice and approved the project, despite the fact that it did not qualify for funding under the criteria. If my advice is wrong, this matter can be settled and the people seeking assistance to reduce or remove dangerous sections of road through black spot funding can apply for money confident that they will be given a fair hearing. But if my advice is correct, those genuinely seeking funding through the black spots program can have no confidence that they will be given a fair hearing. That would be proven, of course, if the documents that the Senate and I have sought in this return to order were produced. If I am correct, Mr Vaile at least has allowed this program to be manipulated, and manipulated for political gain.</para><para>I referred earlierâas did the minister in his statementâto a freedom of information application for documents in relation to this project lodged by my me on 2 July this year. One of the documents that I was provided with was entitled `Notice to tenderers'. On page 2 of that document, there is a paragraph that reads:</para><quote><para>The methodology for carrying out the work is to be a `reverse tender' process. This involves the invitation of tenders to investigate and propose a suitable project or projects that can be shown to provide safety improvements.</para></quote><para>This may in fact be the way that things are done. It would be unusual, to say the least, that any application for assistance through a program with such a tight set of criteria is not required to actually nominate a specific project, but, in this case, tenderers are asked to offer suggestions.</para><para>The black spots program also provides funding for projects that have not met the list criteria but have been recommended for treatment on the basis of an official road safety audit report. There is also a discretionary clause for the minister to approve funding, but on the basis of advancing national road safety, not advancing political prospects. So it appears to me that if an application for funding met the criteria, the project or projects would be identified in the application. </para><para>I would like to refer to two other documents that have been provided to me. The first is an email from Mark Laduzko, who appears to be from the land transport policy area of the department, to Mr Kevin Reece, who appears to be from the Federal Office of Road Safety. In part, the email reads:</para><quote><para>Kevin, as discussed, has FORS had any applications for black spots funding for this?

RTA also understand that Peter Cochrane, state member for Eden-Monaro, may be approaching FORS about black spots funding.</para></quote><para>As at 12 August 1997, this section of roadâwhich is 11.7 kilometres in lengthâwas not considered so unsafe that it warranted an application by the Bombala Shire Council for New South Wales safety funds. So it went from not appearing on the radar screen at all in August 1997âeven at a state levelâ to attracting $250,000 in black spots funding at the end of 1998.</para><para>I have also been provided with a copy of the nomination form for the project, and it is dated 26 August 1997. It was lodged by the Delegate River and Border Districts Progress Association. What appears next at point 18 on the nomination form is a little unclear, I must say, but it is the nature of the heading which is of concern. Under that heading, it states:</para><quote><para>Since 1990, some 61 accidents have occurred on this section of road. We believe this section of road necessitates urgent upgrading before further fatalities occur.</para></quote><para>That is, there were just under nine accidents per year. I would be interested to see how that accident rate compares with other actual or potential black spot sites. While there is a reference to fatalities, the actual number of deaths on this road section is not identified. I would be interested to hear from the minister as to the actual number of deaths on this section of road as compared with other potential or actual black spots. The last document that I received through the FOI process was a typed note to the then land transport adviser and to the then minister, Mr Vaile. It reads:</para><quote><para>Dear Lochie,</para><para>Could you please fill in the details for items numbered 10, 11, 12 and 13 on our behalf? We don't have a copy of the quote from the local road contractor that we left with you. Thank you.</para></quote><para>Then it is signed. What does that suggest? It suggests to me that this particular submission for black spots funding was personally progressedâin fact, the paperwork even completedâby the minister's own land transport adviser. </para><para>In the absence of this material we have the following matters that require clarification: claims put to me that this project was forced through by Mr Vaile at the urging of his land transport adviser and against the very forceful advice from the Department of Transport and Regional Services that it should be rejected; questions on notice that go to the issue of the criteria for black spots funded and the compatibility of this project with those criteria that remain unanswered; an email suggesting that the section of road covered by this application had not been identified as unsafe by the local council as late as August 1997; and evidence that Mr Vaile's land transport adviser may have in fact personally completed the application for funding for the project in Mr Vaile's office. </para><para>The best way to deal with this matter is for the minister to table the material the Senate is seeking, but apparently he will not. Only after that occurs and the claims made to me that this program has been corrupted by the government have been properly dealt with can people have any confidence again in the integrity of the assessment process. It is very much, I suggest, in the national interest, and certainly in the interests of those people and organisations seeking funding through the black spots program, that all the relevant material is tabled. I say again: its non-tabling can only indicate that what I have said is absolutely true.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>26523</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Reports: Government Responses</title><page.no>26523</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>26523</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present three government responses to committee reports as listed on today's <inline font-style="italic">Order of Business</inline>.

However, the Government rejects many of the assertions made in the report regarding action by the Government, and the effectiveness of existing policy and programs in addressing the issue of climate change and meeting our international obligations. </para><para>This Government has an outstanding record with regard to action on climate change, a record that is increasingly being recognised internationally as being at the forefront of domestic action by Kyoto Protocol signatories. Total Government commitment to action now extends to approximately $1 billion, amongst the highest per capita funding for greenhouse action globally. </para><para>Meeting the challenge of climate change is not a task the Government takes lightly. A mood of uncertainty continuesâinternational negotiations are continuing including to consider possible rules for implementing the Kyoto Protocol and its emission targets; the cost of operating in a carbon constrained world is not yet clear; and the likely impacts of climate change on our regional communities or the costs of adapting to that change are not yet fully understood. These are challenges the government is responding to through a long-term, carefully planned and integrated approach. The Government is committed to the pursuit of cost effective greenhouse gas abatement policies and measures. In the event that Australia ratifies the Kyoto Protocol, it will meet its international greenhouse commitments in the most cost effective manner so that Australian industry remains competitive and in a way that secures continued strong economic growth and job creation. Another key feature of the government's greenhouse response is the inclusion of industry and the community through extensive consultation in the development and implementation of policy.</para><para>The Government's response to key issues raised in the report is provided below. The Government's response to individual recommendations is provided in the attached document.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The International Framework</inline></para><para>As noted in the ECITA report there are many outstanding issues to be resolved before the Government is prepared to consider ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. These include: the rules pertaining to the use of the Protocol's flexibility mechanisms (Joint Implementation (JI), the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and international emissions trading); definitional and operational issues associated with the use of carbon sinks under Articles 3.3 and 3.4 of the Protocol; and the compliance system that will apply to the Protocol. Also of key concern to Australia is the engagement of developing countries in action to reduce emissions. To ratify the Protocol prior to the resolution of these matters would not be in Australia's national interests.</para><para>The Sixth Conference of the Parties (COP 6) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in November 2000, was scheduled to reach resolution on a number of these issues. However, it was not possible to reach agreement at COP 6 due to the complexity and range of matters under negotiation and the economic and political issues at stake. COP 6 was suspended, and will resume from 16-27 July 2001. Australia has consistently argued that a workable international framework to address climate change needs to be economically manageable and include developing countries whose emissions will exceed those of OECD countries within this decade. The United States recently expressed opposition to the Kyoto Protocol because it exempted developing countries from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and would be costly to implement. The Prime Minister subsequently wrote to President Bush outlining Australia's approach to climate change and reaffirming Australia's commitment to develop an effective global framework to address the issue.   </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The National Framework</inline></para><para>The Government rejects the assertions of the ECITA report that there has been a lack of integration of greenhouse matters into other strategic policy agendas; that there is a reluctance on the part of the Government to take a long term view of action to address climate change; and that current measures do not put us on the path to meeting our international commitments. The Government believes that such views are based on a misreading of the national framework for action and its strategic greenhouse policy. The Government has invested significant resources to develop a long term integrated strategic framework to respond to the challenges presented by global warming, recognising the uncertainties in international negotiations and the constraints on domestic actions.</para><para>The Government's approach to addressing climate change has been developed in the context of our national interest, ensuring that current, and future, greenhouse gas abatement policies and measures promote cost effective actions that minimise the burden for business and the community. It is an approach that has the support of all governments and the majority of stakeholders. Institutional mechanisms such as the establishment of the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO) and the Ministerial Council on Greenhouse have been put in place to ensure that greenhouse policy is developed in a whole-of-government context and that due consideration is given to the potential impact of other Government policies on our greenhouse gas emissions.</para><para>The National Greenhouse Strategy (NGS) articulates the framework for a coordinated and collaborative approach by governments. Under the NGS all governments have committed to action to limit greenhouse gas emissions; foster knowledge and understanding of greenhouse issues; and lay the foundations for adaptation to climate change. The Government agrees, however, with the report's assessment that States and Territories will need to increase their commitment to greenhouse action, as they are responsible for implementing measures in key areas of emissions growth such as transport and land use planning, land management, and energy use and supply.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Progress and Effectiveness of Current Measures</inline></para><para>As demonstrated in the <inline font-style="italic">National Greenhouse Strategy 2000 Progress Report</inline>, tabled by the Government in December 2000, good progress has been made in putting in place the NGS's broad range of measures. Commonwealth and nationally coordinated measures contained in the NGS are expected to deliver emissions savings in the order of 58-64 million tonnes (Mt) (equivalent to around 14-16 per cent of 1990 levels, excluding emissions from land clearing). When the impact of action the Government is pursuing under the 1999 <inline font-style="italic">Measures for a Better Environment</inline> package is taken into account, as well as the opportunities likely to be presented by international flexibility mechanisms (the rules for which are currently being negotiated), the Government expects that Australia will be able to meet its Kyoto target should Australia decide to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. However, while Australia's Kyoto target remains achievable, staying on track will depend on Australian governments, industry and the broader community remaining committed to reducing greenhouse emissions. </para><para>The Commonwealth Government has led by example. Key achievements under the Prime Ministers 1997 <inline font-style="italic">Safeguarding the Future</inline> package, a central element of the NGS, include:</para><para>Â·	supporting <inline font-style="italic">renewable energy</inline> by funding industry development and commercialis-ation and the passing of legislation to require that, by 2010, Australia sources an additional 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable sources;</para><para>Â·	promoting energy efficiency by introducing, in consultation with the States and Territories, Minimum Energy Performance Standards for equipment and appliances as well as pursuing incorporation of energy efficiency measures into the Building Code of Australia;</para><para>Â·	moving towards best practice in fossil fuel electricity generation through introduction in July 2000 of new power station energy efficiency standardsâexpected to cut about 4 Mt of carbon emissions each year (equivalent to taking one million cars permanently off the road);</para><para>Â·	increased use of alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and improved consumer awareness of the fuel efficiency of motor vehicles;</para><para>Â·	an improvement in Australia's capacity to store carbon in vegetation through the innovative Bush for Greenhouse program and Plantationsâ2020 Vision program; </para><para>Â·	delivering reductions in Commonwealth Government greenhouse emissions through implementation of the Commonwealth Energy Policy, which includes mandatory energy intensity targets to be met by 2002-03 and mandatory annual reporting. Since the 1997-98 reporting period the energy consumption of government operations and associated greenhouse emissions have both been reduced;</para><para>Â·	further Australian industry engagement including:</para><para>Â·	the voluntary Greenhouse Challenge program to abate greenhouse emissionsâover 45 per cent of Australia's total industrial emissions are now covered; and </para><para>Â·	stimulating, through the voluntary Energy Efficiency Best Practice program, contin-uous improvement and innovation in achieving the efficient use of energy in a range of industry sectors and the uptake of cost-effective technologies and practices with cross-sectoral application; and </para><para>Â·	compilation of the world class National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, providing high quality estimates and trend analyses of emissions as well as establishment of the technically rigorous National Carbon Accounting System to account for greenhouse gas sources and sinks. </para><para>Building on achievements under the NGS the Government has reaffirmed and strengthened its commitment to taking action to abate greenhouse gas emissions through the greenhouse measures incorporated in the 1999 <inline font-style="italic">Measures for a Better Environment</inline> package. </para><para>Key amongst these additional measures is the <inline font-style="italic">Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program</inline> (GGAP).<inline font-style="italic"></inline>Through this program the Commonwealth is seeking to fund abatement effort that will reduce Australia's national emissions profile within the first Kyoto commitment period and beyond. GGAP is targeting projects that offer significant and cost-effective reductions in Australia's 2008-12 emissions profile. GGAP will draw on a range of abatement offers over the next four years, and provide funding of up to $400 million to worthy projects. </para><para>Under the first round of GGAP funding, the Government is investing over $100 million in a range of greenhouse abatement projects. These projects cover various sectors across Australia, including energy, transport fuels, mining, industrial processes and agriculture.</para><para>The expected cost of abatement ranges from $4.00 GGAP/tonne to $8.00 GGAP/tonne, with an expected average cost of about $6.00 GGAP/tonne.</para><para>The Government expects over 17 Mt of CO2-e to be abated from these projects in the first Kyoto commitment period.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Measures for a Better Environment</inline> is also providing additional support for the development, commercialisation and uptake of renewable energy technologies (up to $321 million); and promoting and encouraging the uptake of alternative fuels ($75 million). </para><para>While significant effort is being taken to contribute to reduce emissions through domestic action the Government also recognises that global greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced very cost-effectively through the proposed Kyoto Protocol flexibility mechanisms. These mechanisms (International Emissions Trading, JI and the CDM) would create a global market in carbon credits which will seek out lowest cost abatement opportunities internationally. The Government has set up the International Greenhouse Partnerships Office to progress the establishment of the CDM and JI.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">New Measures and Options Under Investigation</inline></para><para>The Government is also working collaboratively with State and Territory governments and industry to minimise levels of uncertainty about the long-term implications of addressing climate change and maintain the momentum for containing growth in emissions. Some key options currently under investigation include domestic emissions trading, credit for early action, and the inclusion of a greenhouse trigger under the <inline font-style="italic">Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act</inline><inline font-style="italic">1999</inline> (EPBC Act). In addition several new programs are due to commence in 2001 including the first round of projects under GGAP and a new product certification program.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Domestic Emissions Trading</inline></para><para>The ECITA report calls for the early implementation of a domestic emissions trading scheme. The Government has asked the AGO to examine the feasibility and implications of emissions trading for Australia. Work undertaken to date suggests that emissions trading can provide a variety of benefits in terms of offering a non-prescriptive and economically efficient approach to greenhouse gas abatement, linkage to international trading systems and reliability in achieving an emissions target. But this analysis is far from complete and the evaluation of emissions trading options will be the focus of continuing consultation. </para><para>The Government announced in August 2000 that it will only implement a mandatory domestic emissions trading scheme if the Kyoto Protocol is ratified by Australia, has entered into force and there is an established international emissions trading regime. The Government's decision does not rule out the subsequent introduction of such a scheme if further analysis demonstrates that this would be in the national interest. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">Credit for Early Action</inline></para><para>On 15 November 2000, the Government released the public consultation paper, <inline font-style="italic">Encouraging Early Greenhouse Abatement Action</inline>. The Government announced in-principle support for the development of a system that would credit early abatement action occurring within Australia, if there is sufficient demand for access to âearly action creditâ and a satisfactory program design can be agreed. Early crediting arrangements could enhance opportunities for investors to hedge against greenhouse risks thereby encouraging further abatement in the most cost effective areas of the economy. Under the proposed program, companies could earn âcreditsâ that would be exchangeable for emission allowances that will be assigned to Australia if it becomes a Party to a Kyoto Protocol which enters into force. These credits would effectively become permits under any future emissions trading scheme. Participation by industry would be on a voluntary basis.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Greenhouse Trigger</inline></para><para>In 1999, the Prime Minister indicated that, upon passage of the EPBC Act, the Commonwealth Government would commence a process of consultation with the States and other stakeholders `on the issue of applying a greenhouse trigger under that legislation in relation to new projects that would be major emitters of greenhouse gases'.</para><para>A consultation paper on the possible application of a trigger was released in December 1999 and a model trigger design was released in May 2000. In November 2000, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage wrote to the States and Territories seeking their views on a draft regulation and attached a discussion paper outlining how such a trigger could be applied. Under the draft regulations, the EPBC Act would be triggered by major new developments if they are likely to result in greenhouse gas emissions of more than 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in any 12 month period. </para><para>A greenhouse trigger would provide a mechanism to assure that Australia's national interest is taken into account when considering the implications of new projects. The purpose of the proposed greenhouse trigger would not be to restrict Australia's future economic growth but rather to ensure that new developments represent âbest practiceâ from a greenhouse perspective. Effects on international competitiveness and regional development would be factored into the assessment and approval process. The government is currently consulting with State and Territory governments and other relevant stakeholders on the possible implementation of a greenhouse trigger under the EPBC Act.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Product Certification Program </inline></para><para>This proposed program is a greenhouse certification and labelling program. Under the proposed program design, it is intended that product manufacturers and service providers will be able to apply for certification that the greenhouse gas emissions of a product or service have been offset by corresponding emissions abatement projects that have been financed by the company. </para><para>The proposed program is designed to encourage consumers to consider greenhouse when making their purchasing decisions, and to stimulate further greenhouse gas abatement in Australia.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response to Key Issues Raised in the ECITA Report</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">Energy Markets and Supply</inline></para><para>The ECITA report calls for the acceleration and broadening of activity in the energy sector with a particular focus on improving the greenhouse outcomes of energy market reform. The Government accepts that greenhouse gas emissions from stationary energy have increased, however, this is the result of a range of factors and cannot be attributed solely to the short-term outcomes of the energy market reform process. Through the implementation of the NGS and the Government's <inline font-style="italic">Measures for a Better Environment</inline> package considerable steps have been taken at the Commonwealth level to accelerate greenhouse action across the energy sector. </para><para>Energy market reform is one of the key elements of the Government's approach to microeconomic reform and competition policy. To date, energy market reform has delivered substantial national economic benefits and reduced input costs to business by improving productivity, resource allocation and investment decisions in the electricity and gas sectors, and by delivering lower real electricity and gas prices to end users.</para><para>In the initial stages of the reform process there was an excess supply of electricity in the market. This resulted in relatively depressed market prices, which favoured low cost and incidentally high emission incumbents. Accordingly there has been an increase in the greenhouse intensity of energy supply. This trend is expected to weaken over the medium to longer term as the market matures. Barriers to entry for alternative energy suppliers as a result of excess capacity and transitional arrangements are likely to diminish over the medium term.</para><para>The Government agrees that there is a need for continuing energy market reform. Pursuit of accelerated energy market reform will have significant economic benefits for the Australian economy as well as environmental benefits from reduced greenhouse intensity of energy supply in the longer term. Competition principles must remain the primary driver for continuing energy market reform if the full economic benefits are to be realised. It is expected both the electricity and gas reform measures will contribute to emissions reductions by increasing the proportion of gas in total energy consumption in the long term. </para><para>Generator Efficiency Standards for power plants, which commenced on 1 July 2000, will assist in reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of energy supply and will encourage best practice in the efficiency of electricity generation using fossil fuels. This program is projected to achieve about 4 Mt per annum of greenhouse gas abatement at a cost of up to $10/tonne carbon dioxide equivalent in the Kyoto commitment period.</para><para>Increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy market is a key outcome sought by Government. To this end legislation to support the Government's mandatory renewable energy target was passed by Parliament in December 2000. As the first legislated energy supply greenhouse response measure, the mandatory renewable energy target demonstrates the Government's commitment to greenhouse gas emission reduction and is a recognition of the contribution that the renewable energy sector can make to Australia's efforts to address climate change.</para><para>In addition, considerable funding of $386 million under the Prime Minister's 1997 <inline font-style="italic">Safeguarding the Future </inline>package and the 1999 <inline font-style="italic">Measures for a Better Environment</inline> package has been provided to encourage increased uptake of renewable energy and support development of renewable energy technology. The<inline font-style="italic"> Renewable Energy Action Agenda</inline> a jointly developed industry-Government strategy, also provides a path for the development of the Australian renewable energy industry. An Industry Chief Executive Officer Group has been established to provide high level support and strategic guidance in the implementation process and will report on progress in implementing the Action Agenda by end July 2001. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">Transport</inline></para><para>The ECITA report also calls for more substantial action across a broad range of Government activity. It argues for new levels of investment from governments in urban and interstate rail and public transport; reform of Fringe Benefit Tax arrangements for cars, to remove financial incentives to travel greater distances; the exemption from GST of public transport; and additional measures to encourage greater uptake and increase the availability of alternative fuelled vehicles. </para><para>The Government acknowledges that the transport sector is an area of increasing growth in emissions and that this sector needs to play its part in meeting the Government's environmental objectives. </para><para>There has been progress by the Government in a number of areas including steps to improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles and increase the uptake of alternative fuels. From January 2001 under the Government's fuel consumption labelling scheme, all new passenger cars, four wheel drive and light commercial vehicles sold in Australia are required to carry a fuel consumption label on their windscreen. </para><para>The environmental advantages of rail freight over road transport are also recognised, and the Government has initiated a broad ranging program of reforms addressing the substantial deficiencies in the interstate rail network with a view to increasing the proportion of the freight market directed to rail transport. The reforms seek to improve rail service levels through the introduction of private sector expertise to the industry, improvements to track management and track quality, and reduction of operator costs.</para><para>The Government has recognised the need to ensure consistency between economic instruments relating to transport and fiscal, economic and environmental policy, including greenhouse objectives. A report by the Bureau of Transport Economics <inline font-style="italic">Transport and Greenhouse: A Study of Policy Options</inline>, into the effects on transport of various economic instruments, has been commissioned as part of implementation of the NGS. The Government will consider the outcomes of this report in the further development of measures to abate greenhouse emissions from the transport sector but does not support major changes to transport taxation at this time.</para><para>Curbing the growth of transport emissions requires a systematic and cooperative approach by governments and industry. The Australian Transport Council (ATC) is providing a key mechanism to foster strategic thinking on cross-modal, cross-jurisdictional and strategic issues of national significance such as greenhouse. The ATC has established in 2000 a National Transport Secretariat (NTS) to facilitate this action. The NTS will greatly enhance ATC's ability to progress national planning and reform in this sector. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">Forestry, Land Management and Agriculture</inline></para><para>The ECITA report recognises the potential of the land management sector to contribute to emissions reductions. The report recommends the establishment and enhancement of carbon sinks under the guidance of a national sinks policy; the introduction of strong national controls on land clearing; and the use of regional abatement strategies that encourage retention of native vegetation, investment in revegetation activities and investment in plant that will support such activities.</para><para>The Government is acting in the land management sector, including to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from land clearing. Strategies being implemented under the NGS include:</para><para>Â·	encouraging sequestration of carbon and supporting sustainable land management by developing and implementing policies to protect and expand Australia's vegetation cover;</para><para>Â·	assisting national efforts to reduce emissions from agricultural activities; and </para><para>Â·	providing credible and verifiable estimates of Australia's emissions and sinks resulting from land use, land use change and forestry activities by developing a world class carbon accounting system (expected to be operating by end 2001).  </para><para>The Government supports the concept of a National Policy Framework for Greenhouse Sinks. Such a framework could:</para><para>Â·	raise awareness of the kinds of sinks eligible under the Kyoto Protocol and the accounting framework necessary to determine their capacity to offset emissions, once these issues have been determined at the international level;</para><para>Â·	enhance coordination of Australia's action on greenhouse gas sequestration across jurisdictions; </para><para>Â·	contribute to achievement of Australia's greenhouse commitments at least cost to the Australian economy; and</para><para>Â·	allow for the appropriate integration of regional, natural resource management and greenhouse sinks objectives. </para><para>The Government continues to make progress in the area of agriculture where it is developing a cooperative approach with industry to identify areas where private and public investment can be made to optimise emission reductions. It is also investigating synergies between the development of on farm sinks and other natural resource management goals.</para><para>The Government is also providing significant support for research and development into alternative forest products with positive greenhouse outcomes, such as the development of biomass fuel, and exploring the viability of commercial ventures from low rainfall forestry. This is occurring through initiatives under the <inline font-style="italic">Joint Venture Agroforestry Program </inline>supported by the <inline font-style="italic">Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation</inline> and through the AGO's <inline font-style="italic">Renewable Energy Commercialisation Program</inline>.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Greenhouse Challenge</inline></para><para>The Government rejects the criticisms of the Greenhouse Challenge program made in the ECITA report. The Greenhouse Challenge is recognised as an international role model for the inclusion of business in greenhouse abatement.</para><para>The success of the Greenhouse Challenge in engaging business leaders and stimulating cost-effective greenhouse gas emission reductions across a wide range of industry sectors demonstrates the value of this joint industry-government initiative as an important component of the Government's suite of voluntary and mandatory greenhouse gas abatement measures. Membership of the Greenhouse Challenge is continuing to grow and the program is extending its reach across industry sectors, including in the agricultural sector.</para><para>In addition to significant abatement achievements, the Greenhouse Challenge has delivered many other tangible benefits. Through participation in the Challenge, industry and government are building valuable expertise in identifying, monitoring, managing and reporting emissions. As a result, the Challenge is not only assisting industries to improve their efficiency and competitiveness, but is also preparing them for a carbon constrained future and improving their capacity to cope with possible future developments, including emissions trading.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Scientific Research</inline></para><para>The Government rejects the ECITA Report's finding that the Government has provided inadequate funding and focus to researching the impact of climate change on Australia, the potential cost of inaction, and adaptation to climate change.</para><para>The Government recognises the importance of greenhouse science in underpinning national and international policies on climate change.

Under this, a non-compliant Party would have to formulate a âcompliance action planâ which would set out how it proposed to restore its excess emissions, for example by undertaking additional mitigation projects or acquiring permits under international emissions trading.

Under the operating cost method, the taxable value of the benefit is based on the cost of owning and operating the car, reduced by the portion which relates to the business use of the vehicle. Employers are required to substantiate the business use of the vehicle by maintaining a logbook for a specified period.</para><para>The more widely used statutory method (to which this recommendation relates) is designed to provide employers with a low compliance cost alternative to the operating cost method, eliminating the need to maintain a vehicle log book. While the statutory method does not explicitly distinguish between business and private use of a vehicle, because a significant proportion of cars provided as fringe benefits will have some business use, the statutory formula effectively incorporates a business use element into the valuation of the benefit. This implicit business use element varies with the annual distance travelled by the vehicle. </para><para>Removing or reducing the implicit business use element in the statutory formula would disadvantage those employers whose cars are used for predominantly business purposes and who wish to avail themselves of a low compliance cost valuation method. This may force these employers to change to the operating cost method of valuing car fringe benefits, with a resultant increase in fringe benefits tax (FBT) compliance costs. </para><para>The FBT treatment of car fringe benefits was one of the issues considered by the 1999 Ralph Review of Business Taxation.

This basic principle is reflected in the FBT treatment of car fringe benefits, whereby a fringe benefit arises when a car is made available for an employee's private useâfor example, for travel between home and work. </para><para>Applying FBT to benefits associated with employee commuting expenses ensures that there is equitable treatment between those employees who are provided with such benefits by their employer and those who are required to meet their commuting expenses from their own after-tax income. Allowing FBT concessions for commuting expenses would be inconsistent with this basic equity principle. However, where employees are provided with a public transport commuter pass which is used in part for business travel, the current FBT arrangements allow a reduction in the taxable value of the benefit in proportion to that business use.</para><para>As noted in the response to Recommendation 47, Commonwealth and State Transport Ministers have sought further research into and assessment of the potential for tax and other economic instruments to influence transport demand and environmental impacts.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 49</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that public transport fares be considered for exemption from (or zero rated for) GST.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>The Government does not support this recommendation. </para><para>The Government's intention in introducing the GST is to apply the tax to as broad a base as possible rather than providing a range of exemptions for certain goods and services.

It actively promotes and invests in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Government and industry jointly fund the programs. Some programs that promote and invest in energy efficiency and renewables are the GGAP, REEF, RECP, RRPGP and PVRP.</para><para>Through the NGS, State and Territory governments are working with electricity retailers on cooperative programs to reduce greenhouse emissions.</para><para>The Government is already providing $13 million over five years for the CCPTM Australia Programâthe largest single contribution to this global campaign by any government in the world to date. In participating in the CCPTM Program, Australian councils commit to progress through five milestones to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. This includes addressing corporate emissions resulting from street lights through improved energy efficiency.</para><para>The AGO is also currently working with the Electricity Supply Association of Australia to identify the potential for improved energy efficiency in street lighting on major traffic routes. In addition, the AGO is surveying councils to assess their education and training requirements in relation to maximising the uptake of energy efficient street lighting.</para><para>The Government considers that there is in-principle merit in examining funding requirements for the transport sector in an integrated way which assesses the merit of each mode to provide improved access while also considering the environmental, social and economic impacts.</para><para>The Government recognises the advantages of an outcome-oriented process that allows flexibility and the comparison of a wide range of options, with appropriate assessment and open consultation. However, the Government does not consider that this approach is best achieved by a common Transport Fund. See Australian Democrats Recommendation 7 for further details.</para><para>The Government recognises that renewable energy offers opportunities to reduce the use of diesel for electricity generation in those areas not serviced by a main electricity grid. The $264 million RRPGP provides support for the installation of renewable generation technologies in remote areas of Australia. States and Territories will be allocated funding on the basis of the relevant diesel fuel excise paid in that State or Territory by public electricity generators. The funds will be used to provide a rebate for the installation of renewable remote area power supplies. Potentially eligible installations are those where renewable energy replaces diesel for all or part of the energy source for off-grid electricity generation. </para><para>State and Territory input was sought in respect of this recommendation. The three substantive responses received generally support the Government's position. States and Territories that did not provide a specific response generally expressed the view that the recommendation would be taken into account in future policy development. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bob Brown Recommendation 6</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">Reinstate the National Energy Research and Development Corporation with a budget of at least $30 million pa to fund research into sustainable energy and energy efficiency.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>The Government does not support this recommendation.</para><para>The Government is actively engaged in this area and has committed substantial resources to R&amp;D and, particularly, the commercialisation of technology in support of its energy efficiency, renewable energy and greenhouse objectives.

The Government recognises the importance of these issues however, and is implementing a number of initiatives that address the issues raised in this recommendation.</para><para>Queensland has primary responsibility for land management in that state, including for its own land clearing regime. However, the Government recognises the important implications of current Queensland land clearing rates, in particular that Queensland's current land clearing regime does not provide an acceptable greenhouse outcome. The Government considers wide community acceptance, particularly by farmers and landholders, as essential if vegetation management is to be effective and if sustainable land management is to be achieved.</para><para>The Prime Minister has made it clear to the Premier of Queensland that the Government is prepared to consider funding assistance in relation to land clearing restrictions on a basis that meets the Government's greenhouse objectives. He has also agreed to discussions on this issue between Commonwealth and Queensland government officials. The Government is also continuing to have discussions with senior Queensland farming representatives, with a view to achieving a mutually acceptable outcome.</para><para>Similarly, Tasmania is primarily responsible for these issues in that State. The Government is actively engaged in enhancing native vegetation management in Tasmania through the Natural Heritage Trust. The national goal of the Trust's <inline font-style="italic">Bushcare</inline> program is to reverse the long-term decline in the quality and extent of Australia's native vegetation cover. In signing the Natural Heritage Trust Partnership Agreement, Tasmania agreed to contribute to achieving the stated national outcome of putting âEffective measures in place to retain and manage native vegetation, including controls on clearing.â (Partnership Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and Tasmania, 7 October 1997). </para><para>The National Framework for the Management and Monitoring of Australia's Native Vegetation, an initiative of ANZECC, also provides a mechanism to implement the Natural Heritage Trust goal. Tasmania's Interim Work Plan for the ANZECC vegetation framework commits the Tasmanian Government to âpursue options and recommendations for implementation of vegetation clearance controlsâ.</para><para>The RFAs between the Commonwealth and the States recognise the special value of old growth, and have made considerable advances in the identification and protection of old growth forests throughout Tasmania. As part of the Comprehensive Regional Assessments (CRA), old growth was mapped in each of the RFA regions. As a result of this assessment we have a thorough knowledge of the extent and distribution of old growth in forestry regions in Australia. This information, along with other assessments undertaken as part of the CRAs, has provided a solid information base for land use decisions in the RFA and has resulted in a Comprehensive, Adequate and Representative (CAR) reserve system. </para><para>The CAR reserve system now includes over 2.8 million hectares of old-growth forest, with over 840,000 hectares added to the reserve system as a result of the RFA. Nationally, this represents more than 65 per cent of all old-growth present in the RFA regions. The Government is investing around $30 million in the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement Private CAR Reserve Program to protect high conservation values on private lands. Eighty-six per cent of Tasmania's old-growth forest on public land is now protected in reserves, or through restrictions on logging. </para><para>Of the 31,000 hectares of public forest in the Styx Valleyâthe âland of the giantsâ, some 8,500 hectares or 27 per cent is in National Parks. A further 3,050 hectares, or 10 per cent, is set aside for conservation and protection purposes as a result of the RFA, signed by Commonwealth and the State in November 1997. Forestry Tasmania has recently given a public assurance that no trees over 85 metres tall will be logged.</para><para>In recent years the wood production industry has relied less on old-growth forests and drawn increasingly on regrowth native forests and plantations. The Commonwealth and State governments' agreed approach to conserving and managing old-growth forests will help this transition to continue.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bob Brown Recommendation 8</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">Negotiate at the Sixth Conference of Parties (COP6) (November 2000) for international accounting rules that -</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-style="italic">Are consistent with the goals of the convention on Biological Diversity, the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, The Regional Seas Convention, and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification;</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-style="italic">Allow carbon credits to be created only when the carbon stock on any given parcel of land is greater than it was in 1990;</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-style="italic">Include logging of native forests and clearing of native forests for plantations within the definition of `deforestation';</inline></para><para>Â·	<inline font-style="italic">Are `symmetrical' with respect to the inclusion of new activities - that is additional sinks can only be counted if additional sources are included too.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>The Government considers that this recommendation is currently being addressed in the context of policy development.</para><para>The Government supports Parties taking into account the potential synergies between the implementation of the Protocol and actions to meet the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention to Combat Desertification, the Convention on Wetlands and Agenda 21. </para><para>Consistent with key provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, Australia is only interested in receiving credits for sinks that are the result of human action and are real, measurable and verifiable. To achieve this outcome, Australia is therefore investing considerable effort and resources to develop the NCAS that will provide world class measurement of land based emissions and sinks.</para><para>The definition of deforestation before the negotiations (and which has a high degree of acceptance) requires that the deforestation activity be the product of direct human action, involve the conversion of forest land to non-forest land and have occurred since 1 January 1990. While the commercial forestry practices of clear-cut harvesting where it is followed by replanting, thinning or selective logging are unlikely to be regarded as deforestation events under this definition, neither will the replacement of native forests by plantations be eligible for credit as reforestation.  </para><para>Article 3.4 of the Protocol provides for additional human-induced activities within the agricultural soils and land-use change and forestry categories to be included in the set of activities accounted for in achieving Kyoto Protocol targets. These additional activities may be either sources of emissions or sinks and each will be considered on its merits by the Conference of Parties. However, there is no requirement under the Protocol that only allows additional sinks to be counted if additional sources are also included and the Government does not support such a position.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bob Brown Recommendation 9</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">Negotiate at COP6 for the contribution of sinks to be capped under any international emissions trading system.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>The Government does not support this recommendation.</para><para>The Government considers that sinks are a valid tool to complement other measures to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions such as reduced energy consumption. Articles 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol implicitly acknowledge that sinks activities are an environmentally effective response to global warming. At present, eligible sinks activities under the Kyoto Protocol are restricted to direct human induced afforestation, reforestation and deforestation that has occurred since 1990 under Article 3.3. This substantially limits the availability of sinks credits. </para><para>Article 3.4 provides for further negotiation on including additional agricultural soils, land use change and forestry activities. At COP 6 in The Hague, the United States, Canada and Japan proposed including a range of broadly defined additional activities which could make a significant contribution towards their greenhouse abatement task. If the Conference of the Parties decides to include these broad additional activities, it is likely to consider placing a limit on the credits that they may generate in the first commitment period. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bob Brown Recommendation 10</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">That Basslink should not proceed.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>The Government does not support this recommendation.

The Government response to this aspect of the Report is at Part A.</para><para>Â·	allegations relating to disclosure practices such as the issue of bank statements to customers in default on their loan obligations.  Part B contains the Government's response to the PJSC's findings on this matter.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">PART A:  TAXATION CONCERNS</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusions and Recommendations</inline></para><para>1.41	The PJSC does not find that with regard to the instances before it and with regard to the material provided to it, either through written submissions or oral evidence, that a wrongful use of shadow ledgers occurred or that the failure to provide bank statements could have constituted unlawful behaviour.</para><para>1.42	The Committee notes that the Australian Tax Office covers the accounting practice of operating shadow ledgers in its TR 94/32.  This tax ruling allows that when banks classify a loan as non accrual that any interest accruing thereafter will not be derived for income tax purposes until it is received.  The Committee concludes that it is unlikely that a case could be made that the use of shadow ledgers by banks are not a proper accounting function.</para><para>1.43	The Committee notes the bank's advice that independent auditors Ernst &amp; Young had specifically reviewed the shadow ledger accounts and confirmed that the activity on those accounts is in accordance with accounting and taxation requirements.</para><para>1.44	While the Committee is satisfied with the findings of Ernst &amp; Young, to ensure that any outstanding public concern is addressed about the administrative errors admitted by the bank in relation to Tratzea's accounts, the Committee asks the CBA to confirm the taxation treatment of monies in respect to Tratzea were correct.</para><para>The Government believes that financial institutions should deal with their customers in an open and transparent manner.  It considers effective communication to be a key component of good banking practice.  It is central to the maintenance of good customer relations, particularly where a customer is experiencing financial difficulties, and requires both parties to exchange relevant information.  While appreciative that, for commercial reasons, financial institutions may not wish to reveal some aspects of their accounting and taxation affairs, it would nevertheless appear to be in their best interests to take all steps necessary for the effective resolution of customer concerns.</para><para>Initiatives arising from the Committee's inquiry are considered to be a beneficial step towards resolving customer concerns about internal accounting practices relating to their debts.  However, the Government considers it regrettable that these concerns were permitted to arise and believes that they could have been avoided or resolved through more effective communication between financial institutions and their customers. </para><para>The Government and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) take very seriously all issues relating to compliance with the taxation laws.  The ATO does, and will continue to, take steps to ensure that taxpayers comply with the taxation laws.</para><para>To assist taxpayers in complying with those laws the ATO issues public rulings advising of the Commissioner's view on the application of those laws to particular circumstances.  The Commissioner's views as to the taxation treatment of bad debts and non accrual loans has been publicly documented in Taxation Rulings TR 92/18 and TR 94/32 respectively.</para><para>The Government has been advised by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) that it has investigated a number of complaints and while all investigations are not complete it is clear that proceedings cannot be instituted for breaches of the Trade Practices Act in every case.  The ACCC has noted that the Commonwealth Bank has initiated a mediation process to deal with complaints and the ACCC is hopeful that process will deal with the individual complaints more thoroughly than any litigation it might initiate.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">PART B:  DISCLOSURE CONCERNS</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusions and Recommendations</inline></para><para>1.45	The Committee concludes that the Commonwealth Bank by not automatically issuing account statements to some customers who were in default on their loan obligations exacerbated an already difficult situation for the customers, making it difficult for them to budget, re-finance loans and submit taxation returns.</para><para>1.46	The Committee believes that the Commonwealth Bank's explanation that they did not provide bank statements to customers because they did not wish to `inflame a dispute' is poor banking practice.  Evidence presented to the Committee also demonstrated that the confusion customers faced about the bank's practices in respect to `shadow ledgers' was unreasonable.</para><para>1.47	The PJSC therefore concludes that the management practices of the Commonwealth Bank in relation to non-provision of statements albeit to a small number of customers who had fallen behind with repayments, were seriously flawed in terms of best practice customer relations.</para><para>1.48	The Committee acknowledges the efforts that witnesses to the inquiry such as Mr Bruce Ford have made in order to have their issues properly considered.  The Committee notes that the need to hold an inquiry into `shadow ledger accounts' represents a failure of the Commonwealth Bank to resolve some customer relation disputes internally.</para><para>1.53	The PJSC also notes that members of the Committee believe that on the evidence presented it is not possible to determine how many Commonwealth Bank customers have been affected by the bank's decision not to issue bank statements when loans are in default.  The PJSC recommends that mediation services be offered by the CBA to affected customers where appropriate.</para><para>Labor and Democrat members believe that the Commonwealth Bank should appoint an independent mediator to resolve any outstanding disputes.  Labor and Democrat members also believe that the appointment of the mediator should be advertised in the national press and the Commonwealth Bank asked to report back on progress in resolving disputes.</para><para>1.54	The PJSC recommends that all banks if they do not do so already, clearly inform customers about the procedures and processes which result in the case of troubled loans.</para><para>Adequate disclosure places customers in a position to make informed and timely decisions about the organisation of their financial affairs.  Effective disclosure is also an important foundation for building good relations between financial institutions and their customers.  Good disclosure practices clarify the nature and extent of each party's rights and obligations and in so doing help to foster a mutually beneficial customer/bank relationship.</para><para>The Government therefore considers it poor banking practice for a financial institution to withhold from its customers relevant and timely information about their financial obligations.  This is so irrespective of the fact that only a small number of customers may be affected by such practices.</para><para>The consequences of inadequate or inaccurate disclosure include customer confusion about banking procedures and a breakdown in the relationship between financial institution and customer.  Appropriate disclosure is likely to assist in the process of resolving concerns and any confusion that may have arisen between financial institutions and their customers.  </para><para>It is therefore reasonable to expect that financial institutions would endeavour to provide all necessary financial information to their customers.  Where disputes do arise, it is important for financial institutions to advise their customers about the dispute resolution avenues available to them and the processes involved.</para><para>The Government encourages financial institutions to review regularly any internal practices that have a potential to impact adversely on customer relations, including their internal dispute resolution processes.  The Government expects such reviews would aim to ensure the continued effectiveness of these processes and to address those measures necessary to resolve reasonable customer concerns.</para><para>1.49	The PJSC recognises that the commitment by the Commonwealth Bank to provide full statements to customers in default is a step forward.  However, the Committee is disappointed that this commitment did not eventuate until this Parliamentary Inquiry was initiated.</para><para>1.50	While the Committee has investigated the practice of the Commonwealth Bank in respect to the treatment of bad debts and the creation of shadow ledger accounts it is evident that this practice is not limited to the Commonwealth Bank.  Indeed in its evidence to the Committee the Commonwealth Bank stated that its practices are `industry standards'.  If this is indeed the case then it is appropriate that all banks commit to providing statements to customers who are in default on their loans when requested by the customer.</para><para>1.51	The PJSC believes that all financial institutions which do not already do so should adopt the announced intention of the Commonwealth Bank to provide full statements to all customers.  Therefore the PJSC recommends that the automatic issuing of statements of account in all circumstances short of litigation be considered for inclusion in the banking code of practice.</para><para>1.52	The PJSC believes that the statement should set out the total amount which the Bank believes that the customer owes in respect of the account in accordance with the terms and conditions on the account and should not reflect any write downs which the bank has made for internal accounting or taxation purposes.  The Committee will refer the matter to the relevant parties undertaking the review of the banking code of practice. </para><para>The Government would expect that financial institutions will review their banking practices in relation to troubled loans to ensure that their customers receive appropriate and timely information about their financial obligations.  It encourages and supports this process.</para><para>In view of the central importance of adequate disclosure, the Government is pleased to note that the Commonwealth Bank has introduced, from 1 January 2001, new arrangements for the provision of full statements to customers in default on their loan obligations.</para><para>It notes that the current review of the Code of Banking Practice provides an appropriate forum for the banking industry as a whole to consider these matters.  As part of the review, an issues paper canvassing possible changes to the Code was released on 5 March for public consultation.  Presently, the Code includes some matters related to the provision of statements to customers.  As the Code describes standards of good banking practice and is intended to promote the disclosure of information to customers, the review provides a timely opportunity for the banking industry to re-evaluate existing industry practices and to consider embedding any reforms in a revised Code.</para><para>The Government also welcomes initiatives taken by the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman in December 2000, examining principles for good banking practice in this area.  It views this as a positive step and encourages all financial institutions to adopt those banking practices necessary to deliver high standards of customer service.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>26575</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>31st Conference of Presiding Officers and Clerks, Norfolk Island</title><page.no>26575</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âI present the report of the 31st Conference of Presiding Officers and Clerks which was held in Norfolk Island between 31 July and 4 August 2000, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of the conference.</para></talk.start></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>26575</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Works Committee</title><page.no>26575</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>26575</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>26575</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present report No. 8 of 2001, entitled Lavarack Barracks Redevelopment Stage 3, Townsville.

This is our Review of Auditor-General's Reports for the fourth quarter of 1999-2000.</para><para>Madam President, the Committee held a public hearing on 3 November 2000 to discuss these ANAO Reports with the relevant Commonwealth agencies.  I will briefly discuss issues in each of the selected reports in turn.</para><para>Audit Report No. 40 examined the Tactical Fighter Operations.  The Committee reviewed the administration of Tactical Fighter Operations (TFOs) by the Royal Australian Air Force (Air Force).  The JCPAA focused its examination on air superiority and regional capabilities, and management of the fast-jet pilot workforce.  Air superiority, which encompasses tactical fighter operations, airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C), and air-to-air refuelling (AAR) is critical to the defence of Australia.</para><para>The JCPAA supports initiatives outlined in the 2000 Defence White Paper to acquire AEW&amp;C and enhance Air Force's AAR capability.</para><para>The management of the fast-jet pilot workforce comprising recruitment, training and retention is a major issue for the Royal Australian Air Force, and ultimately Australia's defence.  It is unacceptable that there are insufficient numbers of fast-jet pilots.  In a crisis situation, Australia's ability to sustain extended air combat could be under serious pressure.  The ANAO should conduct a follow-up audit to assess how Air Force is addressing this issue.</para><para>In the second report selected, the Committee reviewed the audit on the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Services.  It examined effectiveness and probity of the policy development processes and implementations involved in improving access to the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Services.</para><para>The audit concluded that there were areas for improvement by the Department of Health and Aged Care in its policy development, risk management and in its management of negotiations with representatives of the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists.  The number of machines for which eligibility for MBS rebates was sought greatly exceeded expectations.  The desired distribution of machines was still not fully realised.  Expenditure for MRI services also exceeded anticipated amounts.</para><para>Chief among the ANAO findings was a lack of adequate documentation by departmental officials.  The Committee also found it disturbing that DHAC was so lacking in rigour in its probity arrangements, given the professional interests involved.  The department's open-ended approach to risk management was deficient, especially in its handling of conflicts of interest and its acceptance of statutory declarations at face value as proof of date of order and installation.  Until the cut-off date of 10 February 1998 came into effect on 1 November 1999, almost $46 million had been paid in medical rebates, some to machines subsequently deemed ineligible.</para><para>The Committee recommended that the department improve its practices in contract management and urged departmental officers to base its guidelines on the ANAO Better Practice Guide on Contract Management (2001).  In addition, the Committee has noted that the department has made an effort to improve its record keeping, its risk analysis and risk management.  The Committee, however, would have more confidence in improved future performance by DHAC if DHAC frankly recognised and addressed these major flaws.</para><para>Madam President, the Committee debated long and hard on the probity issues raised by the MRI audit and repeatedly sought information from DHAC as it sought to come to grips with why arrangements went horribly wrong.  The JCPAA finally concluded that not only did DHAC lack clear guidelines to assist its staff but it took an ad hoc approach to risk management.</para><para>DHAC's original risk management strategy failed.  All MRI scanners assessed as eligible for benefits, received them.  Once paid, these benefits could not be recovered, even though the machines were ineligible because of the cut-off date.  The large number of machines on order exceeded that anticipated by DHAC.  The Minister was not kept informed as he should have been.  ANAO stated in its report that it was the Minister who insisted that something be done as soon as he found out that new machines were still being registered.</para><para>I am proud to tell the House, Madam President, that the Committee did not split on party lines during the arduous debates on some of the sensitive issues which it considered.  We worked hard to get a consensus and succeeded admirably in focusing on how this report on MRI policy development and implementation can assist the DHAC and the HIC to improve their accountability and their risk management strategies.  I believe that officers in DHAC have noted the lessons learnt and will ensure there will be full and accurate record keeping, especially of negotiations and meetings, from now on.</para><para>I now turn to the final ANAO report the Committee reviewed in this quarterâHigh Wealth Individuals Taskforce. </para><para>Audit Report No. 46 on the Tax Office's High Wealth Individuals Taskforce considered the management and operations of the taskforce and assessed its performance against the outcomes specified by the Government.  The audit report concluded that the management and operations of the taskforce was effective and that the taskforce was achieving the revenue targets set by the government.</para><para>The audit report also found that the taskforce had contributed to the development of administrative and legislative proposals to address undesirable tax minimisation practices.</para><para>In its review of the High Wealth Individuals Taskforce, the Committee took evidence on taskforce resourcing, litigation and settlement procedures, the revenue raised by taskforce activities, taskforce involvement in addressing tax minimisation techniques and taskforce reporting of outcomes.</para><para>The Committee supports the work of the taskforce and sought to assure itself that adequate resourcing would continue to be available to the Tax Office to fund the work of the taskforce.  The Tax Office has indicated to the Committee that it has made a decision to continue with the taskforce approach of looking at high wealth individuals.</para><para>The Committee endorses the Tax Office's allocation of resources based on a properly planned risk management approach.</para><para>The High Wealth Individuals Task Force established a Compliance Management Strategy to address its responsibilities.  One of the elements of this strategy is litigation and prosecution.</para><para>The audit report found that the taskforce conducted settlement processes in accordance with the ATO's Code of Settlement Practice. The report also found that settlement processes had been conducted with a view both to protection of revenue and to fairness to the High Wealth Individual taxpayer concerned.</para><para>The Committee notes that the Tax Office has a fairly rigorous process in place to guide settlements.</para><para>The Committee was interested in the issue of revenue targets for the taskforce.</para><para>Based on analysis of a sample of taxpayers and their related entities, a figure of $800 million per year was derived by the Tax Office as on order of magnitude estimate of revenue potentially at risk from aggressive tax planning and minimisation arrangements used by some High Wealth Individuals.</para><para>The Government's required revenue targets for the taskforce were $100 million in each year from 1997-98 to 1999-2000. The ANAO concluded that the taskforce had achieved its revenue targets for the first two years. The Committee ascertained that the Tax Office had also met its revenue targets in 1999-2000.</para><para>In relation to taskforce involvement in addressing tax minimisation techniques, the Tax Office confirmed that there had been a very substantial volume of advice from the taskforce to government, which had suggested areas for systemic policy reform.</para><para>The audit report concluded that while there had been some public release of information on the taskforce's activities, the external reporting of the taskforce's performance could have been more comprehensive.</para><para>The major reporting of the results of its work on High Wealth Individuals is in the Tax Office's Annual Report.  The Tax Office also indicated that it had issued a number of press releases over the period of the taskforce's existence.</para><para>The Committee considers that publishing the results of and issues involved in the taskforce's operations are important for community education and compliance and that more attention should be given to this area.  The Committee recommends that the Tax Office make further efforts to promote greater public awareness of the taskforce's activities and achievements by disseminating more widely the information contained in the Commissioner's annual report.</para><para>May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking on behalf of the Committee the witnesses who contributed their time and expertise to the Committee's review process.</para><para>I am also indebted to my colleagues on the Committee who have dedicated their time and effort to reviewing these Auditor-General's reports.  As well, I would like to thank the members of the secretariat who were involved in the inquiries.</para><para>Madam President, I commend Report 382 to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report No. 384</title><page.no>26578</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>26578</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of Senator Gibson and of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the following report of the committee: <inline font-style="italic">Report No. 384: Review of Coastwatch</inline>.

During this time the Committee participated in two off-shore patrols and saw at first hand how Coastwatch conducts patrols, detects and investigates surface contacts, and coordinates the interception of vessels carrying suspected illegal immigrants. </para><para>The Committee saw a well integrated organisation, effectively using the resources at its disposal, and staffed by personnel dedicated to protecting Australia's borders. </para><para>However, the Committee considers Coastwatch's role could be better defined and has recommended that there be a clear statement from the Government, in the form of a publicly released charter, setting out what the Government regards as its expectations for Coastwatch. Such a charter would serve to inform the public of Coastwatch's intended role.</para><para>Madam President, we are all aware of the recent upsurge of boat people arriving off the north west of Australia and at Christmas Island. It is important to state what Coastwatch's role is in this regard. Its role is to detect, and coordinate the interception of those boat people and, if they choose to enter Australia's territorial waters ( ie cross the 12 mile line), bring them safely to land. It's role Madam President is notâas some would have us believeâstopping those people, of intercepting them, refuelling their boats, and telling them to go away!  </para><para>Coastwatch also plays an essential role in detecting illegal activities such as illegal fishing and is integral to anti drug operations undertaking surveillance on behalf of its clients, Customs and the AFP.</para><para>The Committee feels that Coastwatch's role is poorly understood by the public and has recommended that there should be a comprehensive campaign to inform the public of Coastwatch's role in protecting Australia's borders.</para><para>The Committee has looked at Coastwatch's performance measures and agrees with the Auditor-General that these could be improved. The Committee has developed this further and the report contains performance measures which could be used as a basis for a balanced scorecard by which Coastwatch's performance could be measured. The Committee is also critical of the information about Coastwatch provided to Parliament by Customs at Budget time, for Additional Estimates and in the Customs annual report. The output price information provided is unclear and appears in part to result from a misalignment of the Customs output structure with its program structure. While such a mismatch may improve flexibility for Customs, a consequence is poor pre and post-expenditure accountability to Parliament.</para><para>There has been speculation that Coastwatch, as a program within Customs, may be too close to Customs to the detriment of services provided to other Coastwatch clients. The evidence provided by Coastwatch's clients, however, has not supported this view. From this and other evidence, the Committee concludes that the relationship between Coastwatch and its clients is sound. This is no doubt assisted by the recent practice of seconding a serving uniformed Australian Defence Force officer to be the Director General of Coastwatch. The Committee has recommended that this practice continue.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The challenges faced by Coastwatch are being met effectively</inline></para><para>Madam President, The challenges faced by Coastwatch are wide ranging and demanding. The Committee has discussed the challenges of the unauthorised arrival of suspected illegal immigrants, illegal fishing, the movement of people across the Torres Strait, and the issue of unauthorised air movements in northern Australia.</para><para>In discussing the arrival of boat people the Committee draws a distinction between those arriving to the north and north west who arrive openly and those that have attempted to enter covertly along the east coast. The Committee believes that Coastwatch is performing well in detecting and coordinating the interception of illegal entry vessels in northern and north-western waters. Simply providing additional resources to Coastwatch or creating a coastguard will not stem the tide. The solution is to prevent people illegally setting out for Australia. To this end, the Committee is satisfied that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is making every effort to enter into agreements with Australia's neighbours to thwart the people smugglers.</para><para>Regarding illegal fishing, the Committee considers that in northern and north-western waters Coastwatch's performance is limited by its ability to intercept the vessels it has detected. In contrast, in the Southern Ocean the limiting factor is one of actually detecting illegal fishers. The Committee has recommended that: </para><para>Â·	there should be a review of options for increasing Australia's ability to respond to illegal fishing in northern waters, with consideration of increasing response capability if warranted; and</para><para>Â·	Defence should investigate the cost of acquiring and outfitting a Southern Ocean patrol vessel, and investigate the feasibility of mounting joint patrols of the Southern Ocean with other countries with an interest in the region.</para><para>In his audit the Auditor-General raised the issue of unauthorised air movements (UAMs). The Committee believes that UAMs do not currently pose a threat, but nevertheless Australia must plan to meet this threat should it eventuate. The Committee's recommendations include:</para><para>Â·	the continued analysis of potential threats and the development of response strategies;</para><para>Â·	there should be contingency plans for siting sensors in the Torres Strait and Cape York to meet any identified threat;</para><para>Â·	links and protocols should be developed with Australia's northern neighbours to enable investigation of suspicious aircraft leaving Australian airspace; and</para><para>Â·	a contingency plan should be prepared for recommending to Government the mandatory use of transponders on non-commercial aircraft if there is a demonstrated problem of unauthorised air movements.</para><para>A concern of the Auditor-General was that it was unclear which agency should take primary responsibility for the UAM issue. The Committee has reviewed the matter and concludes it is Customs which should be responsible. However, because UAMs potentially pose a threat of national significance, Defence should be intimately involved in the contingency planning recommended by the Committee. Allowing Customs to assume responsibility and Defence to respond to UAM incursions may require amendments to legislation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">There is no need for an Australian Coastguard</inline></para><para>Madam President, there is no need for an Australian Coastguard. </para><para>The Committee has received evidence proposing several models for a new coastwatch organisation. The models range from: merging Coastwatch with Australian Search and Rescue; Defence to assume the coastwatch role; to the creation of a separate paramilitary coastguard. </para><para>The Committee has taken considerable evidence on this issue and has analysed the issues by asking: </para><para>Â·	does the proposal provide for better use of scarce resources; and </para><para>Â·	will the proposal result in improved performance?</para><para>The Committee included the current Coastwatch in its considerationâto see how it matches up against these criteria.</para><para>There appears little overlap between AusSAR and Coastwatch. As it happens Coastwatch aircraft fly very few hours on behalf of AusSAR because their operations are largely in different areas. It is highly unlikely that savings could be achieved by combining their flying operations or even their operational centres. This is because a single centre would be unable to simultaneously undertake a search and rescue operation and a surveillance and tactical response operation. It could be argued that a combined operation would have better access to sources of information such as ship movements. But this might come at the cost of poorer information from other sources such as Customs and classified information from Defence.</para><para>Madam President, there have been arguments that Defence should take over Coastwatch. The report draws attention to fundamental differences between a defence role and a policing role such as Coastwatch. One such difference is that defence officers are trained to fight and destroy Australia's enemies, whereas a policing role involves the minimum use of force.  </para><para>Although Defence could use the marine assets as a valuable training ground for the navy, there is a risk if Defence took over Coastwatch, of Defence becoming distracted from its prime objective of being prepared to defend Australia in times of conflict.</para><para>In analysing the call for a paramilitary coastguard it is tempting to base an argument solely on the comparative costs of the US Coastguard. The Committee has not done this. </para><para>Creating a coastguard would lead to duplication of marine assets. If the RAN patrol boats and Customs vessels were moved to form the nucleus of a coastguard, the navy would still need patrol boats, and Customs would still need a maritime arm. Customs told the Committee that 30% of the operational time of its 8 Bay Class Vessels would not be spent on Coastwatch operations. Putting the Bay Class Vessels into a coastguard would mean that Customs would need at least 2 new vessels.</para><para>As well, there would be competition for personnel. Despite the results of the new Defence Force recruitment drive, a coastguard is likely to deplete the Defence Force and the coastguard itself may be understaffed.</para><para>And would the new organisation perform better? </para><para>Well, it might not have the good access to Defence intelligence Coastwatch presently has, and enjoy the good relations with, and intelligence from, Customs and Immigration. To quote from evidence provided from an AFP witness about the UK experience:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">... from a law enforcement perspective they would give their right arm to have arrangements similar to those which exist in Australia because [in the UK] there is competition for intelligence and for investigative supremacy ... that is absolutely counterproductive.</inline></para><para>But, Madam President, we must ask, `Does the current Coastwatch stack up against the criteria the Committee has used?' </para><para>Coastwatch is a coordinating agency. There is no duplication of assets because Coastwatch does not own them. Through its memoranda of understanding it has ready access to the resources it needs. Because the assets used by Coastwatch belong to others, the risks associated with those assets are borne by others. Risks such as maintenance, repair and replacement. And when those assets, such as Customs vessels or RAN patrol boats, are not used by Coastwatch they can be deployed elsewhere. </para><para>A major advantage of contracting-in the assets Coastwatch needs is that if circumstances change, if the suite of platforms and sensors have to be changed to meet a new threat, Coastwatch can renegotiate its relationship with its asset providers. Coastwatch will not be saddled with outmoded equipment, but will instead be a body able to quickly adapt to new threats and to take advantage of new and developing technology.</para><para>The Committee is of the view that the current Coastwatch is in effect an `outsourced coastguard'. The core business of coordination has been retained and the provision of services is provided by other entities both private and public sector. Australia has been able to achieve this position without the cost and pain of creating then dismantling a large and cumbersome coastguard.</para><para>In conclusion, Madam President, I would like to express the Committee's appreciation to those people who contributed to the inquiry by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings.</para><para>I wish to also thank the members of the Sectional Committee for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry. I also thank the secretariat staff who were involved: â the secretary to the Committee, Dr Margot Kerley; inquiry secretary, Dr John Carter; research officer, Ms Rebecca Perkin and administrative officer Ms Maria Pappas.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the Report to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>26581</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

The profit confirms that the four major banks are on track to record annual profits of over $10 billion this financial year. Banking continues to be the most profitable industry in the country. Banking is a critical industry to the Australian economy. It is important that banks do make profits so that we have a safe and sound financial system. But there is no doubt that the level of profitability of Australia's banks is excessive. Banking is an essential service. To survive in our society you must have a bank account. Whether you are an employee, a social security recipient or even a self-funded retiree, you need a bank account to receive your wages, social security benefits or even dividends. The profits that banks make must therefore be weighed against the needs of customers. </para><para>In the last five years, under the Howard government, the balance has tipped firmly in favour of the banks. Let us just look at a few statistics. When John Howard was first elected in 1996, the four major banks made profits of $5.4 billion. These profit figures have steadily increased each year. In 1997, the major banks earned $5.8 billion. This increased to $6.2 billion in 1998, $7.1 billion in 1999 and a staggering $9.4 billion in the year 2000. How have banks achieved these massive fee increases? It has been in three ways: by closing bank branches, increasing bank fees and reducing services. Since 1996, 1,505 bank branches have closed. In the last year alone banks closed 350 bank branches. In its annual report released yesterday, the Commonwealth Bank reported that during the last 12 months it has reduced the number of branches from 1,141 to 1,066, a reduction of 375. A total of 290 of the branch closures were amalgamations between Commonwealth branches and Colonial branches.</para><para>The question that must be asked is: what has been the impact on customer queues of merging two organisations into one? Disregarding the impact of the merger, the Commonwealth Bank still closed 85 branches in the last year. This in fact means that the Commonwealth Bank has closed more branches this year than in the last three years. Excluding the impact of the Colonial merger, last year the Commonwealth Bank closed 75 branches, while the year before it closed 67 branchesâand, Senator McGauran, the people of Benalla have heard nothing from you at any stage, not a word. This demonstrates that the Commonwealth Bank has continued a consistent program of closing branches, and this program continues.</para><para>Senator McGauran, there was an opportunity on Tuesday night to come along to the auditorium to watch a movie called <inline font-style="italic">The Bank</inline>. At one stage in the movie the CEO was meeting with the board and they were congratulating him on how well he had done the year before. He had made a 16 per cent profit increase. He had closed a third of their branches and sacked 20 per cent of their work force. But this year they were targeting a disappointing, according to them, nine per cent, and the CEO made the comment, `But we have almost run out of bank branches to close and staff to sack.' That is what we are facing in this country at the moment.</para><para>Next week the Commonwealth Bank will close its Canterbury branch in the bustling shopping centre at Maling Road in Melbourne's eastern suburbs. This is despite the fact that six months ago the bank assured local traders that the branch was safe. Next month the Commonwealth Bank is to close its Croydon branch in the northern suburbs of Sydney. The bank is giving customers only a very short period of warning that their branch is to close. I do not believe that this is acceptable. With the best will of the community, there is no way in the world that they can establish alternative banking services in a few weeks, yet this is the notice that the banks are prepared to provide. That is why Labor's social charter includes a branch closure protocol of six months, which is amongst the toughest in the world.</para><para>Labor will also require banks to consult with communities before closing a branch so that they can understand the impact on a community. Banks have an interesting way of describing branch closures to their customers. I recently heard that a bank put a sign outside a closed bank branch that said, `We have changed.' What a ridiculous statement to make. But the sign was right: banks have changed. We all remember the times when the bank would come into the primary school and open bank accounts for all the children in the classroom. Remember those days, Senator McGauran? How far away is this kind of bank from the ones that we see today. How long would the 50c that used to open that bank account last with today's fees and charges? Today banks are concerned with the profits they make from their customers. Whereas your bank manager used to know your name, today all he knows is your customer profile.</para><para>To the banks, customers are either in market segments that they are trying to attract or regarded as a cost to the bottom line. Banks regard customers who are a cost to the bottom lineâand that is predominantly low income earnersâas a nuisance. If banks cannot get rid of these customers, they try to punish them by imposing unjust fees and charges. An example of this is the fees that banks charge for over-the-counter transactions. These fees have increased by as much as 400 per cent in the last five years. That is right, Senator McGauran: 400 per cent in the five years you have been in government.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âWhy are you picking on me?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âBecause you are the only one here.

It hopefully was a meaningful stride in here by Senator Boswell to take part in the debate. As I was just saying to Senator McGauran, Senator Boswell, bank fees have increased by as much as 400 per cent since you got your bums on that side of the chamber, since you got your bums into a white car. That is what has happened while you have been joy-riding around. </para></talk.start></continue><para>In the last four years the income that banks have earned increased by 75 per cent. However, there is clear evidence that it has been low income earners who have been the losers from the introduction of bank fees. The Reserve Bank's July 2001 bulletin <inline font-style="italic">Bank fees in Australia</inline> stated:</para><quote><para>Benefits are likely to have been greatest for borrowers, especially household borrowers, since they have gained significantly from lower interest margins in recent years and have also been partly insulated from higher bank fees. By contrast, customers who do not have a loan, who have a low balance, or those with a high volume of transactions will not have benefited from these trends.</para></quote><para>This is not S11 talking, this is not the national committee of the metalworkers talking; this is the Reserve Bank of Australia. In the US the cost of banking has meant that many consumers simply do not have bank accounts. According to a report by the US Federal Reserve, <inline font-style="italic">Recent changes in family finances</inline>, in 1998, 9.5 per cent of families do not have a bank account. The families who did not have accounts were disproportionately likely to have low incomes, to be renters, to be in the bottom quarter of the distribution of net worth and to be from ethnic backgrounds. There you have the picture that the Reserve Bank is pointing to, as these are the losers from current bank behaviour.</para><para>The question we have to ask is: do we want to see this kind of social exclusion in Australia? Well, Senator McGauran, Senator Campbell, Senator `Shrek', do we? I say to you: no, we don't. Labor is determined that this not happen. While the coalition has presided over the biggest increase in bank fees in modern Australian history, Labor will ensure that consumers have access to affordable banking services. We will to do this by requiring banks to offer fee-free bank accounts to all social security recipients and no-frills bank accounts to all Australiansâ something that even you, Senator McGauran, can surely support.</para><para>We will also direct the ACCC to formally monitor bank fees and charges. Despite the massive increases in bank fees over the last five years, the coalition has not been prepared to direct the ACCC to monitor fees and charges. It is that simple. You ask Allan Fels. Give him a ring, Senator McGauran, and say, `Can I just check with you, Mr Fels, whether the federal government has given you a directive to formally monitor bank fees and charges?' He is going to say, `No, Senator McGauran.'</para><para>We will also make the banks more accountable for their fees. We will do this in several ways. We will require banks to provide fee information on bank statements and to disclose bank fees at the time of transaction. Labor will also require banks to report on a range of issues. Banks will be required to submit a six-monthly social obligations statementâor a SOS, as its appropriate acronym isâto a newly established financial services advisory board. A SOS will detail each bank's compliance with the conditions included in the social charter. Social obligations statements will ensure that banks' practices are transparent. Unfortunately, at the moment the banks' fee practices are not transparent.</para><para>Yesterday, I was interested to find out how much income the Commonwealth Bank earned from transaction fees. In their annual report they state that retail transaction fees represent 12 per cent of other operating income and that this figure is the same as last year. According to the Commonwealth Bank's report, other operating income increased by 10 per cent this year. Therefore, it is obvious that the income the banks are making from retail fees increased by 10 per cent this year. There is a need for much more transparency about the income that banks are earning from fees. </para><para>I would like to make a couple of comments in respect of the Commonwealth Bank's profit announcement. The Commonwealth Bank announced that its net interest margin was 2.78 per cent, down one basis point from the previous year. The Commonwealth Bank makes an interesting comment about interest margins. In the depths of its report, if you dig around enough, you will find it states:</para><quote><para>Average deposit balances on low interest paying accounts were higher over the year than the prior year, mainly as a result of business accumulating their GST instalments.</para></quote><para>Responsible small businesses which are putting away funds to cover their GST instalments are being hit by the low, and sometimes zero, interest rates that banks pay on small business accounts. Does that seem fair to you, Senator McGauran? Struggling small businesses trying to do the right thing get slugged twiceâslugged coming and slugged going.</para><para>I briefly turn to the issue of shadow ledgers. The parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities tabled a report on the issue of shadow ledgers on 3 October 2000. I know why you guys are nervous about shadow ledgers. You have got that spiv Seyffer wandering around in the background. There we were sitting in the committee trying to get to the bottom of shadow ledgers, and what have this mob got going on? They have got that spiv Seyffer sneaking around behind the scenes trying to close the committee down, telling them that the Prime Minister wants the committee closed down, and Senator Heffernan and Tony Staley in the background digging around. The truth will eventually come out. The full truth, Senator Ian Campbell, will come out about what has gone on there, despite the efforts of Senator Heffernan and Mr Staley to go to ground.

Your ruling is entirely correct. As I said, we know why they are so sensitive on this issue, and the truth will come out, just like it is going to come out on this GST fraud that has been uncovered today. Having examined the practice of the Commonwealth Bank of not issuing bank statements to customers, the committee concluded:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The management practices of the Commonwealth Bank in relation to the non-provision of statements albeit to a small number of customers who had fallen behind with payments, were seriously flawed in terms of best practice customer relations.</para></quote><para>The committee also noted that the need to hold an inquiry into shadow ledger accounts represented a failure of the Commonwealth Bank to resolve some customer relation disputes internally and stated that it was disappointed that it took a parliamentary inquiry to receive a commitment from the bank that it would provide bank statements to customers. Following the release of the parliamentary report, the Australian Banking Ombudsman released guidelines to the banks on the practice of shadow ledgers that stated:</para><quote><para>It is best practice for a bank to:</para><para>Continue to issue statements showing interest and fees accruing, reflecting the actual liability of the customer to the bank.</para></quote><para>There is a blindingly obvious statement: `reflecting the actual liability of the customer to the bank'. It seems an extraordinary proposition that a bank can be building up fees and interest penalties and not even tell their customers. The ombudsman also stated:</para><quote><para>Even if statements may cease a bank still has an obligation under the Credit Code to provide information on request about the amount owing.</para></quote><para>This seems perfectly reasonably. In fact, it seems quite extraordinary that this was not going on in the banking industry. But I am pleased with one outcome of the shadow ledgers inquiry: that, upon request, banks should now provide statements to customers, even where they are in default on their loan. In future, customers should not have to suffer the frustration of having their requests for statements ignored.</para><para>Labor members of the joint parliamentary committee recommended that independent mediation be offered to those customers who had been affected by the refusal of banks to provide statements. I am disappointed to see that independent mediation has not been offered by the Commonwealth Bank to customers who were affected by the bank's practice of not providing bank statements. There is perhaps an attitude from the bank that, having survived the scrutiny of a parliamentary inquiry, the issue can be swept back under the carpet. Let me say that Labor still believes there is a need for independent mediation to be offered to customers who were affected by the bank's practice of not offering statements.</para><para>The government has today issued its response to the joint parliamentary committee's report on shadow ledgers. So here we are, Senator McGauran and Senator Ian Campbell, here is the government's chance to step up to the plate and have a swing. And what does the government say? It says:</para><quote><para>The Government has been advised by the ACCC that it has investigated a number of complaints and while all investigations are not complete it is clear that proceedings cannot be instituted for breaches of the Trade Practices Act in every case. The ACCC has noted that the Commonwealth Bank has initiated a mediation process to deal with complaints and the ACCC is hopeful that process will deal with the individual complaints more thoroughly than any litigation it might initiate.</para></quote><para>It is clear from the government's response that it is now washing its hands of the whole affair. Shame on you, Senators McGauran and Campbell. You had the chanceâthe government had the chance to make a difference when it comes to how banks treat their customers. What customers are being told by the government is that, after pursuing the banks for years and getting no response, they must now use the same mediation process that previously failed to address their concerns. Congratulations, Mr Hockey! This is a government in bed with the banks. It is not prepared to stand up to them. Let me repeat that Labor believes there should be independent mediation on this issue.</para><para>The whole issue of shadow ledgers demonstrates the need to improve the process of handling disputes. Labor have a plan to do this. We have indicated that we will establish a financial services ombudsman to provide a one-stop shop for consumers with complaints against financial institutions. There is a clear alternative emerging on the issue of banking between the policies of the coalition and the policies of Labor. On the one hand, we have the coalition's view of the world, which is to let banks increase fees, close branches and reduce services. The attitude of the coalition is that customers in dispute with banks should sort it out themselves, no matter how unequal that contest might be. On the other hand, Labor have committed to introducing a social charter that will define the social obligations of Australia's banks. The social charter will be legally binding on the banks. If the banks refuse to negotiate an acceptable social charter, a Labor government will impose a social charter through legislation. And we will be looking to see how you vote on that one, Senator McGauran. The message is clear: Labor will get tough on the banks; the coalition will not.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>26586</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is always interesting to see Labor Party tactics when they are on the back foot in the parliament.

And the tactical genius, in the Senate chamber and in the other place across the hall, of finally getting the health debate on the agenda was obviously successful to such an extent that today they decided that they needed to move the debate on to the internal machinations of an obscure Liberal Party branch in the hinterland of Queensland, I understand!</para></talk.start></continue><para>You can always see when the Labor Party are in trouble.

Senator Conroy could never have been accused of being in Joan Kirner's faction in Victoria.

Can you please take us over, get the Commonwealth Bank to buy us?' Of course, they said that there would be no bank closures, no redundancies and that everyone would be looked after. That is why I am so amused, when Senator Conroy can find nothing else to bash, he picked on a poor little obscure Liberal Party branch in outback Queensland somewhereâhe has picked on everyone else he can think of; anything to divert attention from the woes of his hapless leaderâand then finally came back and bashed the banks.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What are the issues? I sit here taking notes. The Chief Government Whip said, `Senator Campbell, can you go into the chamber and respond to Senator Conroy in a debate about bank closures and bank fees?' and I said, `Well, that shouldn't be too hard.' I sit here with my pen and my Australian Senate pad trying to find anything that he said that I could respond to. He spent most of the time talking about everything else under the sun. I have three pretty hopeless notes to respond toânot much to go onâso I am going to have to talk about what the coalition is doing and that cannot be done in 20 minutes.</para><para>The previous government had, of course, a woeful record. Their greatest achievement was for the Commonwealth Bank to take over the State Bank of Victoria and in the immediate aftermath of that you saw the biggest number of branch closuresâand you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President George Campbell, because at the time I think you were a vice-president of the ACTU and your affiliate members in the banking industry would have been screaming blue murder. They get promised by the then Prime Minister of Australiaâthe economic vandal whose name is Mr Paul Keatingâthat there would not be any redundancies or branch closures, assured by the then Premier of Victoria that there would be no branch closures and no redundancies, and what happened? Arguablyâand I do not have the statistics right in front of me but if anyone wants me to table them I willâthere were more branch closures in Victoria in the immediate aftermath of that and more redundancies in those merged banks than ever in the history of Australian banking. That was the direct result of the Victorian Labor Party branch and their hapless former Premier and the former failed Treasurer of Australia, Mr Keating.

The last point is this, to quote Senator Conroy: `The Liberals are in bed with the banks.' This is the bloke, he is the guy, who was supposed to have written the banking policyâthe socialist charter, the social charterâwho did not want to distract himself too much by having to write a policy, so he plagiarised it from the Australian Bankers Association, which then quickly disassociated itself from the whole exercise and basically tore up the social charter because most of the banks said: `It's a load of rubbish. Labor is a risk to consumers because they'll re-regulate and push up the price of banking.'  </para></talk.start></continue><para>We have introduced competition and brought the price down. We have brought interest rates down. Labor want to push them back up again. Their regulatory regime when they were in powerâand this really is the point that should be madeâthat we inherited ensured, for example, that credit unions were not allowed to issue cheques. I do not know how the credit unions put up with that for 13 years. Obviously they have, in some cases, strong affiliations with the trade unions, but when they wanted to issue cheques to their customersâand credit unions provide tremendous services to tens of thousands of Australians around the countryâthey had to go to banks and get the banks to issue cheques on their behalf.</para><para>One of the very early reforms that this government put in placeâand it did not attract a lot of attention; it was a sort of an <inline font-style="italic">Inside Baseball</inline> issueâwas to ensure that credit unions and all other deposit taking institutions were treated equally. When we deregulated banking, we ensured that you did not have to be one of the big four to be called a bank and to issue cheques. Credit unionsâand there are many successful credit unions in Australia who service suburbs and towns right around this wonderful country of oursâare now able to provide all of the services of banks.</para><para>So you have this incredible boost in competition which ensures that, if people are not happy with the service that they are getting from one of the established big four banks, they can go to a competitor such as one of the smaller or medium sized banks. We have seen, of course, the regional bank and the community bank sector blossoming under this government. That sector was just snuffed out under the previous Labor administration. I do not know whether they were in the pockets of the big banks or whether they were in bed with the banks, but certainly the banks had impressed upon the previous Labor administration that they did not want deregulationâthat they wanted to have a special place in the sun. </para><para>Our Treasurer and our Prime Minister said, `No, we want competition.' So you have had the mortgage origination business blossoming in Australia. While Labor is saying, `We want bricks and mortar branches everywhere and we will insist that they stay open,' people are voting with their feet. They have moved significantly to the Internetâthe last the statistics show that 2Â½ million people are now doing their banking over the Internetâand this government has ensured that, if people choose to bank over the Internet, they do not have to have the means to buy their own PC and Internet connection at home. We have actually funded, through the Networking the Nation program and a range of other programs, an Internet access network across Australia which is the envy of every other nation that will ensure access virtually wherever you live in Australia, whether that be through the telecentre network in Western Australia or the Internet access network in Tasmania, which Senator Denman who is here today would know is a very successful community service in her home state of Tasmania.</para><para>I have personally worked very closely with the minister for IT in New South Wales, Kim Yeadon.

He is too far to the Right for the Acting Deputy President. Kim Yeadon has done an extraordinary job, working with the coalition government federally, in picking up Hendy Cowan's successful telecentre model from Western Australia and ensuring that across New South Wales that is being rolled out under the NTN program, funded from the sale of Telstra. It will effectively ensure, Mr Acting Deputy President, that if your constituents in New South Wales cannot afford an Internet connection and a PC they will be able to go to a telecentre very close to where they liveâquite often in a library or a town hall or something like that. That is a phenomenal achievement of the government. It brings to people at all levels of income and from all social and cultural backgrounds access to Internet based banking services. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Internet based banking will never be a substitute for face-to-face contact. Face-to-face contact is crucial. People need to know that they can talk to a financial adviser, a banker, a bank manager, a customer relations officerâwhatever they want to call them these days. If the opposition wanted to be frank about it, they would acknowledge that there are so many new offerings now, such as low fee accounts and no fee accounts. A whole range of banking opportunities, through both electronic Internet phone banking and face-to-face banking, are now available to customers. </para><para>Fees are an issue. If you are on a low income and you are paying high bank fees, it eats up a far greater proportion of your monthly or weekly income than if you were on a high income. So fees are a matter of particular importance for people on low incomes. The government is cognisant of that. The banks will not get away with ripping off customers with high fees. The government is keen to ensure that there is good disclosure of those fees so that people can make a rational, sensible decision about where they do their banking. If they are banking with a bank that is ripping them off with high fees for service they do not believe they are getting, then we have always encouraged them to move to another bank. Change banks. Go to an Aussie Home Loans. Go to a credit union and get all the services out of credit unionsâthanks to this governmentâthat, I repeat, were prohibited by the previous Labor administration. So there is a whole range of new services. </para><para>The mortgage originators are, in my view, the way of the future. Senator Conroy reflects a 1950s or 1960s image of the community that isânot to be unfair and not to be too partisan about itâwhat his leader Mr Beazley represents. It is sort of folksy. I think he picks up his political culture from the time when his distinguished father was a member of the parliament. You have to have a couple of big doors, and wait till 10 o'clock when the doors are opened and all the people queued up outside run in. If you want to go to see your banker you have to ring up a week in advance and say, `Can I have an appointment?' unless he rings you up and says that you need an appointment, and, of course, that is always stressful for customers. But that is not the Aussie Home Loans sort of way, where they send people out to your home to see you at a time when it suits youâthe customer. That is the sort of innovation in face-to-face banking services that the new regulatory regime is providing. The new financial services regime that has been created by this government is providing better services to people regardless of where they live.  </para><para>There needs to be, to use the IT cliche, across Australia a `clicks and mortar' strategy. Labor has got the old bricks and mortar banking strategy. It is locked in the past. It wants to re-regulate the banking sector. It wants to effectively constrict the great innovation that has occurred in the past five years by re-regulating. If you go back to Senator Conroy's words, the opposition wants to get back into bed with the banks. We do not want to be in bed with them. We want to be in bed with the customers. We want to ensure that customers get what they want. You do not do that by coming in here and creating a set of black letter law, hundreds of pages of legislation, and saying, `This is how banks should be run.' Banks that are successful will listen to one person when it comes to how they should be successful. It will not be a bureaucrat or a politician around this joint. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator Hutchins</name></talker><para>âIt will be their directors, won't it? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âNo, it will be the customer. Banks that do not listen to their customers will not have customers. The competition is fierce and phenomenal now. The major banks, if they drive too far towards an Internet strategy and do not have face-to-face banking, will lose customers. If they go too far towards bricks and mortar and do not have a good electronic banking service, they will lose customers. They have to get it somewhere in between. It is a very dynamic area. The last thing you need to do in Australia is have a bunch of left-wing politicians and bureaucrats telling the banks how they will operate. It is the worst thing you can do. </para></talk.start></continue><para>But there is a serious role for regulation. We have sensible regulation. Contrary to what Senator Conroy saidâit is a point that needs to be rebuttedâwe have a very powerful ACCC which is monitoring bank fees and charges. The ACCC has quite specific powers under the Trade Practices Act 1974 to investigate and authorise the setting of bank fees if it considers bank fees to be excessive. So, contrary to what Senator Conroy says, we already have in place a formal and informal legal structure to monitor bank fees. We have in place a multifaceted policy that ensures that the regulation of the banks is in the customer's best interests. We have a competitive regime that ensures that customers, for the first time in Australian history, have significant choice as to where and how they do their banking and choice also in relation to the mix of services and fee structures they can avail themselves of.</para><para>I think the final point that needs to be made in the short time that is remaining to meâand it always humours me slightly when Senator Conroy or other Labor senators get to their feet to talk about the cost of bankingâis that the most significant cost to Australian citizens in banking over the past decade or so has been interest rates. Interest rates now are at historic lowsâ30-year lows. I remember when I bought my first property, and many people will remember that time under Labor when the government drove housing interest rates up from approximately 10Â½ per cent to more than 17 per cent. Australia had the highest real interest rates in its history under the last Labor government. They were much higher in real terms than the rates that applied at any other time in Australian history.</para><para>We must remember the rates that small businesses were paying on overdrafts and project finance. In one case that has been brought to my attention, they actually hit in excess of 32 per cent. That is what people remember about Labor and banking. You mention `Labor and banking' and people think `interest rates'. People should never forget that, when Labor was in power last time, they drove a million people out of work, a million breadwinners. A million households did not have a breadwinner because Labor drove up interest rates to over 17 per cent for the average house owner. That was a deliberate policy of Mr Keating, and I remind people that Mr Beazley was in the cabinet at the time. For businesses, interest rates went up to 32 per cent.

The Prime Minister was Malcolm Fraser and the Treasurer was John Howard. John Howard, as Treasurer between 1975 and 1983, mastered one of the great increases in rates of inflation, which affected interest rates. I remember how high they were. For Senator Campbell to come in here today and lecture us about the last five years or about the last 13 years of the Labor government is beyond belief or reason. I say `reason' because I have listened to Senator Campbell on a number of occasions and, even though I do agree with hardly anything he contributes, I find that his arguments are at least cogent and reasonable.</para></talk.start><para>However, after listening to what Senator Campbell said today in his apologia for the banking services, you would think that nothing has gone wrong in the Australian community, that nothing is disturbing people about the actions of the banks and their exorbitant profits. I refer to an article in today's <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> entitled, `Tough at the top: which bank chief's pay packet is nearly 10 times bigger than PM's'. It happens to be that little genius, David Murray, from the Commonwealth Bank. This article by John Rolfe appears on page 36 of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>. They did not put it at the front so the punters could read it: they put it down the back so that the boys like Senator Campbell and his matesâthe directors that they answer toâcould look and get a guide about how much money they should be going for. The article states: </para><quote><para>According to David Murray's theory of the general relativity of pay, his job should be at least eight if not ten times harder than Prime Minister John Howard's.</para></quote><para>The head of the Commonwealth Bank reckons that his job is eight to 10 times harder than that of the Prime Minister, who has direct control of a high percentage of the Australian economy. The article continues:</para><quote><para>The only problem is that even Mr Murray concedes running the Commonwealth Bank is easier than running the Commonwealth of Australia.</para><para>Spelling out his pay theory yesterday after revealing an 11 per cent full-year profit fall to $2.4 billion, Mr Murray said it was important treatment of workers was `even'.</para></quote><para>Let me quote Mr Murray:</para><quote><para>But we should provide reward based on the level of complexity of work undertaken.</para><para>Our policy is to determine remuneration based on attracting skilled people in the market, so we benchmark against the market.</para><para>I don't know how the Prime Minister's pay is determined. You should ask him that.</para></quote><para>That is what we have done. Mr Acting Deputy President, we heard earlier from your namesake, Senator Campbell, this apologia for the banking services. This man stood up this afternoon and said in a roundabout way that Mr Murray's pay increase was entirely justified, without taking into account the fact that hundreds of thousands of Australians have been hurt and dispossessed by the actions of the banks in the last five years that the coalition has been in power. Since March 1996, when the coalition was elected to office, the four major banksâand I will name them because when I was growing up there were a lot more of them: the Commonwealth, Westpac, the National and the ANZâhave made $34 billion in profits. I suppose you have to make that sort of money if you are going to pay your chief executive at the bank eight or 10 times more than the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia earns. You have to think about these poor struggling capitalists wandering around in Treasury Place or wherever else they hang out!</para><para>In that same period, as was so cogently put to the Senate by Senator Conroy, we have seen 1,150 branches of these banks close in regional and rural Australia. Regional and rural Australia are bleeding because the Commonwealth, the ANZ, the National and the Westpacs have been pulling out of the towns. What has the subservient coalition partner, the National Party, done about this? Where is Senator McGauran jumping up and trying to defend the actions of the National Party in this? The National Party has been silent; it has said nothing. It has let this go through to the keeper. It is no wonder its political base is under challenge and under threat from various sources. As I have said, 1,150 bank branches have closed across Australia in the last five years since John Howard became the Prime Minister.</para><para>This week, as I have said earlier, the Commonwealth Bank posted an annual profit of $2.2 billion for the 2000-01 financial year. And how did they achieve that? Three ways, as Senator Conroy said: close down branches, reduce staff levels and reduce services. That is exactly what they have done: closed down branches, reduced services and cut down staff. That is how they have been able to make their money. And who are they answering to? Senator Campbell would have us believe that they answer to their clients. By the actions of these Bourbonesque type people, like Mr Murray, they answer to no-one except their directors. As Senator Conroy said, in the film <inline font-style="italic">The Bank</inline> they were a bit worried they were going to go down to only a nine per cent increase in profits that year. This is totally despicable, and that is why we are raising this matter this afternoon, to take advantage of the opportunity to put this to debate and also to highlight it to the people of Australia.</para><para>I want to make it even more personal, because I want to talk about one of the regional seats that I look after in New South Wales: Robertson, which is on the Central Coast. You might call the member for Robertson Silent Jim Lloyd.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>âI've never heard of him.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name></talker><para>âI would not expect you to, Senator, because you do not hear much of Jim when he is in parliament or indeed when he is back in the electorate. And why would you? If you were Jim Lloyd, why would you put your head up? In the last five years, 13 branches of the banks in the electorate of Robertson have closed down. In Wyoming the Commonwealth Bank closed down; in the Gosford Big Fresh the Commonwealth closed down; in East Gosford the Commonwealth, the ANZ, the Westpac, the National and the St George closed down; in West Gosford Westpac closed down; in Terrigal the ANZ and St George closed down; in Umina the ANZ closed down; Ettalong, Westpac; and Woy Woy, Colonial. East Gosford itself has lost five branches of banks in the last three years alone. Many pensioners, the aged, the computer illiterate and other people dependent on over-the-counter services now have to travel to one of the large shopping centres located around Gosford and brave the crowds and the congestion to get access to their money.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So where is this caring, sharing government? Where are these people that claim they represent regional and rural New South Wales or Australia? When have they put their heads up to defend these people that need defending? Not once. As I said, when you think about it, why wouldn't Silent Jim Lloyd be silent? I bet he doesn't have to worry about when he goes to the bank. He would not want to run around some of these places in his electorate, because the pensioners, the aged, the computer illiterate and the people that need over-the-counter services would give him a hiding. When they get the chance at the election forthcoming they will give him that hiding. </para><para>I also want to talk about another one of my duty electorates: the seat of Parramatta. The seat of Parramatta is held by that evangelical member, Mr Ross Cameron. Mr Cameron is, I understand from conversations with him, quite close to God. He and God commune and communicate on a regular basis. I imagine Mr Cameron would have to do that, because in Mr Cameron's electorate since he has been the member there 16 branches of banks have closed down in the last five years. You would not want to be Mr Cameron. I suppose Mr Cameron would like to talk to God, because I do not think he would like to talk to his electorate. I do not think he would like to talk to those people that need, as I said earlier, those over-the-counter servicesâthe aged, the infirm, the computer illiterate, the pensioners. They do not want to talk to Mr Cameron; they want to give him a hiding, and they will at the next election.</para><para>Let me just go through the bank branches in the electorate of Parramatta that have closed down since Ross Cameron has been the member. I want to talk about the North Rocks suburb, where the National, the Westpac and the Commonwealth banks have disappeared; in North Parramatta the ANZ Bank, the Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank have disappeared; in Parramatta itself the ANZ, the Westpac and the Commonwealth have disappeared; in Wentworthville the National Bank branch has disappeared; in Pendle Hill ANZ and Westpac have disappeared; and in Rydalmere the ANZ and the NAB branches have disappeared. In particular, North Parramatta has been gutted of all its branches of banks. There is now not one branch of a bank in the North Parramatta shopping precinct or district. There is not one branch of a bank left there. This has all occurred while Ross Cameron has been the member for Parramatta.</para><para>Prior to the branch closures, people dependent on over-the-counter banking servicesâpensioners in particularâwould withdraw their money and spend their money in that shopping precinct in North Parramatta. Now pensioners have to catch a bus or walk down Church Street and across the hazardous Victoria Road to get to their nearest branch. As a result, they spend their money outside the North Parramatta shopping precinct, and the area and the local businesses are suffering. They are the actions of this government; that is what they have been presiding over for five years. For someone like Senator Campbell to come in here this afternoon and try to put some case that somehow defends the actions of the banks is beyond my comprehension.</para><para>I want to also talk about another seat, and this is where there is a National Party memberâthe Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile. He is seldom in the country, and he is seldom up in his seat.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>âThat's right, he's out their selling our stuff.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name></talker><para>âThat is right. I think he should start going back up to his electorate, because they want to see him. They do not see much of him. Why would you go back if you were Mr Vaile, with his actions over the last few years in relation to branch closures in his electorate? In the last few years, Westpac has replaced its branches in Laurieton, Wingham and Wauchope, and they have been replaced with in-store services through the local pharmacies. As a result, Westpac customers in these towns can no longer get access to loans and other services that only be provided by bank branches. There is also major discontent with the increase in over-the-counter service fees that have been imposed on former Colonial State Bank customers after it merged with the Commonwealth Bank. These things have occurred over the last five years. They have occurred under a coalition government, under compliant and probably useless members of parliament representing their areas.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I recall, like Senator Conroy, when the Commonwealth Bank used to come into your school and help you start your first bank account. I remember my first bank account was at the Cronulla branch of the Commonwealth Bank, and I think I put in two shillings or something like thatâI cannot recall what it was at the time. During that period, banks had standing in the community. They were respected institutions. People used to want to work for banks. The bank branch manager was someone of importance in the community. Those were the days when there was a bit of standing and the banks understood their role and the role that they needed to play in the community and in the wider sphere. But not now. All banks are interested in now is making moneyâmaking profit and distributing it to their shareholders, not to their customers.</para><para>I have a newspaper article here referring to poor old David Murray. I cannot see how much he earns, but if it is 10 times what the Prime Minister earns it must be at the million dollar mark or so. You could imagine poor David Murray struggling through on a few million dollars a year while he goes around and closes another bank branch somewhere, while he sacks a few more hundred or thousand workers, while he increases the fees for people who get their own moneyâthey actually have to pay money to withdraw their own money. That is how the banks are making money, and that is highlighted in Senator Conroy's motion. I suppose those were the days, and now we are seeing fewer banks, fewer staff and fewer services.</para><para>I do not think it has been widely recognised by the coalition, but a number of community banks are springing up all over the country. A number of people are fed up with the inactivity and the compliance of the coalition government with these big banks. You only have to go to Melbourne or parts of regional New South Wales to see that even once stalwart National Party supporters are disillusioned and disenchanted with the leadership and the activities of their National Party colleagues, not only in the federal parliament but in state parliaments. They are taking the action to set up these community banks.</para><para>Interestingly enough, they are also starting to approach us. They say to us, `We've been taken for granted by the National Party for so long. For generations, we've been taken for granted by them. We know that the only action that will make them do anything is to make sure that the seats they hold are marginal and not regarded as safe turf.' That is why Mr Vaile is going to lose his seat at the next election. That is why the Deputy Prime Minister is in a lot of trouble. That is why you have got Peter Cochrane running down here in Eden-Monaro. They are fed up with being taken for granted by the National Party. And why wouldn't they be? In the five years that this compliant, cowardly coalition partner have been lapdogging to the Liberals, they have presided over the closure of 1,150 bank branches. Senator Conroy has outlined what Labor will do when we achieve power. We will compel the banks to have a social charter, and that has been well and truly outlined by Senator Conroy. </para><para>I want to finish with a quote from a book called <inline font-style="italic">An Intimate View of History</inline>. I cannot recall the author, but the quote says:</para><quote><para>In real life, for the last 500 years the vast majority of humans have been submissive, cringing before authority and apart from short lived outbursts of protest, sacrificing themselves so that a small minority could live in luxury ...

The power to give orders is no longer enough.</para></quote><para>What the coalition have allowed the banks and their directors and shareholders to do has led them to have wealth, which has led to luxury. This has led to idleness, inertia and the fact that these people think we will not rebel and challenge their authority. They will have a few lessons to learn when we do get into power, and they will be very hard lessons indeed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>26593</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to speak on this debate on the important social issue of banking on behalf of the Australian Democrats. Banks play a unique role in a modern society. They bring people together in so many ways. The role of a bank is to bring together those who wish to save money and those who wish to borrow money. Banks profit because both parties pay for this service. But banks bring people together in so many other ways as well. No other industry unites people in the same way when it comes to consumer discontent and the perception that they are being treated unfairly.</para></talk.start><para>The problems of consumer protection and the need for banks to act responsively and equitably towards all their customers arise out of the fundamental changes that have occurred in the Australian banking industry in the last 10 years. Deregulation and attempts to make the industry more competitive have failed, with the big banks continuing to swallow up their smaller competitors. Fewer competitors mean fewer choices and worse outcomes for consumers.</para><para>The biggest problem with the banking industry, however, is not choice between banks, but the impossibility of avoiding the banking industry as a whole. Whether we like it or not, we are all forced to deal with financial institutions. Few employers still provide the option of being paid in cash, and welfare recipients have no choice but to receive their funds electronically. The banks have profited massively from this compulsion and, in turn, they must accept responsibility for delivering these essential services equitably and efficiently. Once upon a time, people could keep their money under their mattress if they wished. They could do so today, but they would first have to withdraw it from their financial institutionâand no doubt pay a fee, if they can find a branch.</para><para>Electronic banking has delivered massive benefits to Australian consumers and businesses. It has revolutionised the way many people conduct their lives, it has changed the way we view credit and it has done away with the weekly pay packet. Electronic banking services, like the provision of electricity and water, are now essential services. Just as the electricity and water industry are expected to perform to higher standards than most, the Democrats believe that the banking industry must accept the same responsibility.</para><para>Regulations are all about community standards. We regulate the advertising of drugs and food more strictly than we regulate the advertising of clothes or stationery for the simple reason that the stakes are higher. Selling miracle cures to the frail and scared is not allowed; however, the suggestion that a new car or new soft drink could change your life is. Environmental standards and occupational health and safety legislation are all designed to force firms to behave in a way that is in accordance with community expectations and standards.</para><para>The whole point of regulation is to change behaviour. Yes, such regulations may have costs for some businesses, but the objective is to maximise the national interest and the public interest, not maximise banks' profits. It is time, the Democrats believe, to institute a social charter for banks, and that is why we are supportive of that call in this motion for the government to immediately negotiate a social charter with Australia's banks to ensure that all Australians have access to affordable and fair banking services. It is no longer good enough to hope that consumers will be afforded the protection they deserve. We need to insist they receive it. </para><para>Banks often mount two rather inconsistent arguments when trying to deflect the need to codify a minimum level of service for customers. On the one hand, they argue that such a move is unnecessary because the banks have already acted on community concerns. On the other hand, they often argue that such regulations will impose an unfair cost burden on banks and their shareholders. It is hard to see how forcing banks to do what they claim they are already doing will increase costs, and the Democrats are not swayed by such arguments. Consumer protection is an essential government service. It cannot be shirked or privatised. Indeed, it is interesting to note in conducting this debate about banking charges and banking costs the role of the Labor Party in privatising the Commonwealth Bank. That act needs to be noted in this debate because I think it has contributed to the direction of banking policy significantly in this country, and a significant part of why we are where we are today in relation to banking behaviour has to be traced back to the actions of the former Hawke and Keating Labor governments in relation to financial deregulation and in relation to actions such as privatising the Commonwealth Bankâan action that was of course supported by the National Party and the Liberal Party at the time. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âIt seemed like a good idea at the time!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>âOf course, the Democrats did not believe it was a good idea at the time and opposed it strongly. The idea of consumer sovereignty underlies the economic theories that justified both this government's and the previous government's faith in the capacity of deregulation to deliver benefits to consumers. I do not think, however, that many bank customers feel like kings or queens these days when they pay high fees to queue in lines or to queue online. On the matter of online banking, it is essential that governments intervene early to prevent problems before they arise. Banks are increasingly trying to push customers away from relying on a branch network and towards reliance on the electronic network. While such an approach does have some obvious benefits, it also has substantial risks and is also clearly not appropriate for many in our community. Only yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper the Bank of Melbourne offered `an apology to our Internet banking customers'. The advertisement went on to say that `Internet banking is available again', and customers were thanked for their patience during the disruption. While it is inevitable that technical difficulties will occasionally affect Internet banking along with most other services offered on the Net, the impact of such disruptions will be magnified if the banks continue with their shift away from a branch network. As an addition to the branch network, Internet banking has the potential to be a valuable tool. As a replacement for the branch network, Internet banking is a risky and poor substitute. Internet banking and improved technology have the potential to significantly reduce the cost of many banking activities. As yet, consumers have not benefited from any of these technological improvements in terms of reduced costs. Lowering costs is not the same thing as lowering prices. Unfortunately the difference in the case of the banking industry is due to the lack of competitive pressure.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Much has been made, both by the banks and the government, of the decline in both interest rates and interest rate margins. While falling margins are of benefit to consumers with substantial borrowings, particularly those with home loans, millions of Australians receive no benefit from lower margins at all. Unfortunately, while Australia has a high rate of home ownership, low income earners are the least likely to be paying off their own home. The benefits of lower mortgage rates, caused primarily by the entrance of non-banks to the home loan mortgage markets, do not flow to many low income earners. The most vulnerable people in Australia have gained least from the policies of financial sector deregulation. It is time that policy is designed exclusively to protect these consumers. The Australian Democrats for this reason fully support the introduction of a charter for bank conduct. Banks in Australia are highly profitable, as we all know, and, as this motion we are now debating notes, they are getting more so. Banks are also closing branches, sacking staff, increasing fees and advertising more. The current market outcomes are neither equitable nor socially responsible. All Australian citizens and corporations have an obligation to act in the national interest. If banks will not elect to do so, then they should not be surprised that the community will force them to. </para><para>A social charter for the banks needs to consider the wide range of ways in which banks interact with Australian consumers and small business. Access to timely and high quality transaction services, access to consumer credit and access to timely information about banking services and fees are all essential for an equitable and efficient system. It is time, in the Democrats' view, that community expectations were clearly laid out in consultation with the banks and other interested parties so that all parties can be certain whether individual bank decisions can be discussed within an agreed framework. Only once we have agreed on what it is that banks are supposed to be delivering to their customers can we have a meaningful discussion about the desirability of specific decisions. So it is important, in the Democrats' view, that movement occur on the development and negotiation of a social charter for Australia's banks, and that negotiation should involve and include consumers as well, and unions and employer interests also because they clearly have a role to play in determining such a charter. It does need to be focused on delivering a fair outcome for all Australians, particularly lower income Australians, who are clearly sick and tired of being worn down by more and more charges and incredibly difficult access to information about those chargesâthe range of them and how they apply and operate. People are clearly getting immensely sick of the level of charges, the bank closures, the staff sackings and, of course, that being coupled with massive and increasing levels of bank profit. It is a sign of a failed policy of the past which, as the Democrats have stated both today and previously, is in place in large part due to the policies of the previous Labor government. It is pleasing that Labor are modifying their earlier position from when they were in government to recognise the need to have social obligations placed on the banking industry. We certainly hope that if they do get into government they will follow through on the rhetoric they are now enunciating in opposition, and the Democrats certainly will be pushing hard, if there is a change of government, to ensure that Labor do follow through on a measure such as this.</para><para>We believe that it is of benefit. It is needed. It will provide significant benefits, not just to the community but indeed, in our view, to the banking industry, which, as I think everyone in this place would acknowledge, suffers from a significant PR problem and a significant problem in terms of community acceptance and support. It would be in the banking industry's interests as well to have an increase in community acceptance of their activities and of the services they deliver. It would be a positive outcome, a positive action, and it is one that the Democrats support and will continue to work towards and will continue to pressure both the current government and any future government to implement in an effective and speedy way. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>26596</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe can detect the Labor Party's priorities today.

There are these echoes of the 1930sâSir Otto Niemeyer and Jack Langâand then, later on, Doc Evatt and Mr Chifley. There is this false paradox that the Left always come up with, where they pit the banks on the one hand versus the worker on the other hand. That is the paradox. That is the fight that the ALP love to portray, and it is an artificial portrayal of reality. Why is it an artificial portrayal of reality? Because the workers own the banks. They have shares in them and banks make money, like most businesses do. This is again an appeal to populism in its most pathetic and base form. Even where the workers do not have shares in the banks, where is their superannuation invested? The ALP often take a sound approach to superannuation, but where is the superannuation of Australian workers invested? It is in the banks, based on the profits of the banks. There is this pathetic attempt to build up this animosity, this false war between the workers on the one hand and the banks on the other. In fact, they have mutual interests.

It is not horrible big capitalists up there; it is ordinary people who own the banks. When you finally get that through your thick skulls, you will realise in the end that when banks succeed the workers succeed as well. Senator Campbell, you might want to reflect on that for a while, because the profits will be paid back to the people who own the banks, to the people whom you say you represent. You do not like to face that because for 100 years the Labor Party have liked to build this false dichotomy between the workers and the owners of capital. The problem is that now the workers own the capital. I think I have made that point fairly strongly, so I will move on. I like nothing more than punching holes in the arguments of this wet, weak bunch on the other side who have had nothing new to say for about 20 years since we won the economic debate; it has been about a generation.  </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84M</name.id><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name></talker><para>âI would love to debate this, Senator Collins.

In March 1996, mortgage interest rates were 10Â½ per cent. They were 18 per cent in 1989. Today, they are under seven per cent. Banks like high interest rates because they make more money. Under this lot, banks were doing extremely well as a proportion of their investment. Of course, the Labor Party do not like to talk about that. In terms of access to banking, in 1996 there were 107,000 EFTPOS terminals; under the coalition, as at March 2001, there are 320,000. In March 1996, there were 7,200 automatic teller machines; today, under the coalition, there are 10,800. GiroPost is set to expand. Total points of access have increased since the 1996 March election from about 135,000 under Labor to about 350,000 under the coalition. That is a big difference.

Variable home mortgage rates today have fallen from 10Â½ per cent at the time of the 1996 election to about 6.8 per cent today. This represents a saving of a staggering $3,700 a year in interest payments on an average $100,000 home loan. The Labor Party say that they represent the average worker, but the coalition government have saved people $3,700 a year in interest payments on the average $100,000 home loan. Under this government, ordinary Australians are now saving. Compare that to their miserable government. There is nothing the Labor Party can say to get around that fundamental failure. It is a fundamental failure for the middle class of this country and the workers of this country. The Labor Party failed on the most fundamental test of the right to govern: they abandoned middle and working Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84M</name.id><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name></talker><para>âThat will never be forgotten, Senator McGauran. Business interest rates today are at their lowest level in 30 years. I remember Senator Boswell making a passionate speech about this. The people who employ the workers of this country that the Labor Party are supposed to represent went bankrupt because interest rates went so high. Unemployment skyrocketed because business could not afford to employ people. That is a very sad thing. Once again, the Labor Party failed the people whom they claim to represent. This is slightly off the topic, but it is one of the great indices of the failure of the Labor Party: under which government did real wages rise? Under the coalition. Again, the opposition failed. Under Labor, real wages fell, interest rates went up and unemployment went up. They are the indices of success in modern Australia. On those indices, how did the Labor Party perform? They failed on the fundamental test of good governance in this country, yet they think somehow that they will slip into office on the back of the GST and on concern about the GST, but they never actually want to refer to either their policy or their record.

It cannot refer to its policies or its own record, yet it hopes to be the next government of this country. It is absolutely pathetic. It hopes to skate into government on the back of the GST. It is a gross failure on the major points of government in this country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Another very important point is that Australian home owners are waiting only four days to receive interest rate reductions from banks, compared to 51 days under Labor. Similarly, small business owners have to wait only seven days now, compared to 35 days under Labor. Also, as part of tax reform in this country, the government scrapped the financial institutions dutyâthat is, the tax on transactionsâas of 1 July this year. This could save a typical bank customer about $170 a year.</para><para>The Howard government welcomes recent initiatives by the Australian banks for banking consumers. Senator Ian Campbell touched on these, but I will elaborate. Firstly, there will be fee-free bank accounts for five million Australiansâthat is, for the holders of health, seniors or pensioner concession cards. The Howard government welcomes those initiatives from the Australian banking industry. Secondly, there is a plan to provide more accessible services for Australians with disabilities. Thirdly, face-to-face banking services will be maintained in rural and regional Australia. The banks have also agreed to longer consultation periodsâthree monthsâin predominantly rural areas where bank closures may occur. The banks have also made a commitment not to decrease face-to-face banking any further. Alternative forms of face-to-face banking are now offered in 2,800 Australia Post branches and in nearly 6,000 retail agencies. </para><para>In a press release this week from the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, it says that the Rural Transaction Centre program has been extended to provide online banking and bill paying services through small rural postal outlets in communities that might not otherwise be able to participate in the program. I think that would generally be acknowledged as a good initiative. What was the ALP's reply? Their reply was mixed. On the one hand, shadow minister for communications, Mr Stephen Smith, was reported as describing the new RTC initiative as, `stealing ALP policy'. He did not mention the fact that the ALP stole half of their policies from the Australian Bankers Associationâbut I will get to that in a minute.  </para><para>While Mr Smith was reported as describing the new RTC initiative as `stealing ALP policy', the shadow minister for regional services, territories and local government, Senator Mackay, in a separate statement, said the very same policy was a `token gesture'. So, on the one hand, we are doing a dreadful thing by stealing Labor Party policy and, on the other, this new policy initiative is merely a `token gesture'. The ALP, on banking policy, are floundering. They have nothing to say. My friend Senator Ian Campbell spoke about the development of Labor Party policy on banking. He mentioned that the Australian Bankers Association was planning to launch new initiatives for low income and disabled customers but then, of course, the Labor Party stole their policy. In a Media Monitors transcript from the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program, with Mark Colvin, on 26 March 2001, Mr David Bell from the Australian Bankers Association says:</para><quote><para>We've heard the community and today we are announcing an action plan which recognises our social obligations.

It is important that services be available. What happened then? Senator Conroy stole half the policyâhe stole the bit which related to the development of the social obligations of banks. I now get back to where I started, because I like to finish with a flurry: fundamental failure of social democracy and the Left in this country. I repeat that the Labor Party have never understood that this is not a capitalist versus worker nation anymore.

Not for one nanosecond out of that 40 minutes did either Senator Mason or Senator Campbell pose any criticism of what is happening in our banking system today. What does that demonstrate? Does it demonstrate that the rest of us have what is happening out there in banking so absolutely wrong or is it simply a reflection of the fact that this is a government with a set of members who are blindly ideologically obsessed with all of these issues and think that anything the Labor Party might criticise must obviously be defended?</para></talk.start><para>Is their defence of the banking system warranted? You do not have to take the word of the Labor Party: look at what has been occurring. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>by Sid Marris and Duncan Macfarlane on 20 July, the opening paragraph states:</para><quote><para>Banks stripped a further $750 million from customers last year, increasing overall fees to households and business customers by 14 per cent for the second year in a row, according to a Reserve Bank study released yesterday. </para><para>Despite a growing community and political backlashâ</para></quote><para>there is no political backlash coming from the other side of the chamberâ</para><quote><para>the rate of fee increases was greater for households than businesses during 2000. </para></quote><para>Clearly, that is a reflection of the attitudes of the community generally to what the banks have been doing in our economy and the way in which they have been manipulating the process of charging fees to maximise profits. I quote from an article that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on Tuesday, 17 July. Written by Robin Robertson under the heading `Banks criticised on fees to small business', the article said:</para><quote><para>The Small Business Ministerial Council has unanimously called on the Federal Government to seek an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry into possible anti-competitive practices by banks against small business. </para><para>Research tabled at the council's meeting last month showed that the big four banks provided very similar basic small business bank accounts, and that there was no evidence of competition on price between them.</para></quote><para>Not only is there no evidence of competition but there is a substantial body of evidence of collusion between the four banks in respect of the fees and charges that they are charging the community generally. This unanimous decision included the federal Minister for Small Business, Mr Ian Macfarlane, who has had a bit of mention in this chamber today for reasons other than his portfolio. He is a part of the Small Business Ministerial Council, and he was part of the unanimous call for the ACCC to look into the banking industry. </para><para>But you do not have to take their word for it either. Go to the banks themselves. Even they recognise that they are on the nose with the community in a big way. We have all seen the television ad for the St George Bank. The Acting Deputy President may not have, so let me tell you what the St George ad does. It is shot by the side of a pool at a family barbecue. There are three or four couples, a dog, and a couple of kids in the swimming pool. There is a person sitting at the table and he is asked, `What do you do for a living?' He says, `I'm a banker.' There is an instantaneous pause by everyone there, including the dog and the kids in the swimming pool, until he tells them, `It's all right: I'm a St George banker,' and all of a sudden he is acceptable. It is simply St George trading on the fact that they know that the community at large have got a very poor image of the banking system. As someone said earlier in this debate, a few years ago the banks had some stature in our community whereas now they are getting right down to the bottom rung when people rate various occupations in our society.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âDown there with journalists.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>âAnd politicians.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âProbably lower than journalists; maybe still a little bit above politiciansâwe do not knowâbut certainly lower than journalists. It was also interesting to listen to Senator Ian Campbell's contribution to this debate, because he really filled up 20 minutes with nothingness. There was not much discussion about the issue of what is occurring in our banking sector and the need to apply some pressure on that sector to ensure that a range of services is available to the community at a reasonable cost and that these services are readily accessible. He spent most of his time reflecting on what the Labor Party did in 1980, 1975, 1960, 1901 or 1933âhe covered a fair spectrum. </para></talk.start></continue><para>He made a couple of points which I think need to be rebutted. He talked about the contribution of this government's policy in reducing interest ratesâI am particularly talking about mortgage interest rates. He claimedâwhich is the wont of people on the other sideâresponsibility by this government for the mortgage originators. I want to put Senator Ian Campbell's misunderstanding of that to rest. Mortgage origination occurred under the Labor government. It occurred under the Keating government in the early 1990s. Aussie Home Loans was around long before John Howard became Prime Minister of this country. RAMS Home Loans was there long before John Howard became Prime Minister of this country. The trade unions super funds home loans were there long before John Howard became Prime Minister of this country. It was mortgage origination, introduced by a Labor government, that drove interest rates down in the banking sector. When mortgage origination started in this country, home loan interest rates applying in the banking sector were an average of 11 to 12 per cent. Because of the shift in market share, those interest rates fell to about six per cent over a period of some 12 to 18 months. That was as a result of nothing other than mortgage origination, where those players coming into the market offered home loan packages at a substantially more competitive rate than the banks were prepared to offer. What was very interesting about that whole exercise was that I happened to sit on the board of one of those home loan companies at the time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âStill going?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âNo, I resigned my position when I came into this chamber, Senator McGauran. Tony Staley still sits on it, I think, so it was not one of those companies that had a political bias, which you might have been assuming in your mind. It had a broad, representative groupâ and I say `broad' in the very broadest sense of the word.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We watched what occurred in that area as a result of the mortgage origination businesses getting off the ground. For the first time what we also observed was that there was actually some differential starting to occur in the types of home loan packages that banks were making available. Prior to that all the packages by the banks were almost identicalâand the reality is that through the history of banking whenever the banks could collude and come up with the same packages they did. They did in the past, and they still do. It makes a mockery of the suggestion from the Treasurer, Mr Costello, which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> of 21 July. He said:</para><quote><para>Obviously the public is concerned about the level of bank fees and we think the most important thing is to exercise consumer power against banks that are overcharging.</para></quote><para>That is all well and good. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>If they are worried about their own bank overcharging you, move your account.</para></quote><para>Move your account! That seems like a simple, reasonable proposal. Just go down the street, knock on your bank manager's door and tell him, `I am going to take my money out and I want to put it into the bank down the street.' However, we all know that these days it is a bit more difficult to open a bank account than it used to be, particularly if you happen to have a little bit of money. You are required to have your passport and a few other bits of identification to make sure it is you. I am somebody who resided in the bottom of the harbour days, when the Prime Minister of this country was Treasurer and we had all those tax avoidance schemes running around rampant in our society. It is not that easy now to start an account, and it is very obvious from the Treasurer's comments that he has never stood in a bank branch; he has never walked in and stood in a queue to try to open a bank account. I tell you what, you will wait a fair time these days if you walk into the branch of a bank trying to get over-the-counter service. That is not because people are particularly interested in getting into the banks; it is because banks have introduced a deliberate policy of driving people out of real, physical banking environments. They have adopted a deliberate policy of driving people onto the Internet, into electronic banking. As a consequence, services in bank branches out in the suburbs have deteriorated considerably. </para><para>That is over and above the issue of bank closures. We know they have been closing bank branches and in many areas they have just not been making the services available, and also those services that are available are being operated in a way that deters people from using them. Someone said, `Well, talk to your bank manager.' Try it one day. My bank is the National Australia Bank. Try ringing up your local bank manager for an appointment. You cannot get the number of the branch. The branches do not have any phone numbers any longer. You have to go through a call centre, and they will not connect you. You cannot pick up the telephone and ring the branch manager of a National Australia Bank branch; you have to go through a call centre. If you can get through the hurdle of spending 20 to 40 minutes talking to someone there about why you want to talk to the manager of the bank, you may get put through, or you may not.</para><para>If you have reasonable deposits in the bank, you may get more sympathetic consideration than if you only have a normal bank account. We know it happens. I know individualsâfamily membersâwho have reasonable accounts with the National Australia Bank, and they do not have any problems getting access. In fact, the bank manager rings them up, saying, `Can we do anything for you? Do you want to come down and we can talk about your investments? Would you like to invest a bit more? Maybe you would like to borrow a bit more.' However, if you are a pensioner trying to get your pension cheque into the system and trying to get something back out of the system, you will find it considerably more difficult than it used to be. The reality is that the community is being herded into the electronic banking system environment. That is all right for some of us. I must admit I am still nervous when I do banking over the Internet.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>âYou can't use the telephones here.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âI know that.

It has done nothing. It has not even tried to use moral persuasion to get banks to introduce some changes to the banking system which might make it reasonably accessible to ordinary people out in our community. It has certainly done nothing at all about solving the problem of a lack of banking services in regional and rural Australia. In regional and rural Australia, the issue is not just that of having a bank physically in the town to be able to take some money out of or to put some money into over the counter; in those regional areas, the bank is a much more social environment, with a social responsibility. In the past, bank managers in regional and rural Australia were very important pillars of the community. They were able to make decisions about whether farmer A or farmer B or farmer C should get access to a loan: not only did they know the individual; they knew their business and their capacity in given sets of circumstances to be able to generate profits and income and to be able to meet their payments. Those bank managers became a source of knowledge within the community. </para><para>These days, if a person in regional and rural Australia wants assistance in that form, they get forced on to the Internet with someone who has no understanding of what life is like out in those regional and rural communities. The chances are that many people are being denied access to funds out of the banking system in regional and rural Australia, simply because the person they are dealing with in the banking system does not understand the area in which they are operating. These are people who in normal circumstances in the past would have got access to those funds and been able to keep their businesses viable and their farms operating and would have been able to generate profits to make repayments on their mortgages into the future.</para><para>So it is not just about having a hole in the wall to put money in or to take money out, although that is important in regional and rural Australia; it is very important if you are operating a petrol station, for example, that may be 50 or 100 kilometres from the nearest town with a banking system. What do you do with the cash that comes over your counter? How do you get that to a secure environment? Are you not exposed to someone walking in with a shotgun or some other form of weaponry and exposing you to violence, being robbed or whatever else may occur in that situation? A lot of that is happening simply because those businesses are in isolated areas where it is very difficult for them to get to an environment where they can secure, in a proper set of circumstances, the resources or the moneys that they have.</para><para>The reality is that this government have done nothing about that. They have talked about the rural transaction centres. We heard a couple of years ago that there were going to be 300 of these set up around the country, which would solve all the problems of regional and rural Australia in terms of banking services and all the other things that were being ripped out of their communities. At the last count that I heard, I think there were 17 or 19 of them that had actually been established. That is an absolute and monumental political failure by this government, and they still try to perpetuate the myth that in regional and rural Australia somehow or other these centres are out there solving all the problems in those communities and providing the services that those communities have been lacking as a result of the bank closures.</para><para>The minister responsible for this area should be condemned, not only for his failure to introduce the policy but also for his consistently coming in here and trying to bluff the rest of us by telling us that it is actually working. It has been an abject and monumental failure. I thought the greatest bit of hypocrisy in this chamber today was perpetrated by Senator Ian Campbell, who tried to shamefacedly claim responsibility for the Bendigo Bankâsomething that would never have got established if we had been relying on this government and its assistance to put it in place. The reality is that the banking industry in this country is controlled by four major players. There is very little difference in the services that they provide to the community and in what they charge for access to those services. There is a big difference, however, in how they treat you if you are at the bottom end of the income tree as opposed to being at the big end of town. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>26603</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI too join this debate to present the government's side of the argument and to reject the motion put forward by Senator Conroy as it stands in full, though we say that elements of it are quite agreeable to us.

We have been critical of the banks due to their lack of social sensitivity and responsibility and, at times, we have been highly critical of the very highly paid executives of the banks. We thinkâat least I thinkâthat many of the executives of the banks are paid too much for what you would think they would do and for some of their public comments. There should be far more transparency and accountability of their salaries. Also, when it comes to fees, we have been critical of the banks' often callous lumping of fees on the pension and the social welfare sectors. We are on record as being critical of the banks in their approach in this matter.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What is more, the latest incident involving banks is with regard to shadow ledgers, touched on by Senator Conroy. This is a very troubling area which the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities has looked into. I believe that the act of using shadow ledgers, undertaken by some of the banks anyway, is highly suspicious and ought to be brought to a grinding halt. Let us look behind the incident of shadow ledgers. That was prompted by a tax incentive brought in by the Keating government. Senator Conroy did not say that. Didn't the banks give Mr Keating many thanks with regard to that particular tax advantage that he gave them?</para><para>The point is that, if this parliament seeks to cut the cost of banking, if the opposition are seeking to cut the cost of bankingâand they had no credibility in the time that they were in governmentâthen I point out to Senator George Campbell the actions that this government has taken. First of all, the government has abolished two government taxes that appear each month on everyone's bank statement. We have abolished over $2 billion worth of bank statement feesâ that is, the FID and the BAD taxesâand we did not get support from the opposition at all. You would not even support our reducing a government tax on every person's bank statement. Your credibility is not there. Really, the highest banking charge upon any citizen is of course interest rates, but what credibility do you have to come into this chamber and talk about bank costs when in fact it was a policy of yours to jack up the interest rates? In our term in office, this government has single-mindedly reduced interest rates to historic lows. That is lifting a bank fee charge.</para><para>The third way the government has acted to reduce the cost of banking has been to set up and support the market structure of competitionâthat is, we are holding firm to the four-pillar policy so there is competition between the big four banks. Furthermore, we have loosened the rules and given credit unions a greater ability to act as a bank, and that is extra competition. We have, regardless of what the previous speaker said, implemented the policy of transaction centres, which brings to small townships an ability to establish face-to-face servicesâno less personal banking servicesâwhere the bank may have left the town. Of course, the Bendigo Bank has set up those wonderful community banks. In towns where the major four banks have left the town, the Bendigo Bank has filled the gap.</para><para>Moreover, this government has given increased powers and encouragement to the ACCC and the Reserve Bank to monitor those fees. Senator Conroy has come into this chamber and given the same speech many times over, but he simply has not updated his facts. The ACCC are presently monitoring the big four bank fees, and this is borne out by the very fact that they initiated, through the Reserve Bank powers, the inquiry into the interchange fees for Bankcards. They took on the big four banks, believed that these fees were exorbitant and, under the law, undertookâtriggered by the Reserve Bank, of courseâto bring down credit card fees. The previous speakers on the opposition side have not given any acknowledgment to the government's actions. Furthermore, there is a difference between the opposition and the government with regard to regulation. This government does not believe in regulation. We do believe in reflecting the public view, and the public view of banks is not good and will not get better with the latest announcements with regard to shadow accounts. But there have been major steps in the banks' thinking, and you will not get it from regulation. You will get it by this government reflecting the public's views.</para><para>Again, I say that Senator Conroy has not updated his speech notes. He comes in here criticising the banks for things they have made progress on, such as bank closure protocols and improved standards with regard to developing an electronic banking service for older people and people with disabilities. But, more than that, all the banks have introduced bank fee-free accounts for pensioners and social welfare holders. That is now a policy; it is now up and running and yet Senator Conroy comes in here and says, `That's what we're going to do.' I know he really likes to plagiarise the policies of the banking sector but, Senator Conroy, you are going to have to update your speech notes, because the banks have actually done half those things. They are in place now and we never needed regulations to get the banks to the table. Of course, they needed a bit of pushing and shoving from the topâfrom the Prime Minister, from the minister and from the cabinetâbecause they are not easy people to deal with. As I said in my introduction, they are overpaid and probably underworked, but they have made tremendous progress with this government's pressureâand not regulationâand with public pressure. In fact, that is really how you will get the banks to change. Public mood and pressure will get the banks to change. To its credit, as a whole the banking sector has made big improvements. Of course, if you do not have some legal authority over the banks they will just slip back with their bank closure protocols and improved standards and bank fee-free accounts. The legal authority over the banks comes from the Reserve Bank and the ACCC, which are presently monitoring the banks' behaviour. </para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President Campbell, I am sure that in some way I have helped in convincing you and those on the other side that this government is not in the pocket of the banks, as you would so like to paint us. Far from that. Who would be? Honestlyâ we have all been singed by them. You talk about the rural sector. The rural sector knows only too well. Nothing hurt the rural sector more in the eighties and nineties, nothing singed the rural and farming sector more, than the high interest rates and the ruthlessness of the banks to claim their debts. But that is not forgotten. That is in the past and the banks have learnt a great deal from it.</para><para>We are not going to drop our guard at all on this particular matter. We are constantly monitoring the banks' behaviour and we are reflective of the public opinion with regard to the banking sector. So, all in all, we again reject Senator Conroy's general business motion and we simply ask him that when he has to deliver it againâand he will, just as a filler for a Thursdayâhe update his notes. We really do ask Senator Conroy to update his notes and to stop plagiarising the policies, because they are so out of date now. Most of the policies he would claim as his have been put in place by the banks. That is because they were always the banks' policies in the first place. This government does not believe in regulation, unlike the opposition. We in this government believe we can direct the banks in a proper manner to bring them to a social and legal responsibility.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>26605</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, George (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator George Campbell)</inline>âOrder!

I do so in the context of the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, on 13 August 2001, in which he announced the agreement with the United States that was concluded in Washington on 31 July 2001 which facilitates the sale of Australian uranium to Taiwan. This agreement is consistent with Australia's role as a major supplier of energy and mineral commodities to Taiwan. It builds on the very special commercial relationship that we have with Taiwan, in that they are a major market for our coal, iron ore, wool and manufactured goods. On this night in Taipei there are Mitsubishi cars being driven around that were made in Adelaide. It is very important that, in future sales of other energy sources, uranium be included in our market to them.</para></talk.start><para>All of Australia's uranium is exported for exclusively peaceful purposes under bilateral safeguards agreements. Australia currently has 15 such agreements in place, covering 25 countries. One is with the European Atomic Energy Community, EURATOM, and Australia can be very proud that its network of nuclear bilateral safeguards agreements complements and builds upon the International Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards regime. Australia has a very close but non-formal relationship with Taiwan. Australia, however, recognises that Taiwan has legitimate energy needs and that it has chosen nuclear power as part of its energy mix. Accordingly, an agreement has been concluded with the United States providing for Australian uranium to be enriched in the United States, after which it would be possible for it to be transferred to Taiwan. Australian uranium destined for the Taiwan market will therefore be covered by the nuclear safeguards agreement between Australia and the United States and by agreements between the United States, Taiwan and the IAEA. This arrangement is similar to one made by Canada in the early 1990s, I thinkâperhaps in 1993.</para><para>Taiwan has made clear its strong commitment to nuclear non-proliferation by welcoming the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of 1995. Furthermore, it has accepted international safeguards on all its nuclear activities, including being amongst the first to implement the terms and conditions of the additional protocol for strengthening IAEA safeguards. Taiwan has publicly stated in its 2000 national defence report that its armed forces will not own, manufacture or use nuclear weapons. The agreement is consistent with Australia's strong stance on preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons while allowing the export of uranium for peaceful activities. It ensures that any transfer of Australian uranium to Taiwan is subject to IAEA safeguards and complies with Australian longstanding policies for control of nuclear materials. It is anticipated that this agreement will be tabled in the parliament this year and will enter into force once Australia completes its domestic requirements, subject to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I want to take this brief opportunity to welcome this action, because it builds on the unique and mutually beneficial commercial relationship that Australia has with Taiwan. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>26606</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to government documents were considered:</para><quote><para>Agreement between Australia and the Argentine Republic concerning Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy.

The Senate committees on which I serve have had a fair bit to do with AFMA, particularly in our inquiry into the proposals for changes to the management regime for the Northern Prawn Fishery. Having experienced its role in that inquiry and also in the estimates process, it is fair to say that AFMA is a very professional organisation dealing with an extremely important industry insofar as Australia and Australia's export task is concerned. The rock lobster fishery of Western Australia, the prawn fishery of Northern Australia and the fin fish fisheries of south-east Australia in particular contribute many millions of dollars to Australia's balance of payments.</para><para>In fact, last night representatives of the fishing industry hosted a function in this building to allow the Minister for Forestry and Conservation to attend and make a presentation together with officers of the various bodies who form the significant fishing industry that this country has the benefit of. Minister Wilson Tuckey made a presentation at that meeting indicating that over the next three weeks he was going to spend time going around the ports of Australia seeking submissions from representatives of the fishing industry on reforms that might be needed in the administration of the fishing industry by his department.</para><para>I thought that was a fairly interesting proposition to put. My understanding was that representatives of the industryâsome 22 of themâhave been involved for many months in putting together proposals for reform and a policy position which they wished to put to the minister and the federal government. In fact, they had drafted a position which was approaching a final draft. These 22 people had put in their time voluntarilyâthey had put in, as I say, many months of workâonly to be told by the minister that that was all to be trashed, that the consultative body that was established was to be wound up and that over the next three weeks Mr Tuckey, doing what I suspect will be a lap of honour of the fishing industry, was going to go around and gather the information for himself.</para><para>Minister Tuckey was not concerned, as I understood what he was saying, with what work had been put in. He is going to go around and ask people to direct their comments directly to him. Over the next three weeks he is going to form a view for the policy for the fishing industry for the next decade. He was saying to the gathering last night that people could not expect anything other than matters that were put to him over the next three weeks to be considered for policy over the next decade. I thought that was a bit of a liberty. I suspect that Mr Tuckey will not be the minister for fisheries after the next election and the policy position that is to be considered will probably be prepared by an incoming minister, and I suspect it will be an incoming minister in a Labor government. Be that as it may, I thought it was rather outrageous that the minister would wind up the work of a hardworking industry body of people who had volunteered their time and put a lot of work in, simply throw that in the wastepaper basket and say that in three weeks he was going to fulfil the task that they had spent many hours on in arriving at a policy position. </para><para>This portfolio area was not originally Mr Tuckey's. Mr Tuckey was the minister for forests initially. I gather he did not have enough work to do and Mr Truss found that he either did not have the time or did not have the interest in doing the work required in the fisheries part of the AFFA portfolio, so he handed that over to Mr Tuckey. Mr Tuckey, having managed to cast around and cause as many difficulties as he could in the forestry area and achieve absolutely nothing for the forestry industry, was given the fishing industry. I suppose the fishing industry will now say, judging from Mr Tuckey's performance, that he will achieve just as much for the fishing industry as he has achieved for the forestry industryâabsolutely nothing.</para><para>I understood that Mr Tuckey was rewarded with a ministry because of the work he put in in the last campaign when he represented the government's position on the GST to the racing industry. He had a big win there. He told the racing industry that, as a result of laws that his government would put in place, every person who owned a racing animal with a reasonable prospect of earning prize money would be able to register for the GST and claim back their GST inputs as business credits. I gather that about 20 per cent of people who race animals in the thoroughbred industryâand a lot fewer I suspect in the harness racing and greyhound racing industryâare able to do that. So he had about a 15 per cent to 20 per cent success rate in terms of his promises in those areas.</para><para>Mr Tuckey is now going around telling the fishing industry that he is going to reform the fishing industry as a result of a three-week tour of duty around the fishing industry. I suspect that in reality the fishing industry is very angry with Minister Tuckey, at the arrogance that the minister has displayed in trashing the work of the industry's representatives, in telling the industry that he will know best in a portfolio that he has had for five minutes and in telling them that if they do not tell him what he wants to hear and he does not promulgate a policy they will not get another chance for 10 years. He will deliver on that, I suspect, as much as he delivered on his promises to the racing industryâto a very small proportion.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>26608</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, George (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator George Campbell)</inline>âOrder!

One of the areas I want to explore concerns the potential social, cultural and economic impacts of AIDS in our region if the response that we make to the spreading pandemic is not a coordinated one.</para></talk.start><para>I am pleased to see that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, has made the fight against AIDS a top priority. He says:</para><quote><para>AIDS has become the primary cause of death in Africa, but let no-one imagine it is only an African problem. Parts of South-East Asia are not much better off, and we may well be about to see an explosion of new infections in south Asia.</para></quote><para>Kofi Annan has proposed an international fund to fight AIDS and other infectious diseases. I think it is important to place this on the record in the context of the sixth International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, known as ICAAP, and the ministerial council meeting which the foreign affairs minister, the Hon. Alexander Downer, is convening in October this year.</para><para>We have a pandemic in HIV-AIDS that has the capacity to devastate the countries of the Asia-Pacific region on a similar scale to its impact in much of Africa. In the year 2000, an estimated 700,000 adults in the regionâ250,000 of them womenâbecame infected with HIV-AIDS, and deaths as a result of infection increased by 47 per cent. At the start of this year, an estimated 6.4 million people in Asia and the Pacific were living with HIV-AIDS. Although Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV, it is spreading faster in South Asia and South-East Asia.</para><para>The UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV-AIDS, which took place in June this year, occurred only six months after the General Assembly decided to convene the session to mount an urgent response to this global crisis. Some would observe that, for the United Nations, moving that quickly to convene that sort of special session within six months is a very prompt response. During the three days of the UNGASS, member states, intergovernmental organisations, United Nations agencies, and civil society and private sector partners explored their potential collaboration in mounting an expanded response to the pandemic.</para><para>Australia's Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon. Michael Wooldridge, addressed the Special Session and explained to delegates and participants how Australia has fought the pandemic here and that that has largely been governed by what he described as a `political consensus', supported by all elements of the political system and endorsed by the Australian community at large. He noted that government willingness to engage and work with those most vulnerable to the virus is extremely important. As a result of that, he further noted that the Australian government and other Australian participants were somewhat disappointed that some groups, after extensive negotiation, were not to be named in the final declaration of commitment. They included particularly vulnerable groups like sex workers, injecting drug users, prison populations and indigenous people.</para><para>In Australia, conversely, the support and commitment of those groups and their active involvement and partnership have been a significant part of the basis on which the Australian national response to HIV-AIDS has been founded. AIDS activism and countering the spread of HIV have been directed towards constructive participation in this country, not destructive protest, and towards participation assessed on a sensible and logical process, not guided by concerns, biases and, some might say, bigotries in relation to some groups in the community.  </para><para>I want to particularly note youth involvement in the special session. One of several activities organised with young people in the run-up to the special session was to highlight their roles in fighting HIV-AIDS.</para><para>The Declaration of Commitment is the official outcome document of the 26th Special Session and it recognised that in the Asia-Pacific region there are 7.5 million HIV positive people. Importantly, the declaration also recognised that stigma, silence, discrimination and denialâas well as a lack of confidentialityâundermine prevention, care and treatment efforts and only go to increase the impact of the pandemic.</para><para>I want to briefly speak about the sixth ICAAP, which will be held from 5 to 10 October this year in Melbourne. It is cosponsored by UNAIDS and the AIDS Society of Asia and the Pacific and should attract over 3,000 delegates. It will gather those involved in HIV-AIDS work, primarily from the Asia-Pacific region, and combine science, advocacy and community development in one event. This biannual ICAAP is the major conference for AIDS organisations and workers in the region. The previous ICAAPâthe fifthâwas convened in Kuala Lumpur by Marina Mahathir.</para><para>The co-convenors of the Australian ICAAPâthey are exceptional peopleâare Professor Rob Moodie, Professor Dennis Altman and Robin Gorna, who, with a team of supporters, have been putting an enormous amount of work into convening this conference. It is strongly supported by ministers Wooldridge and Downer, and it has received financial support from both federal and state governments. </para><para>It presents both challenges and opportunities to better understand the global pandemic and how it affects our region and what strategies can be adopted in our region to prevent the spread of HIV. The diversity of HIV in Asia and the Pacific adds to the challenge, but I think it also creates opportunities to learn from one another and to apply that knowledge more broadly across the world. The scientific program has become more inclusive and reflects the multisectorial nature of the impact of and response to AIDS.</para><para>The structure of the scientific program of the sixth ICAAP will break away from the traditional conference disciplines and will be organised around four specific crosscutting themes: treatment and care, prevention, socioeconomic determinants, and sexuality and gender. As well as the ICAAP conference, there will be major activities and satellites taking place in conjunction with it, including, importantly, a youth forum to ensure young people a voice at the congress. ICAAP recognises that HIV demands from the whole region a unified response. This conference will enable us to share knowledge and experience and to learn from each other. It will also help focus public and media attention on the growing severity of this issue in our region.</para><para>During ICAAP, a regional ministerial meeting on HIV-AIDS and development will be held on 9 and 10 October. Alexander Downer, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, will be hosting the meeting of senior officials and ministers from the region as a complementary event but separate from ICAAP itself. I want to congratulate the minister on this initiative. It is aimed at bringing together not just health ministers, because that is easy. You can bring together health ministers to discuss HIV-AIDS and its impact on your community, but its impact in a developing region like the Asia-Pacific is so much broader than that that it needs to be a broader ministerial conferenceâand that is what the minister is bringing together. Its aim is to secure broad political commitment to increase national and regional efforts to counter the escalating HIV-AIDS problem. It will build on the energy and commitments, for example, from the 26th declaration made during the UN General Assembly Special Session earlier this year and discuss regional responses to the epidemic with both key multilateral agencies and regional neighbours. Most importantly, it follows from a call at the fifth ICAAP for a summit of regional leaders to better coordinate efforts in recognising the transboundary nature of HIV-AIDS. They will be able to explore things like poverty as a driver of HIV-AIDS, the macro-economic impacts of HIV-AIDS, the cost-effectiveness of prevention versus treatment, HIV-AIDS and security issues and the impact of HIV-AIDS at a micro-economic level.</para><para>The government recognises the importance of this forum for highlighting the global AIDS crisis and developing appropriate cross-disciplinary responses to it. Last year the government launched a six-year $200 million global HIV-AIDS initiative, most of which is dedicated to assisting our partner countries in the Asia-Pacific region. We have played a pivotal role in that area in pursuing innovative responses in partnership with many of those countries, and I will just cite a couple of those. In Indonesia, religious groups are working together in a campaign to encourage people to avoid infection. Sex workers in the Philippines are finding effective ways of educating one another in the use of condoms. Peer education is proving highly effective at informing young Pacific islanders about HIV-AIDS. In Africa, volunteer carers are helping to look after the sick and rebuild community values. And so the list goes onâfrom puppet shows in Laos to new health clinics in Papua New Guinea where Australian efforts are pivotal. These are important cooperative processes which recognise the threat that the epidemic poses to perhaps reversing decades of development in some countries. The breadth of the impact of HIV on these countries cannot be underestimated and Australia has a very effective leadership role to play in fighting this epidemic.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Caravan Park Rentals</title><page.no>26610</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>26610</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to speak on an issue that has been a source of great hypocrisy and many broken promises made by numerous government members in the House of Representatives. The application of the GST on caravan park and mobile home rents has fully exposed members of the current government as a heartless group of individuals only interested in their own welfare. The decision by the government, in collaboration with the Democrats, to apply the GST to caravan park and mobile home rents is one of the most callous and cruel acts undertaken by this government since their election in 1996âand we have seen a lot of those from this government since that time. We have seen them slash funding to health, education and aged care and strip back the rights of working Australians. But this tax and its application to the most vulnerable and, in many cases, the most impoverished members of our society is nothing short of despicable. I cannot understand why the government and the Democrats did not exempt the rent of caravan park and mobile home residents from the GST in their secret, closed-door GST deal made last year.</para></talk.start><para>We now have the bizarre situation where, if you rent a regular house or unit with a fixed street address, you pay no GST on rent, but if you live in a caravan or a mobile home, which usually means you are on a low income and do not have a lot of money to throw around, then you get slugged. If you rent a caravan at Kincumber Nautical Village on the Central Coast or a caravan at Edgewater Caravan Park on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, you get slugged, but if you rent a trendy high-rise unit in Potts Point in inner city Sydney or one in North Sydney you are exempt.</para><para>It is no wonder that, in his memo to John Howard, Liberal Party federal president Shane Stone said, `We have been just âtoo trickyâ on some issues, for example, GST on caravan parks.' But it would appear that John Howard and his government have not taken the advice of Shane Stone and have just kept on being tricky with this issue. Last week, they deceitfully announced that they had provided GST relief to caravan park and mobile home residents when they have in fact done nothing of the sort. The government has merely made available to caravan park owners the option of not charging the GST. The catch is that, if caravan park owners are gullible enough to take up this new option, they will have to forgo the GST collected on site feesâa cash flow that that they currently use for up to three months before the moneys must be remitted to the Taxation Office.</para><para>John Howard is therefore relying on the selflessness and philanthropy of caravan park owners, hoping and praying no doubt that they will have kinder hearts than he has. The fact is that this is not a solution to this problem and it is not a relief for caravan park and mobile home residents. It is simply another trick from this government, and I do not think that caravan park and mobile home residents are going to fall for it.</para><para>I especially fail to believe that the thousands of caravan park and mobile home residents in the seats of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast and Lyne on the New South Wales mid-North Coast are going to be deceived any more by the deceitfulness being practised by their local federal members around this issue. They have had enough of it. Mr Jim Lloyd, the member for Robertson, told a group of caravan park residents at a public meeting at the Central Coast Leagues Club in June last year that he would be taking their concerns about the GST on caravan parks to Canberra and to the Prime Minister himself. This was reported in the local paper in Gosford, and people present at the meeting like Trish Moran, who is Labor's candidate for Robertson at the next election, have relayed this same story to me.</para><para>The member for Robertson stood up there in front of all those justifiably angry caravan park residents and promised them that he would take up this issue for them and take it directly to Canberra. But, since that time, has Mr Lloyd stood up once in parliament and outlined to the House of Representatives and put on the record his support for caravan park residents in his electorate? No, he has not. He promised the 1,750 caravan park residents living in his electorate that he was going to fight for them, but in fact he has done nothing. And he clearly has not taken the issue up with the Prime Minister when the best relief John Howard can offer residents paying the GST on their rents in Tingara Village at Terrigal or at Ettalong Beach Village in Ettalong is a tricky and deceptive announcement about a bottle of Clayton's GST relief that he has stuffed up his sleeveâthe GST relief you get when you are not really being given any relief at all. </para><para>Caravan park and mobile home residents in the federal electorate of Lyne are also not going to be deceived by this tricky move on the part of the government. They have become aware of the deceitful character of their local member, the Hon. Mark Vaile. During the 1998 election campaign, Minister Vaile distributed a pamphlet promising that his government would not be applying the GST to caravan park rents. I would like to read a short quote from Minister Vaile's pamphlet:</para><quote><para>I would like to reassure you that residents who occupy accommodation in a caravan park or holiday village on a permanent basis will not have to pay GST on their site fees. This will be treated the same way as rental of a house or unit and is GST free.</para></quote><para>What a great whopper of a lie. After being given this promise by their local member, within two years residents at parks such as the Lighthouse Beach Caravan Park and the Rainbow Beach Caravan Park in Port Macquarie have had their rents increased through the imposition of the GST on site fees. So when this government stands up and says that they are going to be providing relief to the almost 3,000 caravan park and mobile home residents living in the electorate of Lyne, I think these residents have a right to be very sceptical. And sceptical they should be. The recent announcement by the government that they will be providing relief to caravan park residents is misleading and an outright lie. The only way that caravan park and mobile home residents will be given any relief is if the GST directly applied to site fees is removed. And only the Labor Party has promised to do this. Only Labor will provide long overdue relief for battling caravan park and mobile home residents. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Social Welfare</title><page.no>26612</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>26612</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âBefore I commence my contribution, I would like to congratulate Senator Payne on the remarks she made on HIV-AIDS. It is an issue we all need to be aware of. Having lost a friend to HIV-AIDS, I know just what an important issue it is.</para></talk.start><para>Since this government came into power we have seen a rise in the penalties imposed on those receiving benefits. It seems that it is their fault, or one would be forgiven for thinking that it is if you view the penalties imposed. In the last week a report has been handed down entitled `Working towards a national homelessness strategy'. The fact that at this time we have to commission such a report is an indictment of our society and further proof that the current system has been hijacked by short-sighted ends. Simply put, to ensure that those who are in want have reasonable housing would most likely save money for everyoneâthrough reduced health-care costs, for example. </para><para>When we examine some of the causes of this occurrence we see that the philosophy of mutual obligation is one of the problems. Thus we see a one-sided system where the poor and disadvantaged are harassed and threatened with poverty, degradation and homelessness through ill-conceived punitive policies that are not about helping the unemployed find work; rather they are about punishing those who through no fault of their own cannot find work. In other words, if we are rich we can gamble, we can drink and have a great time, but if we are poor we will be chastised for even having the desire to do those things. I am not suggesting that overindulging in those behaviours will lead to anything other than problems, but the suggestion that being poor should result in an exemplary lifestyle is a bit rich. This was the implication of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Abbott, when he was reported as suggesting that being poor was the person's own fault. This is the easy way for the government to find a way out of the duty of government that is entrenched in our cultureâto provide the possibility of at least a safe place to live, adequate health care and education, a basic wage and a certain amount of freedom from coercion or undue surveillance. </para><para>Many of the basic tenets of mutual obligation border on undue coercion. A young man recently came into my electorate office. He had moved from South Australia to Tasmania. He had run into a bit of trouble in South Australia and wanted to spend some time with his grandmother. Due to the fact the area his grandmother lived in had a higher unemployment rate than where he had come from in South Australia, he was initially told he could not receive benefits. Thus the nature of the young to wander was curtailed andâworseâhe was punished. People with housing problems are often typecast as vagrants or unemployed. However, as an article on 11 July 2001 in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> states, up to seven per cent of people accessing the Exodus Foundationâa charity organisation in Ashfieldâwere in full employment. I would suggest that this is merely the tip of the iceberg as many people in need are too proud to access charitable organisations. Some would rather soldier on than ask for help. </para><para>Before I came into this place I was teaching. Lots of my teacher friends tell me that there are children whose parents are working but that these kids come to school having had no breakfast and with no lunch because, even though the parents are working, they are poor and are too proud to ask for help. So some of the schools where I live are providing breakfasts, particularly for these children. This fact is supported by the Reverend Bill Crews, who has stated that the working poor are reluctant to ask for help because of their embarrassment about relying on charity. They feel that if they are working they should not have to get help. This again is indicative of what is happening in some schools. Captain Glen Whittaker of the Salvation Army suggested in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 11 July:</para><quote><para>There are definitely people who are left behind on the poverty issue.</para></quote><para>He also said:</para><quote><para>We still find people living in all aspects of poverty through no fault of their own.</para></quote><para>This tends to suggest that some aspects of poverty are structural. This is supported by the Smith Family, which found that up to 40 per cent or two in every five Australian families who were living in poverty had one or both adults working. On page 14 of the report `Working towards a national homelessness strategy' it states:</para><quote><para>Access to regular, stable employment is essential for preventing and reducing homelessness.</para></quote><para>Unless the wages paid are adequate, the degradation continues. In some ways, 100 years later, the `ragged trousered philanthropists' still exist. The working poor are real. A job in itself is not enough. This is why the current enthusiasm for breaching people is a total disgrace. ACOSS, in their recent report, bore testament to that enthusiasm. They state quite plainly that in their opinion there has been a 189 per cent increase in penalties in the last three years. This is not a drop of 189 per cent in unemployment but a massive increase in those being punished for not finding work. We see no notion of a fair go, but rather a notion of a bash at the downtrodden and underprivileged that results in dislocation and distress. This is hardly the Australian way.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Exchange Program: RAAF Edinburgh</title><page.no>26613</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>26613</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis evening I wish to speak in relation to what has been commonly called the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Scheme 2001. Senator McGauran and I were both participants in that and it was, to say the least, an extremely interesting exchange program. We have not got to that exchange yetâI understand that is still in the windâwhere we politicians have visited Australian Defence Force establishments but Australian Defence Force personnel have yet to visit the Senate or House of Representatives. The program I had the opportunity of going on was at the Edinburgh RAAF Base, which stood out as an excellent choice for the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Scheme.  </para></talk.start><para>The program at Edinburgh highlighted a range of activities that seemed to meet the expectations of what a parliamentary scheme could be about. The purpose of the scheme was, amongst other things, to provide politicians with an overview and experience of the elements of the Defence Force. This is so that we, as elected representatives, can play a more informed and constructive part in the national defence debate. The Edinburgh RAAF Base, as we know, plays an integral role in Australia's defence capabilities. It is home for a wide variety of units and functions within the Australian Air Force. The base provides an opportunity for program participants to gain a first-hand knowledge of the personnel that comprise the operations at the Edinburgh RAAF Base and also to understand the workings of the various units that are there. In the brief time available, the program attempted and, I believe, successfully managed to touch upon as many of these roles and functions as could possibly be squeezed into a week without compromising the outcomes.</para><para>Taking a snapshot of the week in July, it encompassed visiting 1 Recruit Training Unit, 1 Radar Surveillance Unitâwhat is commonly referred to as over-the-horizon radar or the Jindalee siteâa maritime patrol group, the Aircraft Research and Development Unit and the Institute of Aviation Medicine and the various subunits within those broad units that I have mentioned. This range of activities permitted the Air Force to exhibit the professional commitment of its personnel at the base, to draw attention to the technical side of the work and to underscore that there are costs to maintaining personnel, not only in money terms but also in social terms. For instance, the personnel are required to be away from their families when taking interstate postings and are required on occasion to undertake arduous training tasks and the like.</para><para>Time did not permit the visiting of a number of the units at the RAAF Base Edinburgh, and I sincerely hope I have not left any of them out of the following list: 1 Airfield Defence Squadron, 44 Wing (Air Traffic Control), 24 Squadron (Reserves) and the Joint Logistics Unit in South. This acknowledgement will, as is often the case, not encompass everybody at Edinburgh. However, it does provide a flavour of the diverse roles performed at the base and provide some excuse that one week is insufficient time to visit even some of the elements of the base. Clearly, I could have spent more time at the places I did visit and would have liked to, but the program was intended to give us an appreciation of the work and not so much to participate in it.</para><para>In the end, the program drew out units on the base that would meet the objectives of the ADF Parliamentary Schemeâthat is, to improve our understanding of the Australian Defence Force. Its execution of the scheme at the base ran with military precision that was impressive to observe and be part of. They managed to schedule everything in, within minutes taking us from one place to the next, and the XO or executive officer managed to follow us throughout that and ensure that the handovers were smooth between the various units on the RAAF base. </para><para>Special mention should also be made of the many civilians employed on the base who perform a wide range of tasks that can sometimes be overlooked as being significant contributions to Australia's defence capabilities. The brief visit did not directly encompass this group but I would like to acknowledge their contribution and say that their presence did not go unnoticed. In going to the various units, we had an opportunity to see the civilians in action in joint work with the Defence Force and it was impressive to behold the interactions and the personnel working constructively to achieve end products.</para><para>During the week in July, of the many activities we participated in, two areas stood out as worth mentioning, not because they were exciting or interesting but because they typified the work at the RAAF Edinburgh base. This of course is not to neglect the other areas. The first area involved the recruits and their instructors. The time I spent with the recruits struck a couple of long forgotten memories from when I was a recruit. It also reminded me of the importance of investing time and energy in achieving a high standard in both the recruits and their role models, the instructors. The instructors stood head and shoulders above any instructors I had known. They imbued the troops with a sense of urgency, excitement and interest in the RAAF. I can only say that the recruits who were moving through 1 RTU and their instructorsâI participated in some of their workâ were just brilliant in the execution of their work.</para><para>The second area, which I found particularly helpful in gaining an appreciation of the base, was the Maritime Patrol Group. This area was new and fascinating to me. The MPG have a significant role and responsibility as the surveillance platform in the maintenance of the sovereignty of Australia's coastal and maritime economic zones. The Maritime Patrol Group also undertake the more visible role in search and rescue operations off our coastline. They explained that this job is the smaller part of the many activities performed by the Maritime Patrol Group. I had the opportunity to accompany a crew, captained by Flight Lieutenant Jacob Antunovich of No. 11 Squadron of the Maritime Patrol Group, on a number of training activities out of Edinburgh. The training exercise provided a terrific opportunity to observe first-hand the crew performing their roles in an operational setting. I was impressed beyond measure by the cohesive and businesslike manner with which the crew went about their assigned tasks. It did strike me that this purposiveness is sometimes lacking, and not easily emulated, in civilian work settings.</para><para>The program, to my relief, was not a boot camp for politicians. I have done that, so I was a little apprehensive that the program could be perceived as such, and to do so would have undermined the true worth of the program. I was pleased to see that the doors of the base had been removed and that I had an opportunity to speak to people openly and frankly about conditions on the base and about their experiences in both at work and social setting. The program provided a good balance between a demonstration of the capabilities of the Air Force at Edinburgh and how its people interact on the base and in performing their duties. </para><para>The test for the program being worth while, in my mind, is whether I would recommend it to others. The answer is a clear yes. When I went back for a debrief to look at how you could improve it, we came up with very little other than perhaps a few more rest stops for the weary. The program provided a rewarding and informative experience. It assisted in my gaining a greater understanding of the Australian Defence Force, and in turn I had an opportunity to provide various personnel some understanding about how the Senate operates and what is required to work here.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone who helped in the ADF Parliamentary Program. It is always fraught with danger to single out any one person; nevertheless, a special thanks must go to Air Marshall Angus Houston both for making it happen and for allowing personnel under his command to open their doors without reservation to a politician. Last but not least, I also thank the invisible armyâthe spouses, partners, parents and childrenâwho allow it all to happen on the base.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 6.49 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>26615</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>26615</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Census and Statistics ActâAustralian Bureau of StatisticsâStatement No. 2 of 2001.</para><para>Health Insurance ActâHealth Insurance (Accredited Pathology Laboratories â Approval) Amendment Principles 2001 (No. 3).</para><para>National Health ActâPrivate Patients' Hospital CharterâNHA73F1/2001.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indexed Lists of Files</title><page.no>26615</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following document was tabled pursuant to the order of the Senate of 30 May 1996 as amended 3 December 1998:</para><quote><para>Indexed lists of departmental and agency files for the period 1 January to 30 June 2001âStatements of complianceâDepartment of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>26616</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Aged Care Portfolio: Value of Market Research</title><page.no>26616</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3391)</subtitle><id.no>3391</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>26616</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 29 January 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	What was the total value of market research sought by the department and any agencies of the department for the 1999-2000 financial year.</para><para>(2)	What was the purpose of each contract let.</para><para>(3)	In each instance: (a) how many firms were invited to submit proposals; and (b) how many tender proposals were received.</para><para>(4)	In each instance, which firm was selected to conduct the research.</para><para>(5)	In each instance: (a) what was the estimated or contract price of the research work; and (b) what was the actual amount expended by the department or any agency of the department.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>26616</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>To provide a complete answer to this question would require considerable time and resources and I am not prepared to ask my Department to divert them from health priorities at this time.</para><para>However, each year the Department reports on consultancies in its Annual Report.
