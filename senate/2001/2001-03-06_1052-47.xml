To put Mr Beazley into the Lodge they will do whatever it takes. When we introduced the new tax system, we compensated pensioners up front for any one-off price increases. Scare merchants like Mr Beazley, Mr Swan and Senator Evans over here find it easier to scare elderly Australians rather than tell them the truth. This behaviour is despicable.</para></talk.start><para>The fact is that the government have introduced a number of beneficial measures for pensioners and allowees way over and above anything the previous government was ever prepared to do for them. We increased pensions by four per cent on 1 July 2000. It was clear to the opposition at the time—Mr Simon Crean identified it in the GST package that he sent out—that that four per cent increase comprised a two per cent real increase forever and a day and a two per cent advance on the indexation. On top of that, we increased the income and asset test free areas by 2½ per cent, we increased the pensioner rebate and we reduced the pensioner withdrawal rate from 50 per cent to 40 per cent. All of those things were good for pensioners.</para><para>Do not forget that it was this government that legislated to ensure that pensions at all times would be either 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings or the CPI, whichever is the greater. In contrast, Labor did this only twice—not regularly, just every now and then. They liked the idea of pensions being 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings but they were not prepared to regularly do it. They did not have the guts to enshrine it in legislation. It was another short-term trick by them using smoke and mirrors to deceive elderly Australians. </para><para>When Labor increased the wholesale sales tax by two per cent in 1993-94—having gone to the people saying that they did not want indirect taxes, never mentioning an increase, and then coming into this parliament and increasing indirect taxes—they did not increase pensions and allowances at the same time, unlike this government. When we changed the tax system and there was a potential increase in prices, we paid compensation and paid it in advance. Labor, when they were in power, increased taxes on pensioners and refused to do anything about it—not a cent in advance. </para><para>The government's advance has cost over $540 million, and that is an extra $540 million in the pockets of pensioners and allowees that they would never have got if Labor was in power. How can Mr Beazley claim that we are ripping pensioners off? Either he cannot add up or, more likely, he will engage in any underhand trick and scare campaign to get himself to the Lodge, regardless of the distress he selfishly creates in the community. Anything it takes to get him into the Lodge—that is what this is about. Let us reduce it to its simplest. You people put up taxes by two per cent and you never passed on any compensation to pensioners, let alone in advance. We introduced the GST. We had a one-off, two per cent, forever-and-a-day increase and two per cent in advance. You never did it. You were hopeless when you were in power. You said you wanted pensions to be 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, but why did you not legislate for it?</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

It deals with an issue that is very important to many Australians—that is, the issue of drugs. Today I launched the ABCI report on illicit drugs in Australia. That report outlines a comprehensive situation in relation to illicit drugs in Australia and internationally. This report has received international acclaim, but what is important is that at the outset it acknowledged that, due to the increased cooperation between law enforcement agencies, there have been record seizures of illicit drugs. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, ought to listen to this and stop being so negative when he puts forward Labor's so-called plan in relation to drugs. In this report we have an acknowledgment of the excellent work that law enforcement agencies are doing across Australia, with record seizures.

Since the instigation of this government's Tough on Drugs policy we have seen $1.24 billion worth of drug seizures. We have seen an increase in the seizure of illicit drugs of 300 per cent. This is what the mums and dads of Australia want; this is what the people of Australia want.

Of that, $220 million is going to diversion plans for those people who have a drug problem, and $120 million is going to the illicit drugs strategy, which has seen results with drug seizures. Also, and importantly, we have seen the setting up of the National Schools Drug Education Council—the first time that any national government has ever done this in relation to educating the next generation of Australians against drug abuse. But what do we have from the opposition? We have less than a page on education matters on drug abuse—education that is so vital for the next generation of Australians.</para><para>The ABCI report also alerted us to the fact that modern organised crime uses technology and other means to perpetrate its ill-gotten ways.

Senator, you raised the issue of the government's particular actions in relation to the indexation of petrol. The government has taken action, and that action is widely welcomed. The question is whether the Labor Party, with its alleged concern—which it has purported—will support the abolition of automatic indexation on petrol. I have not heard anyone in the Labor Party say that they are supporting that. After question time today I think there could be a good debate on this, and Senator Collins, given her particular concern, may clarify Labor's position on this. I know it is difficult for the Labor Party to reach a policy position—I have said that before—but this is quite an important one. The further point I make to Senator Collins, coming from Victoria, is: is Premier Bracks going to take steps, like the Commonwealth government has taken, to ameliorate the price of petrol by providing a subsidy like the Premier of Queensland does?

It has been a matter of particular concern that when you get outside some of the major regional centres, and indeed the metropolitan capital cities, you will find very patchy mobile phone coverage. That is why the government was able to announce last week with great pleasure the outcome of a competitive tender process which saw Vodafone nominated as the preferred tenderer to receive $25 million, which will be of direct benefit to almost 10 million mobile phone users along almost 10,000 kilometres of 11 major highways around Australia.</para></talk.start><para>That is a huge breakthrough not just for those who live near the highways in rural areas but also for families, truck drivers, contractors and all sorts of small business people. In other words, virtually every Australian at one time or another will be travelling on these highways. We estimate that there are something like one million trips a day made on these 11 highways alone. This is the GSM network—the digital technology that has now been available for some years—but it is being matched progressively by Telstra with its CDMA rollout, and we expect that to lead to Telstra expediting the process as well. In non-metropolitan areas we will have two high quality competing mobile telephone services. That is very good news.

He is effectively putting Australians on notice that whenever any initiatives are announced for those outside the capital cities they will be dismissed as bribes. I presume that means that the Labor Party will not be announcing any promises of its own, because they would constitute bribes as well. Or is the Labor Party so one-sided and narrow that it regards anything that the government does as a bribe and anything that the Labor Party does as somehow helpful? History speaks for itself. Labor's track record over 13 years in government and five years in opposition has been of total disinterest. They put out press releases every day of the week, but you never see any welcoming announcements about additional spending on telecommunications facilities, additional rollouts, social bonus programs—a whole raft of initiatives that we have supported, promoted and funded. There has been not a word from the Labor Party.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Schacht is the high watermark. He wanted to freeze that program—stop it dead in its tracks—during the last election. That will be a very fitting epitaph when he leaves the Senate in the middle of next year. Quite clearly, the Labor Party has no interest at all in ensuring the rollout. It is not prepared to even welcome government initiatives. It was never prepared to promise to spend an equal amount or anything like it. In other words, it is not prepared to look at the concerns of people in rural areas. All it is really interested in doing is getting down into the gutter, as we have seen today. That is where the fundamental difference will become even more apparent in the months ahead.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aged Care: Accommodation Places</title><page.no>22583</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>22583</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care.

That is the hypocrisy. None of this hand-wringing about the harm and misery that flows from problem gambling. I think the Productivity Commission found something like 300,000 problem gamblers around Australia. That is a very serious social policy issue, and Labor has been absolutely silent on it and not prepared to draw any connection with the interactive gaming industry; it is simply prepared to run the party line—a party line that benefits it very directly from the gambling and gaming industries. If we want to hear any more about hypocrisy, there will be plenty more.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>22588</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—No matter how hard Senator Alston might strive to make this into a debate about gambling, this is a debate about ministerial propriety and a conflict of interest. Let me put it straight on the table: if we want to have a debate about gambling, let us have one. But let us not have it now as a way of muddying what is clearly a case of ministerial misconduct—and that from a government whose Prime Minister announced, when he came to office, that there would be a new standard of ministerial conduct. This is the new standard: tolerate conflicts of interest as though they do not exist.</para></talk.start><para>Let us get a clear statement of the facts on the record. The facts are these. One, McGauran Altona Pty Ltd owns the Millers Inn hotel in Altona North and, in that hotel, the 70 poker machines that are operated by the hotel. Two, the Peter John McGauran family trust has a one-sixth interest in McGauran Altona Pty Ltd. Three, therefore Minister Peter McGauran has a direct commercial interest in the hotel and by extension in the poker machines operated by the hotel which, as Senator Faulkner says, register an annual total player loss of $4.63 million, that is to say, $4.63 million is lost by workers and their families in that region of Victoria. Four, the members' register of interest lodged in this parliament enables you, if you are diligent, to trace through the interconnecting web of trusts and companies to establish that the hotel is owned as I have set out, but it does not enable anyone to trace through the web of interconnecting companies to establish the ownership of the poker machines. That is a failure, and a clear one, in the register of members' interests, because the ownership of the poker machines within the hotel is the key operative in this conflict of interest case. The fifth point that has to be borne in mind is that when Minister McGauran was acting minister for communications he announced a bill which would place a moratorium on online and interactive gambling and, as a minister, took that bill through the House of Representatives. At no point did he disclose his gambling interests in announcing the ban on online gambling or in taking that bill through the House of Representatives, when clearly a ban on online gambling benefits the 70 poker machines he owns and the poker machine industry per se. And that is the point: why didn't he declare his interests; why didn't he absent himself from the responsibility of doing this; and why didn't he make that conflict public? Of course, he now has reaped a commercial benefit.</para><para>The other point that is worth mentioning in this debate is that the family trust through which he conducts his affairs and which enables him to reap a commercial reward is taxed at a much lesser rate than companies. The McGauran family trust has been, unquestionably, of considerable commercial and financial advantage to the McGauran family. In the ANTS package brought into this parliament on 1 July—that is, the package that introduced the infamous GST—we were promised by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, that family trusts would be taxed at the exactly same rate as companies. Then he announced, in his first backflip, that he would defer doing that until 1 July 2001. Last week, in his second backflip, he announced that he was not going to do that now; he was going to defer the taxing of family trusts as companies indefinitely—in order to get him past the election, in order to get him past the vociferous complaints of the coalition partner, the National Party, and obviously in order to get him past the vociferous complaints of the many frontbenchers in the government who are beneficiaries from family trusts, including Senator Heffernan, who has a reported five—no less than five!—family trusts. So not only is there a conflict of interest. There is a conflict within the government in not honouring its commitment on ANTS, deferring it indefinitely and enabling people to benefit from it in the circumstances I have described. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>22589</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have heard some hypocrisy in this chamber, but I think this afternoon when we heard Senator Cook and others speak about conflict of interest and muddying of waters it was the most gross act of hypocrisy I have heard incorporated in a speech in this place for a very long time. Let us get conflict of interest on the table or, to use Senator Cook's words, let us get the facts out. Let us ask some questions here on conflict of interest which beg answers very clearly, along with any questions that Senator Cook may well have asked. Who are the beneficiaries of gambling that sit in this chamber? How many frontbenchers on the other side of this chamber have been or are directors of Labor clubs that donate to the Labor Party, and therefore are direct beneficiaries through a political party of which they are directors? Let us find out, for example, whether any members and senators on the other side of the chamber have ever been directors of the Canberra Labor Club—poker machines—the City Labor Club, the Ginninderra Labor Club, the Randwick Labor Club or the Sydney Labor Club, just to name a few. Let us know how many beneficiaries there are among the members and senators of the opposition who have served as directors of those Labor clubs. I am not saying that there is anything necessarily wrong with this. I am just saying that a conflict of interest question arises when a political party is a direct beneficiary of a club where poker machines exist. We are talking about conflict of interest. Senator Cook raised it and it was raised by other speakers including the Leader of the Opposition in this place. They talked about muddying the waters. They talked about clear statements of fact. Well, let us have them. Let us have them on the table. How many directors of the Labor clubs in Australia sit in this chamber and in the other place?</para></talk.start><para>We all know that problem gambling is rife in this country. Nobody knows it better than I do, as chair of the Senate select committee that looked into online gambling. We had some quite terrifying statistics which outlined the extent of problem gambling in this country. As patron of Pokies Anonymous in South Australia, I am very aware of the damage that is being done, particularly in the poorer suburbs of my own state of South Australia, by poker machines; and I am very, very concerned about them. Problem gamblers definitely exist in Australia. In fact, the Productivity Commission has estimated that approximately 130,000 Australians have severe problems with their gambling and a further 160,000 people are affected by problem gambling and may require treatment. If you look at families that are affected by problem gambling, there are hundreds of thousands of them.</para><para>Gamblers in New South Wales, interestingly enough, are the worst affected in Australia. They lose over $5 billion in gambling each year—over $1,000 of problem gambling losses per family. The direct beneficiary of those revenues is the Labor government of New South Wales under Premier Bob Carr. It is the state where poker machines were introduced into hotels on the basis that if they were removed from just being in clubs that would address the problem gambling issues. I find it interesting that one of the beneficiaries of the decision to introduce poker machines into hotels was none other than the police minister of New South Wales, Mr Whelan. I wonder how many poker machines are in Mr Whelan's clubs, whether Mr Whelan owns them and whether Mr Whelan has declared them? I have a 1996 press clipping here from the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline><inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline>. I seek leave to table it. It outlines police probes into the pub licence of the police minister, Mr Whelan. </para><para>Leave granted.</para><para>(<inline font-style="italic">Time</inline><inline font-style="italic">expired</inline>)</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>22590</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—You notice that the two coalition contributors have not defended the McGauran's at all—not once. We had one interjector when the words `family trusts' were mentioned and you would not have to be an Einstein to guess who that was: one of the masters of the webs of family trusts in this place. The government today has whinged about us scrutinising the behaviour and ethics of ministers. At question time yesterday, we raised several serious economic issues only to be met with bombast and polemics in response. Today, we ask this one crucial question: why didn't Minister McGauran indicate the massive benefit he and his family were deriving from poker machine gambling? Because of a complex company and family trust system, the gambling interests were not obvious to anyone. You can read Mr McGauran's declaration in the House of Representatives and you would not know he owned a poker machine. Unless you peel four or five layers back, you still would not get to know. It is all hidden away in this web of complex companies and family trusts.</para></talk.start><para>He should have made it clear. When he was handling this bill, Senator Hill, in the House of Representatives he should have actually said that he had gambling interests. His name is apparently up on the wall in that hotel as one of the licensees of the poker machines. A search of the record shows that his brother, Senator Julian McGauran, twice voted on the online gambling issue on 5 December 2000 without informing the Senate at the time that he too was deriving an income stream from poker machine revenue. We have said on the record that—and I do not want to be misquoted here—if it is explicit in your declaration of pecuniary interest, we regard it as a farce to have to get to your feet here and repeat it. But it was not explicit on Senator McGauran's form. He may have made it explicit in committee hearings and elsewhere but he did not do it in this particular chamber when he was obliged to do so.</para><para>It appears that the McGauran family trust is deriving approximately $1 million per year from poker machines. What does it do with this money? This company that controls the hotel and the poker machines bought 34,000 ordinary shares in the National Bank of Australia. Based on its latest price value, the value of those shares is $1,039,720. I can recall Senator McGauran, when debating the role of banks on 11 October 2000, saying:</para><quote><para>It is an area in which people on lower incomes are hit most and in the past banks unquestionably have been vigorous ... if not exploitative in regard to bank fees.</para></quote><para>But that does not stop you holding bank shares, does it? It does not stop you holding shares in banks that are guilty of these practices and are out making country closures and foreclosing on farmers. Oh, no. You have $1 million worth of shares in those particular institutions. And what an irony: these very bank shares are bought from the contribution of the battlers in Altona who have contributed through the poker machines. The McGauran family trust then buy shares in banks that in turn go and screw those battlers back down to the ground. That other side talks about hypocrisy. This is hypocrisy run mad.</para><para>There are members on all sides of the chamber who have genuine concerns about the addictive nature of gambling. What we are considering here is not a question of legality but a question of double standards. There is an absolutely clear benefit to the owners of existing poker machines to have online gambling banned. The federal government's legislation on online gambling will profit the McGaurans. Hence, there was an absolute need for them to declare their interest before the issue progressed. Whether they failed to do so deliberately or out of stupidity is not really relevant in the end. But do not worry; nothing will happen about it. The Prime Minister's code of conduct has proved to be a one day wonder. Mr Max Moore-Wilton will clear them. Meanwhile, the punters of Altona will continue to support the squattocracy whilst at the same time being hammered by the very banks that the McGaurans invest in.

I sought to draw to her attention today the report that was in the press yesterday. I thought the minister would have noticed this. It was in just about every major daily paper that I saw. It is very significant, because Sir Richard Doll is a very respected researcher around the world. In fact, 40 years or more ago, he first warned the world about the dangers of tobacco smoking. As we know, that was a very long and protracted debate in terms of whether a cause and effect could be shown between the smoking of cigarettes and cancer. Now we do accept that worldwide, and we have taken steps in government to limit the amount of advertising, for instance, on tobacco. It does not go anywhere near as far as the Democrats would like, and I wish to put a motion tomorrow related to the exemption that is granted for major events, including the running of the Grand Prix. We have seen a smorgasbord of advertising of tobacco products through that race, but that is beside the point that I want to make.</para><para>The issue here is childhood and even adult leukaemia and the links which Sir Richard Doll has drawn by reanalysing existing research. This is not new research; it is existing research. On the basis of his recommendations, the UK government is likely to indicate that there may well be health problems associated with living in close proximity to high voltage powerlines and that people ought to be warned about the situation. I think it flows from that that we should examine the standard setting so that we have proper mechanisms in place to protect people. As the Senate will be aware, the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee is currently looking into this question with regard to telecommunications, although we have had some evidence on the subject of powerlines too.</para><para>In the articles in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>yesterday, we were warned by Dr Bruce Hocking that the current safety standards allow much higher doses of electromagnetic radiation from powerlines than we currently have. He says that there was a fair amount of attention given to this question back in the 1990s, when very large pylon structures were being proposed through residential areas. I know the Northcote area in Melbourne was certainly in the midst of a very contentious public debate about whether these were safe. He points out too that more recently the interest in this question has shifted to mobile phones. Nonetheless, he suggests that this problem has not gone away. In fact, the UK work also suggests that asthma and depression may be linked to proximity to electrical facilities, including high voltage powerlines.</para><para>This is an interesting observation and something which warrants much greater attention. I think it is the government's responsibility to have an open mind on these questions and be prepared to fund research into them. We do know there has been an increase in depression, and perhaps there is an answer as to why that increase has occurred. I am disappointed the minister did not notice this article in the paper and did not prepare herself for the question. I think that it would be surprising if any of us here missed that article in the paper. I would like to see the government pay careful attention to this whole question and talk with the states about how people can be protected. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>22592</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Independence and Funding</title><page.no>22592</page.no><no.signed>91</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>TW4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Bourne</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</para><para>The petition of the undersigned calls on the Federal Government to support:</para><para>i.	the independence of the ABC Board;</para><para>ii.	the Australian Democrats Private Members' Bill which provides for the establishment of a joint Parliamentary Committee to oversee ABC Board appointments so that the Board is constructed as a multi-partisan Board, independent from the government of the day;</para><para>iii.	an immediate increase in funding to the ABC in order that the ABC can operate independently from commercial pressures, including advertising and sponsorship;</para><para>iv.	news and current affairs programming is made, scheduled and broadcast free from government interference, as required under law; and</para><para>v.

This includes:</para></quote><para>·	design:</para><para>·	site establishment and environmental controls:</para><para>·	demolition and excavation:</para><para>·	the treatment and removal of contaminated materials;</para><para>·	the backfilling and compaction of clean fill; </para><para>·	seawall protection works; and </para><para>·	management of contaminated groundwater. </para><quote><para>The estimated cost includes a construction contingency and a price indexation adjustment over the proposed remediation period.</para><para>The Committee has recommended that the proposed remediation proceed.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusions </inline></para><para>The Committee's key conclusions were:</para></quote><para>·	first, that contamination on the site is causing ongoing pollution to the Neutral Bay area and the surrounding environment;</para><para>·	secondly, that remediation of the site may mitigate Commonwealth's liability for the contamination of the site; and </para><para>·	thirdly, that the proposed work represents value for money and has potential to maximise the revenue return to the Commonwealth from a future sale. </para><quote><para>The Committee acknowledges that nearby residents have concerns about the remediation.  However, it believes two factors will minimise the impact of the proposed remediation on the amenity of local area.  They are:</para></quote><para>·	conditions imposed by the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales; and </para><para>·	actions proposed to be taken by the contractor over the time required to remediate the site. </para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Contamination</inline></para><para>The issue of most concern to all stakeholders is that of ground contamination - a legacy of a gas works constructed in the late 1800s.</para><para>The Committee found that the site is subject to contamination flowing from the ground beneath an adjacent residential property and that, under the remediation proposal, the Commonwealth would meet the costs of a contamination management system. </para><para>In the Committee's opinion, responsibility for drainage from the adjacent site is the responsibility of the New South Wales Government, both now and in the future.  The Committee is firmly of the view that the Commonwealth should be exempted from any future legal liability.</para><para>Accordingly, the Committee has made two recommendations:</para><para>First, it recommends that the Minister for Defence write to the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority, requesting that the Authority consider issuing an investigation order under Part 3 of the NSW Contaminated Land Management Act 1997 in respect of the adjacent property, and </para><para>Secondly, it recommends that the Department of Defence investigate the possibility of being compensated for:</para><para>(1)	any damage caused by the migration onto the former <inline font-style="italic">HMAS Platypus</inline> site of off-site contaminants; and </para><para>(2)	costs associated with remediation and installation of a management system for such contaminants.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Heritage issues</inline></para><para>In all its inquiries the Committee gives specific attention to heritage and environmental issues.  They must have priority in any proposed work submitted for consideration.  They can never be an afterthought. </para><para>The Committee believes that, where practicable, features of cultural and historical significance attached to public works should be preserved and bequeathed to future generations. </para><para>From time to time, the Committee has faced challenges in determining how others assess some features to be significant  - either culturally or historically.   </para><para>In the case of the remediation at Neutral Bay, the Committee had to assess how some in the community had come to see retaining walls, remnant pipes, traces of tar and other chemicals and a cliff profile as being in need of preservation.</para><para>The Committee expects that Defence will photograph and carefully document features of heritage and historical value that have been identified.  It should be done in consultation with the Australian Heritage Commission and the Australian National Archives.  </para><para>With respect to the heritage value of the cliff at the rear of the site, the Committee is of the opinion that a satisfactory solution would be to recreate a straight vertical face at the back of the site when excavations are completed.  Then, the cliff will continue to appear as it currently does, that is, a single excavation alongside the waterfront. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>In conclusion, I would like to thank the Department of Defence, and in particularly Mr Bernard Blackley and Mr Mathew Beggs for their assistance during the Inquiry. </para><para>The information provided to the Committee by the Department included an independent audit of the works costs and an independent legal opinion as to the Commonwealth's future liability with respect to the site.

These two bills are being debated together and seek to finally give effect to measures announced by this government as far back as 22 December 1999, and more recently in August last year. The <inline ref="R1172">Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Bill 2000</inline> seeks to widen the circumstances whereby reserves can be called out for continuous, full-time service. It initiates a process of modernising the structure and organisation of the reserves in Australia and empowers Defence to implement an employer support payment to compensate employers who incur additional expense and disruption because of the absence of an employee on extended reserve service.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1175">Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Bill 2000</inline> proposes a series of protections and benefits that will apply to various forms of service in the reserves. This includes a prohibition on discrimination in employment and rights to defer and resume studies and, in the case of compulsory service following call-out, to postpone certain financial liabilities. Labor will support the passage of these bills. Nevertheless, we do have a number of reservations about key aspects of the bills and will continue to emphasise the government's failure to properly address the full array of challenges that confront the defence reserves. Indeed, the government has failed on a number of key challenges. It has failed to articulate a coherent policy on the expected contribution of reservists and reserve units in the national defence effort of this country. The government has refused to reintroduce defence leave for reservists as an allowable award matter. It has failed to review its disastrous experiment with common induction training in the Army. It disgracefully neglected to implement employment and education protection measures before the deployment of reservists to East Timor.</para><para>The government has been unable to reverse the dramatic decline in recruitment levels in recent years and to address anomalies in pay and conditions for reservists. It has failed to properly manage the provision of training opportunities and necessary equipment and to clarify ongoing levels of funding for its announced measures beyond the current financial year. Finally, judging by community reaction to recent decisions in this regard, the government has clearly failed to consult adequately with relevant stakeholder groups. </para><para>Since the coalition government was elected to office, we have heard endless assertions in this place that the reserves will have to assume a growing proportion of our national defence effort. Yet, at the same time, the government has ruthlessly slashed the number of full-time Defence Force positions by approximately 8,000 as part of its Defence Reform Program. Like most other aspects of this government's reform agenda, a key driver has been its ideological commitment to outsourcing. The Peacock committee recently conveyed broad critical comment of stakeholders around this country in its consultation about our defence situation. Evidence suggests that commanders and rank and file troops are extremely critical of the situation that has arisen as a result of this ideological preoccupation with outsourcing and subcontracting.</para><para>The more the coalition crows about reservists needing to play a larger role in the Defence Force, the further recruitment has plummeted. Retention levels and the number of reservists actually fulfilling their training obligations have become issues of serious concern to people interested in these areas. In the 12 months to June, the number of active Army Reservists shrank by a massive 18 per cent—from just under 22,000 to less than 18,000. During the same period, the Army Reserve achieved only 33 per cent of its recruitment target. Both of these figures are from Defence's own recent annual report. This is a set of figures that the Howard government should have little pride in.</para><para>In comprehending the seriousness of the recruitment position of the Army Reserves, it is worthwhile analysing comparative data for the eight years commencing in July 1992. In the first six of those years, the Army Reserve managed an average of 4,800 recruits each year. During that period, the year by year variation was quite small, ranging between 4,300 and 5,800. In contrast, despite the government's constant rhetoric in every policy area about the 13 years of Labor government, over the last two years of the Howard administration we have seen the worst recruiting outcomes for reserves ever. In 1998-99, the number of recruits collapsed to 2,281, and in the past financial year it fell even further, to 1,566 for the whole country. These figures compare dismally with the earlier six-year average of 4,800. It is a disgraceful record for the minister responsible for handling this policy area, and that is why Labor have relentlessly pursued the government on these matters.</para><para>Labor have provided the government with a myriad of initiatives, including private motions and private members' bills by the Leader of the Opposition in the lower house. The government, to its discredit and in its short-sightedness, did not support these measures, but we have pursued this matter because Labor can see that there is a growing problem. It has been acknowledged by just about everyone that the government has been doing nothing to turn things around. Indeed, there is widespread agreement, as I will demonstrate, that various coalition policies were directly contributing to the problem. Given this, the key measures included in these two bills are long overdue. The bills propose that some or all of the reserves may be called out in a wide range of circumstances other than war, including a defence emergency, defence preparation, peacekeeping, peace enforcement, civil aid, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. In considering this, however, it will be important for the associated call-out powers to be utilised appropriately, and there will be a clear need for the parliament to oversee their application.</para><para>Other proposals in the bills provide for a permanent force and a reserve force for each of the three services. Additionally, the bills empower Defence to define training requirements for reservists, which will facilitate, through regulation, the implementation of a revised structure of defence service. The bills also provide for the introduction of an employer support payment to compensate employers impacted upon by the absence of an employee on extended reserve service. Labor do not oppose the introduction of an employer support payment; however, the government has clearly neglected to adequately consult with employer organisations in the development of this outcome. Indeed, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, following evidence from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was far from convinced that the Army had consulted sufficiently widely on the issue of employer needs. In implementing the employer support payment, it will be incumbent upon the government to ensure that this measure is not exploited.</para><para>With the <inline ref="R1175">Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Bill 2000</inline>, the government has made limited but welcome progress on protection and benefits afforded to reservists. These include a general prohibition on discrimination against employees on the grounds that they are currently serving in the reserves, have served in the reserves or are considering serving in the reserves. In addition, the bill provides for additional but time limited employment protection for workers who are absent from the workplace on what is called `protected' defence service. This additional protection includes the right to have an absence treated as leave without pay but does not break a person's contract of employment, and it entitles them to resume work in their previous position, or in an equivalent position, without any diminution of their terms and conditions of employment. In an important step, students who are serving in the reserves will also be afforded protection where they undertake certain forms of continuous, full-time defence service. This includes the right to defer their studies without disadvantage. Finally, in the event of continuous, full-time service that results from a call-out order, the bill offers reservists specific protection in relation to financial liabilities, including the right to postpone certain repayments and to avoid the threat of bankruptcy action being taken against them because of their reserve activity. </para><para>It is sufficient to say that, through word and action, Labor have offered support for the general thrust of these measures and, as I mentioned previously, we have laid out on the table our own measures to further this agenda. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the government. Indeed, I remind the Senate that way back in October 1999 the Leader of the Opposition introduced a detailed private member's bill to this end. Whilst the bill received widespread support from key stakeholders, let us never forget that the government saw it as unnecessary to implement the important changes in Labor's proposals. Minister Reith insisted that there was no need for any new legislation and that existing protections were adequate. Judging by these bills now before us, the minister has clearly admitted he was dead wrong on this matter, but it is a shame that he has taken so long to correct his mistake. Overall, the government's approach to improving the state and conditions of the reserves has been, at the very least, lacklustre, and critical issues continue to be neglected by the Howard government. </para><para>The first issue relates to defence leave. The government has been adversely silent on the need to restore defence leave as an allowable award matter. Following the 1996 elections, the Howard government attacked workers, and ultimately hindered its own ability to maintain and improve reserve recruitment and retention, by removing defence leave as an allowable award matter despite strong advice from the Defence Force. In its report <inline font-style="italic">From Phantom to Force</inline> the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, of which I am a member, found that the loss of reserve leave entitlement has significantly impacted upon employees attempting to meet the time demands of reserve service. To highlight the situation that has evolved, the committee noted:</para><quote><para>There was evidence that some reservists do not reveal their service to their employer, sometimes because of an expectation of discrimination.</para></quote><para>The sad fact of the matter is that, as suggested by the Defence Reserves Association, general reserve personnel returning from East Timor may be faced with the reality of having lost their job and having to find another one. As noted in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline> on 13 August last year, Major-General Warren Glenny, in discussing the government's removal of reserve leave from employment agreements, said that the move had sent a message to employers that the government was not serious about the reserves. Yet the government is silent and continues to refuse to restore defence leave as an allowable award matter. While the men and women of the defence reserves have put the interests of the nation ahead of their own, the government has threatened their job security and promotional prospects in the long term.</para><para>The second issue relates to common induction training in the Army. Under this system, new recruits are required to attend a full-time induction course together with those signing up to the regular Army. This means that reserve recruits must be absent from their jobs for a longer period than before. This clearly acts as a significant barrier to recruitment into the Army Reserve. The joint standing committee found that the expansion of time taken to complete training courses has had a heavy impact on the reserve. It also noted:</para><quote><para>It seemed illogical to place heavier training demands on reservists if they were not given clear and credible missions.</para></quote><para>Despite this the government has not provided an alternative solution and appears unable to admit that common induction training has had a severely negative impact on the Army Reserve. Finally, another key issue which has earned greater scrutiny relates to recruitment. The Howard government has failed dismally to reverse the dramatic decline in recruitment levels since it came to office. On 30 August last year, the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> noted that only seven per cent of 17- to 24-year-olds—which is the key age group for recruitment—said they would not consider a Defence Force career. Given the government's disastrous record of undermining support for the reserves and inhibiting new recruits from fulfilling training obligations, it is little wonder that young people feel disillusioned about joining the reserves.</para><para>We now have a situation where reservists are having to serve as full-time troops in an Army that is increasingly reliant upon volunteers from the reserve to maintain numbers for peacekeeping missions. As noted in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on August 30 last year, RSL President, Major-General Peter Phillips, said that recent demands of the peacekeeping force in East Timor had shown a glaring need for more defence manpower. In 1998-99 the Army assigned a recruitment target for the general reserve of 4,465. Only 51 per cent of this target was achieved. This is combined with a separation rate in 1999 of 14 per cent. Although hardly surprising, the joint standing committee found that factors contributing to the high separation rate included inadequate career progression, the impact of an excessive drive for efficiency, an indifference by the administration regarding continuous change and poor job satisfaction. The men and women who continue to make such an important contribution to this country through their service in the reserves rightly deserve our appreciation and congratulation, yet you cannot blame them for feeling disillusioned about the government's commitment to and faith in them as a valued force and service.</para><para>The government continues with its refusal to make the necessary steps towards reversing its disastrous record on the state of the defence reserves and to give clear direction to the future of the ADF. Whilst Labor will support the passage of these bills, let me make it absolutely clear that these measures will address only some of the challenges facing the sustainability of the reserve. You can rest assured that Labor will maintain pressure on the government to finally correct each and every mistake it has made to date.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>22602</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this afternoon to speak on the <inline ref="R1175">Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Bill 2000</inline> and the <inline ref="R1172">Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Bill 2000</inline>. These bills give legislative effect to the defence reserve measures that were announced by this government on 22 December 1999 and on 24 August last year. The announcements were an attempt by this government to deflect criticisms of the run-down state of the reserves and of its disastrously poor recruitment performance over the last two years.</para></talk.start><para>These bills clearly indicate that changes to our defence reserves are long overdue. We have yet to significantly recognise the importance of the role that our reserves played during the East Timor peacekeeping mission. Increasingly important for our defence reserves in years to come, with increasing instability in our region, is the need to look after and to build up our reserve force. I represent the people of the Northern Territory. In Darwin we are all well aware of East Timor's close proximity and the continuing problems that occur in Indonesia. Although, thanks to Kim Beazley's initiatives many years ago, we have an increased Defence Force presence in the Top End of this country, there is a need for this government to recognise even more so the important role that our defence reserves play in assisting our full-time Defence Force members.</para><para>For any given level of resources applied to defence, there is a potential trade-off between the number of personnel, the level of readiness and the amount of money that can be committed to the acquisition of platforms and weapons systems that will enhance capabilities. We know—and this is shown by the white paper that was released last year and the amount of money that this government has committed to that—that Defence personnel are expensive to recruit, to train and to maintain. But there would not be one person listening to this sitting of parliament this afternoon who would not believe that they are a vital element in our community and a vital part of the make-up and responsibility of this government in ensuring that this country is properly armed in its defence and is capable of assisting, as it has done so magnificently, peacekeeping efforts such as those in East Timor. </para><para>But with this in mind, properly trained reserves offer the most cost-effective means of providing for expansion and sustainability. However, this government has cut the number of full-time Defence Force positions by about 8,000 as part of its so-called Defence Reform Program. While the coalition has made noises about needing reservists to play a large part in the Defence Force, actual recruitment has fallen dramatically. In the 12 months to June 2000 the number of active Army reservists shrunk by 18 per cent from 22,000 to a little under 18,000. In 1995-96 we were recruiting a bit over 5,500 reservists per year, but in 1999-2000 this dropped below 2,000 per year. So, obviously, there are real problems with our reservists and they need to be identified. Other countries, such as the USA, make more use of their reserves than Australia does. Reserves offer the opportunity to maintain elements with particular skills that are at a higher level than is available among the existing regular forces, such as medical staff. </para><para>I will now turn to the bills. The <inline ref="R1172">Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Bill 2000</inline> seeks to widen the circumstances in which reservists can be called out for continuous full-time duty. It should be pointed out that one of the new five categories of reserves service being introduced in this legislation is the high readiness active reservists, which is similar to the Labor Party's Ready Reserves, which was abolished by this federal government. As we know, military training and full-time defence services are expensive. This is one important reason, amongst others, against national conscription. </para><para>The Ready Reserves was a substantial force of well-motivated and well-trained volunteers who filled a defined defence need. The Ready Reserves did a year's full-time training. They then undertook part-time service for the following five years. This was useful for tertiary students who received a year of full-time work before starting study, had their tertiary fees paid by Defence and had a reliable source of income while studying. They were effective soldiers, and the structure of their training ensured that they had the necessary skills. The Ready Reserves was a cost-effective means of providing an essential force element that did not require the maintenance of full-time forces. However, as I mentioned, this government decided to abolish the Ready Reserves. </para><para>Problems faced by the Australian Defence Force were highlighted in the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report <inline font-style="italic">From phantom to force: towards a more efficient and effective army</inline>. This report raised a number of issues: a lack of planning for expansion and sustainability; force elements that do not have an adequate number of personnel for deployment; problems in recruiting and training reserves; and an impending financial crisis in the Defence budget because of rising personnel costs. The Labor Party has sought to try to rectify some of these problems in relation to our situation with the Defence Force. Kim Beazley in October 1999, as Leader of the Opposition, introduced two private members' bills. The first bill was to amend the Workplace Relations Act to fix up the fact that Defence Force leave had been stripped out of the allowable matters, and the second was a private member's bill entitled <inline ref="R932">Defence (Re-establishment) Amendment Bill 1999</inline>. The purpose of that private member's bill was to enhance the civilian employment protection available to members of the ADF reserves under the Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965. The government did not support either of these bills. </para><para>I will turn for a moment to the bill in which we sought to reinstate Defence Force leave as an allowable matter. Defence Force leave is now to be negotiated between an employee and an employer and has been removed from awards and moved into individual contracts and AWAs, or Australian Workplace Agreements. An employee will now have to negotiate Defence Force leave and convince the employer of the merits of that leave, as opposed to having the backing of the federal government by leaving it as an allowable matter—by leaving it as one of the 20 matters which the commission can approve as being part of an industrial award. As I said, the government did not support either of the private members' bills. It claimed that the private members' bills were unnecessary because the employment position of a reservist who went to East Timor—and that bill was introduced around the time of the East Timor peacekeeping mission—was fully protected anyway. We clearly know that this is not the case. </para><para>This government is now prepared to acknowledge the potential difficulties of reservists by introducing its legislation—the <inline ref="R1175">Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Bill 2000</inline>. This legislation will introduce protections and benefits that will prohibit discrimination in employment, rights to defer and resume studies and to postpone certain financial liabilities. However, the government is still not prepared to restore defence leave as an allowable award matter.</para><para>The two bills before us this afternoon present the first stage of a process of modernising the structure of the reserves by providing that the ADF will, basically, provide a permanent force and a reserve force for each of the three services, establishing regulations that will have five categories of reserve services—the high readiness active reservists, the high readiness specialist reservists, active reservists, stand-by reservists and retired reservists. They also empower Defence to implement an employment support payment—the current estimate of this is around $784.90 a week—to compensate employers who suffer disruption and additional expense because of the absence of an employee on extended reserve leave.</para><para>The Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Bill 2000 talks about implementing a graduated series of protections and benefits that will apply to various forms of services in the reserves, including a prohibition on discrimination in employment, the right to defer and resume studies and—as I said previously—to postpone certain financial liabilities. This legislation is long overdue. In 1996 the coalition had promised to accelerate the legislation to protect the reservist civilian jobs, but it failed to deliver. This government did not do anything to protect the plight of those reservists who served in East Timor. Reservists put the national interest first, despite threats to their personal employment at that time—threats to their employment security or their long-term promotional prospects.</para><para>I understand from talking to people in the Northern Territory who are part of the defence reserves—and there are a significant number of them—that those members of the Defence Reserves Association have been upset that the government had legislated to remove Defence Force leave for reservists as an allowable matter. They are concerned about privatising the Defence Force Housing Association, and they question the future of the independent Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. This government also chose to treat defence personnel entitlements as perks to be reported on group certificates through the fringe benefits reporting tax—a position from which it only partially relented in some areas under sustained pressure from the Labor Party. </para><para>As has been previously highlighted, Labor does not believe the bill goes sufficiently far to ensure that the issues that were raised in the report mentioned earlier, <inline font-style="italic">From Phantom to Force</inline>,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>are adequately addressed. Under this scheme in the bill there is a six-week common induction training, requiring new recruits to attend a full-time induction course alongside those joining the Regular Army. This creates real problems for reservists' ability to get leave. </para><para>One important issue has been reserve forces pay. We need to pay reservists better and to give them better conditions if we are to successfully recruit and maintain them in our reserves. There is also an issue of compensation for the income effect of the GST. Reservist money is tax free. Therefore, they did not get the supposed savings from the GST or the GST tax cuts designed to compensate for the introduction of the GST. Therefore, to maintain parity, there should have been an increase in reserve pay. My understanding is that many of them are, in fact, worse off since the introduction of the GST. This government has introduced other adverse changes, such as the abandonment of the RFD award and anomalies with the home loan benefit scheme. There is concern over the use of regular officers in reserve postings, which is not sensitive to the balancing act required by reservists. Another concern is reservists being made redundant without compensation.</para><para>It is important for this government to finally recognise—which I think it has yet to do—that it can make more effective use of its reservists. About 600 out of 16,000 reservists on the books went to East Timor. So of 16,000 reservists in this country, 600 went to East Timor during the peacekeeping mission, that is, 16,000 reservists, costing $500 million, produced at the time of emergency only 600 reservists, who could not be sent in formed units but were only used—as is my understanding, and they are most disgruntled about it—to slot in and fill the gaps. We know they did a good job, and they are yet to be recognised sufficiently for that. However, reservists want to be deployed in formed units. They want to be given roles and tasks that they are capable of performing, and they want the same equipment as the Regular Army.</para><para>Under sections 50E and 50F of the Defence Act 1903, the defence forces can be called out for continuos full-time service by proclamation by the Governor-General in situations `of war or defence emergency' and where it is `desirable to do so for the defence of Australia'. This limits the ability of reservists to contribute to the range of functions that the modern Defence Force performs. As a result of an increasing level of instability in our immediate region, we are more likely to call out and need our defence forces and our reserves for peacekeeping duties, peace enforcement, humanitarian assistance, civil aid and disaster relief rather than war fighting operations. These bills address and allow the call out of reservists to occur in far broader situations than just call out for war and fighting purposes.</para><para>I have met with many reservists during my time and, in fact, represented many of them during my time as a trade union official. The East Timor mission has highlighted the need to ensure that we properly support, resource and rebuild our reserve forces. The problems experienced by our reservists need to be addressed. But I still believe that this government is avoiding the issues of defence leave as an allowable award matter; problems of a common induction training and shortfalls in recruitment and retention, and they still need to significantly address the pay and conditions of our reservists.</para><para>Finally, I want to note the amendment that Senator Faulkner moved to the second reading of these bills in his address to the Senate. Contained in the amendment are a number of items that go to the government's failure to address some of the issues—the four issues that I have raised and many more—and they are matters that this government needs to address. A significant number of the people from the Northern Territory whom I represent—including those who live in Darwin and Katherine—are members of the reserves, and there are also a significant number of Aboriginal members who live outside Darwin and Katherine and around the different Aboriginal communities who are members of the reserves. This bill is something that we would support. It is long overdue. I do not think it goes anywhere near recognising the efforts and the attempts that these people make in our Defence Force over, above and beyond their full-time jobs and commitment to their families. There are many more issues that need to be addressed on behalf of those people and we call upon the government to do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>22605</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand that it is traditional at the end of these debates to thank honourable senators for their contributions. Having listened to their contributions, I can say that there was only one outstanding contribution, that of Senator Sandy Macdonald, National Party for New South Wales. If you had listened to the contributions you would have been forgiven for believing that Labor opposes this legislation. They were so negative, so carping, so critical, that you would think that they were opposing the legislation. In fact they support it, and I welcome that. </para></talk.start><para>It is the same sort of stunt that they play with the community over tax reform. They would have you believe that somehow they oppose it when they have no intention of changing it if they are ever re-elected. Similarly, with health insurance, they were against our policy of health insurance, and now they are going to adopt it. On education, they gave speeches against our policy and then voted for the legislation at the end of the day. It seems that the Labor Party are pulling the same stunt in relation to this legislation as well. At the end of the day they are going to vote for it, albeit there is an amendment of some sort to the second reading which we, as the government, will be opposing.</para><para>The Labor Party's new-found interest in defence I am sure will be welcomed by those people who are willing to serve their nation, especially in relation to these bills, as reservists. I believe that it was that great former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Sir Winston Churchill who described reservists as `twice the citizen' because they were prepared to be actively engaged in citizen life but, also, were prepared to serve their country in time of emergency. We are fully cognisant of the fantastic role that the reservists play within our community as citizens but, also, in their dual role as being willing to defend the interests of this nation when called upon. As the government we are concerned about reservists.</para><para>We heard two speeches today—one from Senator Gibbs and one from Senator Crossin. They both told us that these reforms were long overdue. Possibly so, but it does lead to the question: where was Labor on this issue during their 13 years in government? When did they move on these issues? Not at all. Indeed, I am wrong. They did move on the reservists—and allow me to tell the people of Australia how they moved on reserves. Labor introduced the Ready Reserves because they thought it would be cheaper. They were trying to do defence capability on the cheap. Labor scrapped two battalions of regular troops to pay for a reserve force that was designed to operate only 50 days a year. Labor said that the scheme would save money because the annual cost of a Ready Reservist would be only one-third that of a regular soldier. But as usual—especially in the area of defence—Labor got the sums wrong. Later estimates showed that the true cost of a Ready Reservist was about two-thirds that of a full-time soldier. Labor's plan on reserves was conceptually flawed, financially irresponsible, and strategically frivolous. </para><para>When we look at the Labor Party's approach to defence, need I remind them of the Collins class submarine debacle? Time and time again the now Leader of the Opposition and would-be Prime Minister promised that they would be delivered on time and on budget. It was about as credible as the promise of the then Minister for Finance to the Australian people that the budget was in surplus and then we came to office and found it to be in $10.3 billion deficit. We have this history of defence with the Labor Party—and, indeed, with the management of the economy—where everything blew out. I am reminded of the <inline font-style="italic">Manoora</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline> which were purchased in 1993 during the reign of Senator Robert Ray as the Minister for Defence. The initial cost was to be $62 million; the final cost—$394 million.</para><para>Guess what? When you are confronted with blow-outs on the Collins class submarine; when you are confronted with problems and blow-outs on <inline font-style="italic">Manoora</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Kanimbla</inline>; when you are presented with a problem of a $10.3 billion budget deficit, guess what the incoming government has to do? It has to take some tough decisions and try to reform the financial affairs of the nation so it can then build in a positive way. Sure, our first term of government was spent in rectifying some of these problems, and that is why we developed the Defence Reform Program—to see where there were areas of fat within defence that we could trim off to save the Australian taxpayers money.</para><para>But we did not only go on with an efficiency program; it was all designed so we could then develop the white paper that was so ably delivered by the former Minister for Defence, the Hon. John Moore. In that white paper, not only did we talk about our dreams and aspirations for defence, as the Labor Party white paper in 1994 did, but we actually put dollar figures on our dreams and aspirations for defence and promised to fund them—unlike Labor. Indeed, Labor at the last election promised another two Collins class submarines. Do you know what the cost was, according to Labor's financial documents at the last election? Zero dollars; no cost at all. We now know of course that would have cost taxpayers $1.2 billion.</para><para>When the Labor Party tries to come into an area such as defence, you have to ask the question: where was the Leader of the Opposition whilst he was Minister for Defence? Where was Senator Robert Ray when he was Minister for Defence, when you were confronted with those problems?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—Where is John Moore?

I would have thought he was one Minister of Defence in recent years who has really taken to the task of reforming defence for the security of our nation. At the end of the day, that is what the Defence Force is all about; it is not about a burgeoning bureaucracy and buying rust buckets from the United States, nor about developing Collins class submarines and then trying to say they will be delivered on budget on time, when you must have known at the time that was manifestly wrong. Minister Moore got out and about and exposed the problems with the Collins class submarines. We are now having a $500 million budget to get them up to scratch—once again overcoming a Labor problem, a Labor legacy.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So it is quite disingenuous of the Australian Labor Party to try to come into this debate and somehow hector us and lecture us as a government as to how we ought to be running defence. Indeed, nobody in defence actually believes them, because they are aware of the fantastic job that we have done in defence and of our absolute commitment to our troops and the reservists.</para><para>We have been told that recruitment is a problem. I would suggest to the Senate and the people of Australia that a very good place to start with recruitment might be the consideration of the cadets. There are 26,000 young Australians involved in cadets, supported by 2,000-plus volunteers. The Labor Party have gone to the last two elections absolutely policy free on the issue of cadets. We have unashamedly been supporters of defence cadets. That is why in the white paper there was a great increase for cadets, and now we have a budget of $30 million. The Labor Party were absolutely silent in the area of cadets.</para><para>Sure, there are difficulties in the area of recruitment: one of the problems that basically all Western nations face is that, when you have a growing economy and growing employment, there are a greater range of job opportunities available to young people and therefore, when they make their choices, unfortunately from time to time defence misses out. As unemployment grows, job opportunities decrease and, as a result, defence becomes a more attractive career prospect. That is the reality, and we as a government are aware of that. But I suppose that was the Labor Party's secret plan to increase recruitment in the defence forces; and that is why, whilst he was minister for employment, Mr Beazley undoubtedly deliberately ratcheted up the unemployment figures to one million Australians unemployed—in the hope that it might do something for his recruitment figures in the area of defence! But, apart from that horrid social statistic, quite frankly, Labor has nothing to point to in the area of recruitment.</para><para>Senator Crossin tried to give us a lecture about the effect of taxation in the area of defence and defence reserves. She did not tell the Australian people, did she, that when Mr Beazley was the Minister for Defence he tried to tax the salary of reservists? We opposed that and, thank goodness, that decision was reversed. If Senator Crossin and the Labor Party were genuinely concerned about the tax implication for reservists, where were they in 1994 when Mr Beazley was trying to impose a tax on reservists?</para><para>This legislation is part and parcel of our whole reform program of upgrading defence. The white paper is a very good document and it has clearly articulated our approach to the reserves. These bills will permit the full integration of the reserve components into the total force structure, enabling the government to access the full potential of the ADF. As a result, the reserve will be able to take on appropriate roles and tasks that are essential to ensure the ADF's ability to generate appropriate capabilities, to deliver these capabilities where and when required, and to sustain them over time.</para><para>As for the opposition's request to reintroduce defence leave for reservists as an allowable award matter, appropriate comprehensive protection for the management of reservists is provided under defence legislation. There is no need for reservists to be covered by separate industrial legislation. Contrary to Labor's claim that the Army's common induction training has been a disastrous failure, it has in fact been successful. Full-time soldier standards have been maintained, while part-time recruit standards have improved markedly.</para><para>The common induction training provides a firm and common base for initial employment within units and a consistent entry standard for further specialised training for all soldiers. Part-time soldiers are now more robust and demonstrate that soldier qualities and the army ethos are being more effectively assimilated in the reserve. The best example of the success of the common induction training concept and of its practical value is that the Army was able to quickly bring a significant number of these trained part-time soldiers into full-time service for operations in East Timor. Without the common base provided by the induction training, this option would not have been available.</para><para>I turn now to the opposition's claim that the government failed to implement employment and education protection measures before the deployment of reservists to East Timor. As the proposed legislation will do precisely what the opposition are seeking, one would have thought they would have complimented the government. Unfortunately, as is the wont of Labor, they want to harp, criticise and knock—although they will be supporting the proposals.</para><para>As part of the government's suite of reserves initiatives, Defence is undertaking a study into the attitudes, opinions, needs and desires of our reserve personnel. This will better enable the development of policies and related personnel initiatives to enhance the attraction, recruitment and retention of reserves. These studies have commenced, and initial findings are anticipated midyear. We have enhanced the Defence Reserve Support Committee structure right around Australia—and the support of James Packer as its head Australia-wide is very much appreciated by the government, because it shows the community and employers working together within the best interests of the defence of this nation.</para><para>In terms of the opposition's concern about anomalies in reserve pay, they should be aware that reserve pay is based industrially on qualifications, skills and conditions required for employment and is directly linked to the permanent force pay and allowance rates set by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. There are no known pay condition anomalies for reservists, nor has the government mismanaged the provision of training and other support to reservists. Indeed, by enabling this legislation and, thereby, the introduction of categories of service directly related to capability and readiness, we will be able to better provide for the needs of reservists and, of course, those of defence.

What I am interested in is the blurring of lines between the reserves and the regular defence forces, taking note of the fact that upwards of 40 per cent of the Defence Force numbers will be reserves. What we effectively have is a part-time Defence Force augmenting the regular Defence Force but with very little to distinguish the two except for that work arrangement, and with the Minister for Defence having the ability, after a phone call with the Prime Minister, to call out the reserves as if they are full-time members of the armed forces, for a very big range of things.

Listeners might be aware that if a minister does not answer a question it is a refusal by government to reply. You will be aware that this is a very valid question. We have an important piece of legislation here which enumerates the circumstances in which the reserves can be called out by a minister—mind you, without the authority or the reasons being given to parliament. That has specifically been left out of this legislation. Under those circumstances, I believe that we as a Senate committee need to know what the government's thinking is here. </para></talk.start><para>I will be clear about this. We passed what was called, in shorthand, the shoot to kill bill before the Olympics, which allows the defence forces to be called out to confront Australian civilians in circumstances of strikes or protests—and protest I did.

Can I get a specific response from the government or the opposition—I do not mind which—to this question: will this legislation enable the reservists to be called out against Australian civilians in a confrontational situation, whether it be a peaceful protest or a strike?

But, on behalf of the Labor opposition, I want to clarify the record as I understand it. The opposition asked the government to define all the circumstances under which the call-out of reservists could occur; but the minister, in his reply, implied that we had drafted that section. All I am saying is that we did not draft that; we just suggested to the government that the legislation ought to cover all the circumstances under which it could be applied. The government, I understand, then proposed an amendment in the House of Representatives that is now contained in the bill. I want to make it clear that we supported the defining of all the circumstances, but I do not know that we will take any ownership of the particular wording. I thought that might help the debate. As to the question Senator Brown asked of Senator Abetz, I think it is best answered by Senator Abetz.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that the bill stand as printed.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>22610</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, you referred in your second reading speech to the difficulties of recruitment—the need to recruit more and better people into the forces and, for that matter, into the reserves. I put it to you that one of the stumbling blocks we have to recruitment into the ADF is the systemic homophobia that we have within the defence forces. In 1994, I think—and it should be recalled—due to persistent and successful agitation by the Australian Democrats, the then Labor government moved to repeal the ban on throwing people out of the defence forces if they happened to be lesbian or gay or found to be lesbian or gay. So we have done away with the complete ban on gay and lesbian people serving their country in the ADF. However, promises then made by the ALP to better promote an understanding of sexuality and homophobia issues within the ADF were never followed through. </para></talk.start><para>While we have what I understand to be a good equity program dealing with the integration of women into the defence forces, there has been no attempt by this or the previous government to deal with the issue of discrimination faced by gay and lesbian people. There are many hundreds of gay and lesbian people—good people—serving their country in the ADF, yet they experience discrimination in partnership recognition; superannuation; and, most appallingly, death benefits, if an accident or death should occur when serving overseas. So the scenario is that the environment is quite hostile to them, despite the fact that they want to contribute to their country. </para><para>We learnt recently that, despite there being a small contingent serving in East Timor, there were several gay and lesbian people serving over there—serving in the Australian Federal Police or in the ADF. We found out from them anecdotally that what concerned them most was that their relationships with their partners and, in some cases, their children living in Australia were not recognised. They were deeply concerned—quite rightly—that they were still being treated as second-class citizens and not being afforded the same rights, protections and recognition that the relationships of their heterosexual counterparts were afforded. Is it the government's intention to continue this policy of hostility towards people who, through no fault of their own, do not happen to be heterosexual but who are able-bodied and good people who want to serve and fight for their country and work towards freedom wherever they can, yet they have a government and, for that matter, a previous government that will not recognise them as full citizens? Is it the government's intention to continue this policy of discrimination against gay and lesbian citizens?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>22611</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A Defence instruction for ADF members and a Defence personnel instruction for Defence APS staff on preventing, managing and eliminating unacceptable behaviour have been issued, supported by an extensive collection of brochures and booklets.

After a while, you just have to stop the discussion. These were of a general nature. Therefore, if you fell into a category where you felt that you had been harassed, the antiharassment provisions would apply irrespective of the reasons that you were harassed. It is similar with equity issues. If you believed that you were not treated on an equitable basis for whatever reason, the appropriate provisions would apply. We can ask about all sorts of behaviour being unacceptable within the defence forces, but there was a general approach to this on the basis that any type of behaviour which falls into the categories of harassment or inequity is unacceptable.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>22611</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The problem with that response is that, sadly, homophobia remains the last acceptable prejudice. The reason that many people, whatever field they are in but in the ADF in particular, do not come forward with their claims of harassment and discrimination is that, sadly, either they feel that it is acceptable or will be tolerated—because the ADF makes no attempt to specifically refer to it as unacceptable—or they know that they are in an environment where homophobia is simply a part of harassment, abuse and unacceptable behaviour.</para></talk.start><para>For example, the minister just said that, if any member of the ADF feels that they have been dealt with on an inequitable basis, they should come forward. I have given several examples already where it occurs on a systemic, inequitable basis. I think the most appalling is the fact that the surviving partner of someone in the ADF who is injured or killed overseas is not eligible for compensation or a death benefit. </para><para>Of course, there are also the ongoing difficulties with partnership recognition. For example, I know that literally dozens of complaints were made to Bronwyn Bishop when she was the minister for defence force personnel. I am aware of dozens of cases over recent years where one partner in a same sex relationship is transferred to another aspect of the ADF—whether it be in Townsville or, in the case of a colleague, in South Australia—and because their relationship is not recognised their partner cannot travel with them at ADF expense, nor can they be housed in quarters for couples. So you have systemic, inequitable, ongoing discrimination within the ADF. The aspect of my question which the minister has not yet answered is: is it the government's intention to specifically continue with that policy, particularly the nonrecognition of same sex relationships within the ADF and the difficulties that causes?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Jim (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McKiernan)</inline>—The question is that the bill stand as printed.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>22612</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think it is worth noting that nobody from the government decided to respond to that.

I am not going to go through the whole debate of last year, but I must object to this move to have civilians used in those circumstances. I expect that, when the minister has been instructed, he will say that this specific list does not allow for such things. But you will note that subsection (e) does say that the reserves can be called out for `assistance to Commonwealth, state, territory or foreign government authorities' in matters affecting Australia's national security.</para><para>All of us know the sorts of matters where national security may be involved, like the Franklin blockade or certainly a wharf strike, a coalminers strike, a meatworkers strike, a postal strike or a protest against something that is happening in the political arena.

There are no reasons given; no permission is required. All the minister has to do, if he or she thinks it is an urgent situation, is go to the Governor-General to get the document signed. There is a requirement that he or she will have spoken to the Prime Minister of the day on the way to the Governor-General. That worries me. I think if we are going to allow that to happen we should debate it in this place and all members should know that is what is being debated. I note the list that the government has drawn up, apparently in response to a request from the Labor Party. I think it was a wise request from the Labor Party to put some definition into this. I doubt the opposition did mean that reservists could be used, for example, against people who are on strike.

Even at this late stage, in writing out this amendment of only a few words, he has had to delete two of them. If that is Senator Brown's attitude to drafting legislation on such important issues, I think it is genuinely regrettable.

I think the onus is on Senator Brown to convince this chamber as to how paragraphs (a) to (g) could somehow be misinterpreted to include the circumstances which he has just scribbled out for the Senate.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>22614</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Abetz for that helpful interlude. What he is saying is that this all has to be fixed up outside and that we will come in here, agree to it and get it over and done with. I will not be a party to that. I do not believe that the executive government should be dominating the parliament. I think these matters should be debated in the parliament, and I do not apologise for the fact that the government has scheduled this on a broadcast day. The scheduling is the government's responsibility; it is not mine. I am not going to be prohibited from coming in here and taking part in a debate because Senator Abetz says that I should do it somewhere else. I would, however, agree that there have been approaches to my office in the last couple of days, particularly to see if we could get this legislation debated without a vote and put through as non-controversial. It is a very taxing thing for the office of the only Green, representing people right around Australia who have a different point of view from Senator Abetz, to cover all the legislation. I do that as best I can in good faith, and that is why I am here now.</para></talk.start><para>The question put by Senator Faulkner to Senator Abetz by way of interjection does help us to resolve this matter and get on with it—that is, can Senator Abetz say that the reasons for calling out the reserves that he has listed in this section exclude and would not allow the reserves to be called out in circumstances that are called `a civilian emergency', such as a strike or a protest? If Senator Abetz, on behalf of the government—and he is on top of this legislation—can explain to me how the legislation excludes reserves being called out against strikers, we can move on. If not, the amendment is necessary. I reiterate that, in this legislation, there is no need to report to parliament on why people are called out. There should be, but there is not. So it is incumbent upon parliament to make it very clear that there are tight parameters. What I am doing is tightening up those parameters. In fact, I am doing Senator Abetz's job for him. I do not mind doing that because that is the nature of a multipartisan house of parliament, and we do end up with better legislation.</para><para>I am also concerned that there is no transition period in this legislation for reservists who are unwilling to accept the increased commitments in the legislation. It will come in and that is it: you accept it or you do not. I am aware that it does make changes for reservists and that they do not have a say. When they are called out, they have to go. This is removing the option that reservists had in relation to East Timor. If the minister says, `Here is a warlike situation,' or, indeed, `Here is a domestic situation under this list,' the reservists have to cease what they are doing when they are called out and go. That is a very onerous thing for reservists. I reiterate: I think it is fantastic that we have Australians committing themselves to this. But the circumstances for reservists serving the nation are changing quite dramatically here, and I want to be very clear on this so that we do not leave it to some minister further down the line to interpret this legislation in a way that we do not intend. I put my finger on very important circumstances such as a strike or a protest. All the minister has to do is explain why that matter is covered by the legislation as it exists. I cannot see where it is and he has not given an explanation. Therefore, I believe this amendment is a good one and should be supported.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>22614</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me outline to the committee the position of the opposition, because we have a situation now that I did not expect the committee would be facing.

I want to make it clear that the opposition, and I assume the minor party and Independent candidates, extended to the government a courtesy last night in bringing forward the second reading debate on this particular bill. </para></talk.start><para>There was a lack of pressure on the government's legislative program, and it was planned to deal with this particular bill during debate on non-controversial legislation on a Thursday. I agreed, on behalf of the opposition, to break into what was a very heavy meeting schedule on Monday night to commence the second reading debate, and I know that other senators also gave some excellent contributions during that debate. Because this was originally planned to be non-controversial legislation, as far as the opposition were concerned—and the government can speak for itself—we did not expect amendments to be moved in the committee stage. Let us be clear: no amendments were circulated prior to the second reading debate. I understand how these things work. I understand that Senator Brown, having had a closer look at the bill, decided that he thought it was appropriate to move an amendment. But the opposition, having extended a considerable courtesy in allowing this matter to come forward when some senators would not have been prepared because they expected the bill to be debated on Thursday, find ourselves in a situation where I would like to consult with my shadow ministerial colleagues in the House of Representatives. </para><para>Two members have an interest here: Mr Martin, the shadow minister for defence; and Mr Laurie Ferguson, the shadow minister for defence, science and personnel. I think that is more than appropriate, and I think that senators in the chamber would acknowledge that I engaged a great deal in the debate that occurred in this chamber on the <inline ref="R1122">Defence Legislation Amendment (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Bill 2000, </inline>which, of course, took up a considerable amount of chamber time.

I do not know what Senator Brown's intentions are and I do not know the intentions of any of the other minor parties or Independent senators; I can speak only on behalf of the opposition.

I do not think it is realistic to bring it back at a later hour this day, but I think it is certainly realistic to deal with it tomorrow. Let us not forget that the original plan was to deal with this in non-controversial legislation tomorrow. As I understand it, commitments had been given in relation to amendments not being moved, but I am not going to get too upset about a change of plan that senators might have.

That bill passed the House of Representatives earlier this month, with amendments moved by the opposition. The purpose of the bill is to allow private patients in both public and private hospitals to cover the cost of their after-hospital care at home with private health insurance. Medicare patients in public hospitals have been able to receive additional care in the home as part of early discharge programs for some years, and more recently as part of `hospital in the home' care provided as a substitute for in-hospital care. </para></talk.start><para>Under the National Health Act 1953, health insurance funds can only pay benefits from hospital tables for patients admitted to hospital. Funds have been able to offer outreach services to their members from their ancillary tables. This bill has come about because some funds want to offer benefits under hospital insurance products for after-care type services. These services come in many different forms, such as specifically targeted services for palliative care, rehabilitation and psychiatric services. They can also cover programs provided as an alternative to hospital admission, programs to support early discharge from hospital, and programs for post-operative recovery in the home environment.</para><para>The opposition's principal concern with this proposal is that allowing private health insurance to become involved in such programs should not change the fundamental separation between in-hospital and out-of-hospital medical services. Medicare is based on the foundation that all out-of-hospital medical treatment is funded through Medicare and not private insurance. Allowing private health insurance to cover out-of-hospital medical services would fundamentally change Medicare and would be another big step down the road to an American style health system with two classes of treatment available, depending on your income and insurance coverage.</para><para>I will turn to the issue of inflationary pressures. Allowing health insurance funds to cover medical expenses out of hospital would also have a dramatic inflationary effect, which would be contrary to the interests of patients. Private health insurance should not apply to out-of-hospital medical costs. The extension of health insurance to cover the cost of GPs attending a patient after a hospital admission would result in an immediate inflation of GP fees, an increased burden on the public in gap charges and an increase in the cost of private health insurance. Labor does not oppose the extension of hospital health insurance to cover the cost of after-care paid for by the hospitals and provided by nurses and allied health professionals. Health insurance funds already have the ability to cover ancillary costs for after-hospital-care services provided by allied health professionals; however, this can occur only if the patient already has ancillary health cover.</para><para>Labor believes it is reasonable for funds to reduce their overall costs and hence reduce pressure on premiums by substituting alternative health care support services for a continuing stay in hospital where that is in the patient's health interest. This bill will provide the option for patients to recuperate at home rather than in hospital, which for many people will have attractions. However, we certainly do not want to see people forced into home care options against their will or funds pressuring people into the programs for purely cost reasons. The industry should be careful in the way that it experiments with hospital in the home programs and should avoid using such programs as a way of forcing people out of hospital to save money. This would only add to the adverse image that many health insurance funds have developed.</para><para>There are opportunities for mutual benefits for patients and funds through better treatment in a more appropriate environment if such programs are undertaken properly. These programs need to focus on the provision of nurses and care services as an alternative to hospital accommodation. The amendments that the government accepted in the House will ensure that these schemes are clearly defined and restricted to genuine programs to replace time in hospital. The amendments also ensure that the approval for the schemes can be revoked and the whole arrangement can be reviewed in two years time.</para><para>I will now turn to the other part of the bill, which contains two amendments to the rules for Lifetime Health Cover. The first amendment ensures that all people who enter Australia on a humanitarian or refugee visa after 1 January 2000, or who were granted a protection visa after entering Australia on or after 1 January 2000, have 12 months after the day on which they become eligible for Medicare to take out hospital cover without their contributions being increased under Lifetime Health Cover. This provision was originally inserted into the Lifetime Health Cover by the opposition, but I understand it now needs to be reworded to pick up an accurate definition of refugee or humanitarian visa because of subsequent changes to the definitions of these classes under migration legislation.</para><para>The bill also clarifies the definition of adult beneficiary and hospital cover with respect to Lifetime Health Cover to ensure that spouses, including de facto spouses, of contributors are defined as adult beneficiaries and can have hospital cover. The opposition supports these changes but would like to reiterate its view that the Lifetime Health Cover arrangements are still flawed in a number of important respects and are unnecessarily harsh and restrictive in relation to the minister's power to grant relief on hardship grounds.</para><para>Finally, the bill remedies another flaw in the Lifetime Health Cover arrangements by amending the privacy rules to allow private health funds to disclose information about a member to a hospital to allow a check to be made of eligibility for coverage. Consumers need hospitals to be able to check their level of cover so that they can be correctly advised of the total bill that they can expect to pay for treatment. The difficulty of checking membership status has been the cause of considerable problems in recent times, mainly because health fund products have grown so complex. Over recent years, there has been a rapid growth in the proportion of policies that include one or more of the following.</para><para>Firstly, up-front deductibles are payments that patients must make either every time they use a policy or the first time they use it each year. Premiums are lower but the cost to the patient is higher when they need their insurance. Secondly, exclusions are expensive categories of treatment which particular health insurance products do not cover, including such things as cardiac treatment, hip replacement or obstetrics. There have been many complaints by people who have not had exclusions explained properly to them, and the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman has questioned the morality of these products. Thirdly, funds are adopting increasingly complex variations in their waiting periods. The pre-existing ailment rules have resulted in many new members being bitterly disappointed because they are not covered for treatment under the policies they have bought. Often this disappointment is heightened by misleading claims made by the funds in selling the policies, including the making of statements such as `waiting periods are waived'.</para><para>The combined effect of these policies is that the public are more confused than ever about exactly what cover they have. Some of these misleading claims have been investigated by the ACCC, and in at least two cases a prosecution is under way. The health insurance industry has been disappointing in its slow reaction to the consumer confusion created by the often misleading and poorly explained advertising that went to air.</para><para>There is a need for the industry to recognise the need for a dramatic shift in its relationship with consumers to offer them gap-free cover that is simple and reliable. The proliferation of complex exclusions and excessive front-end deductible charges has created consumer confusion and resentment from people who discover they are not covered for things they thought they were. The lack of progress on the proposed key features statement and the absence of clear rules on transfers between funds are a serious hindrance to the industry. If it does not get its act into gear, an incoming Labor government will have to take some action to restore consumer confidence. In the meantime, the opposition is happy to support this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>22618</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats support the main purpose of the <inline ref="R1083">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001</inline>, which is to enable the private health insurance industry to fund outreach services as an alternative to in-hospital care for patients who are admitted. Outreach services, such as hospital in the home, have become more popular in the public health system, as patients realise that they feel more comfortable in a home environment and prefer to have their treatment at home. Hospital in the home programs can provide an extensive range of services, including intravenous antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy and anticoagulant therapy. Some of the advantages are perhaps best illustrated when we look at the treatment of young children, who can be far better treated, given their medical conditions—obviously some will still end up in hospital—and do a lot better in familiar surroundings, as do elderly patients. </para></talk.start><para>Hospital in the home services can reduce the risk of infection. That is, I guess, a very sad comment about some of our hospitals, but it is an inevitable fact that some of the hospitals, public and private, have major issues with endemic infections. Research has shown that longer hospital stays increase the risk of infection. Therefore, if we can get people out into the home sooner and look after them there, that risk is decreased. As well, hospital in the home is cheaper, but we must not let that become the determining factor. It must be used only when it is the appropriate option. Of course hospitals, if they are able to release people to the home environment earlier with adequate support, are able to keep those beds for people who really are acutely ill.</para><para>As people know, the Australian Health Care Agreement between the government and the public hospitals allows Commonwealth funding to be used for outreach services for patients in the public system. However, private health insurance funds are only able to pay benefits for hospital cover tables when people are actually in hospital—when they are admitted patients in a hospital bed. Therefore, outreach services can be provided only where people have both hospital and ancillary cover, not for those people who have only the hospital cover. As a result, some private hospitals are forced to retain patients in beds when they really can be supported at home—indeed, when it is more appropriate at home—to take advantage of insurance cover. Another problem is that Medicare benefits are not available to attending doctors under ancillary cover tables.</para><para>It is pleasing to note the results of the recently completed trial of the hospital in the home program. This trial involved private sector patients selected and transferred home as part of their normal period of hospital stay while still being covered under their private health insurance. Six trials were conducted across a range of health care services—including psychiatric, rehabilitation, post-operative and palliative care—and involved six health insurance funds. The national evaluation of this project found that hospital in the home had benefited patients, had good health outcomes and was more cost-effective than in-hospital care. The results of this trial indicated that we needed the legislation that we are dealing with today, so that more patients could take advantage of this option.</para><para>We support the extension of the definition of hospital treatment in the National Health Act 1953 to include specific outreach services at particular hospitals which are approved by the minister. We also support the expansion of the definition of a patient of a day hospital to include persons who receive outreach services provided by or on behalf of a day hospital. I would like to stress that we do not support the wholesale exodus of patients from hospitals unless it is appropriate; however, we see this as a positive move. We must make sure that there is no compromising of people's health and the services that they need. We support the need for this determination to be disallowed by parliament as a safeguard for those people who are privately insured and who choose to use the private system. We do not want to see people encouraged to leave hospital before they are ready purely to save money for either the fund or the hospital. We support the requirement for an independent review of the operation of the extension of the act in relation to outreach services and the fact that that is to be tabled in both houses of parliament by June 2003. This review must be undertaken by people who, in the minister's opinion, possess the appropriate qualifications to actually undertake this review. I think this will ensure that this policy change undergoes appropriate scrutiny and that qualified and independent people are involved in that process.</para><para>We will also be supporting the changes to Lifetime Health Cover. The changes are necessary to ensure that a dependent spouse under 31 years of age is not excluded from being a beneficiary in their own right. This was, I understand, a drafting error in the original bill which we are now correcting. We also strongly support the provisions relating to refugees who enter Australia after 1 January. I understand the opposition have an amendment. When we get to the committee stage we will look at both the government amendment on premium increases and the opposition amendment which I understand they have foreshadowed. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>22619</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>(5.42 p.m.)—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1083">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001</inline> because, in my view, its intent has a great deal of merit. The bill aims to enable private patients in both public and private hospitals to receive the same equitable care choices available to public patients in public hospitals. It enables approved outreach services as a direct substitute for in-hospital care that is provided beyond the hospital that either shortens or prevents a hospital admission. </para></talk.start><para>One of Labor's principal concerns with the bill has been the allowing of private health insurance providers to become involved in programs that could change the fundamental separation between in-hospital and out-of-hospital medical services. Allowing private health insurance to cover out-of-hospital medical services would fundamentally change Medicare and would be another step towards an American style health system in Australia—thereby creating two classes of treatment being available, depending on your income and insurance coverage. This has important implications for the cost of medical treatment, and the minister should ensure by a study into the inflationary impact of this proposed new arrangement that it does not substantially impact on the overall cost of health care. </para><para>The opposition is not opposed to extending hospital health insurance to cover those costs paid by hospitals for care provided by nurses and other health professionals. It is reasonable for funds to reduce costs by substituting other health care support services for a continuing stay in hospital—that is, of course, if it is in the patient's best health interests. It is a great attraction for many patients to be able to recuperate in the comfort and familiar surroundings of their own home or unit. I have personal experience of this through my mother. She was hospitalised but had a great desire to return to the small unit she has in a nursing home—it was familiar, the care was reasonable and, provided she had access to doctors and nursing professionals, she was more comfortable recuperating there than in a remote hospital.</para><para>But while this is so, we need to guard against the home care option being used against the patient's will by funds pressuring people into home care programs on the simple basis of cost cutting. We must always keep paramount in the minds of patients that they have the right to some choice. The wellbeing of the patient must come first and if applied appropriately the funds and the patient can mutually benefit from this program. These benefits can only be realised if there is a focus on the provision of nurses and care services as an alternative to hospital accommodation.</para><para>In the case of South Australia, where I come from, our hospitals are already facing a crisis and, if we consider the impact this bill could have on the older members of our community, that crisis could get worse. For instance, the Productivity Commission has confirmed that South Australians are waiting longer to get into a nursing home. We currently have a situation where 17 per cent of people assessed as needing a nursing home bed wait more than three months to find one. There is a shortage of 633 residential aged care beds. This is well below the government's own target of 90 beds per 1,000 people aged 70 years and over. When the present government came to office in 1996, South Australia was 287 beds above the target. The Howard government's failure to manage the aged care system means that the frail aged and their families in South Australia are being forced to wait months to access the beds and care that they need and deserve. Add to that the state government's inability to manage a reasonable health system and you have a situation that can only be described as deplorable.</para><para>What is unclear is which categories of services or specific services, and from which hospitals, the minister will be approving. As yet, there has been no indication of what criterion will be used in order to approve such services, as well as to what capacity the minister will exercise his powers to revoke approvals. This bill may go some way towards easing some of the pressure on the health care system but it will not alleviate all of the community concerns. Looking around South Australia, we have a crisis in maternity care where mothers to be are required to leave their families to attend maternity services in Adelaide or in the larger centres, with doctors not being prepared to deliver children in remote areas. That clearly needs to be addressed.</para><para>Some large centres in South Australia, including some of the larger cities, do not have the ability to provide dialysis procedures. Specialist care in remote and regional areas is almost non-existent. Where it does exist, the specialists tend to be more concerned about what they can do for those who are suffering from WorkCover injuries associated with the work they have been doing. Again, there is a need for patients to travel long distances to the major city of Adelaide to receive medical care from specialists. One of the major problems that we face is the growing incidence of mental illness. This is a real problem in regional South Australia and, from what I am reading, across Australia—more so in regional areas. The government needs to address these areas as well as aged care when looking at revamping and revitalising the health care system.</para><para>Although the <inline ref="R1083">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001</inline> has reasonable merit, there still exist many problems that need to be addressed with some degree of urgency. Some of those I have mentioned. The current state of the health system in South Australia leaves a lot to be desired and causes considerable concern for those in dire need of medical care. The federal government must take some responsibility for that. Whilst this bill has merit, this merit could be substantially diminished in South Australia because of the South Australian government's appalling lack of attention to the health care system and to the crises we face.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>22620</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this afternoon to speak on the <inline ref="R1083">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001</inline> and want to comment on some of the issues that are being debated in the Northern Territory at the moment that concern Aboriginal health. This bill puts the practice of bulk billing at further risk. It further jeopardises the important principle of access to quality health care for all, and this principle is one that we in the Labor Party hold dear. The bill undermines the principle of equal access, but it is the failure of the Northern Territory government in relation to health matters which I want speak about this evening—and in particular I want to address my remarks to indigenous people in the Northern Territory.</para></talk.start><para>Recent history in the Northern Territory tells us that, while all Territorians are equal, some are more equal than others. This is particularly the case in relation to some aspects of Aboriginal health in the Territory. I will start by providing the Senate with some statistics about Aboriginal illnesses and illness patterns that are well known. These figures vary greatly across Australia, but generally are worse in the Northern Territory than elsewhere. For example, life expectancy is almost 20 years less for Aboriginal people than for non-Aboriginal Territorians. Mortality rates for Aboriginal males are improving, but only at the same rate as for the general population—that is, the mortality gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal males is not narrowing. Mortality rates for indigenous females are not improving; the mortality gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal females is, in fact, widening. Life expectancy of Aboriginal people is consistently worse than for other comparable indigenous populations, such as the native peoples of the United States and Canada and the Maoris of Aotearoa, New Zealand. Infant mortality for indigenous people is 3.3 times the Territory average.</para><para>Aboriginal people also suffer a greater burden of illness across Australia. Hospitalisation rates for indigenous people are over 50 per cent higher than for all Australians. Aboriginal people suffer from certain health conditions at a much higher rate than non-Aboriginal people. For example, Aboriginal people have diabetes at a rate of 12 to 17 times that of the non-Aboriginal population, and the figure for renal disease is 17.4 times. Of the 64 clients of the Alice Springs Renal Dialysis Unit, 63 are Aboriginal.</para><para>So let me turn to the issue of end stage renal disease. Renal disease has now reached epidemic proportions in Central Australia. In fact, end stage renal disease rates among Central Australian Aborigines are around 20 times greater than rates for non-Aboriginal Australians and are among the highest rates in the world. In particular, the community of Tennant Creek, in the Barkly region, has the highest incidence of renal disease in Australia. The only treatments for end stage renal failure are renal replacement therapy—dialysis, in other words—or transplant. Of course, people with renal failure who are suitable for a transplant must go on dialysis while waiting for a compatible donor to be found. In the Barkly region, which encompasses Tennant Creek and the strip across that section of the Territory from the Queensland border to the Western Australian border, there are no dialysis facilities. People there who have end stage renal failure and need dialysis are therefore forced to relocate to Alice Springs.</para><para>I will try for a moment to see if I can get people to understand and to picture what that is like. When I say simple words like `relocate to Alice Springs', I am talking of a distance of over 600 kilometres; I am talking about a distance that is greater than from Melbourne to Sydney. So imagine that you lived in Melbourne and I said to you that you need renal dialysis treatment and the only way you can possibly have that is to get on a bus, be transported as far as Newcastle and be relocated there for every day of your life, when your family, your surroundings, your country, the area you grew up in and are familiar with, are more than 600 kilometres away—but that's life, bad luck, because the only service we can provide to save your life is in Alice Springs. As I said, that is the equivalent distance of Melbourne to Newcastle. If you imagine that then you might start to have a tiny inkling about what that means for the Aboriginal people: how distressing it is for those people who have to relocate and live in another city, where they have no connections, no base, no family, no friends and no familiar surroundings, and what it means for the people they leave behind who cannot see them on a regular basis, who miss them and who want to be constantly with their sick family member—as you would want to be with your family.</para><para>The number of people who are forced to relocate because there is no local facility is not insignificant. Currently, a quarter of the patients being dialysed at the Alice Springs Renal Dialysis Unit are from the Barkly region. In the Barkly, fear of renal disease and its consequences, especially the fear of having to relocate to Alice Springs for treatment, negatively affects the community's acceptance of and involvement in treatment and screening. Thus, prevention and early treatment of renal disease is being hampered by the lack of a local dialysis facility. It needs to be stressed that the `head in the sand' approach taken, I believe, by the Northern Territory government about renal disease in the Barkly comes at a high cost—medically, socially and economically. This burden is carried by the individuals with the disease and by their families, but also by the community at large. It is recognised that primary prevention through health and housing—which I will go on to speak about in a moment—and secondary prevention through health screening are imperative if the epidemic proportions of renal disease in Central Australia are to be seriously addressed.</para><para>However, addressing renal disease simply cannot be done without putting into place appropriate services for all stages of the disease, including the end stage renal disease phase. A Deakin University report in 1997 entitled <inline font-style="italic">Renal disease in Central Australia: Challenges and opportunities for better health</inline> states:</para><quote><para>One important and immediate action is to increase the availability of clinically effective and socially appropriate choices of renal replacement therapy.</para></quote><para>So why, given the fact that the Barkly has the highest rate of renal disease in the country, let alone the Northern Territory, is the Barkly still without any renal dialysis service? A report prepared last year projected that demand for dialysis services in Central Australia will outstrip supply within 18 months.</para><para>Given that one-quarter of the Alice Springs clientele come from the Barkly region, not surprisingly the report recommended the establishment of a satellite dialysis unit in Tennant Creek. The report stated that the infrastructure exists for such a unit and that the recurrent costs of local treatment in the Barkly would be expected to be equivalent—I stress `equivalent'—to the cost of treating patients in Alice Springs. So we are not looking at an additional cost here, particularly when I talk about transporting a patient to Alice Springs, paying for that patient to actually stay in Alice Springs and for the cost of actually dialysing that patient a couple of times a week. There is no increase in costs. In fact, the report suggests that the costs would be expected to be equivalent.</para><para>The report also anticipated cost savings in terms of fewer medical evacuations. This claim is backed by research evidence which shows that having a local dialysis unit increases treatment compliance. Renal disease is a major problem in the Barkly and one that will require a lot of resources to address it. But the report warns that the resources being put into prevention and early treatment will not reduce the number of people needing dialysis in the short to medium term.</para><para>So why has the Northern Territory government failed to act? In a recent television interview, the President of the Northern Territory AMA confirmed that renal physicians had developed guidelines for establishing dialysis units and that Tennant Creek had the highest priority in terms of those guidelines. He also expressed the opinion that Tennant Creek should have got a dialysis unit before the township of Katherine did, where the unit was opened last year.</para><para>Of course, we all know why Katherine got their dialysis unit, which I have had the advantage of actually going to look at. It was because the Jawoyn Association agreed to give up their land in order to allow the dialysis unit to be funded. So it was an exchange of land for the unit, in the same way that the community of Kintore, which I will speak of in a moment, have raised in the last six months $1 million—not an insignificant amount; in fact, a major and tremendous effort from the people in that community—from the sale of their paintings both nationally and internationally. For what reason? To provide funds for a renal dialysis unit out at Kintore.</para><para>Going back to the President of the NT AMA on television in the previous week: when asked why he thought this has occurred—for example, why Tennant Creek had got a dialysis unit and not Katherine—he said:</para><quote><para>Well, I believe it was a political decision to put it in Katherine and there was a lack of political will to put it in Tennant Creek.</para></quote><para>He went on to spell this out:</para><quote><para>The seat of Katherine is held by the CLP, while Tennant Creek in the seat of Barkly is held by Labor.</para></quote><para>His words, not mine. Tennant Creek is not the only place where there is an unmet need for dialysis. There is also a significant number of people from the Western Desert with end stage renal failure. Last year in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, the local Labor member, Peter Toyne, asked the health minister for the Northern Territory, Stephen Dunham, about plans for extending dialysis in the Northern Territory, particularly to the community of Kintore. The minister argued the need to evaluate the units established at Katherine and on the Tiwi Islands before making any commitments to further dialysis units. He also said this, did the Minister for Health in the Northern Territory:</para><quote><para>The option of people moving into town is an option and it might not suit all people but it exists. There will be some among us that need to go elsewhere for treatment and it is something you have got to weigh up in your own head. You've got to decide whether this treatment is more important, sustaining your life with this treatment, than some other option.</para></quote><para>In other words, he is saying that you can permanently leave your family and your country or, alternatively, you stay behind to die. These are the options that are currently being provided through Territory Health Services—and, let me tell you, these are the options that Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are currently taking up. There are Aboriginal people in the Territory who do not want to go to Alice Springs if they live in the Barkly region. There are people in Kintore who do not want to go to Alice Springs and sadly—excruciatingly sadly—they stay behind in their communities and make the choice to die rather than to have to travel more than 600 kilometres to get renal dialysis for themselves.</para><para>I believe that the minister's stubborn refusal to address renal services in Central Australia has come to the point where it is critical and outrageous. The Northern Territory government, I believe, stands condemned for its failure to address the serious problem of renal disease in Central Australia; and it is something that I will be raising again and again until something is done about it.</para><para>Let me say in the final minutes I have for this speech that it has come to light in the last couple of days that we have another chronic problem in the Top End of the Northern Territory, at Maningrida—and Senator Tambling would know all too well about what I am about to refer to: the comments that have been made by a number of my colleagues in relation to tuberculosis at Maningrida. The situation that has now come to pass is that the incidence of tuberculosis at Maningrida is in fact 100 times the national average. We know that the national average for TB infection is five per 100,000. The figure in Maningrida equates to 523 per 100,000, with 12 acute cases being diagnosed last year. Add to this the fact that 31 per cent of the adults and 16.5 per cent of school children have tested positive to a test for potential tuberculosis, and the situation, I believe, takes on epidemic proportions.</para><para>I have read the transcripts, and I know the arguments that have been put by Stephen Dunham, the Minister for Health in the Northern Territory; he advises that in 1999 there were no cases and that there were 12 cases in the year 2000. Nevertheless, we now know that there are enough cases of tuberculosis out there for us to be worried about it, yet there is no designated nurse. I understand that there was in the past a nurse responsible for, and particularly dedicated to, ensuring that these cases were picked up and were treated. But I would say that surely an area with the highest incidence of tuberculosis infection in the country should have, at a minimum, a dedicated tuberculosis nurse who is in fact looking after the needs of this community and can try not only to keep that disease under control but to eradicate it—as it is eradicated in the non-indigenous community.</para><para>There has been much discussion about why this community has this disease and why this community is in such a parlous state. While we might want to attribute blame to the people in that community—I think one of my colleagues may have said earlier this week, `People want to live in filthy conditions'—let me just say this for the record: when you actually go around the Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, those communities are in an appalling condition, but it is not because the people in those communities choose to have it that way. Let us have a look at the decisions of this federal government in just the last three months, where $25 million of the Roads to Recovery program went to the Northern Territory, a territory that has an expanse of 1.3 million square kilometres—yet a seat like Gwydir, where we have the deputy leader of this government, Mr John Anderson, with 114 square kilometres of electorate, gets $43 million. There are few sealed roads at Maningrida and those that are would probably stretch less than a kilometre and are well overdue for resealing. But, by and large, Maningrida is no different to any other town or community that I have been to in the Territory. There is a severe lack of sealed roads, and so we have a huge dust problem there. Do you seriously believe that the people in Maningrida want it that way? I put it to you that they do not. Aboriginal people are 50 times more likely to be sharing their home with 10 or more people and are also more likely to be living in sheds or humpies, according to a national report that was released on indigenous health and welfare back in August 1999.</para><para>So what do we have in those communities? Overcrowding, with 10 or 20 more people sharing, when you and I would have three or four in a four-bedroom house. We have unsealed roads. We have a lack of medical staff who can cater for their needs. This is not a situation that those Aboriginal people choose to live in, and they choose to want to do something about it. They actually want to vote for and put into power governments that will allocate the necessary resources to them, governments that will look after their needs, that will make sure that they get a fair share and an equitable share of the funding when it comes to roads, housing and health infrastructure. This is something that this government has failed to address. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>22624</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The bill before us, the <inline ref="R1083">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001</inline>, will enable the private health industry to fund appropriate alternative models of health care delivery as a direct substitute to in-hospital care for admitted privately insured patients. This bill will address existing private health insurance legislation that prevents health funds from offering outreach services from hospital tables. This bill will enable privately insured patients in both public and private hospitals to receive the same quality care and choices available to public patients in public hospitals.</para></talk.start><para>Under the proposed amendment, hospitals and insurance funds seeking to provide outreach services to private patients will be required to gain ministerial approval before providing an outreach service. Only approved services will be covered by hospital table insurance arrangements. To gain approval, hospitals would be required to meet the minimum guidelines that will be developed in consultation with the relevant stakeholders.</para><para>The bill now incorporates amendments agreed by the government that were proposed by the opposition in the House of Representatives on 7 February 2001. We now have before us government amendments circulated in my name, proposing to allow the Minister for Health and Aged Care to reject premium increase applications from health insurance funds, on the grounds that they would be contrary to public interest. In recent years the Minister for Health and Aged Care has initiated a number of reforms to introduce greater balance between the private and public health sectors. In particular, the government introduced the 30 per cent rebate and Lifetime Health Cover and broadened legislation to allow funds to pay benefits above the Medicare benefits schedule without the need for contracts. These initiatives have resulted in a significant growth in membership of private health insurance funds. The 30 per cent rebate, for example, has helped to make health insurance more affordable for all Australians who choose private cover. However, the gains made by major government initiatives in providing a balance between the public and private sectors and providing more choice for consumers and more affordable private health cover could all be jeopardise by premium increases that are not in the public interest.</para><para>It is against this background that this amendment is being proposed. The minister has many responsibilities and powers in this area and one of them relates to the premiums that funds charge. This amendment will allow the minister to protect the community from the impact and consequences of a premium increase that is contrary to public interest. The amendment will come into effect with the passage of this legislation. Health insurance funds are already required under legislation to meet capital adequacy and solvency standards. This will not change. These standards both ensure financial soundness of the health funds and provide adequate capital for the conduct of their health insurance business. This will not change. This amendment simply allows the minister to take into account the interests of the broader community before health funds can increase premiums.</para><para>Finally, I am aware that Senator Forshaw has circulated amendments requiring the minister to subsequently table a statement outlining the grounds for the decision. The government will accept these amendments.</para><para>Before I conclude my remarks, as a Northern Territory senator I make reference to the comments by Senator Crossin, who spoke immediately before me. I think what Senator Crossin has done is highlight the major differences in health care between urban and remote communities. Those of us who live in the larger population and urban centres of Australia and are used to dealing very openly and honestly with both private and public health facilities of a very high standard. Senator Crossin drew the comparison with people in very remote and isolated communities, particularly Aboriginal communities, where there is still a very wide disparity in the delivery of all forms of health service. She referred in particular to the need for renal services in the Barkly-Tennant Creek region and other areas of the Northern Territory, to other areas of Aboriginal health considerations and to the recent media reports with regard to issues arising from tuberculosis at Maningrida. I concur that these are very important issues that the government needs to address in considerable detail.</para><para>Both the Northern Territory government and the Commonwealth government have in recent years injected very considerable funding and resources into addressing these and many other problems in remote area health right throughout Australia, particularly in indigenous and Aboriginal communities. The measures of cost effectiveness do need very careful analysis in comparison with the Labor Party's own administrative period between 1983 and 1996. I believe the Howard government can stand tall and very proudly in regard to its record for introducing very wide, extra and special health services throughout the country. In particular, in the Northern Territory I am familiar with the coordinated care trials both on the Tiwi Islands and in the Katherine West area near Katherine, where was a shandying of Commonwealth and Territory MBS and PBS funding that has worked very satisfactorily.</para><para>Tragically, the issues that have arisen more recently at Maningrida, where there has been an unsatisfactory and totally unacceptable incidence of tuberculosis, do need to be highlighted. I have contributed to this debate in recent days. In the media in the Northern Territory yesterday, I alluded to the need for a four-way partnership between the people living in remote communities and service providers, particularly in the smaller and special Aboriginal communities on the ground, to address the areas of health, hygiene and housing and the risks that inherently arise as a result of the very close personal contact that occurs where people live in often appalling circumstances. I think Senator Crossin was obliquely referring to me today, whereas her colleague in the House of Representatives has been much more personal in his criticism because I dared to describe some of the appalling living conditions, particularly those that need to be addressed at the environmental level by the local community.</para><para>As I said, there is a need for a four-way partnership between the local residents and the local community and the Territory health service; which provides many of the standard state services, the Commonwealth, which has injected, particularly into Maningrida, considerable additional resources, including the means to support a mooted local health board which is having problems getting off the ground; and the very excellent and hard work of so many clinicians in the medical profession seeking to deal with people living in such difficult circumstances and places. I make no apology for demanding adherence to high standards, whether it is by local residents or in the delivery of health services or by governments in the provision of proper and adequate services. I am disturbed that too many people seem to visit Aboriginal communities with dark glasses and unfortunately do not see the reality of what often needs to be corrected by very simple means, through accepting responsibility at that local level.</para><para>However, that is not directly related to this legislation, which will affect so many others of us living in better serviced and certainly better-off communities. I think the legislation goes a long way, particularly that which relates to alternative models of health care so that services can be delivered from private health facilities. This legislation has much to commend it. I commend the bill and the foreshadowed government amendments to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>22626</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>22626</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill.

We did subsequently circulate a revised amendment, which the minister indicated in his closing remarks the government was prepared to accept. However, we have had further opportunity to consider in more detail the differences between the wording of the original amendment that we foreshadowed we would move, an amendment to the government's amendment, and the revised wording. It is our belief that the original amendment on sheet 2150 is more appropriate. Accordingly, I move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Amendment (2), Schedule 4, item 2, at the end of the item, add:</para><para>	(4C)	A declaration under subsection (4A) must set out the grounds on which the Minister formed the opinion that a change that would increase rates of contributions by contributors would be contrary to the public interest.</para></quote><para>Perhaps the minister may wish to reconsider the government's position in the light of that, whilst I make some remarks in response to the government's amendment and indeed in respect of our own.</para><para>As this bill has now been before parliament for nine months and has already been dealt with by the House, we in the opposition are amazed and somewhat amused that the government has at the last minute brought forward an amendment to clarify the minister's power to reject a proposed increase sought by a health fund. Senators may not recall the history of this matter, so I will briefly refresh their memories.</para><para>In 1997 when the government introduced the means-tested Private Health Insurance Incentives Scheme, the health funds rapidly increased their premiums and managed to swallow the benefit of the scheme for themselves. In the ensuing outcry, the Prime Minister undertook to personally scrutinise all premium increases and ensure that if they were excessive they would be rejected. The minister assured the public he stood as guardian of their interests and would be tough on the funds. In fact, he never rejected a single increase from that point on. The minister turned out to be a complete paper tiger, approving a series of increases which averaged twice the rate of inflation from that time until well after the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate.</para><para>Under the act, the minister had a number of grounds on which he could reject an application for a premium increase, but he did not use them. The government is now saying that the existing grounds are not broad enough to cover simply knocking back a fee increase because the government thinks it is not justified. For four years, the minister has been peddling this misconception to the public, presenting himself as their champion, defending them from fee increases, when in fact he was powerless to act and failed to act through a succession of double and triple inflation increases. Inflationary pressure has temporarily come off the funds after the run for cover advertising blackmailed Australians into joining funds. As a result, we have seen one year with a below CPI increase and we will see no increase at all in the current year. So now that funds are in a position to temporarily defer increases, the minister has decided that the time has arrived when he needs to get some muscle and look tough. </para><para>This is a big turnaround from his position in 1999 when the Senate debated the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1998. The government proposed in schedule 3 of that bill to totally divest responsibility for monitoring premium increases to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council without any residual power for the minister. If that schedule had been passed, the minister would have lost any power after two years. In other words, in 2001—this year—he would no longer even have a monitoring role on prices. Fortunately, the opposition saved him the embarrassment by defeating that ill-conceived amendment in the Senate in early 1999, thereby forcing the minister to keep his responsibility for monitoring health fund premiums. Now, two years later, we find he suddenly needs to increase his powers, not throw them away. One is entitled to ask: why could this be? </para><para>Perhaps the answer is provided in a front page story in an edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> last year, which blew the lid off a scheme the minister had cooked up to artificially depress health fund premiums until after the next election. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper reported a secret meeting with the minister's former Chief of Staff, Mr Ken Smith, who lectured health funds on the need for them to avoid any premium increases between July 2000 and the next election. One of the health funds told the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper that the message given by Mr Smith was that `the government has given the industry a boost with the private health rebate and now we want something in return'. In other words, this was a plot not to protect the public interest but to put in place part of the government's re-election strategy. </para><para>Today we are seeing yet another step in this plan—a plan that is obviously destined not to work. But the government is endeavouring to run with this plan. The deadline for the submission of premium increases for the year 2001 was February, and it appears that the only fund to make such an application was the Hospital Benefits Fund, HBF, of Western Australia—a fund which enjoys a near monopoly of 70 per cent of the Western Australian market. This increase was hushed up during the Western Australian election campaign recently, and it was only because of a leak to the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper that the public was made aware that HBF had applied for an increase. These amendments moved by the government appear to be directed at that application for an increase because the minister wants to ensure there is no increase this year. I do not know the details of the HBF application, but it should be considered on its merits. The minister cannot be allowed to hush it up for political reasons.</para><para>The National Health Act already gives the minister three grounds for rejecting an application for a real change: if it would (a) result in a breach of the act or of a condition of registration of an organisation; (b) impose an unreasonable or inequitable condition affecting the rights of any contributors; or (c) might, having regard to the advice of the council, adversely affect the financial stability of the Health Benefits Fund. This amendment would add an undefined test of if the fee increase `would be contrary to the public interest'.</para><para>The onus is on the government to explain what sort of fee increase proposal would be against the public interest. The bill provides that the minister must table a copy of any declaration in the parliament, but it does not currently require him to give any explanation or to explain the grounds on which he considers the increase to be against the public interest. Given that health funds are private companies selling products to the community, there should be pretty limited circumstances where a public interest arises which is not already covered by another provision in this act or the Trade Practices Act. Therefore, the opposition are willing to support the government's amendments on the basis that we have moved our own amendment which re-expresses the provisions of the government's amendments so that, when a declaration is made, the minister must set out the grounds for his view that the increase would be against the public interest. With that explanation of our position on the government's amendments and on our amendment moved to the government's amendments, I seek the support of the Senate for the opposition's amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>22628</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have to admit that Senator Forshaw is a good poker player. Before I stood up, I was advised that a form of words in the Labor amendment had been agreed and we were going to accept those. Then, of course, during my speech—perhaps I should not have spoken for so long—there was further negotiation. I note that the difference between the two proposed Labor amendments and the one that has finally been accepted is essentially one of semantics in the process of the words with regard to the setting out of the grounds on which the minister has formed the opinion that a change would increase the rates of contribution. It is essentially a matter of administrative detail and when it would have taken place. I indicate that, whilst Senator Forshaw has juggled the words at the last minute, the government will accept the Labor amendment.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Andrew (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Bartlett)</inline>—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Forshaw to government amendment No. 2 be agreed to. </para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question now is that government amendments Nos 1 and 2, as amended, be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that the bill, as amended, be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>22629</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree that the policy is going in the right direction, but the question that concerns me a little is: at the end of the two-year period, what is the service quality going to be?

In a number of ways it is a disappointing bill dealing with the Trade Practices Act and its impact on small business. Firstly, I point out that my colleague Senator Jacinta Collins will be speaking on the issue of secondary boycotts in the second reading and will be moving amendments on behalf of the opposition in the committee stage. This indicates that we will not be opposing the second reading.</para></talk.start><para>For many of us in the opposition—particularly for my colleague the shadow minister for small business, Mr Joel Fitzgibbon—this is a disappointing response. Disappointing, too, have been the government's actions relating to small business over the last 12 months in a number of areas including, in particular, the dreaded BAS—the business activity statement—red tape and paperwork. But I want to refer to the joint select committee report in August 1999 called <inline font-style="italic">Fair market or market failure: a review of Australia's retailing sector</inline>. Some of the matters that the government has taken on and recommended in this bill come from that report either directly or indirectly. </para><para>I was a member of that select committee, and I think the work of the committee in a bipartisan way was extremely productive and many of its recommendations had unanimous support. Though some of the recommendations were controversial, it is interesting to note that, irrespective of political allegiances, across the board all of members of the committee recognised that there was a major problem in the retailing sector in that basically two major companies dominate the retailing sector in the supermarket area in dry groceries and associated products; namely, Woolworths and Coles Myer. Since this report was tabled in August 1999, the dominance of those two companies in the retail area has become even stronger. The apparent imminent demise of Franklins will leave those two companies in an even stronger position, and in some areas of grocery lines they probably already have over 70 per cent of the Australian market. We know that a German firm has opened its first supermarket—the first one in recent times—to provide some competition, but for a considerable time that will be marginal competition because it will not be able to match the size of the two major companies. </para><para>We also note that there has been no evidence that the smaller independent retailer in supermarkets in the grocery area has shown any ability to grow or even protect its share of the market. It is quite clear from the report that the committee was gravely concerned about the ever growing dominance of the two major companies in the Australian supermarket business. We discussed, as we say in our report, the recommendation from the independent grocers that there should be a total cap on how much business any major chain could have. The committee had a lengthy discussion about that and, although in many ways we understand the strength of the argument, for both constitutional and practical reasons the committee itself was not willing to recommend at this time that a cap be imposed that would require the power of divestiture of these companies—whereby if they got too big a share of the market they would have to divest some of the business and sell it off to others. </para><para>But the committee members did recognise that, whether the major companies like it or not, it is a problem for two companies to have such dominance over such an important part of the Australian economy. Therefore, we recommended that in three years time the committee should be reinstituted—again, as an independent parliamentary committee—to review where we will be in this retail area. I know that is something that the major companies were not overly enthusiastic about—and I can understand that. But it seems to me that there is an inevitability now that sometime next year when the three years are up Mr Fitzgibbon, as—hopefully from my point of view—the then minister for small business in the Labor government, will be able to announce the reappointment of the select committee to look at where we will be on these issues. </para><para>It is quite clear that the measures in this bill dealing with amendments to the Trade Practices Act do not go anywhere near far enough to provide protection under the various sections of the act for small business. It really will be a test in this next decade of whether this parliament is willing on a number of occasions to choose to exercise its constitutional power, and even extend its constitutional power—even if that required challenges in the High Court from those who oppose the parliament—to strengthen the Trade Practices Act on the issue of protecting small and medium sized enterprises from the economic power of big business. </para><para>This will be a controversial matter, and there are many arguments to say that you do not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater by, when trying to amend something, creating some unintended consequence that will create difficulties elsewhere. That was certainly the evidence given in many areas of our report: if you adopted what often looked to be a simplistic solution to these problems, you would create a problem elsewhere. One of the most interesting illustrations of that is if you stopped Coles Myer and Woolworths buying up small independent supermarkets in country towns—they would then become part of the chain, adding to the dominance of those two companies.</para><para>The small operator may find that the only way they can retire gracefully with an income large enough to provide a dignified retirement is to sell to such a chain and get a reasonable price, because no-one else will be willing to buy. If you stop them selling to the bigger chains and there is no-one else who will buy, the value of their business will be less and therefore the value they get when they try to sell will be less. So there is a dichotomy: you want to support the small business, the independent supermarket retailer, but if you try to restrict who can buy to maintain a broader based market, you may stop that independent supermarket owner from being able to achieve an income on which they can retire with some dignity after a lifetime in the business. I find that to be a very reasonable argument, and there is no absolute solution to that difficulty.</para><para>It is clear that our Trade Practices Act has to be amended in a number of areas to strengthen it so that small businesses can protect themselves from unconscionable conduct and from the economic power and dominance of the market. My colleague Mr Fitzgibbon in the other place has a private member's bill on petroleum before one of our Senate committees at the moment. It states that any franchisee should have the right to buy 50 per cent of their petrol from any refinery, irrespective of their franchising arrangement. This is strongly opposed by the petrol companies, because they believe it will affect their brand name and, of course, their sales. The small franchisee finds that they are totally dependent upon rebates from the major petrol companies and they do not have any economic independence.</para><para>This raises the issue of whether we want to have a fully vertically integrated petroleum industry in this country where three or four companies control the exploration and extraction of petroleum—in Australia or overseas—the refining of it, the transportation of it, the distribution of it and the retailing of it. That is a totally integrated market. I note that people argue that we should not allow this for electricity or gas under competition policy and that we should privatise gas and electricity companies owned by the state—we should break them up and allow competition. That may be a reasonable argument, but I have to say that the argument provides a stark contrast if we allow such vertically integrated structures in the petroleum industry and in the supermarket industry. It seems to me it is because neither of them have public ownership in any way and people do not want to take on the competition issues in both of those areas. Sooner or later, this parliament will have to deal with amendments to the Trade Practices Act that give some protection to small business to ensure that there is proper and balanced competition between big and small business, whether it is the supermarket business, the grocery business or the petroleum business. It is unfortunate that this bill skirts very much at the edge of some of these issues.</para><para>I realise the coalition has a real problem, in that one part of it—probably led by our colleague Senator Boswell—is a strong advocate in defence of small business. Senator Boswell was a member of the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector. I think he was the one who most vehemently argued for the most radical action. Listening to Senator Boswell, you would have thought that he was well to the left of the Labor Party in his demand for regulatory action, but that is his commitment to small business. But in the same coalition you have members of the Liberal Party who represent the interests of the big end of town—the major companies and representatives of the Business Council of Australia—who argue very strongly against any further amendments to the Trade Practices Act that would restrict the economic power of big business.</para><para>So there is a fundamental contradiction within the coalition itself: there is the Senator Boswell view on one side, which argues for small business—and I think he is to be commended for it—and the Peter Costello big end of town, the Collins Street Melbourne, view of the world that you do not amend the Trade Practices Act; you let the so-called market forces of big business dominate and gobble up the small businesses accordingly. In the time I have left I want to talk about small business.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>22631</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Andrew (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Bartlett)</inline>—Order!

I want to make a couple of comments in relation to this report. I read the report with a great deal of interest, particularly with respect to some references to local government and the GST. Interestingly, the opposition have continually quizzed the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, as to the impact of the GST on local government. If I wished to bore the Senate rigid I could provide excerpts from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>going back 18 months where we asked the minister for local government what the impact of the GST would be on local government. On every single occasion, without exception, he said that the impact would be good, was good, has been good and will be good. When asked whether he had been approached by any councils about the impact of the GST he said, `Not one.' I must admit that I find that pretty amazing, considering that everywhere I go the impact of what has been a totally unnecessary, wasteful and unfair tax on local government has been front and centre on the agenda.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have denials from the minister that there has been any impact in relation to the GST and local government, but the minister's own report from the National Office of Local Government states on page 52:</para><quote><para>Councils reported significant effects on their operation from introduction of the GST. Councils in New South Wales identified four major client groups—ratepayers and other residents, government agencies, community groups and commercial enterprises—all with different impacts from the GST.

It was an involved and complex process with substantial implementation costs and demands on staff resources. </para></quote><para>This is in the annual report by the National Office of Local Government.

If it is not deliberately misleading, then I would have to say that he must be pretty dumb if it is in his annual report but not one council has reported these difficulties to him.

This report tells us that the government has entered into a new set of protocols for higher education approval processes. I am particularly concerned about the implications of these new protocols and about the actions of the government in implementing these protocols, which they praise so highly. I am particularly concerned about the Commonwealth's actions with regard to protection of the word `university'. I do not see any evidence anywhere in this country that the Commonwealth has moved to protect the word `university' insofar as the corporate laws of this country are concerned. I note that a number of states have moved towards reviews, but no action has been taken to protect the word `university' in terms of corporate law.</para><para>I say this in the context of a recent report which was given to the Senate estimates committee, the so-called Gallagher report into the application by the Norfolk Island government for the listing of Greenwich University on the Australian Qualifications Framework register. This report demonstrates that the concerns the opposition has had about this matter over the last couple of years have been completely vindicated. The report highlights that the interloper, the Duke of Brannagh, and others have been operating out of Norfolk, selling useless qualifications to the gullible. They have been exposed for the crooks that they are—unscrupulous freeloaders who have taken advantage of this government's negligence. There is a group of people out there besotted by pretensions of aristocracy but blinded to the realities of quality education in this country.</para><para>These parasites are living off the hard-earned reputations of higher education, and this government is doing very little to enforce the standards and to ensure that the quality of Australia's international reputation is protected. I read this week in the <inline font-style="italic">Campus Review</inline>—a very worthy publication that highlights a range of issues in the higher education sector—that the Duke of Brannagh, Mr John Walsh, this pretender to aristocratic lineage, says that he is now prepared to take Australian government officials through the legal process, similarly to what he has done in the United States. My understanding is that he is seeking to claim that this is an American university and that he therefore has legal rights in America to prosecute Australian public servants for doing their legitimate task in engaging in this inquiry. I understand that threats are being made to Australian public servants to have their assets and superannuation seized by way of legal action. It is shameful to introduce into this country the sorts of disgraceful, illegal techniques that have been undertaken in the United States by crooks and shysters who are seeking to protect themselves and to undermine due legal process in this country. This is clearly shameful, and this government ought to have been taking much stronger action.</para><para>I note that the government of Norfolk Island is seeking to defend Greenwich and to defy the Australian government. It is seeking to defy the processes that have been established and to repudiate commitments that were made before this inquiry was established into the bona fides of Greenwich University. The fact remains that, on all the criteria, this so-called university does not measure up. </para><para>Now we see the Norfolk Island government seeking to protect this outfit, these interlopers, and not take the necessary actions to remove this entity from the Australian higher education scene. The Duke of Brannagh is trying to organise the most extreme, lunatic secessionist elements on Norfolk Island in an attempt to establish Norfolk Island as an entity outside of Australian jurisdiction. These are the sorts of people the government of Norfolk Island seems to wish to give aid and comfort to. The minister for territories and the minister for education have failed in their responsibility to ensure that Australian quality standards are maintained. The Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, ludicrously and naively accepted the assurance that this outfit—an Internet university—would operate on only one island, Norfolk Island. What sorts of clowns do we have in government in this country? What sort of behaviour are we expected to put up with? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>22633</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like Senator Carr, I will address some remarks to the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs report <inline font-style="italic">Higher education report for the 2001-03 triennium.</inline> I am glad that Senator Carr did not hold back on telling us how he really felt in relation to Greenwich. Having drawn the chamber's attention to page 29 of the report, there is probably not a lot more I can add to that particular issue. However, I will turn to the purpose behind this report which has been tabled and which we are discussing tonight. The overview points out the role of this report. It outlines the developments arising from changes in the operating environment for universities and summarises key achievements in relation to the government's objectives.</para></talk.start><para>I note in the report that the government has placed fairly highly among its objectives and so-called achievements its new innovation response, Backing Australia's Ability. That statement, released by the Prime Minister earlier this year, at the end of January, outlined a number of initiatives, including an increase in Federation fellowships—postdoctoral fellowships—better pay parity between researchers supported by fellowship and other academics, and a doubling of the funding available under the discovery and linkage elements of the national competitive grants program, et cetera. While the Democrats—and, I am sure, many others in Australia—commend those initiatives announced by the government, they go nowhere near repairing the disinvestment in higher education and schools—and education generally—by this government.</para><para>I put on record our concern about the other element of this report. Senator Carr referred to page 29 of the report. Page 59 reveals a very stark trend of declining financial strength within Australia's university sector. This report also demonstrates a further decline in funding per student. The government plans to increase student numbers from 1995 levels by 27 per cent by 2003, which again is commendable. The government is keen to increase numbers by more than a quarter, but the total revenue is expected to increase only by 21.5 per cent in the same period. That startling statistic is on page 5, if anyone cares to look. This obviously means a further decline in funding per student. Quality issues associated with that relate to higher staff-student ratios and crumbling infrastructure. </para><para>Page 59 of the report demonstrates a trend of declining financial strength of institutions in Australia. The report shows a decline in the safety margins of universities, by aggregate, from 6.9 per cent in 1995 to 3.3 per cent in 1999, the safety margin equalling the surplus relative to income. There are five institutions in this report that recorded a current ratio of less than one in 1999, the current ratio equalling a liquidity ratio that measures ability of institutions to meet their short-term obligations. A ratio of less than one, therefore, is taken as a flag indicating potential liquidity risk. While no one institution may be in immediate trouble, the trend is unmistakable. Anyone who looks at the triennium report will recognise this trend and will be suitably concerned about it. The government's policy of disinvestment is obviously unsustainable. We have heard this repeatedly not only from the Australian Democrats but from the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee. In December last year, the committee released the report <inline font-style="italic">Our universities, our future.</inline> It suggested that $500 million was needed now—that is, immediately—plus an additional $500 million over five years.</para><para>Backing Australia's Ability has some additional targeted programs—we acknowledge them and we welcome them—including increased infrastructure funding to match the increase in ARC grants and extra funded places in science, engineering, IT and mathematics. But the core problem remains unaddressed. I do not think any political party with credibility—certainly not any political party sitting on 30 per cent in the polls right now—will be able to go to the next election campaign without a comprehensive and costed education policy that recognises that education is an investment and not a cost. There are elements of this report that show that the government still treats education as a cost, not an investment in the future. There is a huge reliance on `user pays' and a huge reliance on getting students to pay for their education in a way that discriminates against the traditionally disadvantaged. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>22635</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government document was considered:</para><quote><para>Employment National Limited—Statement of corporate intent 2000/01.

For those of us who were brought up here in Australia, Speedo swimwear—the Speedo cossie—was synonymous with football, kangaroos, Holden cars and meat pies.</para></talk.start><para>It is with the utmost shame that I have to report to the Senate that, on 23 February this year, the few remaining full-time manufacturing workers—65 staff—in the Speedo plant at Windsor in the federal seat of Macquarie in north-western Sydney were given notice that they were going to have their employment terminated on and from 2 March. These 65 staff are local residents and overwhelmingly women. I am advised by their union—the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia, the TCF—that each of these 65 staff has worked for that organisation for, on average, 15 years. We are talking about a group of employees who have made nothing less than a significant contribution to the growth of this company and this country.</para><para>I might just remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the Speedo company started up in 1928, and was in Australian hands until 1991. Now it is in the hands of some British company, and the other day their managing director, Mr Rob Davies, sneakily gave notice to these people that their jobs would be terminated, as I said earlier, on and from 2 March. The reason he gave for taking that action was that it was too expensive to manufacture Speedos in Australia, so they were going to move their manufacturing operations offshore to that great People's Republic of China—that great workers' paradise! That is where they are going to move those operations. </para><para>I wonder why the people in Speedo are doing that. The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union did a raid on one of their subcontractors. As you would know from your previous occupation, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, there are a number of classifications of employees in this country. In the clothing industry there is a category called outworker. These outworkers in the clothing industry are generally men, women and children working on piece rates—not award wages, but piece rates. One lady advised the union when they did a raid on a company in Seven Hills in the western suburbs of Sydney that had an order with Speedo Australia to manufacture and package 2,252 pairs of royal blue and navy blue briefs. That is what their contract was. The contract price with Speedo to do that was $2.85 an hour. As I understand it, one of the outworkers who spoke to the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union said that it takes four minutes to sew a pair of male briefs. On an average per item they get 19c. So they get that princely sum of about $2.80 an hour to sew about 14 or 15 items. </para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>—and I read this report—went to Parramatta, which is about three or four kilometres east of Seven Hills, to one of the premier sports stores in Parramatta, where there is a lot of turnover, so you can expect there would be some sort of competition. The product those ladies and probably children were receiving $2.80 an hour to manufacture for Speedo Australia was retailed at that Parramatta sports store for $30. So the difference between $30 and about $2.80 for labour costs, and maybe double that for what that shonky Dolphin Garments might be getting, is about $24.80—and that is going straight into the skyrocket of Speedo Australia. Why is that not enough money for those buggers to be able to continue to manufacture in this country? </para><para>I am absolutely outraged, particularly with the federal member for Macquarie, Mr Kerry Bartlett. These are all Mr Bartlett's constituents. Every one of these men and women—and, as I said, they are overwhelmingly women—are his constituents. Where has he been? This has been going on since 23 February. Luckily, these men and women have a union that is looking after their interests and luckily we still have an independent arbitration system in this country. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has put a stay on this, but only until this week, so that we can see if we can put it to Speedo to bring the manufacturing operations back to this country, so these 65 jobs stay in the outer suburbs of Sydney and so these 65 men and women and their families can maintain their lifestyles and their dignity in their local community and do not have to go on unemployment benefits or have to accept some sort of redundancy payment. Where is the government and where is Mr Bartlett? We have not heard one bloody word out of him—not one word!</para><para>I am rightly annoyed about this. We are going to allow this to happen to one of our icons—admittedly no longer owned by Australians—this icon that was worn by almost all our swimmers who picked up gold, silver or bronze at the Olympics. These workers, mostly women, have appealed to our Olympic swimmers to support them. They are pleading with the Olympians and saying, `Please assist us in putting pressure on Speedo to stay in Australia. Please assist us to make sure that our jobs, our livelihoods, our dignity and our local communities are maintained. Keep these jobs in Australia.' To date, I am aware of only one Olympian who has responded positively. Michael Klim has said—and I think I am quoting him correctly—that he believes Speedo should stay here. But all those other stars, all those other Olympians, who have been generously supported—and rightly so—over the years by the Australian community are being sought to lend their support in return to those men and women working at Speedo who paid their taxes, on average, for over 15 years.</para><para>I do not want to bash up Speedo; I want Mr Davies to act with a bit of integrity, a bit of nationalism and a bit of forethought and to think about what he is doing by exporting these jobs. The situation is that not only is he exporting those 65 jobs but also these outworkers are being exploited and ripped off not only in respect of their wages and conditions but also in respect of any sort of superannuation entitlements that they may be entitled to. I came here tonight to report to the Senate this outrageous action by an Australian based company, and I hope that I can get some response from the member for Macquarie, Mr Bartlett. But I will do anything that I can to raise this issue. I intend to write to the Prime Minister tomorrow. I intend to write to anybody I can to make sure that this travesty is highlighted and that one of this country's national icons is preserved in this country and that they do not continue to act shamefully—as they have—and instead act in the interest of the people who have supported them.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Interactive Gambling: Personal Explanation</title><page.no>22636</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>22636</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—During the debate on taking note of answers to questions without notice today, I relied on my recollection that I had not voted in this chamber on the second or third readings of the <inline ref="S258">Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000</inline>.

I am referring to Woodside Petroleum. Woodside Petroleum has recently had an offer of takeover from Royal Dutch Shell, the Anglo-Dutch petroleum company—one of the largest, if not the largest, petroleum companies in the world, with profits this year recently announced running at $24 billion. The offer, as I said in this chamber some weeks ago, was to augment the 34 per cent interest that it already had in the issued capital of Woodside to 56 per cent by the issue of shares in Woodside in exchange for leases. These leases were given to Shell over a period of time going back some decades—gratis, as I understand it, by the Western Australian government. Shell has been one of the prime developers of petroleum areas in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>If Shell did get control of Woodside—the biggest Australian player in the North West Shelf—it would also take control of the North West Shelf itself, a $40 billion investment project. If that were to happen, that would give Shell 92 per cent of the exploitable and proven gas reserves in Australia. In my view, that is too much; that is selling off the farm. It is okay to sell off the farm, evidently, if you are left with a tractor. That seems to be okay because, once you are left with a tractor, you can then do some work on the farm that you no longer own. When properties such as farms are bought by overseas interests, this is in effect what often happens. I do not want to see this icon company of Woodside in that particular category, even if I am using metaphors.</para><para>The offer of $14.80 for Shell's interest in its leases to be transferred to Woodside is perhaps only the beginning. When one looks at the profit of the second big international player in petroleum, BP—a company that, ironically, started in the northern goldfields of Queensland last century—one could reasonably speculate that $14.80 may not be the first and only offer to be made for a company that has serious gas reserves and sales. The bidding war has not started yet, and I do not suppose it will start until the Foreign Investment Review Board has given its decision as to whether the takeover by Shell should be allowed. I do know this, though: where other takeovers have happened—takeovers of banks, for instance, by the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac or other banks—the companies have rationalised after their merger or takeover. The bush has certainly suffered with the closure of banks. That has also happened with the CES and employment agencies, post offices, et cetera—all in the name of rationalisation.</para><para>I would question how we would ever have a company that would compare with Shell or BP if we keep on selling companies like Woodside to overseas companies to make them even bigger—and when I say `even bigger', Shell's turnover was, in rounded figures, $300 billion this year. We had three other petroleum companies in Australia: the Commonwealth Oil Refineries or COR, which went years ago; Ampol, which has gone to Caltex; and Golden Fleece—I do not know what happened to Golden Fleece. Some people here, such as Senator Conroy, may be too young to remember Golden Fleece and are certainly too young to remember Commonwealth Oil Refineries. We would, as someone of note said recently, become a branch office of overseas companies if that were to happen.</para><para>Some global investors in Australia who have shares in Woodside have said—petulantly, I might add—that they would divest themselves of all Australian shares if the takeover was not to go ahead. One global investor, who admitted to having several million Woodside shares, said that it would taint Australia if the move was blocked by FIRB. This company is only interested in profits; it does not matter whether it is in Australia, Mongolia or Zambia.</para><para>Mr and Mrs Average are fearful of globalisation when it happens on a scale like this. They fail to understand the concept of globalisation. Another global investor has even used threats to blackmail us—I suppose you could describe it that way—to say that he, too, would not recommend investing in Australian shares and would not only dump his stock but also dump his stock that was bought with Australian dollars.</para><para>I want to cite a very recent statement by the head of Shell's East Asia arm—not an insignificant part of the Shell petroleum empire—Mr Raoul Restucci. He was quoted recently in the <inline font-style="italic">Scottish Evening News</inline>. He said that, if Shell won control of Woodside, Shell would aim to stop Woodside competing directly with Shell—as Shell has in the installations in China and India—for the vast trade that Australia could build up with its LNG and is building up with LNG. I quote Mr Restucci because it has often been said that the defence of Shell is that they would not do that—they would not restrict the flow of gas, they would not use their strength or combine to use their near monopoly of gas if the takeover were approved by FIRB. I wonder whether Shell would have the same problems with its other partners in Brunei and Dar es Salaam. I wonder what would happen there, where Shell has a minority equity, or in Petronas in Malaysia—which is owned by the Malaysia government—or, indeed, in other parts of Australia. It is not uncommon for governments throughout the world to have equity in petroleum.</para><para>Petroleum is not the icon item that the senator on the other side recently spoke about. It is not a Speedo; it is not a bathing costume. It is not Arnott's, Cottees, Watsonia or Edgells Birdseye—it is not even Holden, which was once owned by Australia. It is the holder of some of the most strategic and sensitive commodities in the world. I speak of petroleum and the vast gas reserves that are encompassed by the Woodside leases, as I said before, given to it by the Western Australian government.</para><para>I do have some empathy that, if Shell were to take over the areas of Woodside and if it were somehow possible to tie Shell down to its 56 per cent or to keep that gas flowing—not to compete with the Sakahlin Island discoveries of Shell just off the coast of Japan, north of the island of Hokkaido—there would be less disenchantment in Australia and less disenchantment with me, as a Western Australian senator in this place. But we have seen all too often, regrettably, that those promises are rarely kept, if ever. Until such time as we could have rock solid proof of that, then I could not allow that and would continue to fight that until Shell was able to relinquish its idea of absorbing our icon of Woodside.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Small Business: Predatory Pricing</title><page.no>22638</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>22638</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a long time since I have spoken in the adjournment debate, but I want to make a contribution tonight because an important issue happened over the last week. It is an important step forward for small business as a result of the last Federal Court decision on predatory pricing, which gave the small business community a lot of heart. The availability of remedies for small businesses under the Trade Practices Act, when a large competitor misuses their market power against small business, was an uncertain area of the law for small business until last week.</para></talk.start><para>Last week, some certainty was given to small business when the Federal Court decided that Boral had misused their market power against a small cement-block maker. What is important about the case for small business is that it proves that section 46 of the Trade Practices Act does work for small business people who find themselves trying to compete in a market against large market players abusing their market power. Small businesses often had many doubts over the effectiveness of section 46. This decision now ensures that it is strong enough to support the many instances where big business have used their market power against a smaller and less well resourced competitor.</para><para>This point of view came through time and time again in the joint committee inquiry into the retailing sector. That inquiry provided the opportunity to bring out into the open the many examples and instances of small business and suppliers suffering at the hands of the big retailers. A particular interest and crusade of mine through my 19 years in parliament has been against the demise of many small businesses as they fell victim to the strength of the excessive market power of some companies. I have always expressed my strong concern about the effect this has on rural communities. Country towns become the victims of the growth of the large supermarket chains, particularly as their local specialty businesses—like pharmacies, liquor stores, fruit shops and independent grocers—disappear from a community.</para><para>The retail inquiry revealed instances of a range of conduct involving predatory pricing. I am very pleased to say that the government acted on that recommendation of the inquiry and showed support for small business. The government acted to increase, overall, the powers of the ACCC to act on behalf of small business. Importantly, this included allowing the ACCC to bring representative action on behalf of small business. Last week's Boral case in the Federal Court saw the ACCC have a substantial win for small business, which proved that the misuse of market power provisions in the Trade Practices Act can and do work for small business.</para><para>The ACCC is to be congratulated on its success in this case. It will set the scene for a fairer trading environment for small business. I hope this decision gives heart to the range of small businesses, from suppliers to other small businesses, that can now have a strong decision that clarifies section 46 of the Trade Practices Act on the abuse of market power. I also hope that small businesses are reassured that the government amendments, which were the response to their own submission to the inquiry, can work for them.</para><para>The other matter I wish to refer to tonight is the increased market domination that would arise from either of the major chains taking over Franklins. At the time of the retailing inquiry, market domination by the big three—Coles, Woolworths and Franklins—stood at 70 per cent. That has increased substantially over the period since the inquiry. Nationally it was around 70 per cent and was even higher in some states, like Queensland. I have always maintained that there needs to be a viable third or fourth force out there in the marketplace to ensure continued competition. If Franklins do exit the Australian market, the result should not be an increased market dominance by the remaining two grocery retail giants. I was pleased to see reports at the weekend of Professor Fels saying that he was firmly against the sale of all or part of Franklins to the country's dominant supermarket chains, Woolworths and Coles. Professor Fels's words were:</para><quote><para>A simple divvying up between the two would raise equal concerns, as would an acquisition of all of Franklins by any one of them.</para></quote><para>Market concentration in the retail grocery trade in Australia stands at such a high level that any further increase should never be possible, by any means, as a consequence of dividing up the Franklins properties and shops. There should be no process that would allow either of the market giants to pick the eyes out of the better Franklins stores, should Franklins sell its businesses.</para><para>Franklins' unfortunate position could now become an opportunity to ensure the continued existence of a strong third force in the grocery sector. Independent retailers and wholesalers have served the smaller country towns very loyally in the past. However, country businesses are always living under the threat of the loss of the necessary critical mass to sustain a viable independent sector, and they also need strong buying power. Any increase in market dominance would be a particular disaster for small business in country areas. It would also see a further unbalancing of market power for the independent wholesalers and for suppliers, both manufacturers and farmers. This is reinforced by the words at the weekend from Professor Fels, opposing any further acquisition by Woolworths or Coles from the aftermath of Franklins.</para><para>It is often said, but it does not distract from the truth, that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy and work force. Small businesses are also the backbone of many rural and regional towns and communities. Small business will be given a great reassurance if the Trade Practices Act prevents any further increase in market share through acquisition by the retailing giants as a result of any sale of Franklins businesses. Last week's Federal Court case is also a very welcome development and a reassurance for small businesses. It is a reassurance that we have a system in section 46 of the Trade Practices Act that protects them against the abuse of market power from the large market players.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.34 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>22639</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>22639</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><quote><para>Employment National Limited—Statement of corporate intent 2000/01.</para><para>Higher education—Report for the 2001-2003 triennium by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, March 2001.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995—</inline>National Office of Local Government—Report for 1999-2000 on the operation of the Act.</para><para>Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee—Report for 1999-2000.</para><para>Treaty—<inline font-style="italic">Multilateral</inline>—Text, together with national interest analysis and regulation impact statement—Amendments done at Koror, Palau on 30 March 1999 to the Treaty on Fisheries between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America of 2 April 1987.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>22640</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Census and Statistics Act—Australian Bureau of Statistics—Statement No. 1 of 2001.</para><para>Lands Acquisition Act—Statements describing property acquired by agreement under sections 40 and 125 of the Act for specified public purposes [2].</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indexed Lists of Files</title><page.no>22640</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled pursuant to the order of the Senate of 30 May 1996 as amended 3 December 1998:</para><quote><para>Indexed lists of departmental and agency files for the period 1 July to 31 December 2000—Statements of compliance—</para><para>Australian Trade Commission.</para><para>Department of Health and Aged Care.</para><para>Department of Transport and Regional Services.</para><para>International Air Services Commission.</para><para>Treasurer's portfolio.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>22641</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Taxation Office: Unauthorised Release of Taxation Records</title><page.no>22641</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3237)</subtitle><id.no>3237</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22641</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 December 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the case of the tax agent outlined in the Commonwealth Ombudsman's 1998-99 Annual Report pp 42-43, and further to the answer to question on notice no. 2869 (Senate Hansard, 6 December 2000, p20609)</para><para>(1)	How many times has the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) requested a review of the original Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) opinion that the disclosure of confidential taxpayer information by an ATO officer had been unauthorised by law but done in good faith.</para><para>(2)	(a) Who requested this review;
