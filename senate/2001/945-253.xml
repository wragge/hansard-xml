The signing of the Food Regulation Agreement 2000 was the culmination of lengthy consideration by all governments of the recommendations of the Food Regulation Review Committee, chaired by Dr Bill Blair OAM. </para><para>The Prime Minister announced a review of food regulation in his March 1997 statement, More Time for Business.  The Food Regulation Review Committee was tasked with making recommendations to Government on how to reduce the regulatory burden on the food sector and improve the clarity, certainty and efficiency of the current food regulatory arrangements whilst, at the same time, protecting public health and safety. After considering the recommendations made by the report of the Food Regulation Committee, COAG agreed to a package of food regulatory reforms that ensure a nationally coordinated approach to food regulation, to apply across the whole food supply chain.</para><para>The new food regulatory reform package will ensure that:</para></quote><para>·	public health and safety is strengthened and maintained;</para><para>·	there is national consistency in the interpretation, administration and enforcement of food regulation;  and</para><para>·	consumers have sufficient information to make informed choices.</para><quote><para>The new food regulatory framework is designed to operate efficiently by reducing costs to industry, government and consumers. In particular, it seeks to improve the timeliness and responsiveness of the food standards setting process while maintaining the transparency of, and community confidence in, the food regulatory system.</para><para>The Agreement establishes a new Ministerial Council, the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council.  The Ministerial Council will, among other things, develop domestic food regulation policy as well as policy guidelines for setting domestic food standards.  Recognising the primacy of public health and safety considerations in developing such policy, the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council will be based on the existing Council of Health Ministers (ANZFSC). Its membership may also include other Ministers nominated by individual jurisdictions covering portfolios such as primary or processed food production, or trade.  Each jurisdiction will have one vote with a lead minister for each jurisdiction being chosen. Most jurisdictions have already indicated that their lead Ministers would be from the health portfolio.</para><para>The Bill will establish a new statutory authority, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (the Authority), to be based upon the existing Australia New Zealand Food Authority. </para><para>The prime function of the Authority will be to develop domestic food standards that are to be adopted nationally. These standards are to be developed based on scientific and technical criteria and in accordance with the objectives set out in section 10 of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991, dealing with protection of public health and safety and the provision of information to consumers. </para><para>The Authority will have a Board. The Board will approve standards developed by the Authority and notify those standards to the Ministerial Council. The members of the Board will be appointed by the Commonwealth Minister for Health and Aged Care but only with agreement from the Ministerial Council.  The Board membership must include someone with expertise in consumer rights.  The FSANZ Chief Executive Officer will be appointed by the Board.</para><para>The new food regulatory arrangements will strengthen Ministerial authority and accountability.  The Ministerial Council will develop and promulgate policies that are consistent with the objectives and other matters set out in section 10 of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991, in order to give clearer guidance to the Authority in its development of food standards. This will enable the Ministerial Council to direct, rather than react to, proposals by the Authority. It will also have the capacity to direct the Authority to review any standard, and can reject any proposed draft standard, in accordance with the arrangements set out in the Food Regulation Agreement 2000. </para><para>The Bill sets out the process for the development of food standards that takes into account these roles of the Ministerial Council.  The Bill also makes provision for the transition from the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) to the statutory authority Food Standards Australia New Zealand, and other amendments that are consequential on the re-naming of the Act and the creation of the new Authority.</para><para>The new food regulatory framework is designed to ensure that food businesses produce food that is safe and suitable for human consumption.  To be effective, it must apply across the whole food supply chain. The Authority will therefore eventually be able to develop all domestic food standards that are to be adopted nationally and with New Zealand, including those that under current arrangements are or would be established by the (Ministerial) Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand.</para><para>The arrangements for the development of these primary product standards will be developed by the new Ministerial Council and may require further legislation. New Zealand has indicated that it will not be adopting these primary product food standards because it has other systems in place for their development.</para><para>The Ministerial Council will also determine the arrangements to provide for high level consultation with key stakeholders.</para><para>The new arrangements are designed to enable food standards to be developed more quickly, if agreed by the members of the Ministerial Council. All standards (except those urgent standards that must commence immediately to protect public health and safety) will commence if the Council has informed the Authority that it does not intend to request a review of a draft standard approved by the Authority, if a period of 60 days has expired without the Council requesting the Authority to conduct such a review, or, in relation to an approved draft standard that has already been reviewed twice, the Council does not reject the draft standard.</para><para>Because of the proposed capacity of the Authority to eventually develop all domestic food standards to be adopted nationally, the Board will be able to have a wider range of expertise than does ANZFA (for example, the Bill enables the appointment of members with expertise in primary food production and small business).</para><para>It should be noted that consumer rights are protected in this Bill.  The Amended Act will require that the FSANZ Board must have a member with expertise in consumer rights.  At the same time, the new regulatory model maintains the existing open and publicly accountable arrangements which allow input by all interested groups.  Within the Act there is a set process for FSANZ to follow when developing standards that require public consultation through calls for submissions on the draft standard as it goes through the assessment process.  </para><para>here are other key elements of the new food regulatory system that do not require legislative change.  First, a Food Regulation Standing Committee will support the Council.  The membership of this Committee consist of heads of health departments, and heads of other government departments that reflect the membership of the Council, as well as a senior representative from the Australian Local Government Association. The Committee is to be chaired by the Secretary of the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care. Secondly, the Council will establish a mechanism for the provision of stakeholder advice by representatives of the interests of consumers, small business, industry and public health.</para></quote><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the 2001 winter sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>21656</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Legislation</title><page.no>21656</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.</para></motion></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET</title><type>Budget</type><page.no>21656</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration by Legislation Committees</title><page.no>21656</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Additional Information</title><page.no>21656</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>21656</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee, I present the transcript of evidence and additional information received by the committee relating to the supplementary hearings on the budget estimates for 2000-01.</para></talk.start><para>On behalf of the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, I present additional information received by the committee relating to supplementary hearings on the budget estimates for 2000-01.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>21656</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Publications Committee</title><page.no>21656</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>21656</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>21656</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the 22nd report of the Standing Committee on Publications.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Corporations and Securities Committee</title><page.no>21656</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>21656</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>21656</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Joint Parliamentary Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities on fees on electronic and telephone banking, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of the committee's proceedings and submissions received by the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>There can be no doubt that electronic banking is here to stay. Undoubtedly, there will always be an important role for bank branches. However, there can be no doubt that the efficiency and convenience that the various electronic forms of banking provide will see increasing numbers of bank customers opting for these types of transactions, especially as the proportion of computer literate people in our community increases and newer technology makes the process simpler. Given this, it is essential that customers are fully informed about the cost of each and every transaction before it is undertaken so they can exercise choice about which bank offers the best deal for them. Only then will market forces operate as they should to ensure that competitive pressures keep fees for electronic banking as low as possible. It was in this context that, as Chairman of the Corporations and Securities Committee, I foreshadowed an inquiry on this issue just over 12 months ago. I became aware that a proposal in the draft code of conduct for electronic funds transfer being negotiated between the financial institutions and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to require up-front, real-time disclosure of electronic banking fees had been removed from the draft. This was unacceptable to me and, in calling for disclosure to be restored, I foreshadowed an inquiry if it was not.</para><para>In May, the research group Cannex released its report showing a dramatic increase in electronic banking fees during the past two years. Meanwhile, there was no progress in restoring to the draft code the real-time disclosure provision. Hence, the committee accepted my proposal for this inquiry. The committee received 30 submissions in relation to the inquiry, with strong representation from all of the major players—financial institutions, rural and urban consumer groups and experts, as listed in chapter 1 and appendix 2 of the report. These witnesses represented a very comprehensive and balanced selection of expertise and personal experience, which is reflected in the conclusions and recommendations of the report.</para><para>The first issue, which the report addresses, is the reason for fee increases on electronic banking. The committee concludes that increases have been due primarily to the adoption by banks of a user-pays fee structure on most banking products in place of the margins between borrowing and lending rates cross-subsidising transaction costs and other services provided by financial institutions. Nevertheless, substantial cross-subsidies remain, which make it difficult for customers to know whether they are paying a fair or competitive price. Once a substantial body of customers had been attracted to electronic banking, our evidence shows that financial institutions, having initially underpriced these transactions, substantially increased fees. This indicates market failure, which we find is largely due to the absence of real-time disclosure of electronic banking fees.</para><para>American research clearly shows that customers will vote with their feet and change behaviour and service provider if given adequate information on costs. While the overall lack of specific electronic transaction fee information concerns the committee, a particular concern is fees charged for the use of foreign ATMs, which are those operated by financial institutions other than the one with which the customer holds an account. Banks may be making abnormal or supranormal profits on so-called foreign ATM withdrawals, possibly through collusion and certainly from a disinclination to compete, as a result of the interchange fee system that operates. Evidence from the Reserve Bank and the ACCC confirms that oligopoly profits are being earned through the ATM interchange fee system. Accordingly, we recommend that all interchange fees between banks in relation to foreign ATM transactions be abolished immediately and replaced by direct charging, to reduce foreign ATM fees from approximately $1.50 to approximately 50c. While this may seem a drastic step, it is essential to protect consumers against possible collusive practices and certainly against a lack of competition and pricing unrelated to cost.</para><para>The committee also recommends that all ATMs immediately display a warning notice indicating that a fee will be charged on foreign ATM transactions. Westpac is to be commended for moving in this direction, no doubt in anticipation of this report. It is confirmation of the significance and effectiveness of parliamentary inquiries. On the impact of increases in fees on electronic banking, for those who choose to engage in serial bank bashing, it is pertinent to record that not all the news is bad on this front. Certainly, there have been substantial fee increases. However, the committee concludes that the majority of fee revenue has been reinvested into new and innovative electronic banking services, resulting in a substantial increase in access to these services with associated benefits to users. Also, the impact of fee increases on lower income groups has been reduced by safety net services which have been voluntarily offered by banks.</para><para>We accept evidence that up to 75 per cent of bank customers pay no fees at all and that there are substantial fee exemptions and discounts for people who are financially disadvantaged or disabled and for pensioners and students. As to the availability and transparency of fee information for consumers of electronic banking, there also is some positive news. The committee concludes that the general provision of information is good, being based on ASIC approved codes. These codes are market based and self-regulatory, providing more effective outcomes than direct regulatory intervention. Banks publish more information than the codes require, expressly to assist customers to minimise fees. Increasingly, banks are providing account statements which break down fees and charges, rather than providing just one amount. They are also publishing more fee information on the Internet, a particularly effective channel of disclosure.</para><para>All these practices considerably assist consumers. However, our report also finds that there is a lack of fee disclosure at the point of transaction—usually called real-time disclosure, which is often the most important time for informed consumer decisions. This is a major shortcoming which should not continue. The issue of real-time disclosure, or disclosure at the point of transaction, was one of the most important matters raised during the inquiry. Both the banking industry and the consumer groups agreed that it was a key area in relation to the availability and transparency of fee information. However, the banks claimed that real-time disclosure was not possible in the near future because of technical difficulties and costs. They acknowledged that, with advances in technology, real-time disclosure of fees on electronic banking should be available in the medium to long term. The consumer groups, on the other hand, regarded a time frame of one to two years as appropriate.</para><para>ASIC, as the coordinator and facilitator of the Transaction Fee Disclosure Working Group, advised that its initial view was that guidelines should provide principles which banks should meet within three to five years. The committee considered this conflicting evidence and concludes that consumer interests demand an earlier rather than later implementation of real-time fee disclosure. Consumers would benefit from all aspects of such disclosure, in particular because it would result in downwards pressure on fees and charges. The committee accepts that there would be substantial costs if real-time disclosure were introduced immediately, but we also emphatically find that a five-year delay would be quite unacceptable.</para><para>Accordingly, the committee recommends that a real-time disclosure framework for Internet, telephone and ATM banking should be established within two years and implemented within six months of the finalisation of the framework. We consider that this timetable is so important that we also recommend that ASIC report back to us on a quarterly basis on its progress in implementing the recommendation, with the committee to review progress at the two-year period. We are willing to exclude EFTPOS transactions from the timetable, with ASIC and the consumer groups advising that there is no pressing need to provide real-time disclosure for EFTPOS and that the technological challenge is much greater.</para><para>The committee recommends several other ways to improve the availability and transparency of fees and charges. We also addressed surcharging, which has the potential to become an important consumer issue. Surcharging is a practice widespread in the United States, and is becoming so in Australia, whereby ATMs are operated by independent owners rather than by banks and who charge a fee every time the ATM is used. There are recommendations regarding implementation, and I seek leave to have my remarks on these matters incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The remarks read as follows</inline>—</para><quote><para>The Committee also recommends several other ways, to improve the availability and transparency of fees and charges. First, banks should provide to customers, through web sites and ATMs, a transaction statement setting out the number of previous transactions undertaken in at least the last month. Also. monthly account statements provided to customers should include a breakdown of all fees and charges, not a simple lump sum amount, and these should be displayed in a prominent manner. These are relatively straightforward procedures, but would provide an immediate and significant benefit for consumers.</para><para>The Report also addresses surcharging, which has the potential to become an important consumer issue. Surcharging is the practice widespread in the United States, and becoming so in Australia, whereby ATMs are operated by independent owners rather than by banks and who charge a fee every time the ATM is used. This fee is unrelated to the maintenance of any bank account, being imposed solely for the use of the ATM.</para><para>The Committee notes that the existence of these third party surcharges could be a risk for consumers and therefore recommends that any surcharge should also be subject to disclosure before the actual transaction is made. This will give consumers the option to discontinue the transaction if they wish to avoid the fee. It will protect consumers in an area which is likely to become more important. We also recommend that these third party ATM operators be brought expressly within the provisions of the EFT Code of Conduct.</para><para>The Committee recommends that all of its findings should be implemented through the existing ASIC procedures, in particular through the continuing review of the EFT Code of Conduct. We received evidence on the conduct of the review and of the agreed principles under which the ASIC Transaction Fee Disclosure Working Group, which has the general carriage of this matter, operates. We have confidence in the processes of the Working Group, especially the recognition of the competitive nature of the market and the need for flexibility and innovation. The details of the core Committee recommendations should be finalised through these processes.</para><para>The Committee did not agree with submissions which argued that fee disclosure should be subject to direct legislative intervention to impose a prescriptive bureaucratic solution on banks and customers.</para></quote><para>In conclusion, the committee has confidence in the effectiveness of market pressure in causing financial institutions to reduce fees for electronic transactions. However, market forces can only operate in a situation where the consumer has adequate information. Real-time disclosure of fees is an essential component of that information. My thanks to all members of the committee for their work on this inquiry. I welcome the Democrats support for the report and the qualified support of the opposition, who I hope might resist last minute temptations to indulge in some bank bashing and indeed give the report unqualified support. My thanks to the committee staff—the committee secretary, David Creed, and his staff—along with my own staff, Rob Young and Andrea Bell, for their tireless work in ensuring an effective inquiry and a quality report. I commend the report to all honourable senators. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>21659</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would also like to start by thanking David Creed and the committee secretariat and members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities for all the hard work that has gone into producing this report. Labor members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities are unable to join the government and the Democrats in unanimously agreeing to all aspects of the chairman's report on fees on electronic and telephone banking, but we certainly support many of the recommendations in it.</para></talk.start><para>There are some recommendations and findings of fact that we are unable to agree with. We have therefore produced our own report, which we have called<inline font-style="italic"> Bank fees: up, up and away.</inline> The committee received a great deal of evidence on the impacts of bank fees. Probably the most significant piece of evidence the committee received came from the Commonwealth Bank, which in their submission stated that bank fees generated only a third of the costs of providing banking services. The Commonwealth Bank stated:</para><quote><para>On an industry wide basis, the costs involved in providing these transaction services are still at least three times the level of fees collected. Reserve Bank research has shown that $460 million is recovered from the Australian household sector by way of deposit and transaction fees, compared to total costs of the order of $1.5 billion.</para></quote><para>These comments should send a chill down the spine of every pensioner and every consumer who uses a bank branch. What they tell us is that, if the banks get their own way, over-the-counter transactions in a bank branch would increase from their current level of around $3 to around $9. Consumers who use ATMs and EFTPOS could expect that fees would go up from around $0.60 a transaction to $1.80. Levels of fees such as these would be socially unacceptable. What these comments tell us is that banks have not finished increasing fees. While banks earned fee revenues from households of $1.8 billion last year, and have increased some fees by 400 per cent in the last five years, this is only a drop in the ocean compared with what they could, and want, to earn.</para><para>The warning to consumers is that bank fees will increase until action is taken by the government. Labor members of the committee say that it is time to draw a line in the sand on bank fee increases. A moratorium on bank fee increases is needed to allow the federal government to bring the banks together with pensioner groups, consumer groups, the National Farmers Federation and trade unions to establish a social charter of community obligations.</para><para>One of the main areas of the committee's inquiry focused on whether it was possible to improve the disclosure of ATM fees at the time of transaction. The committee received a great deal of evidence from the banks on this issue. The Commonwealth Bank submitted to the committee that, in many situations, it was technically impossible for the Commonwealth Bank to quote a fee at the time of the transaction. The bank concluded its submission by warning the committee that:</para><quote><para>... further imposition of disclosure practices may inhibit the ability of the Bank to offer customers the ability to receive rebates and concessions on transaction fees they would otherwise have to pay.</para></quote><para>I should pause at this moment because I would like to congratulate Senator Chapman. I think it is important to note Senator Chapman's patience and perseverance in working his way through the undermining and the grandstanding by some of his colleagues in the other place—some senior colleagues—trying to grandstand and jump on board the inquiry by Senator Chapman and the committee.</para><para>Earlier this week Mr Hockey heralded the move as `a very important step'. He was able to announce to the House of Representatives—interestingly, on behalf of the Commonwealth Bank—that the Commonwealth Bank had agreed to join Westpac in committing to improve disclosure of ATM fees. He said:</para><quote><para>The government has delivered real reforms for banks. </para></quote><para>There is a pretty simple message: beware of banks bearing gifts, Mr Hockey. Let us be clear what the banks are actually proposing to do. They are proposing to put a sticker on an ATM which tells a customer from another bank that they may or may not be charged a fee by their bank for using the ATM. Labor welcomes any move that improves disclosure of ATM fees, but this falls short of real reform.</para><para>Mr Hockey seems to have missed what the debate about fee disclosure was all about—or perhaps he was not even following the debate and just jumped in at the end to try to grandstand. The issue for consumers is that at any stage they never know how many transactions they have made in a month, so they are unable to plan their transaction behaviour to minimise fees. If, prior to making the transaction, consumers knew the fee they were to be charged, they would have the ability to cancel. Placing a sticker on an ATM will not fix the broader issue of real disclosure of ATM fees. There has been a great deal of debate as to whether real-time disclosure is technically possible, and there are some issues, as Senator Chapman acknowledged. </para><para>On the other hand, the banks are currently testing new ATMs which will enable banks to advertise products. These new ATMs will enable banks to sell tickets, stamps, prepaid phone vouchers and on-screen advertising and use screens to cross-sell other financial products and services. It would be unthinkable that a bank could provide its customers with the ability to buy a movie ticket before it provided information on how much it is charging to use its own teller. I believe that it is technically possible to introduce a new fee disclosure regime for ATMs within a period of 12 to 24 months. In this area we are in complete agreement with and in support of where Senator Chapman is coming from. </para><para>There are costs involved in establishing a better fee disclosure regime, but these should be weighed against the benefits of a more informed market. Without the introduction of a real-time fee disclosure regime, consumers will increasingly be uncertain as to how much they will be charged for using an ATM and will continue to find it difficult to manage their own transactional behaviour. The recent introduction of Internet banking by the major banks has demonstrated that, if the banks think that they can make a buck, they can implement a new initiative quickly and efficiently. If the banks applied the same commitment that they applied to the introduction of Internet banking to introducing a new fee disclosure regime for ATMs, there is no doubt that a disclosure regime would soon be operational.</para><para>As well as announcing this week that it would improve ATM fee disclosure, Westpac raised the issue of ATM fees. They publicly stated that they supported the introduction of a new direct charging fee regime for ATMs. Westpac told the media that this would reduce ATM fees to `around $1' when it was introduced. The government's report into bank fees has also recommended that a direct charging fee regime be adopted. The government recommended in their report that:</para><quote><para>... interchange fees between banks in relation to foreign ATM transactions be abolished immediately and replaced by direct charging with the effect of reducing ATM transaction fees from approximately $1.50 to 50 cents.</para></quote><para>However, Labor members of the joint parliamentary committee are concerned that, without an agreement with the banks on the level of bank fees, the introduction of a direct charging regime for ATMs will actually lead to some ATM fees increasing. I will quote from the ACCC and the Reserve Bank's report <inline font-style="italic">Debit and Credit Card Schemes in Australia: a study of interchange fees</inline>, which discussed direct charging of ATMs. On page 41 of their report they state:</para><quote><para>Under current arrangements the ATM owner receives the same interchange fee for an ATM withdrawal from a given issuer, regardless of where that transaction is undertaken. High cost locations are therefore subsidised by low cost ATMs. Under a direct charging regime, in contrast, ATM owners could vary the transaction fee according to the per unit cost of individual machines. This would provide an incentive to place more ATMs in higher cost (eg remote) locations, offering greater convenience for consumers willing to pay.</para></quote><para>There is no doubt that rural and regional Australians have higher costs for ATMs than Australians in the city. Firstly, the cost of delivering cash to ATMs in rural and regional areas is greater. Telecommunication costs are also greater. In Collins Street in Melbourne it is rare to see an ATM without a queue of three to four people. This increases the profitability of city ATMs. In contrast, in rural and regional areas, the volume of transactions is likely to be significantly lower. For all John Howard's talk that a `red light' will go on if services are reduced in the bush, we now have a government report that is expressly recommending a proposal that would hit regional and rural Australian consumers.</para><para>I will now turn to another aspect of the government's report on bank fees. One of the comments that received publicity from the committee's inquiry was the ABA's evidence to the committee that up to 75 per cent of consumers do not pay bank fees. Firstly, let us be clear what the ABA actually said about bank fees. They stated:</para><quote><para>ABA analysis shows that, depending on the provider, 30-75% of customers do not pay fees and charges for services associated with transaction accounts.</para></quote><para>One way of reading this statement is to say that up to 75 per cent of customers do not pay bank fees. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>21662</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking on this report, <inline font-style="italic">Bank fees: up, up and away</inline>, I am not going to repeat the observations made by Senators Chapman and Conroy, which covered much of the material that needs to be covered. This is a unanimous report but with additional remarks by the Labor senators, which add to the depth of the content of the report and give a perspective that the Labor Party wish to add. I have some additional perspectives, but I have chosen to use this opportunity to express them rather than to put them in the report.</para></talk.start><para>The Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities is, in my view, not just a committee of the parliament with the normal functions of such a committee. It is a regulatory body; it is part of the regulatory matrix. I say that not only because it has oversight of ASIC but also because it has a particular ability to influence the bodies and the markets with which it deals, by virtue of its conclusions. We are already seeing that in the reaction of the banks to the terms of reference of the committee. In that sense, the committee has a need for, and has developed, considerable expertise. It is a committee to be valued and the members of that committee are certainly able, in their combination, to produce a range of wisdom and expertise which contributes very materially to good outcomes. Senator Chapman is the chair of that committee. These are his terms of reference and, on behalf of the Democrats, I wish to thank him for advancing this particular course. It is a difficult course, it is a technical area, and it is an area where vested interests are amassed on the other side. I think he has shown some political courage in exercising his right to take up these terms of reference and, in the process of this inquiry, he has again proven a careful and consultative chair in the way in which he manages these things.</para><para>Moving onto the report, when you deal with banking issues inevitably the broader issues do emerge—partly because they intertwine by the nature of the industry but also because banks are extremely high profile in a political and market sense. One of those issues is whether monopoly profits, in the economic meaning of that phrase, are being taken by banks. There is a view that, based on such comparisons as are available, the Australian big four generate a rate of return which is ahead of international standards. In other words, they are far more profitable than their competitors. Whether that view is accurate or not I do not know, but there is a feeling in the community that banks can be described as greedy as a consequence. If they were generating significantly higher profits, economic and competition theory would expect that those high profits would attract competitors who, in turn, would be willing to accept lower rates of return, resulting in greater competition and therefore lower prices for customers. That is standard economic theory. In banking in Australia, with the exception of home lending, there is a fear that that has not happened. </para><para>While the chair has quite rightly pursued the issues of transparency—and we are in agreement with the recommendations of the committee and we think that they will have useful outcomes on pricing—there does remain the larger question of whether the banks are generating monopoly profits, in the economic sense of that phrase, and whether they are making excess profits. It is therefore important that the government—and perhaps the Reserve Bank, the ACCC or even the Productivity Commission—keep an eye on whether there are any market failures due to a lack of competition, and why, in the banking sector. The why is not at all clear to me, given that, broadly speaking, the competition and other regulatory systems we have in Australia, and the laws, should have generated greater competitiveness than seems apparent on the surface of things. Therefore, I would be surprised if market failure should be a consequence of that. If it is not a consequence, you would have to ask whether it is regulatory failure.</para><para>There is also a question about whether the market of providing electronic and telephone banking services is sufficiently accessible to new entrants: are there extraordinary barriers to entry into this industry? Why is the sector overall not subject to low-cost competitors in the same way as home loans were subject to a low-cost competitor such as Aussie Home Loans—and there are others in that market. These questions should not be avoided by government, and I would urge the backbench, of which Senator Chapman is a considerable member, to raise them. I think the very substantial disquiet in the community about banks does need some proper appraisal from a policy perspective. </para><para>That leads you to the expectations of the community which we would commonly describe in the sense of community service obligations. This is another issue that was raised in evidence to us. It was not a term of reference and we could not deal with it on that basis, and that is fair enough. The community service obligation means, in government terminology, that you impose a requirement on an industry or a sector and you compensate them for it. From the community's point of view it has a different meaning. To them a community service obligation is the requirement that an industry or a sector provide a service, whether it is from government or from the private sector. There is no doubt that the community in rural and regional Australia and, indeed, in some urban areas of Australia, feel underdone by the banks. They feel that the services that they want are not available, particularly as regards branches and other forms of supply. That may reflect the technological or non-technological ability of large numbers of Australians, but if large numbers of Australians want branches, you have to ask why they cannot be provided. </para><para>From the perspective of the banks, closing branches, cutting staff numbers, maximising profits and adopting user-pays approaches are sound commercial behaviours and you cannot condemn them for looking after the interests of the shareholders. But if the government has to respond to the needs of the community it will have to look at whether it is going to legislate at some stage for banks to provide certain minimum standards to all sectors of the Australian community, simply because it is regarded as an essential service, similar to the essential services of water and electricity, for instance. It would be better if the government did not have to do that. It would be much better if the banks found a way to meet as many of the genuine needs of Australians as is required. </para><para>Our committee is not in the position to evaluate what community service obligations or what minimum service provisions should be made available but perhaps it is time that the government had a look at that and, in a sense, put the banks out of their agony and advised them what minimum, mandated banking community service obligations the government thinks would need be provided unless the banks themselves provided them. I leave that thought with you as well. My last thought is in terms of the real-time remarks made by Senator Conroy. I must say that I share a doubt that this can work well at this time given the evidence that we have received but it is a worthy objective and I think one the committee should keep its eye on.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carr</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21663</page.no><id.no>R1214</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>21663</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kemp</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>21663</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>21663</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><quote><para>The purpose of the <inline font-style="italic">Communications and the Arts Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2000</inline> is to amend certain offence provisions in legislation within the Communications, Information Technology and the Arts portfolio to reflect the application of the Criminal Code to all Commonwealth criminal offences.  The amendments are intended to ensure that when Chapter 2 of the <inline font-style="italic">Criminal Code Act 1995</inline> (the Code) is applied to all Commonwealth criminal offences, from 15 December 2001, those provisions will continue to operate in the same manner as they operated previously.

Chapter 2 of the <inline font-style="italic">Criminal Code</inline> codifies the general principles of criminal law and adopts the common law approach of subjective fault based principles.  It adopts the traditional distinction of dividing offences into <inline font-style="italic">actus reus</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">mens rea</inline> but uses the plainer labels of physical elements and fault elements.  The general rule is that for each physical element of an offence it is necessary to prove that the defendant had the relevant fault element.  The prosecution must prove every physical and fault element of an offence.  The physical elements are conduct, result of conduct and circumstances of conduct and the fault elements specified in the <inline font-style="italic">Criminal Code</inline> are intention, knowledge, recklessness and negligence.  The default fault elements which the <inline font-style="italic">Criminal Code</inline> provides will apply where a fault element is not specified and where the offence (or an element of the offence) is not specified to be a strict or absolute liability offence.

This is necessary to ensure that offences currently interpreted as strict liability continue to be interpreted as such after the Code is applied.  In addition the Bill amends certain offence provisions to remove the defence and restate it is a separate subsection.  This is to ensure that the defences are not interpreted as an element of the offence.</para><para>In addition, the <inline font-style="italic">Communications and the Arts Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2000 </inline>will make other minor amendments to offence provisions in the Communications, Information Technology and the Arts portfolio which are consistent with the general criminal law policy to simplify offence provisions and improve the operation of offence provisions.  </para><para>These amendments fall into the following broad categories:</para></quote><para>·	amendments to restructure provisions where part of the conduct element of the offence includes `breach of a condition of a licence, authorisation, permit, certificate or declaration';</para><para>·	amendments to restructure offences relating to non compliance with a notice, requirement, rule, direction or order; </para><para>·	amendments to restructure offence provisions which include an inappropriate physical element of conduct; </para><para>·	an amendment to alter a legal burden of proof; </para><para>·	amendments which create a new offence; </para><para>·	amendments to make certain fault based offences ones of strict liability; amendments to ensure the meaning of `engaging in conduct' includes omissions; </para><para>·	an amendment so as not to require knowledge of the law; </para><para>·	amendments to repeal false or misleading statements or false or misleading documents provisions; and </para><para>·	amendments to convert dollar amounts to penalty units.</para><quote><para>Subject to several minor exceptions, noted in the Explanatory Memorandum, this Bill does not affect the operation of the current criminal offences.

The Labor amendment proposes to omit 30 June as the operative date for the changes, which the government have advocated, and substitute 28 October 1998. The effect of that is to make the changes that the government are proposing retrospective. We are faced with quite extraordinary circumstances in dealing with this legislation. Labor believe that making the proposed changes to tax law that are presented before the chamber today retrospective to this date is fully justified. What are the reasons for that? We are faced with the situation, as admitted by the tax office, that there has been $1.5 billion laundered through a variety of schemes to evade, minimise or in many cases not pay tax that the vast majority of Australians are required to do. This $1.5 billion is a loss of revenue of some $600 million. That is the tax office admission with respect to the figures we are dealing with with this legislation. The figures may be higher. The tax office have not finished counting. So it is a very substantial amount of money. Evidence before the committee from other witnesses indicates that it may be substantially more than $1.5 billion.</para></talk.start><para>The money is being laundered through a variety of schemes, including noncomplying offshore superannuation funds. It is very clear, not just to the Labor opposition but to the government, to the Liberal-National Party and indeed to all political parties represented in this Senate, that the intention of superannuation funds is for retirement purposes. Moneys in superannuation funds are required to pay a variety of taxes. Those taxes include contributions tax and in some cases for higher income earners the so-called surcharge tax. The evidence before the committee is that there are perhaps some 2,000 to 3,000 individuals who have been involved in laundering money through a variety of schemes to avoid these taxes. And not only to avoid those taxes, which every other Australian is obliged to pay, but also to not pay income tax. </para><para>Apparently, according to the evidence before the committee, in the case of offshore noncomplying superannuation funds, moneys are moved offshore, avoiding the contributions tax—which is 15 per cent when you put your money in and 15 per cent when you take your money out—and avoiding the so-called surcharge tax, which is up to 15 per cent for higher income earners. Then the moneys are brought back into Australia and no income tax is paid. In other words, a significant number of high income earners are not paying any tax through these very dodgy arrangements. It is a massive tax scam. I must say in passing that it surprises me that, with a few exceptions, the media has not been more vigilant on this issue, because this represents one of the major tax minimisation scandals of the last 20 years.</para><para>As I said earlier, it was never the intention of parliament, nor is it indeed the policy of any political party represented in this place, for superannuation funds and other employee benefit arrangements to be used in this manner. Indeed, we are confronted with the somewhat intriguing situation of the tax office not believing that these arrangements are legal. The tax office has said that these arrangements are illegal. The Assistant Treasurer has said these arrangements are not legal, and yet they continue to be marketed. So we are confronted with the rather contradictory position, never adequately explained by the minister, Senator Kemp, or by the tax office, as to why we are in fact passing law to change the regulation in this area when the current law, apparently, is fine. The activities are illegal under current law. It seems to me to be a basic contradiction that has never been properly explained.</para><para>The Labor opposition believes that the government and the tax office should be fully armed to collect this money. There should be no doubt that these moneys can and will be collected. And to remove any possibility of doubt that these moneys cannot be collected, the Labor opposition is taking the very unusual step of proposing to make this amendment retrospective to 28 October 1998. Why 28 October 1998? Well, that was the first occasion on which the tax office gave a view publicly that these arrangements were illegal. </para><para>We are faced with another fairly intriguing contradiction, that is, it is clear from evidence from the tax office that, on six or eight occasions, the tax office itself, through the process of private binding rulings, had ruled that some of these schemes were in fact legal. It certainly puts a question mark over the way in which these private binding rulings were issued by the various officers of the tax office. So Labor is proposing 28 October 1998 as the date for amendments that, apparently, the tax office and the government admit are not necessary in order to enforce the existing law.</para><para>We wish to see this massive amount of revenue collected, backdated from 28 October 1998 through until obviously today—some 2½ years. We are critical of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, not the tax office. The tax office is the servant of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, who is responsible for the administration of the tax office. Here we are 2½ years later considering critical legislation which will, apparently, wipe out a massive tax scandal and scam. It is 2½ years since the initial view was issued by the tax office—2½ years, Senator Kemp. Frankly, the Labor opposition does not know what you do. This legislation should have been presented much earlier. It should have been considered much more urgently than is the case. Now, 2½ years later, these scams are still going on, despite the fact that you, Senator Kemp, claim that they are illegal.</para><para>So the purpose of the Labor opposition in moving our retrospective amendment is to ensure that the tax office is fully armed in collecting a tax—a significant amount of revenue—from these schemes that, it is very clear, were never intended to be utilised by a relatively small number of high income earners. They were never intended to be utilised to wipe out the tax that everyone else in Australia—low and middle income earners, and most high income earners, for that matter—is required to pay through employee benefit arrangements, including their superannuation contributions. So we urge the chamber to accept the Labor amendment to hopefully put this matter beyond any doubt whatsoever and to fully arm the tax office to let it get on with its job. The Labor opposition—the tax office is well aware of this, and I know Senator Kemp is—will be pursuing this issue on an ongoing basis to ensure that every cent of this $600 million—it is possibly a larger figure—is collected.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>21666</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just want to indicate that the Democrats will not be supporting this ALP amendment, as I indicated in my speech on the second reading.

We think any retrospectivity is better than no retrospectivity. It is disappointing to us that the Democrats are not taking the same tough position as we are in enforcing what is apparently existing law, as argued by the minister and by the tax office. I wish to make two other points. The Labor Party did attempt to invite at least some of the promoters of these outrageous schemes to the Senate committee hearings—those that we had some knowledge of. They refused, which is not surprising, I suppose, but disappointing. It would have been useful to have had the promoters, some of which are leading accounting firms in this country, justify how and why some high income earners have placed at least $1.5 billion in these tax avoidance schemes to minimise or not pay tax that the vast majority of Australians are required to pay. Nevertheless, that has occurred and—short of attempting to subpoena those companies and get some evidence—they refuse to appear.</para></talk.start><para>There is one question I would put to Senator Allison.

While acknowledging the principle that governments allocate portfolio arrangements within administrative arrangements, the question that needs to be examined is whether this is an appropriate allocation within the Senate committee system. We have a simple situation, which I think the Senate should appreciate. There is a new department being created, the Department of Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, and, as a consequence of the creation of that new entity, some 12 pieces of legislation which were formerly administered by the Prime Minister's department—that is, the Aboriginal Affairs (Arrangements with the States) Act 1973, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Act 1978, the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976, the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Act 1989, the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991, the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act 1997 and the Native Title Act 1993—are all being transferred to this new entity, the Department of Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, for administration.</para></talk.start><para>It may well be reasonable to ask whether this is an appropriate reorganisation within the government. I think the opposition are entitled to question that. This country has had great difficulty dealing with the issue of reconciliation as a result of this Prime Minister's failure to face up to some fundamental issues with regard to justice for Aboriginal communities. But now it is being proposed that this new entity be created and it be moved across, in effect, to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs insofar as the same head of department will be in charge of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the new Department of Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I understand it is even physically moving into the same building.</para><para>The government has a few options as to where it allocates responsibility for the consideration of these issues within the Senate estimates. There are three options, as I understand them. It can go to the Community Affairs Committee, the Finance and Public Administration Committee or the Legal and Constitutional Committee. The argument for the Community Affairs Committee essentially rests on the proposition that Aboriginal communities ought to be considered in the context of general services available for all communities in this country. The weakness of that argument, of course, is that the Aboriginal communities require much more assistance than the general communities within society, and that goes to issues of legal rights, reconciliation and, in particular, land rights.</para><para>The other area that the government has chosen is that of finance and public administration. The argument there goes to the issue of continuity and, I would suggest, the real issue of convenience for the minister—in this case, Senator Hill. The issue then is the third area—that of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—where, it seems, the questions would be more logically put with regard to the legal questions that have to be dealt with and the broader issues that have traditionally been dealt with by those with expertise on that committee. A decision has been made by the government and, I understand, is supported by the Democrats to stick this issue with one particular committee, the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee. That is the essence of this motion.</para><para>We need to consider whether the government is now caught out, as a result of its own inaction, with regard to its ministerial allocation within this chamber. There is the legitimate question of whether the government has ensured that the ministerial provisions in this chamber are adequate to meet the requirements of the chamber itself. I have no doubt that Senator Ian Campbell would agree fully with me on that proposition. The other issue that concerns me is how much consultation there has been with the committees themselves about where this might best be dealt with and whether it might be appropriately considered by looking at other options. It strikes me that the Legal and Constitutional Committee is a more appropriate place to put it in terms of the expertise that is available. It is reasonable that the general issues, particularly the legal concerns, should be dealt with in the framework of our Legal and Constitutional Committee.</para><para>The government will argue that, in essence, it is difficult for Senator Hill to go to two committees. The problem is that the officers of the department, who would normally be considering issues within the context of the legal and constitutional committee—which handles immigration and other issues associated with that department—will be appearing before the legal and constitutional committee. So, instead of the minister moving, the departmental officers will be required to move. If this is the way in which the government wishes to allocate the department—and it clearly has the support of others in the chamber—then, presumably, that is what will happen. But proper consideration ought to be given to the availability of the committees, the availability of the expertise within each chamber and the capacity of the government to proxy ministers into these committees.</para><para>One understands the pressure of time on particular ministers, and Senator Hill may well argue that case, but Senator Ellison will be required to deal with all the other issues before the Legal and Constitutional Committee and is more than able, I would have thought, to delegate for Senator Hill with these officers, particularly given that these officers will be from not PM&amp;C but the new entity of the Department of Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. In that context, the government is making a decision conditional upon the convenience of one particular minister rather than the best allocation of departments to the resources of this chamber so that the acts administered by this new department can be properly scrutinised within the most appropriate committee framework. For those reasons, we are concerned about the proposition advanced by the government today and we oppose it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>21670</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I say to the Manager of Government Business that the more appropriate action here would be to adjourn this matter, mostly because we had set views on it a couple of hours ago but, as more information has come in, we are now more likely to be flexible.

If, as we understand, a new department is going to be created, there is no problem with putting it in the FPA area. If the funding is going to remain in PM&amp;C and if Mr Ruddock is going to represent it there, there is no problem with it staying there. But if the funding and organisation is moving to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs as a subset of that then Senator Carr has hit it right on the head: it should be in the Legal and Constitutional Committee area.</para></talk.start><para>These things have not been gazetted yet and, therefore, we cannot be certain of where this should sit. We have been extremely flexible in the arrangements and allocation of ministers in the estimates process. They always take number one priority and shadow ministers take second priority. Initially, it seemed that this was being done just for the convenience of Senator Hill. As more information comes in, it appears to be more complex than that. I also think Senator Hill has too high an estimates load, representing Prime Minister and Cabinet, his own Environment portfolio, Foreign Affairs and now this area. Maybe when we get around to having parliamentary secretaries there, the next Labor government will not have to repeat this error and will have a more even distribution of areas. We are starting to shift on this as information comes in. We could never agree to it just for the convenience of a minister if it stood in such contrast with the way it is normally done. That may not be the case.

I agree with the proposition put by Senator Ray and supported by Senator Faulkner, which is to postpone this matter until a later hour. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21671</page.no><id.no>R1150</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1149</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>21671</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 7 December 2000.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>) proposed:</para><motion><para>That the committee does not insist on its amendments to which the House of Representatives has disagreed in respect of each bill.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>21671</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—These are quite serious amendments that need to be considered, and the opposition is, in essence, pressing its argument that it maintained in the original consideration of these issues before Christmas.

I will begin by outlining the opposition's general approach to these amendments that we are seeking to press. The message from the House concerns the two Australian Research Council bills, and it might seem to a number of senators here that this is a bit of a bad dream in so far as we went through this whole argument in the last sitting week of last year. Unfortunately, the nightmare is still with us. Our amendments have not been accepted by the government in the House of Representatives. The government has in fact ensured an unreasonable delay in the passage of these bills as a result of its decisions in regard to some of the issues.</para></talk.start><para>This is especially important given that the government in this chamber voted for a number of the propositions that we advanced last December, but it now feels that it is not able to support them now that the matter has come back to us after the amendments were rejected by the government in the House of Representatives. We will have to examine in some detail the apparent change in the government's attitude. This is despite the fact that the government, before the Senate committee that examined a number of these issues, received acknowledgments from the departmental officers and the persons who were presumably responsible for issuing the drafting instructions, through of course the minister, to the legislative draftspeople that they had created a situation where they were not intending to undertake actions that the bill specified the government was undertaking.</para><para>This situation is particularly odd given the Prime Minister's recent innovation statement and given such an attempt by the government to present itself as having reformed its attitudes on research and development. Given that research and development is central to our economic prosperity, it is not surprising that these issues ought to be attracting such concern within this chamber itself. The government, as I say, has caused the delay in the introduction of these bills into law as a result of its own actions. </para><para>The drafting errors in the bill have yet to be attended to by the government. I am referring to the way in which the Commonwealth will be seeking to allocate funds to various entities. The drafting area here suggests that the minister will have the power to bypass the whole institutional framework established in other parts of the legislation to the point where the government can allocate moneys to organisations other than those registered on the Australian framework register. This means that companies or organisations that are not registered may receive funds from the government to undertake research and development work which ought to be properly undertaken through their own resources. So under this scenario we could see funds being made available to BHP or to Coles Myer or even McDonald's. They could absolutely bypass the university system in toto.</para><para>When these matters were raised, every witness appearing before the Senate committee that considered these issues made it perfectly clear that the sector as a whole did not support these proposals and that the provision was contrary to the opinion and wisdom of every responsible party and organisation in the higher education sector. The First Assistant Secretary of the department, the senior officer responsible for higher education, Mr Michael Gallagher, in evidence to the inquiry referred to the new national protocols applying to the creditation of higher education institutions. He said:</para><quote><para>He—</para></quote><para>the minister—</para><quote><para>has no interest in circumventing those procedures. Without subsections (1D)(b) and (1E)(b)—</para></quote><para>that is, the offending subsections—</para><quote><para>the bill would not be substantially altered.</para></quote><para>So the senior officer of the department responsible for administration of this legislation says that, if we were to accept these amendments and change the bill to reflect the intentions of the government's stated policy, the bill would not in any way be substantially altered in its impact. Mr Gallagher went on to say in response to questioning that the department would be recommending to the minister that he accept amendments to the bill and remove those subsections. I can only presume that that recommendation was made. One can follow from that, given the government's current position, that the recommendation was rejected. Senator Ellison, who is here today handling this matter for the government, is recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as saying, in terms of the amendments that we pursued on the last occasion:</para><quote><para>The government will not oppose this provision.</para></quote><para>It is quite apparent that the government have had a change of heart and have dug their toes in and will not accept the opposition's amendments designed to fix up this drafting error. I take the government at their word—maybe that is a mistake. But I am always a generous person when it comes to this government and one has to assume that they mean what they said—that the government, at their word, did not intend these things to happen. Therefore, one would have to argue that the government should have no trouble accepting what Senator Ellison said the last time this matter was considered—that is, the government will not oppose this provision.</para><para>The amendments agreed to by the Senate go largely to the question of transparency and accountability. I think these are important issues when we are talking about the allocation of very substantial sums of public money. The government and Dr Kemp have asked us, in effect, to swallow the news that, while they are prepared to double the funds available to the ARC, they want the new look ARC to be less accountable, less transparent, less independent, less authoritative than it was under the old legislation. That is essentially the proposition we have been asked to cop here. While they are claiming to spend an extra $3 billion over five years on research and innovation, they do not want to tell the public, nor this parliament, what they are going to do with that money or why they are doing it. It strikes me that that is something we cannot accept. </para><para>The ALP and Democrat amendments—and on most of these issues there is probably broad agreement across this side of the chamber—have the effect of actually strengthening the ARC and providing it with greater independence. They require the tabling of certain decisions relating to research and funding on behalf of the minister and the reasons for those decisions. They will seek to add a student member representing higher degree students to the ARC. They will remove the subsections containing the drafting error, which I have referred to today. They will allow the council to initiate its own inquiries and reports. It strikes me that none of those propositions are particular revolutionary. They are straightforward and they are reasonable. They are positions that this government ought to accept. In part, the government has accepted them in the past but now, because of some reasons which are yet to be explained to us—and I look forward to the minister's explanation on this point—the government has backflipped on this issue.</para><para>The ability for the ARC to initiate its own inquiries is a very important matter in all of this. It is critical that the ARC be able to provide independent advice to government. Unless it has the power to do this, we will have a serious situation whereby a public institution is required to give advice to government but is restricted in the capacity in which it gives that advice. The minister could presumably find himself in the situation where he could hear advice only of the nature that he wants to hear. That is very dangerous for any government. Frankly, I think governments do better when they have access to independent advice, and I suggest the country would do a lot better. This is an incredibly short-sighted view by the government. It has the potential to do damage to the whole country if the government is not incredibly careful.</para><para>This minister will not be here forever. These provisions will apply to ministers until this law is changed. For those reasons, we ought to look very carefully at what the government is seeking to have us accept. It strikes me that, under this arrangement, if the ARC wanted to undertake a study or an inquiry on a matter that has been identified as important to research policy, it would be obliged to go cap in hand to the minister and to seek a reference from him. Under the old legislation, it did not have to do that. The minister says that no reasonable request of this kind would be refused by the minister. I am sure every minister would say that. It would be a very strange minister indeed who did not make that claim. I have yet to see a minister say, `I acted unreasonably.' The problem is determining what is reasonable and what is unreasonable in these circumstances. It may be that, if a piece of research is not liked by the minister, that in itself becomes unreasonable.</para><para>There are a couple of parallels to be drawn when considering these issues. There is a whole series of Commonwealth acts that set up statutory bodies to provide advice to government—the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992, the National Gallery Act 1975, the National Museum of Australia Act 1980 and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Act 1989. At least one of these acts—the National Museum of Australia Act—is the product of a coalition government. I understand it is before the parliament at the moment. These acts are therefore indicative of the government's thinking in other areas. None of these restricts the capacity to provide independent advice. In the case of the museum act, the museum powers are much broader than are being proposed under this measure by this government. Frankly, the government's position makes no sense.</para><para>I presumed that the government's abject refusal to remove the unintended errors with regard to the <inline ref="R1149">Australian Research Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2000</inline> was unintentional, but its refusal now is nothing short of stunning. The minister has a few moments to consider this issue and to explain to us why it is the case. Minister, will you reconsider this position? What we are saying on those two matters is quite critical, and we will be pressing these amendments. I need to say a few other things, Minister. I trust you have had a look at those documents and will now indicate whether leave will be granted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Is leave granted?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name></talker><para>—We are still looking at the document.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>21674</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will follow on from what Senator Carr was saying. I think the issues of transparency and accountability are very central points. The structure of this legislation would enable a minister—I use the word `enable' advisedly; I am not saying for one minute the minister would do this—to act in an arbitrary, indeed capricious, manner. Minister, perhaps when you answer the issues raised by Senator Carr, it would be useful to go through the mechanisms by which a decision is reached and whether there is any process at all that could be effectively subjected to scrutiny either in the courts or in parliament. The proposition put in the government's material is that these matters will be set out in an annual report. Putting matters in an annual report is hardly the sort of process that Senator Carr was talking about. How do people know how public money is being spent? How do people know whether their application for research funds has been properly looked at? How do people know that money that is going to research is going to the proper research?</para></talk.start><para>How is it that the government can say that this is a matter where transparency and accountability prevail? Because, when you look at it, what you have is a very thin act that simply sets up a board that makes recommendations to the minister, and it is left to the minister to decide how the money is to be spent and to what grants the money will go. I think this is part of a much broader problem that must be answered at some stage. It is comparable, I think, to the tendering process in government, where commercial-in-confidence is used as a means of prohibiting people from seeing what happens. So people tender for a particular contract—it may be a contract to supply goods or it may be a contract to supply IT material, and I note that sitting in front of me here is Senator Lundy, who is perhaps the most outstanding mind in this parliament on the issue of IT, so I will not press on with that illustration because she would soon pick up any errors I made about it. I simply use that to bring out what I am trying to say—that is, in a tendering process the person who loses the tender does not know why he or she lost or why, if it is a company, it lost, and that is not a good thing when there is public money being expended and where accountability and transparency are preached but never, it seems, carried out.</para><para>I think there is a danger in this legislation, as there is in much legislation—and I have been reading the schedules of the amendments made by the Senate and the government's comments—and there is oftentimes a great tendency in government to use matters of virtue to produce outcomes that are really outcomes of vice. I would like to know from the minister just what the process is that translates the minister's decision into a payment of a research grant and whether any part of that process is open to scrutiny at a public level.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>21675</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have had a chance to look at the document that Senator Carr wants to table and, with some reluctance, I am prepared to agree to leave to table it.

I know that Senator Carr is saying there is an allegation that fee paying students are given some favouritism. This government is deeply concerned about the quality of the higher education sector and will take any documented allegation seriously. Should the allegation raised by the Australia Institute be appropriately documented, I am advised that the minister will instruct the department to contact the vice-chancellors directly at all relevant universities regarding the allegations. But we must remember that Australian universities are autonomous institutions and are fully responsible for their own academic standards.</para><para>The Commonwealth government has played an integral role in the establishment of a new, independent university audit agency, the Australian Universities Quality Agency. The Australian Universities Quality Agency will focus, as part of its academic audits of universities, on the internal mechanisms in place to ensure high academic standards for all students. This will include scrutiny of the processes an institution has in place to investigate allegations in relation to academic standards. With those remarks, I agree to leave for tabling of the document. I do not want to delay the passage of this matter, but the document is not really relevant to the ARC.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>—I will now move on to put the government's position on record in relation to both of these bills. The <inline ref="R1150">Australian Research Council Bill 2000</inline> and the <inline ref="R1149">Australian Research Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2000, </inline>as put forward in this parliament, have the intention of broadening and strengthening the Australian Research Council's role in both providing strategic policy advice to government and administering a new financial regime of support for excellent research. The amendments proposed by the Senate threaten to jeopardise the key function of the ARC by overwhelming it with paperwork and red tape. Furthermore, the government is of the view that these amendments potentially have jeopardised the consultative relationship between the government and the ARC, altering the balance between the performance of the ARC's statutory duty to inform the government on particular priorities rather than on those priorities of the ARC's choosing. Furthermore, these amendments expand the membership of the board in a manner that is unworkable. That is another aspect of these amendments that the government is not prepared to concede at this stage.<inline ref="R1149"></inline>Finally, although not related to the operations of the ARC, the amendments impose unnecessary restrictions on the availability of funding to support research and research training. In particular, they remove the access to Commonwealth funding for research and research training from at least one university currently in receipt of it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to those who can be funded—and I think Senator Carr referred to the transitional bill and the register that was mentioned there—the government would say that that is an appropriate way to deal with the matter because it is a transitional bill dealing with the implementation of these measures. Senator Carr also concentrated on the question of references and the question of whether the ARC on its own initiative could embark on a particular area of research. There is nothing in these proposed bills which prevents the ARC from drawing the minister's attention to an issue which should be referred to them for further investigation and advice. Such an approach ensures that there is regular consultation between the minister and the primary advisory body on research matters. The function of making recommendations to the minister about matters related to research and education effectively duplicates the other functions of the ARC—namely, to provide recommendations on proposals for approval for funding assistance and the funding of providing advice to the minister. So the government would reject any notion that what it proposes limits or truncates the ability of the ARC to function effectively as an advisory body. With those comments, I advise that, at this stage, the government does not propose to agree to the amendments as put by the opposition. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>21676</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is appropriate that we consider in the debate on the <inline ref="R1150">Australian Research Council Bill 2000</inline> the issues covered by the documents that have been tabled today. In the context that the Prime Minister has made statements where he has sought to represent the government's position as a major reversal on higher education and research, it is important to note that the government is going to have to do a great deal more if it is to mend the damage that it has done to our universities. </para></talk.start><para>The desperate rush to commercialisation in response to the funding starvation is seriously threatening the international reputation of our higher education system as a whole. The Australian higher education institutions are deservedly respected here and overseas for their high standards of teaching and research. But this reputation cannot be taken for granted; it must be earned genuinely and nurtured carefully. Amongst the private colleges operating within the international education industry, it has taken only a small minority of disreputable operators to threaten the health of the industry as a whole. One must avoid any similar unfortunate development occurring in the broader higher education sector. </para><para>Australian universities once had an unquestioned reputation for excellence. Australians in the past could be heard scoffing at the variable quality of American universities. But now, thanks to this government's policies, there are question marks over the presumption that Australian university courses offer universally high quality. The New South Wales Ombudsman has revealed that the number of complaints about higher education that he has received has doubled since 1996 and that such complaints are now a weekly occurrence. Based on the available reports, my information is that the number of complaints to the ombudsmen in Western Australia and Queensland has also doubled since 1996. The recent cases of alleged soft marking and preferential treatment at the Sydney University and the Queensland University of Technology reinforce the view that concerns about quality assurance are more widespread than might be supposed. Claims that the integrity of the Australian qualification system has been compromised are very grave. These are matters that go to the heart of our international reputation for excellence in education. The reputation of our universities and their graduates is crucial to our economic health and our future in global markets. </para><para>I personally have received a considerable number of complaints and depositions on these particular issues from university staff, students and others associated with the universities. These complaints have been referred—in fact, I encouraged members of the public, citizens, to do so—to the current Senate inquiry, although it may be necessary for me to raise further matters in this chamber. Serious allegations made in good faith about misconduct and falling standards for our universities need to be promptly, thoroughly and publicly investigated. Pretending that these events do not occur does nothing to address the central problems. The Australian government has responsibility to ensure the quality of our universities. Tragically, this government does not appear to care. </para><para>By way of a case study of possible outcomes of the pressures facing Australian university staff, let me cite a recent example of the Department of Accounting and Finance at the University of Melbourne. The facts of this case appear not to be in dispute with the university—they have been acknowledged by the university. In 1998-99 a mature age postgraduate full fee paying student, Mr Paul Marks, was enrolled in a Master of Applied Finance at the University of Melbourne. This person was not an international student. On a number of occasions between August and September 1998, this student put a proposal to Kevin Davis, the Colonial Mutual Professor of Finance and head of the department. The proposal was that a sum of $2 million be made available from the student's father's estate to finance a research centre headed by Professor Davis. The money was to be made available in June or July 1999. The $2 million offer was communicated to the Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Commerce, the academic director of the masters program and the head of the finance cluster in the department. Others within the university were also made aware of these offers. The nature and the length of the negotiations entered into between members of the department and the student suggest that the offer was viewed as genuine and likely to come to fruition.</para><para>The proposed donation of $2 million was given credence by the faculty insofar as the dean of the faculty wrote to the student confirming in detail the terms of the donation. That letter is dated 29 September 1998, and it has been tabled here today. The letter confirms that the $2 million was to be paid in June or July 1999 and that the research centre was to be headed by Professor Davis. The tax act requires that donations of this type, if they are to attract deductible status, must be anonymous; yet the senior management of the department clearly knew of the source of this proposed donation. In fact, they offered to host a dinner for Mr Marks at the university. </para><para>In addition to the $2 million donation, offers of lucrative consultancies were made by the same student and discussed with academic staff teaching the Master of Applied Finance subjects in which the student was enrolled. Several consultancies were offered to the student's lecturers, with varying values from $50,000 to $250,000. The student proposed that a team of consultants be assembled for one of his company's clients, Hitachi, and fees of $250,000 were discussed with each of the student's two lecturers who participated in a lunch with him in July 1998. The student also discussed with another of his lecturers the possibility of rendering assistance for that lecturer to secure a scholarship for a prestigious program at the University of Chicago. Only one lecturer indicated to the student that a discussion of these matters was inappropriate and should cease. A number of these approaches by the student took place less than a week before the date of his examinations. Of the 10 subjects undertaken by the student, five were upgraded. One mid-semester exam result, in corporate finance policy, was raised from a fail to a pass. Without a pass in this subject, the student would not have satisfied the requirements for a masters degree. That these events occurred is beyond dispute. </para><para>On 9 December 1998, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne asked the Head of the Law School, Professor Michael Crommelin, to undertake a closed review of allegations of possible impropriety in the department of finance and accounting. The Vice-Chancellor, Professor Alan Gilbert, in a letter of 28 May 1999, directed that `staff not discuss the report with anyone that does not have a legitimate interest in the issues raised'. Staff were directed that they were not to copy the report or allow others to read it. The report, while recommending that staff be more careful with `apparent conflicts of interest' found that there had been no misconduct by staff or students.</para><para>My reading of the report suggests to me that, during the conduct of the inquiry, not all staff members involved directly in the events surrounding these claims were interviewed. The inquirer did not directly ask staff whether consultancy agreements were entered into or whether money was exchanged. I have reason to believe that not all consultancies offered were declared in this report. It appears that not all relevant correspondence was called for to be provided by all members of the university. It appears that the inquirer believed that seeking a disclosure of all consultancy activities by staff in the department was not relevant. The implicit assumption is that no donations, gifts or consultancies were accepted. I repeat: staff were not asked the relevant questions and not all staff were spoken to. I can just imagine the public response if this same level of partiality were applied to the inquiry into cricket match fixing.</para><para>The inquiry did not deal with the fact that the main beneficiary of the proposed donation—the head of the department—presided over the determination of grades. Nor does the report acknowledge that the academic director of the program knew of the offered donation, that other lecturers probably knew of the donation—and certainly knew of the proposed consultancies—and that the student, contrary to normal practice, sought to identify himself on exam scripts by including his name as well as his student number. It defies credibility to assert that offers of donations and consultancies were made without any attempt to influence lecturers, examiners and those who had direct control over the determination of grades. </para><para>It will be argued that, in this case, no evidence has been brought to light that the student in question did in fact receive any beneficial treatment. It is arguable, however, that these events constitute the offence of solicitation of secret commissions under section 176 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Victoria). It would appear that the university's internal inquiry did not examine any of these issues. There is some evidence that offences of corruptly receiving or corruptly giving secret commissions have been committed or attempted. However, in the absence of documentary evidence or other evidence of concluded contracts between the parties, it may well be that these offences would not be proved in a court of law. It remains unclear as to whether such evidence was actually sought, just as the matter of contradictory advice provided to the inquirer remains unresolved. The veracity of the assertions to the inquiry may well be open to question. </para><para>While the University of Melbourne has in recent times, on legal advice, referred to the police other matters involving university members, it would appear that this option was not considered in this inquiry. It is also clear that serious issues involving apparent conflicts of interest do arise in this case. The university seems to have ignored the fact that there is possibly a case of misconduct within the meaning of section 10.3.1 of the university's personnel policies and procedures manual. Also, the university does not seem to have taken into account section 13.1 of the statute in regard to the considerable body of evidence concerning attempts to gain an academic advantage or advancement. The university's inquiry report is silent on these matters as well.</para><para>Let me stress that my intention is not to engage in a witch-hunt or to cause harm to individuals. My concern is to highlight a case which, I believe, demonstrates that it is questionable whether universities themselves—as this government has just asserted—can be relied upon to deal internally with allegations of serious impropriety. It is for this reason that a closer examination of the university's inquiry is warranted. </para><para>A careful reading of the report of the internal inquiry may well suggest that the conclusions drawn are not supported by the accounts of events presented within the report. As far as I am concerned, many unanswered questions remain, and it would appear that the inquiry is incomplete. There are still questions relating to what has been done with the inquiry report within the university itself. Why was the inquiry conducted outside the formal process of the statute of the university and the personnel manual of the university? Further, why has this report not been submitted to the academic board for consideration? Given that the university chose not to follow its own formal procedures, why did it not have an inquiry external to the university, as has now occurred in the case of the Queensland University of Technology?</para><para>The case was partially reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> in September last year. Subsequently, I have undertaken my own research on this matter. The university's response to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> report was to suggest that, some 18 months after the report had been concluded, a new policy would be established whereby students would not be able to give a gift within five years of being a student at the university. Twenty-five months after the completion of the report, the university has yet to take that policy to its governing bodies. It has yet to implement that report. It is apparent to me—while there are a few other matters I need to say on this issue, as the Prime Minister has asked me to put up or shut up in this regard—that there are serious concerns and a coalition of concern developing within Australian higher education. It needs attention by this government and it needs the government to go beyond its glib statements that it is up to the universities to fix themselves up. After all, they are effectively responding to government policy. It is the government that has starved the universities of funds and I am concerned that the universities may well have responded to that policy direction from Canberra in ways that not all of us would welcome.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>21679</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was listening to what Senator Carr said and I can say this about Professor Crommelin —I have met him and he is a man of integrity and honesty. I just wanted to say that before going on to the other issue that was raised before and that the minister did not answer. In a certain sense, it flows from what Senator Carr said. What is in this legislation that stops the minister being able to act in an arbitrary and capricious fashion? As I said before, Minister, I am not saying that the minister will. That is not the thrust of what I say at all. I am not accusing the minister of anything. But what I am saying is that if the system is such that it allows capricious decisions to be made then it is not a good system. We went through this before and I am not sure why you did not address that issue. It seems, particularly given the sort of matters that Senator Carr was talking about, that there ought to be transparency, as you yourself said, in the giving of grants. But you have not as yet pointed out the system that could operate to do that. As I said before, other than the publication of these matters in the annual report, there seem to be no proper facilities whereby the public, and indeed the parliament, can scrutinise these important issues. Unless you have transparency and accountability, how are you going to make everybody content at least that what is being done is being done according to what is fair and reasonable?</para></talk.start><para>The other matter I have to pick up with Senator Carr before I sit down, besides the issue of Professor Crommelin, is the use of the word `industry' in this context. I would have thought that he would talk about the `profession' of teaching, having been a teacher himself. When he talks about the education industry, that puts a tone into it that may well lead to the problems that he is talking about at the moment. Anyhow, Minister, I would be interested to hear what sort of processes there are to lead from a consideration by the council to a decision by the minister to appropriate money to the research body.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>21679</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In relation to Senator Cooney's question, I can say that the minister has to approve funding rules for Australian Research Council projects. These are public documents and they are widely disseminated in the sector. These funding rules have to set out procedures for funding, the process of application and also a procedure of appeal if an application is not successful. The minister is only able to approve funding for grants that have gone through the process set out in these funding rules and I believe that this tightens the current process, where the minister may fund any research or research related project that meets any term or condition set by the minister. I am referring to section 23 of the Higher Education Funding Act. </para></talk.start><para>So what we have here is a situation where the minister has to set out these rules for funding, there is a process and any applicant has to go through that process. I suppose if a minister is set to be difficult in this and was capricious, as Senator Cooney said, then that minister would be running foul, no doubt, of the rules and if it was a capricious refusal of application there would be an appeal process provided for in those rules. No doubt the minister's actions would be subject to public scrutiny and that scrutiny would be conducted with the background of the funding rules and the process which had previously been set out. The government believes that there is transparency in that regard and that the process that I have mentioned would be a safeguard against any inappropriate exercise of the minister's discretion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>21680</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—So what you are saying is that there is a means—you would hardly call it a process—whereby the minister's decision can be subject to criticism in the public and in the parliament. But that seems a poor substitute for what is really needed, which is a tight system whereby grants go to where they are needed and whereby people can say, `This grant has been given, it has been given on the basis that this particular research grant has more merit than those that are underneath it and it has been given to competent people.' What you have really said is, `Yes, the minister has got the ability to be capricious but the parliament and the public would know all about it and regard him badly if he was.' I am not saying that he would do this, but the fact that the ability is there is the problem. That is hardly a system of enforcing accountability and transparency.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>21680</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support Senator Cooney on these essential questions of accountability and transparency. I think they go to the heart of the opposition's concern about why the government is failing to understand the importance of the questions that are being pursued. We have still yet to hear I think a `reasonable explanation'—to use that term—as to why the government has done this backflip from what it said at the Senate committee, that is, what the minister and the officers said at the Senate committee, what the officers have indicated to us that they recommended to the government and what the minister himself, representing Dr Kemp, I should emphasise, has said in this chamber. I understand there is obviously a degree of separation in terms of intention and action, and that is the issue we are trying to get to the bottom of: how is it that the government has suddenly done this reversal?</para></talk.start><para>On the question of accountability, and on the issue of transparency similarly, there are more general issues affecting the operations of public institutions which the government, ultimately, has to take responsibility for, given that it is government policy that sets the framework in which our higher education system actually functions. It may well be that these are issues that states have direct control of insofar as they administer various acts that affect our universities, but the funding framework and the policy framework are determined through this parliament, through this government. I think in that process we are entitled to question what is actually occurring in higher education, and it is the government's response on this particular bill that has brought to public attention the discrepancies in the government's own attitudes.</para><para>It is in that context that I have raised this issue at Melbourne University that troubles me greatly. Despite these processes being established internally in the university, secret reports have been issued, have not been discussed with anyone, and have been shunted off to try to ensure that concerns are in fact pushed under the carpet and not fronted up to or addressed. This government seems to embody that approach. You would have to argue that it gives encouragement to that approach. It is understandable that universities respond to government initiatives in this context. This is why I come back to this problem at Melbourne University. You would have to ask yourself: are there any other incidents occurring there that reflect a change in the culture of our higher education institutions, at least in part?</para><para>Let us look at the composition of the Melbourne University Council, which was significantly altered under the Kennett government. It moved from 39 members down to about 21 members on the basis that we wanted it to be more business friendly, more flexible and more commercially orientated. Perhaps the university would have taken a different approach on these issues if it had had a more representative council. Let us consider, for instance, the issues that have arisen around the case of Melbourne IT, where, as I understand it, at least three members of the council have been allegedly accused of, in terms of the share register, receiving shares in a float of a university company. The suggestion is that perhaps these issues would not have gone unquestioned if the council had been more representative. These issues of the alleged insider trading remain, frankly, unresolved. It is quite clearly arguable that the university has breached its own act—a Victorian act of parliament—in regard to decisions taken on pecuniary interests of its council members. The operations of the Melbourne University council, it would seem, have been criticised by the Victorian Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Victorian Ombudsman. I think it is now appropriate that a review of the council's operations perhaps be examined.</para><para>For that reason, I am calling upon the Victorian minister for education to review the effects of Jeff Kennett's reorganisation of the university council. It really is odd that the former minister responsible for the administration of universities in Victoria received shares in this particular float. It is a matter that does concern me. As I understand the situation, Mr Phil Honeywood appears on the share register list, and I have reason to believe that it is the same Phil Honeywood that was formerly the minister responsible. It seems to me that the case that I have referred to at Melbourne University is one of many. As I said, there is a coalition of concern developing over the numerous cases of, one could only suggest, inappropriate behaviour at institutes of higher earning, I mean, learning—not higher earning, in fact that is probably what many of them have had a look at. These cases are serious and ought to be addressed by government. As I said, universities are operating in the context of government policy. Since coming to office, this government has in fact extracted $5 billion from the higher education and research development systems in this country. It has asked universities to fund their operations increasingly from private sources of income. It has set in place no checks and balances as to how the money is to be raised and precious little on how it is to be used.</para><para>Despite Dr Kemp's best efforts, Australian universities remain public institutions. For this reason I argue that the principles of accountability and transparency of operation ought to be insisted upon. You can understand why it would be difficult for a government to do that. It has proposed to this parliament a situation in regard to the ARC Bill where it is not insisting on those principles itself. This government has suggested—as this minister has earlier today—that complaints, such as the ones I have raised, be referred to this new Universities Quality Agency. Yet the agency's own charter spells out that it is not going to have a look at individual cases and will not, in fact, be up and running for a while. The Melbourne University could well, in my judgment, be an example of how the Howard government's savage cuts to higher education have left universities scrambling desperately for funds from commercial sources. </para><para>Recent policy announcements made by governments do not change that. Competitive pressures in this particular sector are intense. In this climate complacency about the maintenance of academic and ethical standards is far from appropriate. The government's policy has changed the environment in which universities operate, particularly in relation to research and international education. More and more higher educational institutions have been forced to rely upon the revenue brought in by fee paying students, which has inevitably changed their focus and their priorities and maybe even their standards. The existing regulatory regime is seriously inadequate.</para><para>The government has recognised this fact in regard to private colleges operating in international education to the extent that last year it finally responded to Labor's concerns by a complete overhaul of the regulatory framework through the ESOS Act. I have raised before the potential and the actual problems of poor quality, private virtual universities which are nothing more than degree mills. I look forward to further debate in this parliament on the still unresolved issue of Greenwich University, that interloper established by statute on Norfolk Island that the opposition exposed here in 1999.</para><para>I look forward to the minister explaining how his colleague directed the administrator of Norfolk Island to sign into law that statute that allowed people to fundamentally challenge the existing quality assurance regime in this country. I look forward to that, Minister, and I am sure that you will have plenty to say on the matter as well—I trust that that is the case.</para><para> It is possible that under the unprecedented strains imposed by Dr Kemp's starvation policies our reputable universities might just buckle. I sincerely hope they have not already done so. But none of us can be sure of this unless genuine claims of malpractice and misconduct are honestly and openly examined. The attempt to sweep them under the carpet would be irresponsible in the extreme. That is why Labor has called for an independent inquiry into the allegations of academic fraud with guaranteed protection for whistleblowers—and that is a critical component. Failing the establishment of an independent inquiry, the Senate education committee inquiry into higher education provides—perhaps in some ways unfortunately—the only venue in which these matters can be dealt with. That is why I have urged those who have information on similar practices to come forward and use the vehicle of the Senate to approach their parliament about their concerns and allow these issues to be examined at least through that process. It is important for the future state, reputation and integrity of Australian higher education that this is done and that these issues are dealt with thoroughly, comprehensively and impartially through a process whereby we can genuinely guarantee quality assurance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>21682</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I, too, wanted to comment on part of the minister's answer to Senator Carr's question earlier.

For example, they do approximately 60 per cent of the research within universities, they author approximately 35 per cent of publications, they play an important role in many ARC funded projects, they are at the cutting edge of new knowledge, they make significant contributions to developing national and international research networks, and they constitute the rejuvenation of the research community.</para><para>The Democrats believe the perspective that a research student can contribute will be a valuable addition to the ARC board and will complement the views of the research, academic and industry stakeholders the government has identified for the board.

The government's white paper `Knowledge and innovation' proposed to establish the Australian Research Council as an independent organisation with an enhanced strategic leadership and management role in Australian research. The original bill brought forward to this house was flawed in a number of respects, notably with respect to ministerial accountability and the failure to carry forward the ARC's existing capacity to initiate its own inquiries into the new framework. To strengthen the ARC and to address the shortcomings in the proposed legislation, the Senate passed a series of perfectly reasonable, moderate and appropriate amendments.</para></talk.start><para>We Democrats respond to the question before us today by saying that we have pressed ahead with all the amendments, apart from Nos 1, 2, 8 and 9. We were happy to dispense with No. 1 on the grounds that the Labor amendment suffices for that, and Nos 8 and 9 have effectively been updated by the four Democrats amendments which are about to be passed. Senate amendment No. 3, along with today's passage of the ALP amendment, gives the ARC the capacity to initiate its own inquiries. This capacity, which it currently possesses, is essential if independence is to mean anything. If the role of the ARC were only to provide advice to the government, there would possibly be a case for not including this capacity. However, by the government's own admission in its message, the ARC is intended to have a broader role in this.</para><para>The government's stated objection is that there is nothing to prevent the ARC from drawing the matter to the attention of the minister, who may then formally refer the matter to the ARC for further investigation. We Democrats believe that that response is unacceptable. The National Health and Medical Research Council can initiate its own inquiries. At no stage has the government advanced any sensible argument as to why this capacity is onerous or inappropriate or why the NHMRC is not a relevant analogue. Moreover, since the abolition of the National Board of Education, Employment and Training and thus the Higher Education Council, there is no independent body giving advice to the government on research and research education matters.</para><para>It has been claimed elsewhere that, as the current power has been rarely used, it is of minor consequence if it goes. This claim is both complacent and ill informed. It is complacent because, by simply having self-initiating capability in place, a minister cannot prevent investigation of an issue that the ARC board has identified as warranting investigation. Secondly, over the years the ARC has instigated and published a number of important and influential studies that have thrown light on a wide range of important issues. A recent example was the study <inline font-style="italic">Inventing our future: the link between Australian patenting and basic science</inline> in 2000.</para><para>Even if it is likely that the minister would give a specific reference for a study such as this, it does not change the fact that this capacity is essential if independence is to be taken seriously. The government also makes the comment that it is not necessary to specify research education as a separate aspect of research matters. The Democrats believe that the slightly broader scope implied in the Senate's wording is desirable and note that this is supported by, amongst others, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. It should be noted that the government itself saw fit to specify both research and research training in its requirement in the <inline ref="R1149">Australian Research Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2000</inline> that institutions must provide an acceptable research and research training management plan to access the contestable funding schemes in section 23 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. Accordingly, the Democrats have been pressing those two amendments.</para><para>In terms of ministerial accountability, the other fundamental flaw with the government's initial ARC bill was the unacceptable lack of ministerial accountability and transparency. Senate amendments Nos 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 11 all went to that issue. The government claims that requiring the minister to table directions and requests to the ARC in parliament within 15 sitting days is an onerous requirement and that it would be more efficient to record such directions and requests in the ARC's annual report. The government's position beggars belief and is unacceptable to us. The Democrats have consistently argued for greater transparency and accountability in government. We find it intensely disappointing that the government will not take fundamental issues such as ministerial accountability seriously. Simply recording requests in the ARC annual report means that there could be a window of up to 15 to 18 months before the community is aware of such requests. The government recently announced a doubling of the ARC's budget over five years. This is a significant amount of public money and makes ministerial accountability more urgent.</para><para>The reporting requirements in the Senate's amendments are quite conventional. They do not infringe unreasonably on the minister and apply, for instance, to the minister for health in respect of the NHMRC. I might add that the minister was required to report directions and requests to the ARC to parliament in a timely fashion under the arrangements until December 2000. I would like to make a few specific comments on amendment (11). That requires the minister to table details of individual grant proposals that, firstly, were not recommended by the ARC and, secondly, were recommended but were rejected by the minister. It also requires that the details include the name of the organisation, a statement of reasons and the names of all persons and organisations who gave advice to the minister other than the ARC. While the Democrats understand that the minister may have cause to seek advice outside the ARC, it is unacceptable that any decision in variance with the ARC's recommendations should not be tabled in parliament.</para><para>Peer assessment is a crucial decision to the operations of the ARC. Any measure that undermines public confidence in peer review verification and quality is unacceptable. It potentially opens up the minister to accusations of cronyism if peer review has been bypassed in the approval of research grants. The Senate ought to be aware that, in the public hearing of the Senate inquiry into the ARC bills on 14 November 2000, the head of the research branch at DETYA, Mrs Jenni Gordon, stated that she was not aware of any minister overriding an ARC recommendation. However, the First Assistant Secretary, Mr Michael Gallagher, said that it had occurred once, when Minister Vanstone refused to approve a project on indigenous affairs—the point being that it is likely that instances like those covered by this amendment are very rare. Thus it is hardly an onerous constraint on the minister.</para><para>That such circumstances occur rarely, however, does not obviate the need to ensure community confidence in the processes of the ARC by insisting that the accountability and transparency measures of this amendment be pressed. Indeed, on all amendments that go to ministerial accountability, the Democrats will be pressing ahead. In summary, in view of our stated aim of maintaining some of the initial amendments passed by this chamber, as well as supporting those moved today by Labor in addition to the successful ones that the Democrats have moved today, I conclude my remarks.</para><para>Resolutions reported; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000 [2001]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21686</page.no><id.no>S278</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>21686</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 6 December 2000, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Alston</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>21686</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="S278">Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline> transfers provisions which authorise the national broadcasters to engage in datacasting from the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to the respective enabling acts of both public broadcasters. The bill also amends provisions in the Broadcasting Services Act which were inserted by last year's Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Act 2000, which I will refer to as the digital television act. The opposition has considered the content of the amendments put forward by the government, it is fair to say that they are technical in nature and non-controversial and the opposition will not be opposing those amendments when it comes to a vote.</para></talk.start><para>There are a number of issues raised in the context of this bill that I wish to discuss today. Labor will move amendments at the appropriate time in committee which address these issues, and these amendments will ensure, if passed, that (a) the ABC's role in the provision of online and datacasting services is recognised in its act and charter, (b) the ABC and SBS are not restricted in multichannelling services, (c) the ABC and SBS are exempted from payment of datacasting licence fees and (d) the government's restrictive, genre based datacasting regime is replaced with a much more workable regime. Finally, the opposition also supports the national public broadcasters being allowed to develop and enforce their own codes of practice for the provision of datacasting services. We have indicated support for government amendments having that effect.</para><para>Last year, when the parliament considered the government's Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Act 2000, a Senate committee inquiry into the bill was conducted. The Labor senators' minority report identified then the issues that I have just outlined as still requiring resolution. On the first issue of recognising the ABC's role in online and datacasting services, it has been apparent for some time now that the ABC's role in the digital environment needs to be clarified and expounded. The effect of the ABC's act and charter needs to be extended to activities that the ABC conducts online, in its digital environment or when it moves to datacasting. The ABC is authorised to offer a datacasting service pursuant to clauses 39 and 40 of schedule 6 of the BSA. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 moves those provisions from the BSA to the enabling legislation of the ABC and the SBS. Last year, the Labor senators' report for the inquiry into the digital TV bill recommended:</para><quote><para>Specific provisions that might apply to datacasting by the ABC and SBS might more appropriately be contained within the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991</inline>.</para></quote><para>The amendment to be moved by the opposition in the committee stage implements Labor's recommendation by incorporating provisions affecting the ABC and SBS in their own legislation. The government has not seized the opportunity that this bill presents to amend and update the enabling act of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation consistent with technological advancements. The opposition, on the other hand, seeks to have the ABC's role in online services incorporated into the act. The changes to the ABC Act need to go further than the government is proposing in schedule 2 of this bill. The amendments must address public concerns that future commercialisation or even privatisation of these ABC services is being contemplated and is possible under the existing legislation. We must ensure that this does not happen.</para><para>Concerns about the future of the ABC have arisen because these activities are not incorporated in and protected by the ABC Act and charter. Last year, there was considerable public concern at a proposed commercial arrangement between Telstra and ABC Online which resulted in a Senate committee inquiry into the matter and the deal being subsequently abandoned. Concerns raised during the inquiry were founded on the potential detrimental impact of such commercial arrangements on the ABC and its future independence and integrity. This was particularly worrying in the context of ongoing funding cuts by the current government. The appropriateness of allowing advertising on the ABC's web site was questioned at that time and, by bringing these activities of the ABC within its act, advertising will be prohibited on new digital or online platforms, consistent with restrictions on the ABC's domestic radio and TV services. This amendment proposed by the opposition will assist in ensuring the future independence of the ABC from commercial interests and influences.</para><para>I will move now to the second issue which we will discuss later in committee. The opposition is concerned to see that the ABC and SBS are not—I repeat, not—restricted in multichannelling services they choose to offer. The ABC and SBS indicated last year during the inquiry into the digital television bill that they believed the capacity to multichannel, pursuant to their charters, is important because it would (a) enable them to better fulfil their charters, giving viewers real additional choice by allowing more programming to be showcased and at times that suit their audience; (b) allow the ABC and the SBS to program content with a regional focus, and for the SBS to program additional Australian and multicultural content within that focus; (c) enable them to be cost effective; and (d) encourage take-up of digital technology to the benefit of the industry as a whole. </para><para>The failure of Australians to embrace digital television means that it is even more important now to remove the restrictions on the national broadcasters' ability to engage in multichannelled digital programming. The rationale for the decision to restrict multichannelling by the national broadcasters is not easily ascertained or understood. Interestingly, the commercial stations indicated during last year's inquiry into the digital television bill that they do not oppose multichannelling by the ABC and the SBS provided that the multichannelling is:</para><quote><para>... very definitely within their charters and provided that the focus was very much on complementary programming, rather than quasi commercial programming or programming that is likely to compete in a serious sense with commercial television.</para></quote><para>The opposition believe that multichannelling complements the charters and see no valid justification for denying the national broadcasters the ability to multichannel in an unrestricted way within the constraints of their charters. This is particularly so when those arguments are balanced against the resultant benefits. For this reason, we will be seeking to remove the limitations that the government insisted on as a condition of permitting the ABC and SBS to multichannel when the digital television act was passed last year. </para><para>I will turn now to the third issue that I wish to discuss in the context of this Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill: the exemption of the ABC and SBS from the payment of datacasting licence fees. The national broadcasters indicated last year that imposition of the licensing charge on them would be illogical because, should government funded broadcasters be required to pay that fee to the government, the government will have to increase their funding accordingly. This is in the context of the triennial funding decision by the minister, which has not provided funding for the fee. In effect, the government's refusal to provide funding for payment for the fee would be a reduction in the funding of the national broadcasters, whilst provision of the additional funding would be tantamount to the government paying the datacasting fee to itself. That is, there is no cost to the budget arising from this exemption, because if the government imposed licence fees on the ABC and SBS, its funding to these broadcasters would simply be transferred from the ABC and the SBS to consolidated revenue via the Australian Broadcasting Authority. This situation is nonsensical and requires resolution. Labor will be seeking government support for exempting the ABC and SBS from these datacasting licence fees and resolving this irrational situation. </para><para>The next issue for consideration in today's debate is the need to replace the government's restrictive genre based datacasting regime with a much more workable regime. The government has failed to successfully implement the introduction of digital television into Australia. This failure demonstrates the serious flaws in its digital television policy. We can tell the government now, just as we warned it seven months ago, that its datacasting regime will similarly be a dismal failure if it remains in its present form. </para><para>As we noted in our report to last year's inquiry into the amendments to the BSA establishing the datacasting regime, the definition of datacasting as it stands is overly restrictive, complicated and goes beyond restricting datacasting to services that do not constitute broadcasting. The opposition accepts that datacasting cannot be de facto broadcasting. However, the definition needs to be amended to remove the artificial and unnecessary limitations on datacasting. It is crucial that this emergent industry is not stifled in its development and innovative capacity by overly restrictive regulation. If it is, the benefits for Australia's technological advancement, improved consumer services and employment and economic opportunities will be constrained.</para><para>Labor oppose the genre based definition of datacasting, as we did last year, and instead support an approach that favours flexibility, minimises barriers to entry and allows new services to develop over time. The amendments to this bill that Labor will move implement this flexible approach, which will enable a new industry to develop and prosper. The Productivity Commission, in its comprehensive report on broadcasting last year, noted the flaws in the government's policy. The commission's report stated that the government's policy relating to datacasting:</para><quote><para>... stifles competition and innovation and is at odds with major tenets of mainstream broadcasting policy. </para></quote><para>The commission considered the regulatory restrictions:</para><quote><para>... will be costly to Australian consumers and businesses alike ... delay consumer adoption of digital technology and deprive business of opportunities to develop new products and services for the world as well as Australian markets.</para></quote><para>There was considerable support during the digital television bill inquiry for the Productivity Commission's position that prescriptive regulation will be detrimental to the emergent industry and consumers. The regulatory regime will have particularly adverse consequences for consumers in rural and regional Australia who stand to gain so much from an effective and viable regime. These are serious concerns which need to be addressed so that Australian consumers will not be negatively impacted due to the inability to provide the full range of new digital services and so that the provisions of the BSA do not limit or suppress the viability of this emerging industry.</para><para>The opposition believes that excessive regulation in this instance will have consequences for Australia's technological advancement, improved consumer services, employment and economic opportunities. As we said last May or June, and we restate today, it is critical that we avoid these harmful consequences. The opposition stands by the recommendations in the minority report that the definition should be amended to remove the artificial and unnecessary limitations on datacasting. For this reason, we will again move the alternative datacasting regime that we proposed last year when the digital television bill was debated in the Senate.</para><para>One final point on the issues arising out of the government's definition of datacasting in the act. During the last year's inquiry into the BSA amendments, the national broadcasters raised legitimate concerns that the genre based content definition of datacasting might impinge on programming decisions properly the province of their boards. This is another reason why the opposition is attempting to remove the government's genre based datacasting restrictions and replace them with a general datacasting regime. Our regime, if passed, will benefit the ABC and SBS, along with all other prospective datacasters.</para><para>The final issue for discussion today is that the national public broadcasters should be allowed to develop and enforce their own codes of practice for the provision of datacasting services. The ABC and SBS have indicated concern about the imposition of the requirement to develop uniform codes of practice as part of the datacasting industry as a whole. All other program content by the national broadcasters is subject to codes of practice developed internally and notified to the ABA. This is in contrast to other parts of the broadcasting industry which are required to develop codes in consultation with the ABA and register them with the ABA. The ABC and SBS codes of practice reflect their charter responsibilities and, as a consequence, are necessarily different from those developed by other parts of the industry.</para><para>The <inline ref="S278">Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline> creates a new situation for the national broadcasters by giving the ABA power to impose datacasting licence conditions requiring compliance with its codes. The ultimate sanction for a breach of such a licence condition will be the loss of the licence. These arrangements are completely different from the existing broadcasting content regime for the national broadcasters. For this reason, we have indicated that we will support the government's amendments to remove this code of practice requirement imposed on the ABC and SBS. This will ensure consistency between datacasting service and broadcasting service regulatory arrangements for the national broadcasters.</para><para>We have indicated support for another amendment, which seeks to extend the strong and important accountability measures under the BSA, unique to the national broadcasters, to datacasting services. This will provide consistency between datacasting and broadcasting services in terms of complaint mechanisms. In place of the industry codes of practice for datacasting, the ABC and SBS should be able to develop and maintain their separate codes of practice for datacasting, just as they do for broadcasting. The opposition has indicated support for government amendments to this effect.</para><para>In summary, the opposition will seek to amend the datacasting regime to avert the problems that will be associated with its inevitable failure should it remain in its present form. We will also seek to make several amendments that will impact on the ABC and SBS, including ensuring the ABC's role in the provision of online and datacasting services is recognised in its act and charter, removing restrictions imposed on the national broadcasters in relation to their multichannelling services, and exempting the ABC and SBS from payment of datacasting licence fees. The opposition supports giving the ABC and SBS control over development of their own regulatory codes of practice for datacasting services. Our amendments, if accepted, will ensure a fair and workable digital regime to the extent that the existing policy framework will permit.</para><para>Moving from our amendments to the bill that will be moved in committee, I now advise that I will shortly be moving a second reading amendment which calls on the government to postpone the auction of datacasting spectrum until the datacasting regime is finalised. I have already outlined in some detail the flaws of the existing scheme put in place last year—it is restrictive and unworkable. In view of the substantial changes that are necessary to ensure that Australia has a workable datacasting regime, we are seeking the Senate's support for this motion calling on the government to suspend the auction of datacasting spectrum until consideration of this bill is complete. A number of the proposed amendments to the bill have the potential to significantly impact upon the auction process. By creating a viable framework for the datacasting industry, the datacasting spectrum will be considerably more valuable to potential datacasters than is presently the case.</para><para>The amount to be obtained from the datacasting spectrum auction will have a material effect on the budget. For this reason, we are not asking the government to delay the auction beyond this financial year. There is no reason why the auction cannot be delayed until later this financial year. This action will offer certainty to potential datacasters and seems entirely appropriate in light of the parliament's continuing consideration of the datacasting regime.</para><para>The other issue addressed by the second reading amendment is the government's failure to adequately resource the ABC to effect its digital transition. The parliament mandated the ABC's conversion to digital broadcasting by the end of last year. This was, and is, a costly project. Additionally, last year the parliament acknowledged the importance of digital broadcasting to the ABC by authorising it to utilise multichannelling capabilities in the new digital environment. The digital television legislation empowered the ABC to multichannel when digital transmission began this year. Yet, again, the government has failed the ABC—this time in its duty to resource the broadcaster for this important role and this new technology into the future. In order to undertake these additional demands, the ABC has had to draw on the limited funds made available by the government. The government did not provide for these activities adequately, if at all. Inevitably, responsible management of the ABC has necessitated cuts to expenditure in other areas. We had a lengthy discussion last year in estimates as to where those cuts were falling.</para><para>The opposition is of the view that it is the government's responsibility to ensure that the ABC is adequately resourced to fulfil its statutory responsibilities. The government has again dismally failed the ABC and the Australian public in this duty. Therefore, this second reading amendment calls on the government to finally take action to ensure that the ABC is able to operate effectively in the digital world. Accordingly, I move:</para><quote><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>		"but the Senate calls on the Government:</para><para>	(a)	to suspend the auction of datacasting spectrum until the Parliament has completed its consideration of the bill while still allowing the auction process to be completed this financial year; and</para><para>	(b)	to rectify its failure to adequately resource the ABC to effect the national public broadcaster's transition to the digital world".</para></quote><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>21691</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Allocation of Departments and Agencies</title><page.no>21691</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>21691</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—As was foreshadowed a little while earlier, there have been discussions between parties in the Senate relating to the allocation of portfolios to the various legislation committees sitting as estimates committees.

Items 2 and 3 of the bill provide the museum with power to develop and implement sponsorship, marketing and other commercial activities relating to the museum's functions. Item 4 inserts a capacity to enable the museum to charge fees and impose charges for its services and to raise money through events. The National Museum has set a target for itself of some $4.2 million in its first year. The proposed amendments will enable the museum to engage in a range of commercial activities that will allow it to raise funds to meet the target.</para></talk.start><para>Although we are supporting the legislation, we do have some concerns in relation to the ability of the museum to meet a $4.2 million revenue target—a target set by the government in light of the recent decision that the museum would not charge the general entry fee. Of course we support the decision not to charge a fee, but we are interested to know whether there will be a recalculation of the $4.2 million figure as a result of this decision. I understand that the Prime Minister has asked that a review of the museum's financial position be conducted 12 months after it opens. We presume that the issue will be dealt with before then and we would like that information.</para><para>Amendments proposed by items 5 and 6 raise the threshold under which objects for disposal would require the minister's approval, from some $20,00 to $250,000. We accept that the proposed figure of $250,000 will better reflect current values of museum items and is consistent with the limits for the National Library of Australia. I could go on to a couple of other provisions but I think it is best to indicate that we support the bill and that we will facilitate the quick passage of it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>21692</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate that the Democrats also support this bill. I do want to make a couple of cautionary remarks and to note that this bill allows for the museum, if it chooses—and there is no indication that it will do so in the short term—to charge entry into the museum. So the bill clarifies the museum's power to impose fees and charges and to engage in other revenue-raising ventures—for instance, the holding of events. It increases the limits below which historical material can be disposed of by the museum without ministerial approval—from $20,000 to $250,000—and it enables the museum to develop a National Museum of Australia Fund. While that brings the National Museum into line with the National Maritime Museum as well as the National Gallery, we think it is supportable. But I want to point out that the Senate in 1998 conducted an inquiry into the question of access to heritage—in fact, that was the name of the report, <inline font-style="italic">Access to heritage: user charges in museums, art galleries and national parks</inline>. Quite a lot of evidence was provided to the committee and different opinions were given on the implications of charging for entry into galleries. It was pointed out, for instance, that if we charge for such places we discourage poorer people from coming along and being able to access that heritage. Other views were put forward to the effect that museums and galleries draw visitors who are disproportionately from the educated, and therefore more well-off, groups, so that not charging entries is, in a way, a subsidy for people on lower incomes through taxes of richer visitors.</para></talk.start><para>One of the recommendations made as part of that inquiry was that a bit more work needed to be done—in fact, we said there needed to be research sponsored by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts—to look at the influence of user pays on access and equity in the regional, local and volunteer operated museums and galleries sector as well as the large national museums and art galleries, because we just do not know what the implications are for charging entry into these places. I note that the National Museum is not proposing to introduce those charges, but this bill does allow them to do that. If there were a cautionary note I would like to make in relation to this bill, it is on that question. I would urge those who are in a position to make a decision about entry charges to consider the question of equity and whether or not we would be discouraging people from going to galleries if they had to pay. That is the only point I want to make on behalf of the Democrats. We otherwise see this as a piece of non-controversial legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>21692</page.no><name role="metadata">Heffernan, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator HEFFERNAN</name><name.id>C16</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to Cabinet</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators for their contribution.

That ought to be quite clear. But what do we find from the non-team player? Her view was that the Humphry review should call for the scrapping of the IT outsourcing program altogether. In other words, she was not waiting for the outcome of it; she was not quarrelling at the margin; she was out there stating her position, which was to scrap IT outsourcing altogether. And, in fact, she even manages to turn it into an ideological issue by saying:</para><quote><para>There is no doubt that, under the Howard Liberal government ... we have seen an attack on a philosophical basis.

Is this Senator Lundy saying, `I do not care what the party says. I am a wholly owned subsidiary of the CPSU and I will deliver the goods for them. I will get out there and state my position.' Let us have it plain. If Senator Lundy is authorised to speak on these issues, on whose behalf is she speaking when she calls for the scrapping of IT outsourcing? Are we meant to interpret this as Labor Party policy, or is this simply Senator Lundy off on a frolic of her own? So let us be clear. There is some very good news on this front.

Before I do, the Senate should remember that today we have a record number of full-time equivalent university places under the Howard government. In fact, we have 465,000-odd full-time equivalent university places, an increase of 42,000 on the number during Labor's last year in office.

There are 30,000 more full-time university places today than there were in Labor's last year. </para></talk.start><para>I will go back to the innovation plan. We have here an extra $736 million which will double the funding for the Australian Research Council and will also fund 25 new Federation fellowships valued at $225,000 a year.

There will be $246 million available over five years to upgrade essential university infrastructure such as scientific equipment and libraries. There will be $151 million over five years for an additional 21,000 equivalent full-time university places with a priority, importantly, on mathematics and science. There will be an investment of some $995 million over five years in an interest free student loan scheme for postgraduate students. This will assist some 240,000 Australian students. That spells greater opportunity for those Australians who want to engage in higher education opportunities. We will also have continuing growth in postgraduate employment. That is translating into financial rewards today because we have salaries increasing from $45,000 in 1998 to $47,000 in 1999. So we have postgrad students enjoying the fruits of their studies.</para><para>Let me turn now to schools. We will be providing an additional $130 million as the Commonwealth share of the EBA funding to foster science, maths and technology skills in the classroom. This funding will build on the Howard government's commitment to ensuring that all schoolchildren learn to read and write properly, a commitment enshrined and agreed to in the national literacy and numeracy plan by all states and territories. This was a great initiative taken by the minister for education.

Minister, when is the government going to commit financially to its rhetoric on welfare reform?

Why is it that some recent government announcements have committed specific dollar figures—such as $2.9 billion to innovation, $1.6 billion to roads and $1.5 billion to defence—but all the government's many announcements on welfare reform have not involved any financial commitments to invest in assisting the growing list of disadvantaged Australians who have a severely reduced capacity to participate socially and economically? Why are organisations such as ACOSS providing the government with an integrated, balanced and fully costed blueprint for expenditure on addressing the growing inequality in Australia when no such commitment is forthcoming from the government?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>21702</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the senator for his question. I will not say that it is the first sensible question I have had in this area, because there have been a couple from opposition senators about specific issues for which I have been able to give them some information, and there have been a couple from opposition senators that have been important and not related to scare campaigns. Senator Bartlett, your question relates to one of the biggest issues facing Australians today, and that is the reform of welfare.</para></talk.start><para>I noticed that, when you asked your question, some of your semi-colleagues on the other side of this chamber thought it was an amusing question. I do not know why. In 13 years of government, Labor presided over a welfare system that fell into further and further disrepair. They simply lacked the political courage, and they certainly lacked the policy initiative—and that is understandable from a policy-lazy opposition; you would expect it because they were a policy-lazy government—to do anything about it. They categorised people in large groups, they did not tailor welfare to individual needs, they encouraged families to become welfare reliant and, in fact, they simply left people behind.</para><para>In contrast, Senator Bartlett, the nub of your question is: when will we know about the money? Obviously, you will get some idea of the range of financial commitment in the budget context, but you will get more than that. It is not just a question of dollars. That is what has been wrong with the welfare system. All of us, governments and Australians, have felt that it is good enough to give people some money and then turn away and leave them on their own. We have made a commitment to do far better than that and to bring people in, not leave them behind. There is a lot of detail to work out. We have set up a welfare reform consultative group. They have met three times—one time this week—and Minister Abbott and I met with them. You mentioned ACOSS; I met with them this morning. I understand the position that they have and we had a very useful dialogue. I feel confident that, in the end, what we do will not be an exact mirror of what ACOSS wants, but I hope they feel confident that we do understand the points that they have raised.</para><para>Senator, I will repeat—not for you, because you already understand this—what McClure is about. The McClure report suggested, and the government endorses, an approach that focuses much more on individual needs, on incentives and on responsibilities. In other words, there have to be some carrots there. Perhaps there are not enough carrots, incentives for people to get involved, at the moment. We have to have an improvement in service delivery—that is recognised. While that might be easy to say, it is not necessarily that easy to deliver. Take an agency like Centrelink—one that Senator Collins unfairly, in my view, disparaged in her question today. They do a tremendous job and any change to improve service delivery, if Centrelink is the gateway, does require a significant amount of work to make sure that you can deliver on the good intention you have.</para><para>In short, Senator Bartlett, you can be assured that we have a very strong focus on welfare reform. Senator Newman started this with Mr Abbott, and the first step will be completed in this budget. To change the culture that Labor allowed to develop—which basically said, `We'll give you money,' and then turned away, guilt free—is going to take a lot more than an announcement in May this year. We will continue to work on this issue and we will come back to it until the culture has been changed and until there is an understanding from the government, the community, business and all of us that just giving money is not enough. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>21703</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

I want to save you wasting further questions, so I tell you, probably tell all of you: do not bother asking what is in the budget because you know you will not be told until budget night.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aged Care: Northern Territory</title><page.no>21703</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>21703</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Vanstone, representing the Minister for Aged Care.

People at the dinner pay up to $50,000 for essentially worthless items, like lunch with a federal MP or an autographed photograph of Bob Hawke. There were no posters of Senator Faulkner or Mr Beazley, might I add. Instead of making their cheques out to the ALP, they get people to make out their cheques to Markson Sparks. Markson Sparks then collects the money, takes a commission and forwards the remainder of the money to the ALP. Of course, if the ALP had directly received the money, they would have to declare who the donors were and the donors themselves would have to put in a funding and disclosure return. But by doing it in this sneaky way, nobody can ever find out who is bankrolling the Queensland Labor Party. This is a Labor scam designed to circumvent Labor legislation.

Biotechnology is one of Australia's most creative and innovative industries, with enormous potential for Australia. We have the ability in this field to be a world leader.

Just last year we announced our $30 million biotechnology national strategy, overseen by the new Biotechnology Australia agency. We are currently funding, through the federal government, about $250 million in R&amp;D for biotechnology. We doubled grants for the National Health and Medical Research Council, our R&amp;D START program is currently assisting about 26 biotechnology companies with funding of about $29 million, and 15 of the cooperative research centres are specifically dedicated to biotechnology.</para><para>Just last week, in our innovation plan, Backing Australia's Ability, we announced an additional $66 million specifically for biotechnology.

I can understand that the Australian Labor Party are very touchy on this issue. Yesterday during question time, we highlighted their acceptance of money from the Australian Workers Union, a union which is at the epicentre of the electoral rorting in Queensland—something that has caused some embarrassment and, indeed, conviction of a number of Labor people in Queensland as being in breach of the law. There are a number of investigations taking place as we speak. Today I canvassed the fundraising activities of the Labor Party through Markson Sparks. Once again, the Labor Party went into a frenzy of mock rage. Their mock range is exposed by the fact that they have not joined issue to say, `We didn't accept money from the Australian Workers Union,' or `We didn't accept money through the scam of Markson Sparks.' If the Labor Party would get up and say, `We dislike this fundraising activity. We were not aware of this activity.

For all the electoral reform that we brought about in that era, the most controversial issue was public funding and disclosure. In my entire time on that committee and in my time as minister when I was in charge of it, I can at least accuse the Liberal Party of consistency. They consistently opposed any disclosure whatsoever. They argued that they had their own fundraising code, that no politician knew where the money was coming from, even though we would catch out from time to time various Liberal Prime Ministers raising money in the boardrooms around Australia. </para></talk.start><para>It is true to say that the regime of disclosure has been tightened year by year over the last 15 to 17 years. But in all that time and in all the sorts of rorts and ramps that have gone on, one massively stands out. We all know that the Liberal Party were in massive debt in the 1990s. We know that they owed banks up to $9 million through their fiscal irresponsibility in political matters. But all of a sudden after they won power in 1996 most of the debt was liquidated, and none of us could understand how this could have happened. In the end, the explanation is that the Liberal Party had borrowed $4.6 million from a charitable foundation called Greenfields. None of us had ever heard of Greenfields, so we looked up who was on the board. Oh! Sir John Atwill, former Liberal Party president, chaired it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator Brandis</name></talker><para>—A very fine man.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Yes, he was, but his memory is not too good.

And when we looked at the second of the trustees, it just happened to be the Liberal Party's accountant. When we finally put more pressure on, we found out this was an interest free loan. I am sure a lot of senators around the chamber would not mind even a $46,000 interest free loan, yet alone a $4.6 million one. Then it turns out that the loan is over 46 years and the Liberal Party are only putting up 100 gorillas a year to pay it off. It gets worse. They argue they are not an associated entity. The Electoral Commission investigates. The Electoral Commission finds they are an associated entity. And who put up the $4.6 million for the Liberal Party? Why all the disguise? Why didn't they admit where they got the money from? It turns out the money came from their own federal Treasurer. Our initial suspicion was that he had gone out and collected money—like $4.6 million—and washed it through the Greenfields Foundation so it could not be declared. But what we were really shocked about was that that did not occur. He anteed up the whole $4.6 million himself, out of his own personal savings account. Why wouldn't he admit that? The reason he would not admit that at the time was because of a very close association he had with state and federal Liberal governments.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Greenfields is the biggest scam in Australian political history.

Let me inform the Senate of the manner in which the scams are perpetrated—and this arises directly from Senator Abetz's answers to the question. The 1998-99 Electoral Commission return revealed, as a single line item, a donation of $499,849 to the New South Wales branch of the ALP—that is, Senator Faulkner's branch—by Markson Sparks. That came from the Gough Whitlam tribute dinner in May 2000. How was the money raised?

So Wilson lost his preselection before the 1996 election by the doublecrossing activities of a staff member he trusted loyally. Now Mr Pyne is in charge of the electoral matters committee.

There can be no argument to suggest that the government or ANSTO or the department were not aware of what we were requesting. Indeed, the fact is that, arising out of the deliberations of the Senate select committee, which I chair, on 17 October last year I wrote to the chief executive officer of ANSTO requesting a number of documents be made available to the committee inquiring into the contract for the new reactor. I received a response dated 8 November from Professor Garnett, and in that response Professor Garnett failed to supply several of the documents that the committee had deemed necessary in order to undertake its inquiries. This was then followed by the motion that I moved for a return to order which was subsequently carried.</para><para>This committee is inquiring into one of the most significant and expensive contracts that has been let by any federal government or indeed state government for many years. We are talking about expenditure in the order of $400 million to $500 million, plus the necessary commitment for the next 40 years to run that new reactor at Lucas Heights. There has been a great deal of concern expressed within the community, as well as from a range of other sources, about the decision of this government to award that contract to the Argentinian company INVAP. The committee that was established by vote of this Senate was charged with inquiring into the decision and a whole range of other relevant matters relating to the proposal to build this new reactor.</para><para>It is vitally important that the committee has access to documentation such as the request for tender documentation and the contract that was ultimately signed between the Australian government, ANSTO and INVAP. Further, we have requested information and reports compiled by officers of ANSTO and the department who went overseas to visit and inspect reactors operated by the various tender companies. I am advised that exercise alone cost $70,000. Integral to the decision made by ANSTO and the government were the reports of those officers on their visits. But when we asked for that information and documentation all we received was a cursory response: a one-page document telling us the places the ANSTO team went to and the dates when they visited them. It is simply not good enough.</para><para>There is other material that the government has refused to provide, including the reprocessing contract with Cogema. The reprocessing of the spent fuel from the current reactor and proposals for reprocessing of spent fuel from the new reactor represent a vital issue. It is an issue that goes, firstly, to the decision to build an operator reactor at Lucas Heights. Secondly, it is also integral to the related issue, which is the ultimate location of a medium-level waste facility in this country. Last week we took evidence in South Australia where both the South Australian Liberal government and the South Australian Labor opposition indicated that they would oppose the siting of a facility in their state.</para><para>We are endeavouring to get information which the department, the government and ANSTO have on that vital issue of how we handle the waste for the next 40 or 50 years or longer.

It is widely recognised that the benefits of economic change do not always flow evenly across Australia and that while many parts of non-metropolitan Australia are charging ahead, others are struggling to meet the challenges posed by globalisation and industry structural change.</para><para>The Government has therefore adopted a whole of government approach to working with communities to create an environment that encourages and supports new industries and job opportunities for regional and rural Australia.</para><para>To this end, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Honourable John Anderson MP, convened the Regional Australia Summit in Canberra from 27 to 29 October 1999.</para><para>Two hundred and eighty-two delegates from a range of community, government and business organisations throughout Australia discussed a range of contemporary problems and opportunities in regional Australia.  They developed suggestions for community, industry and government actions to create a positive future for regional and rural Australia.</para><para>The Summit was divided into twelve themes to look at the challenges that face regional areas of Australia, identify priority areas, and develop possible solutions and partnerships aimed at providing a better future for our regions.

In doing this, delegates clearly identified that meeting the challenges above was a shared responsibility.</para><para>A copy of the Summit Communique is at Attachment A.</para><para>At the Summit, Mr Anderson established a Steering Committee, chaired by Professor John Chudleigh, former Head of the Orange Agricultural College of the University of Sydney, and comprised of members drawn from Summit delegates.

Regular meetings between these organisations would enable discussions about how prospective proposals could be implemented and how best they can be coordinated between the various organisations to avoid duplicated effort.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><quote><para>The Government accepts this recommendation and has addressed it in its second term of office through the revised framework and clear priorities that have been put in place for Area Consultative Committees (ACCs).  The ACCs were established to assist local areas generate employment and require a "private sector" spirit rather than just a public service attitude.</para><para>A priority area in the Charter for the National Network of ACCs is working together in partnerships.  This requires ACCs to work to maintain constructive alliances with government, business and the community and bring community stakeholders together to identify opportunities, priorities and growth strategies for the region.  For example, a proposal is currently being developed for the establishment of an economic development commission for the Indian Ocean Territories which it is anticipated will be associated with Australia's northern ACCs.</para><para>Whilst ACCs are not required to have a local government member, in practice, local government representatives are often closely involved with the work of the ACC, and participate either as full or ex-officio members.  Many of the projects which have been submitted for funding under the Regional Assistance Program (RAP) are local council initiatives, testifying to the constructive working relationship that is developing between ACCs and local government.</para><para>Many ACCs already have well-established links with state based regional development bodies and in accordance with their new Charter, ACCs are enhancing these links.  For example, in South Australia, Regional Development Boards and ACCs have held strategic meetings to forge closer and more cooperative links to foster jobs growth, skills development, regional growth and effective service delivery through joint ventures which drive the available funds further.  ACCs recognise that cooperating with State regional development bodies maximises their effectiveness and, as such, representatives of State regional development bodies are invited to attend ACC meetings and brief members on relevant programs and initiatives.</para><para>Action is underway to further develop and strengthen these relationships.  The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB) is developing a strategy to improve national awareness of the network of ACCs.  A component of this strategy will target local, State and Federal government bodies, along with community groups, chambers of commerce and business organisations.  The aim will be to raise awareness of the role which ACCs play in the community and, through this, foster constructive partnerships between ACCs, relevant tiers of government and the wider community.  Rural Transaction Centres (RTC) Field Officers employed by the RTC National Field Officer Network are required to develop and maintain relationships with the ACCs.</para><para>An example of local government and state based regional development bodies being more involved in the operations of ACCs is the trial Regional Forum held at Whyalla, South Australia by the Department of Transport and Regional Services in July 1999.  A priority identified by the Forum was an improved working relationship between the Flinders Region ACC (FRACC) and the State regional development boards in the Spencer Gulf region.  It was agreed that FRACC and the SA Regional Development Association (SARDA) will manage the follow up to the Forum as part of a seven point plan agreed to by DEWRSB, FRACC and SARDA.  This plan specified that the ACCs and Regional Development Boards individually and collectively should seek to maximise outcomes in relation to fostering opportunities for jobs growth, skills development and regional growth, and service delivery by joint ventures which drive available funds further.</para><para>Overall strategies for implementation include:</para></quote><para>·	explore the notion of developing protocols in relation to how the parties will work together;</para><para>·	explore the concept of integrating relevant elements of the respective organisations' strategic plans;</para><para>·	encourage State Government to recognise the role of ACCs in achieving common objectives - recognising in the first instance that the Commonwealth should establish dialogue and agreement with the relevant State Government agencies; and </para><para>·	in conjunction with ACCs facilitate regular joint meetings to discuss matters of concern in the pursuit of mutual objectives.</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 2:</inline> That the Commonwealth Government take a coordinating role in the dissemination of information to local businesses of the range of assistance measures available to them.

Communications, transport and water and energy supply in particular, impact upon the ability of an economy to grow.  The Government recognises the role of infrastructure in regional Australia.  Poor infrastructure impedes the efficiency with which businesses are able to operate and limits further investment and employment growth.  In the Indian Ocean Territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands the Commonwealth has funded a $120 million program of public infrastructure upgrading since 1992.</para><para>The public sector has generally been the main provider of infrastructure in order to: prevent market failure (such as the private sector exploitation of a natural monopoly); provide public goods; and ensure equity in the provision of services.  However, the cost of many new infrastructure projects is such that the public sector cannot afford to build them without absorbing significant debt, reducing essential services, or increasing taxes and charges.  The private sector, on the other hand, is likely to only participate in infrastructure projects that meet commercial objectives.</para><para>Generally, the role of the public sector will be to provide infrastructure that has significant public benefits and can be justified in terms of a government's overall objectives.  Roads in regional areas are one such example.  Competitive tendering and contracting in such circumstances, however, provides some scope for private sector participation.  This will allow governments to concentrate on the provision of goods and services that have equity considerations whilst attaining the technical and allocative efficiencies that are offered by private sector provision.  There is greater scope for examining alternative models such as public-private partnerships as a means for regional infrastructure provision.</para><para>The private sector has begun to meet the shift from public investment, however it has been quite selective, operating in areas that achieve significant financial return such as toll roads and water sewerage schemes that have consistent revenue streams through "user pays".</para><para>In relation to the tax treatment of infrastructure projects, the Government in November 1999 announced in principle support for the recommendations of the Review of Business Taxation to abolish section 51AD and to replace Division 16D of the Income Tax Assessment Act.

This strategy recognises that the community is seeking transport efficiency as an essential part of the process of structural adjustment, improved productivity and resource allocation across the national economy.  As well as freight networks, the strategy reinforces the importance of roads to tourism and modern lifestyles that demand a high degree of mobility.</para><para>The total budget allocation for roads for 2000-01 is more than $1.3 billion, $858.9 million of this involving direct spending by the Federal Government.  In recognition of the importance of transport infrastructure to regional and rural Australia, 90 per cent of the Government's direct spending on roads in 2000-01 will be allocated to non-urban roads.  A further $406.4 million will be provided to local government throughout Australia for local roads, and $41 million has been allocated towards the Road Safety Black Spot Program.</para><para>Commonwealth roads funding has concentrated on a defined National Highway System, which includes a number of key urban links, and Roads of National Importance.

Through its gas industry reforms, the Government has established a national regulatory regime for third party access to natural gas pipelines, which is expected to provide greater certainty for investment in pipelines and opportunities to both link and expand the pipeline network.  This will result in greater competition in the supply of natural gas and lower gas prices for gas consumers, thereby improving the competitiveness of Australian industry.</para><para>As a result of the establishment of competition policy reforms, a number of new gas pipelines are already bringing benefits to various regional areas, such as the central west of NSW, the Murray Valley and Riverland area of South Australia.  A number of additional pipelines, including extensions of existing pipelines, are proposed or already under construction which will also bring gas to rural and regional areas.  These include: the Eastern Gas Pipeline from Longford to Sydney; the Papua New Guinea to Queensland pipeline; the Central Ranges pipeline in central western NSW from Dubbo to Tamworth; the Wide Bay gas project in Queensland; and the Longford to Tasmania pipeline. Feasibility studies have also been announced for new pipeline projects from the Timor Sea to Townsville and from Onslow to Geraldton.</para><para>The expansion of the gas pipeline network is resulting in the introduction of cheaper energy into regions and is contributing to new job creating industries that may not otherwise have been feasible.

As a result of the reforms future resource allocation and infrastructure investment decisions will be determined more by the interaction of supply and demand.</para><para>Economic benefits will flow because competition will open up opportunities for new technology (such as combined cycle gas, solar, etc) and growth in demand will assist the process of new entry.  The network access provisions open up opportunities for smaller scale generators to site themselves close to major industrial customers, reducing potential network augmentation costs and the cost of electricity transmission losses to customers.</para><para>Competition is also placing increased pressure on utilities to reduce costs, align tariffs/prices with costs, and use their assets more efficiently.</para><para>Furthermore the NEM has enabled the market operator (NEMMCO) to reduce reserve plant margins by the sharing of plants between States and to provide better capacity utilisation of generation assets.  In an integrated national market, regions with access to lower cost fuels can provide cheaper energy to other regions.</para><para>At the retail level it is intended that, from 2001, retail contestability will be introduced for electricity users in NEM participating jurisdictions so retail customers will be able to choose their electricity supplier.  Thus, there is an incentive for retail innovation to meet customer needs, such as tailored tariff structures, and energy packages covering electricity, gas and energy efficient appliances.</para><para>The needs of smaller consumers and rural and regional areas are recognised.  The reform process will be monitored closely to ensure that the distribution of these benefits is not just one of the unintended or delayed side-effects of these reforms, but rather a central plank in the delivery of competitive market outcomes outside metropolitan Australia.</para><para>Many country locations also have potential to exploit the renewable electricity generation opportunities arising from the Prime Minister's November 1997 Statement "Safeguarding the future: Australia's response to climate change".  Rural and regional areas will increasingly be able to use technology to break the tyranny of distance and to explore new opportunities for rural and economic development.  The Commonwealth has committed $10 million worth of investment to showcase renewable energy projects.</para><para>The Commonwealth places a high priority on ensuring that all Australians can share fairly in the benefits of the electricity industry reforms at an early date.  Governments have an important role to ensure that the benefits of the market reforms are distributed throughout the community.</para><para>Since the establishment of the competitive National Electricity Market there has been significant interest from the private sector in investment in the electricity industry, with a wide range of proposals currently being considered or approved for construction.

This comprises a general purpose grant of $915 million and a local road grant of $406 million.  Financial assistance grants are untied in the hands of Local Government and are used to address a range of local government expenditure priorities including local roads. Local Government Grants Commissions, established under legislation in each State and the Northern Territory, determine individual council allocations in accordance with agreed National Principles.  For local roads funding, the National Principles state that the grants should be allocated to local governments as far as practicable on the basis of the relative needs of each local governing body for roads expenditure and to preserve its road assets.</para><para>For general purpose grants the National Principles provide additional criteria to the objectives of horizontal fiscal equalisation and the minimum grant to local governments which are established in the <inline font-style="italic">Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995</inline>.  Horizontal equalisation is achieved if each local government in a State is able to provide the average range, level and quality of services by reasonable effort, taking account of differences in their capacities to raise revenue and differences in the expenditure to provide average services. This means that local governments that would incur higher costs in providing normal services, for example, in remote areas where transport costs are higher, will receive additional grant monies.</para><para>The Commonwealth Grants Commission (the Commission) is undertaking a review of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995.

Provision has been made for additional carrier services to be prescribed. The underlying principle of the universal service regime is that all citizens should have access to services considered essential or highly desirable for participation in contemporary society and the emerging information economy. The current universal service arrangements are set out in Part 2 of the <inline font-style="italic">Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999</inline>.  Telstra is currently the primary universal service provider.</para><para>Universal service obligation (USO) arrangements are essentially targeted at support for high-cost rural and remote areas of Australia. Standard telephone services provided are price-controlled, and in high-cost areas the universal service provider cannot always recover the full cost of providing services from the customer. The losses incurred by universal service providers resulting from the supply of loss-making services in the course of fulfilling the USO are shared amongst all participating telecommunications carriers.</para><para>Digital data services were added to the universal service regime in October 1999, thereby giving all Australians the possibility of wider participation in the emerging information economy.  Under the General Digital Data Service, Telstra is required to provide, on demand, to at least 96 per cent of the population a two-way data transmission service, broadly comparable to 64 kilobits per second (kbps).  The remaining 4 per cent of the population who are unable to access standard ISDN services - primarily those in regional, rural and remote areas - are able to access a 64 kbps one-way digital data service (usually provided by satellite) under the Special Digital Data Service (also provided by Telstra).  The Federal Government has also introduced a rebate scheme to allow consumers of the Special Digital Data Service to be reimbursed up to $765 for equipment necessary to access this new service.  From 1 July 2000, it has been easier for other telecommunications providers to become general or special digital data service providers.</para><para>The Federal Government is committed to ensuring that the universal service regime is robust and sustainable into the future.  With this in mind the Government will shortly finalise a new legislative framework for the USO.  The new framework will improve the reliability of USO delivery, enhance industry certainty, widen the funding base and better support the competitive provision of USO services.  The Government is conducting a tender for the provision of untimed local calls in remote Australia, with the successful tenderer becoming the universal service provider for that area for a three year period.  The Government is also well advanced in implementing two pilot schemes for competitive multi-provider delivery of the USO in regional areas.</para><para>Additionally, there are a number of separate arrangements for low-income earners and people with a disability.  These include the National Relay Service, which extends telephony access to the hearing impaired.  The Federal Government has also contributed significant funds from both tranches of the sale of Telstra to support communications developments in regional Australia (see information under Recommendation 4).</para><para>The Rural Transaction Centres program is assisting remote populations in their access to telecommunications by providing funding for access to internet facilities and training, video conferencing and public telephone and facsimile services.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 7: </inline>That the remaining one third (sic) of Telstra not be privatised.</para><para>Note: Government Senators do not agree with this recommendation.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><quote><para>The Government's policy is that Telstra should be transferred to full private ownership, but within an effective regulatory framework that protects consumers and promotes competition.

The Inquiry concluded that Australians generally have adequate access to a range of high quality, basic and advanced telecommunication services, although a significant proportion of those who live and work in rural and remote Australia have concerns about some key aspects of the telecommunications services available to them.  The Government has announced that it is committed to a plan of action to address these concerns.  The Government will not introduce legislation to sell the Commonwealth's remaining shareholding in Telstra until its plan of action has been fully considered and made public.</para><para>The full privatisation of Telstra will not change the telecommunications regulatory framework that exists in Australia today.

The rationale for introducing Job Network was that the previous labour market assistance arrangements which were administered by the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES), were not effective at getting people into jobs.  Job seekers were expected to fit labour market program arrangements and there was insufficient focus on achieving real job outcomes.  To return to such a rigid program structure would be a retrograde step as it would remove the flexibility and incentives built into Job Network.</para><para>One of the major strengths of Job Network is its flexibility.  For example, job seekers who are most in need are eligible for Intensive Assistance services.  These job seekers have the flexibility to decide with their Job Network member the best form of assistance to get them a job.  This may mean that the Job Network member will use their fees to provide the job seeker with job search training, relocation assistance, vocational training, language and literacy training, or other assistance such as work place adjustments.  Job Network members who provide Job Search Training or Job Matching can also use their funds to provide assistance with fares if they believe it will assist the job seeker in getting a job.  Job Network is discussed further in Recommendation 9.</para><para>A range of other Government programs complement the services provided by Job Network in regional Australia.  In addition to the Regional Assistance Program, the Government has introduced Work for the Dole and a variety of measures under the mutual obligation suite.

What has occurred through the introduction of Job Network is the introduction of a fully competitive framework for the delivery of active labour market policies in Australia.  The primary objective of these reforms is to ensure that labour market assistance has a clear focus on job outcomes.  The decision to adopt these reforms was based on a conviction that, over time, a contestable framework for the delivery of employment services would increase the choices available to job seekers.  It will also raise the quality of services that they receive, lead to better and more lasting employment outcomes, and boost value for money from the expenditure of public funds.</para><para>It is clear that Job Network, which provides assistance to job seekers depending on their level of need, is a much more effective system for enabling job seekers to access employment opportunities than the previous arrangements administered by the CES.  For example, in the 12 months to end November 2000, Job Network had placed an average of about 5,700 unemployed people in jobs per week.  There were more than 294,000 eligible job placements under Job Network in the year to end November 2000.</para><para>In the year ending November 2000 more than 62,000 job seekers commenced Job Search Training.  In the same period, almost 319,000 job seekers commenced in Intensive Assistance.</para><para>Current Post Program Monitoring estimates show that around 43 per cent of participants in Intensive Assistance and Job Search Training were in unsubsidised employment or in further education and training three months after leaving assistance.</para><para>The Government has recently released information that demonstrates that Job Network is delivering high quality services to job seekers, as well as large numbers of jobs.  The <inline font-style="italic">Survey of Job Seeker Perceptions of Job Network</inline>, which was gathered from a national telephone survey of 15,000 job seekers, found that more than 80 per cent of job seekers were satisfied with the service provided through Job Network.  Job Network was also seen to be providing a more professional and personalised service than that which was provided by the former CES.</para><para>This focus on competition and delivering quality services to job seekers has been maintained in the second contract period of Job Network, which builds on the successes of the first and provides job seekers and employers with high quality and relevant employment services.</para><para>There have also been a number of changes to how Job Network operates in the second contract period that will lead to improvements in how employment services are delivered to regional Australia.  In the second Job Network contract, there are 19 tender regions and 137 Employment Service Areas (ESAs).  This has improved coverage in regional, rural and remote Australia, as tenderers were able to specify the true cost of providing services in non-metropolitan ESAs.</para><para>The second contract period of Job Network, which commenced in February 2000, has seen a significant increase (from about 1400 to over 2000) in the number of sites from which Job Network services are delivered.  Non-capital city sites have nearly doubled from about 600 to 1100, while more than 250 new Job Network sites (half in regional and rural areas) have been established in locations that did not have a regular Job Network presence.</para><para>The Government, through DEWRSB, continually monitors the performance of Job Network to ensure a high level of contractual compliance, performance, quality and equity of service delivery is maintained.  Job Network members are required to supply DEWRSB with information on their activities and DEWRSB maintains close contact with members both at Head Office and local office levels.  DEWRSB also carries out performance assurance visits.</para><para>Employment Services Contracts commit Job Network members to perform services to a high standard.  Job Network members must participate in any general research, monitoring or evaluation programs undertaken by DEWRSB in relation to the effectiveness of the delivery of employment services.  The Employment Services Contract also requires Job Network members to comply with all relevant State and Commonwealth legislation.</para><para>The performance of Job Network, and the fact that it is outperforming the CES, demonstrates that the introduction of competitive tendering and competition in the provision of employment services has led to better outcomes for job seekers.

An integral and vital part of this campaign has been the development of opportunities for the Minister for Education Training and Youth Affairs to show ongoing support for and commitment to New Apprenticeships by participating in a range of closely targeted events/launches in rural Australia.  These events bring together a wide range of audiences who can influence their local community as to the benefits of New Apprenticeships.</para><para>One example of a particular area facing skills shortages has arisen from the growth in renewable energy, particularly in renewable remote power supplies (RAPS) and domestic photo-voltaic (PV) installations.  This growth places a heavy demand on the existing industry which will require considerable expansion. PV installations will be spread across regional areas as well as the capital cities, and RAPS are by definition located in regional areas and beyond.  The need for accredited training packages to alleviate skill shortages in regional areas has been recognised by the Australian Greenhouse Office, training institutions and the sustainable energy industry.  A steering committee is operating in cooperation with the National Utilities Electrotechnology Industry Training Advisory Board to develop accredited courses in the design and installation of renewable energy systems.</para><para>In June 2000, the Government announced that $469,000 would be provided for a one year project, managed by Rural Skills Australia, to enhance the school to work transition for secondary school students contemplating a career in rural and related industries.  This would be done by improving the current provision of quality structured workplace learning programs and school based part time traineeships.  The project will focus on seven regional areas across Australia.</para><para>In the 2000-2001 Budget the Government also announced measures which recognise the particular health care needs of rural communities, and will provide more doctors in rural areas.  The Government will fund bonded scholarships for 100 new medical students who commit to working in rural areas, and will offer an incentive for new medical graduates to work in rural areas by providing them with a Higher Education Contribution Scheme contribution.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 11: </inline>That an independent monitoring body (similar to the former Employment Services Regulatory Authority) be established to oversee the operation of Job Network and monitor such issues as training provision and make regular public reports.  </para><para>Note: Government Senators do not support the recommendation and believe that the responsibility for monitoring should remain with the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><quote><para>The Government has noted the views of the majority of the Committee on this issue.  However, the Government has established, through DEWRSB, an effective and appropriate monitoring and evaluation strategy which ensures that Job Network delivers appropriate employment outcomes for job seekers in a cost-effective manner.</para><para>DEWRSB continually monitors the performance of Job Network to ensure that a high level of contractual compliance, performance, quality and equity of service delivery is maintained.  Job Network members are required to supply DEWRSB with information on their activities and DEWRSB maintains close contact with members both at Head Office and local office levels.  DEWRSB also carries out performance assurance visits.</para><para>Employment Services Contracts commit Job Network members to perform services to a high standard, to participate in any general research, monitoring or evaluation programs undertaken by DEWRSB and also to comply with all relevant State and Commonwealth legislation.</para><para>The Government also has in place an extensive evaluation and monitoring strategy for Job Network.  The first stage of the strategy is an assessment of issues arising from the implementation of Job Network and early market experience.  The Job Network Evaluation: Stage One implementation and market development report was made publicly available in February 2000.  The second stage of the strategy will be a report, available in early 2001, examining how well the new arrangements are progressing.  The third stage of the strategy will be an effectiveness report which will be available by December 2001, and will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of Job Network in improving the employment prospects of job seekers on a sustainable basis.</para><para>The evaluation will have a high degree of transparency and will include an independent review of the policy framework which will assess the strengths and weaknesses of Job Network policy to determine how it can be improved.  A report of the Review is also planned for December 2001.</para><para>The Government has also introduced measures for the second contract period of Job Network to increase accountability in the delivery of Job Network Intensive Assistance services, while maintaining flexibility for Job Network members to tailor services to the needs of individual job seekers.  Initiatives along these lines include the Declaration of Intent (DOI) and the Intensive Assistance Support Plan (IASP).</para><para>The DOI forms part of the contract between the Job Network member and the Commonwealth.  It will be a summary of the services that a Job Network member expects to provide to job seekers referred for Intensive Assistance over the contract period.  The IASP, negotiated and signed between the job seeker and the Job Network member, outlines activities and assistance Job Network members will provide to job seekers to place them into employment or education.  IASPs will be mandatory if a job seeker is not in employment after three months of assistance, unless the job seeker is placed in employment during this period.</para><para>As well as managing the operation of Job Network, the Government is keen to facilitate the process whereby Job Network continues to provide high quality services to job seekers in the longer term.  The Government is working on a wide range of strategies to facilitate this process of "market development" to ensure that Job Network builds on the impressive outcomes that have been achieved to date.</para><para>Accordingly, the Government does not believe it is necessary to establish an independent monitoring body to oversee the operation of Job Network.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 12: </inline>That additional funding support for TAFE providers be negotiated with the states to improve the provision of structured training opportunities to meet changing local market opportunities.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><quote><para>Consistent with the 1998-2000 Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) Agreement, States and Territories have delivered more training through efficiency gains and, in some cases, through additional State/Territory funding.

The final amount of Commonwealth funding for 2001 will be determined through this process.</para><para>In 2000, States and Territories collectively planned to deliver approximately 160,000 additional student places above the revised planned 1997 level, the agreed base for assessing growth.  Under the ANTA Agreement, the States and Territories retain responsibility for their own training systems.  This includes State level planning, regulation of training providers and the apprenticeship and traineeship system, allocation of funds to individual training providers and setting student fees and charges.</para><para>State and Territory planning processes determine the allocation of resources for training delivery to TAFE and other registered providers.  Planning takes into account the training needs of local areas and the prevailing labour market conditions.</para><para>Primary responsibility for the funding of the vocational education and training (VET) system lies with the State and Territory governments who provided approximately $2.9 billion for this purpose in 2000.

Local government attendance at the Summit included representatives from individual councils as well as from the South Australian, Queensland, Northern Territory and Tasmanian Local Government Associations, the Municipal Associations of Victoria and Western Australia, and the Australian Local Government Association (ALGA).</para><para>In recognition of the need for all three tiers of government to work more closely together on regional development issues, the Australian Local Government Association was represented at meetings between Commonwealth, State and Territory Regional Development Ministers on 29 March and 3 November 2000 (see also response to Recommendation 2 and Attachment B).</para><para>Local government has a strong involvement in the activities of Area Consultative Committees.  ACCs play a role in sharing and disseminating information in local communities and presenting information and feedback from regions to government on the operation of key initiatives such as workplace relations and Rural Transaction Centres.  ACCs are an important source and sharer of information through which they influence, support and promote government policy directions and services for the benefit of their communities.</para><para>Local government also has an important role to play in relation to regional development policy.  It is responsible for delivering and regulating a wide range of economic and human services and providing engineering services and infrastructure.  It plays a major role in environmental management and provides leadership to local communities.  Local government in these roles is a major determinant in the way regional development is pursued.</para><para>The Local Government Incentive Program (LGIP) recognises the need for support to be given to local councils to improve the delivery of services and to lead local communities.  In 1999-2000, around $3 million was provided to help councils comply with the requirements of the GST legislation; in 2000-01, around $4 million will be allocated to assist local government in addressing the Government's priorities, particularly in regional Australia.</para><para>The Program will focus on three priority areas:</para></quote><para>·	activities that lead to the adoption of best practice and sharing of technical expertise across councils;</para><para>·	the promotion of an enhanced role for local government in leading their communities; and</para><para>·	increasing the capacity of local government to contribute to regional development.</para><quote><para>The National Awards for Innovation in Local Government (NAILG) recognise the role local government plays in regional development policy.  It does so by having a business and regional development category that recognises innovation in the development of communities and regional economies through the facilitation and growth of business ventures, infrastructure, tourism and export opportunities.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 15:</inline> That a forum, similar to the Regional Australia Summit, should be convened periodically.  The programming and arrangements for these events should involve all levels of government.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><quote><para>A key objective of the Regional Australia Summit was to gather a broad range of ideas on how best to meet the challenges facing regional Australia.  It also aimed to identify the roles that government, the corporate and community sectors should take in responding to those challenges.  All levels of government were well represented at the Summit.</para><para>The Government was pleased with the outcome of the Summit and the positive and constructive nature of the contribution it made to addressing the problems facing regional Australia.</para><para>At the conclusion of the Summit, a Steering Committee was established by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Honourable John Anderson MP. The Steering Committee has a stewardship role in carrying forward and ensuring action on the Summit deliberations and will work to deliver the outcomes the Summit identified.  An implementation plan was developed by Christmas 1999 and an interim report was delivered in April 2000.  A final report (see Introductory Remarks) has now been released.  While the Government is attracted to the Summit model, a decision on whether to convene any further forums of this kind has not yet been made.</para><para>Regional Forums are a trial, as part of the Commonwealth's "whole of government" approach to regional Australia.  They bring together a considered approach to the sustainable future of a region as well as being a mechanism for governments, particularly the Commonwealth, to address how they interact with, and provide services for, a region.  The Government agreed to trial Regional Forums before deciding on a program across Australia.  The first trial was in the Spencer Gulf area of South Australia.  The Whyalla Forum was widely considered a success.  An independent evaluation is nearing completion.</para><para>In addition, on 13 September 1999 Senator the Honourable Ian Macdonald, Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government announced the Northern Australia Forum.  The area covered was all of Australia above the Tropic of Capricorn, including the:</para><para>(a)	area covered by the Central Queensland Area Consultative Committee;</para><para>(b)	Northern Territory; and</para><para>(c)	the area covered by the Gascoyne Development Commission in Western Australia.</para><para>The Territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands were also covered.</para><para>Although this was a Federal Government initiated activity, the States, Territory, local government and private sector were invited to be partners, as with the forum previously held and those planned for the future.  The Department of Transport and Regional Services is the lead Federal agency and will coordinate a whole of government response by the Commonwealth.  This is expected to be completed by mid 2001.</para><para>Given the size and range of issues for northern Australia, twenty-one pre-summit local consultations were held across the north, which helped to set the agenda and feed into the Forum.</para><para>The broad objectives of the Forum were to:</para></quote><para>·	identify the direction for northern Australia into the new millennium, especially the economic development of northern Australia;</para><para>·	build on the outcomes of the <inline font-style="italic">Regional Australia Summit </inline>held in October 1999; and</para><para>·	plan for the sustainable future of northern Australia, especially emerging industry opportunities.</para><quote><para>The Government recognises the importance of continuing consultation as a way of evaluating the effectiveness of Government policies and programs.  Consultation is also an important way of developing `bottom up' solutions, developing partnerships between the public and private sectors, improving coordination between governments and developing innovative strategies.  The trial Spencer Gulf Regional Forum and the Northern Australia Forum are two examples of how such consultation may occur.  The Government will consider the independent evaluations in deciding whether to establish a continuous forums program.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 16: </inline>The establishment of a Ministerial Council on regional development involving all three spheres of government on the COAG model.

Communities don't want solutions imposed on them.  One size does not fit all.</para><para>·	Government, industries and communities must invest significant ongoing resources in skilling, learning, education and training, and leadership to develop the human capacity of regional Australia.  Distribution of these resources needs to be inclusive of all sectors of regional society.</para><para>·	Communities want to include and invest in their youth.</para><para>·	One of the most extraordinary assets of regional Australia is our unique natural environment, a natural heritage that is a rich and evocative element of our national identity.  The Summit recognises that mistakes have been made in the management of the natural resources which contribute so much to our current wealth and quality of life.  All Australians share a responsibility to restore the productive capacity of our rural landscapes for the benefit of current and future Australians.  Equally, the Summit recognises the great economic and social opportunities our vast, unique rural landscapes offer us to develop new products, services and enterprises based on world-leading management of our natural resources.</para><para>·	Governments, industries and communities must ensure affordable, reliable access to telecommunications.

Some senators may recall that, when this report was tabled in the Senate in September 1999, the committee reported on a comprehensive review of employment issues relevant to regional Australia, hence the words in the title `jobs for the regions'. I thank Senator Ian Macdonald for the tabling of this report. It is unfortunate that Senator Macdonald is not here to address the tabling, because there are several important issues raised in the document which I have not had much time to consider. It arrived in my office today without any covering letter, just as the government's response. We had little notice that it was to be tabled today. Despite that, there are some comments which I think should be raised. I understand that Senator Mackay also has had an opportunity to have a brief review of the government's response and will also address some issues that I will not cover now.</para><para>Firstly, I think it is quite unfortunate that the government has delayed some three times responding to the very important recommendations in this report. I think I stated that it was tabled in September 1999. It appears that the lack of timeliness in the response to this report indicates what has been happening in relation to regional policy across the board. The government has sought to detail a number of initiatives it believes are addressing some of the recommendations moved by the committee. A cursory glance through a number of those seems to indicate that there has been as much progress in relation to acting on policy initiatives for regional Australia, including those set forward in the Regional Australia Summit and the task force proposals, as there had been on getting this report together. It has been a very slow process.</para><para>Unfortunately, I also need to say that, apart from the lack of timeliness, in some areas the substance of what is in this report is equally of concern. In a moment I will go to just one of those areas in relation to the Job Network. Before I do that, I want to go back to what was said in the introduction of our report on this very important issue. As an overall statement, opposition and Australian Democrat senators joined together and said that at the outset the Commonwealth government must take an increased responsibility both for regional development and for past policies that have contributed to regional decline. From my brief look at the report, there seems to be no recognition by this government of the serious impact of those policies—which was highlighted throughout this report—and of the concerns of many Australians that much of Australia's regional decline has actually been as a result of Commonwealth government initiatives.</para><para>As was stated in the opening of the report, many submissions to the committee expressed disappointment at Commonwealth actions such as the withdrawal of Commonwealth agencies from communities and blamed these actions for initiating decline in those communities. The committee's report contains reference to overseas experience in redressing rural and regional decline and we felt that these experiences would provide the government with a useful guide to how the Commonwealth could take action to review policies which have contributed to those declines and to develop policies and initiatives to promote rural and regional development. Unfortunately, if you look at the answers in relation to the progress under the task force, there do not seem to have been significant initiatives in relation to addressing a number of those areas. Opposition and Australian Democrats senators felt that it would be breaking the faith of the many rural and regional Australians who participated in this inquiry not to convey their desire for action to the Commonwealth, which they believed to be the best placed level of government to address their serious problems. The Commonwealth government, unfortunately, though, does not seem to have picked up this message, as it was again reinforced arising from the regional summit.</para><para>I was somewhat bemused when I read the introduction to the government's response where it indicated that in its interim report, released in April 2000, the steering committee recommended the adoption of an aspirational, guiding vision for the future development of regional Australia and to have as a national goal:</para><quote><para>A strong and resilient regional Australia which, by 2010, has the resources, recognition and skills to play a pivotal role in building Australia's future and is able to turn uncertainty and change into opportunity and prosperity.</para></quote><para>So the steering committee was asking for aspirational, guiding vision from this government. Unfortunately, what I have had the opportunity to absorb of this report does not reflect aspirational, guiding vision.</para><para>If I go to one particular area, as I will not have the opportunity to concentrate on more than just that, in relation to the Job Network, we do not see that aspirational, guiding vision. In fact, at the moment with what is happening to Mr Brough, one wonders who is going to guide Employment Services in the absence of a minister to take responsibility for the portfolio, as I am sure that Minister Abbott is fully absorbed in relation to gaining an understanding of workplace relations issues. </para><para>If we go to some of the issues raised about the Job Network, we can see some of the problems that are reflected in this report as a whole. In recommendation 9, the committee had called for further investigation to be made into the effects of the unbridled competition in the provision of employment services. What the government has done in its response is to essentially gloss over that issue completely. It talks further and further about `operating a fully competitive framework' and `benefits in terms of output in relation to having this competitive framework' but does not address the issues that were concentrated on in the report. It does not address the issues raised by witnesses to the inquiry about a lack of guaranteed training. Nor does it address more recent issues about quotas for breaches under the Job Network or about parking mature aged unemployed, a problem particularly in regional Australia. We would accept that there has been some improvement in regional Australia's access to agencies but there is no improvement in the lack of transparency and the lack of accountability within the system. Senators might recall that this system was established through a delegated instrument and it is not only the unemployed that are having problems with accountability with the system but the players within the system, the agencies, are also having problems with making the government accountable.</para><para>On the issue of accountability, in relation to recommendation 9, on page 30 the government report says that the performance of Job Network and the fact that it is outperforming the CES demonstrates that the introduction of competitive tendering and competition in the provision of employment services has led to better outcomes for job seekers. All of this data is selective and is controlled by the department. The department is not prepared to allow independent assessment of these things and to put forward adequate figures that can be used to make fair comparisons. There are several academic reports that indicate that the government's figures are highly questionable. </para><para>This brings me to the government's response to our recommendation 11, where the government outlines its evaluation process but says that the evaluation will have a high degree of transparency and will include an independent review. This is the first that I believe I have heard of an independent review. Unfortunately, the government's response does not indicate how this independent review is going to occur, who is going to conduct it and what exactly it is going to look into and I look forward to more information. I hope that getting more information on this will not take as long as this report took to get out of the government. I suspect, though, looking at this indication of an independent review, that I am going to be disappointed, as I have been on many occasions, because I suspect that the government is representing something that does not exist in fact.

I just remind the Senate that in fact this inquiry, which was a very important inquiry, was precipitated by major concerns in regional and rural Australia in relation to what were a couple of horrendous federal budgets in terms of cutbacks in services, and of course regional Australia always bears the brunt disproportionately in relation to the decisions of this government. I would remind the Senate that this inquiry actually started on 4 December 1998 and that this report was in fact tabled in September 1999. Almost 18 months later, half of a federal government term, we have finally got a response. And what a pathetic response it is. To be honest with you, most of the information that the government has provided in this you could pull off the Internet.</para></talk.start><para>There were 224 submissions to this inquiry. There were 22 public hearings and many witnesses, and many people came along to listen to this inquiry, which travelled extensively at taxpayers' expense throughout regional Australia. But presenting a selection of information which anybody could have downloaded off the Internet in five minutes is yet another insult to regional Australians. It really is a poor, pathetic and ill thought out response, and we had to wait 18 months for it. The government knew that there were a number of recommendations in this report that coalition senators agreed to, which the government obviously would have had a bit of difficulty with, so it deferred it as long as it possibly could. The government has released it now in order to get it out of the way prior to an election.</para><para>I was very interested to note that a number of issues got a bit of a run in this `pulled down from the Internet' response from the government, and one of them was rural transaction centres. Of course, we had the usual old, dreary dorothy dixer on rural transaction centres to Senator Macdonald today. That program seems to be trotted out as the panacea to virtually every ill in regional Australia. It was described as a flagship program in relation to the second tranche sale of Telstra to try to con regional Australians—but of course they have not been. Where are we now? Almost 18 months after the commencement of that program, there are 19 rural transaction centres up and running. Almost two years down the track, approximately $4.5 million has been allocated for this program out of the $70 million which was set down for it initially.</para><para>We are advised by a press release from the responsible minister that there are another 30 to come. We say that is good. Thirty is better than nothing. It is better than a poke in the eye with a burnt stick, which is what regional Australians have come to expect from the government. Let us get them up and running. But, no, we have to wait for dates in ministers' diaries so that the ministers can cut the ribbons and the services can be showcased as much as possible in an election year. There is a clear stockpiling going on here. This program has been an abject failure, and the government has had to employ network officers to assist in getting it up and running to try to get as many of these things opened before the federal election, when the scrutiny will come down on this program.</para><para>The other thing that the report glosses over is the privatisation of Telstra. It describes the independent inquiry set up to examine the issues in rural and regional Australia and the privatisation of Telstra. It does not go much further than that. It does not attempt to describe services and the implications for employment in rural and regional Australia. And what have we learnt over the last week? The wholly owned subsidiary of Telstra, Network Design and Construction, is about to shed another 3,000 staff in Australia, the majority of which will come from regional Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>—What about the Prime Minister's promise?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Senator Woodley, for reminding me about the Prime Minister's promise.

Well, the old red light must be on high beam by now, and I think it probably has been on high beam. Certainly people should have red ears in relation to making commitments on red lights—that is all I will say about that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have a revelation that another 3,000 jobs are going to go from the very people who actually lay the cables for telephone connections in regional Australia. It has to be extracted from Telstra and the government that the figure of 3,000 is correct. It first became clear that it was correct in my home state of Tasmania, where all of a sudden another 35 jobs were cut. This is the state that is supposed to have done well out of the first two tranches of the sale of Telstra. That is going to have more of an implication in regional Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—Yes, that is correct, Senator Woodley. The government has broken its promise not only to Tasmanians but also to Senator Harradine on the matter of Telstra and Tasmania. The other thing the government's Internet downloaded report does not mention is the deregulation of Australia Post. I note with some amusement Senator Macdonald talking about closures of post offices under the Labor Party. I will deal with that in great detail during the next few months. This government is committed to the deregulation of Australia Post. Australia Post has estimated that this will reduce its profit margins by 25 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I wonder whether anybody in the Senate would care to guess where the closures will be, where the job losses will be and where the services are going to be diminished to meet the reduction of 25 per cent in Australia Post's profitability. It will be in regional Australia again. So much for the old red light flashing. So much for the Nyngan declaration. So much for John Howard's commitments to regional Australia. I bet regional Australians are hoping and keeping their fingers crossed that John Howard does not go out to regional Australia again, because the last time he went out to regional Australia there was an announcement from Dr Switkowski that 10,000 Telstra jobs would be cut. I think it is probably better if Mr Howard visits regional Australia as infrequently as possible.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Mr Howard was in Gippsland last week.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—Senator McGauran reminds the Senate that Mr Howard was out in Gippsland last week.

The panacea for that is, yet again, the little old rural transaction centre program, with its 19 outlets for the entirety of regional Australia and 30 secret ones to come. They are waiting on a couple of days to be free in Senator Macdonald's diary. That is not mentioned either. The bottom line is that those who wrote the 224 submissions and the plethora of people who appeared in front of the Senate inquiry—which was taken extremely seriously by all of the participants, including the coalition senators who participated; I would like to thank them as well as my Labor colleagues—got a load of rubbish that anybody who can access the Internet, although you cannot very often in regional Australia, could have printed off themselves. How long did we wait for that? Eighteen months. It is pathetic.</para><para>If the government wish to treat the Senate like this, that is fine, but this will not be lost on the people of rural and regional Australia come the next election. You ignore them at your peril. They are a lot smarter than the government think they are. They are very concerned and I will make sure they know this is what the government think of them in this fairly shoddy effort. It could have been downloaded from the Internet—if you had access to it in regional Australia—at any point.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title><page.no>21760</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>21760</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>21760</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>I wish to speak briefly to the government response to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee report entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Hinchinbrook Channel inquiry</inline>. A development has been built across the channel from Hinchinbrook Island, which is one of many magnificent environmental treasures in the state of Queensland. It is part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The issue of the development has been debated for many years and Senator Woodley and I have followed it closely since at least 1993, if not earlier.</para><para>There is ample evidence of the risks of that development, which the government has chosen to ignore, even though they were quite clearly outlined in the report. I will go into those in more detail on another occasion, but it is worth noting that the Hinchinbrook development was the last time that the federal government used its powers under the world heritage convention, under the old World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. In the 16 years of the operation of that act, the federal government acted six times to protect world heritage environmental values. The government acted for the last time on Hinchinbrook Channel. It is worth noting that, in the little over six months since the new Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which was significantly amended by the Democrats, has been operating, the federal government has already intervened seven times—including six times in Queensland—to ensure proper environmental assessment and to ensure environmental values are protected in world heritage areas.</para><para>I come from Queensland, which has incredibly valuable—both environmentally and economically—world heritage areas, particularly the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and wet tropics areas, and that increased power and opportunity for the federal government to protect world heritage areas is of great value. It is worth noting that in the past we had to wait until the development was being built and impacts were occurring in a world heritage area before intervening and then making assessments and having Senate inquiries. The way that it operates under the new act, which was strengthened and supported by the Democrats, is that the assessments with public input now have to be made before the action can begin. You do not have to wait until the damage is occurring before you intervene, which is a significant advance. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title><page.no>21761</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>21761</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>21761</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>The report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">Deregulation of the Australian dairy industry</inline> was handed down in October 1999. I want to quote from the executive summary of this very comprehensive 200-page report. It states:</para><quote><para>The Australian dairy industry is the third largest rural industry, (behind beef and wheat) and the third largest exporter of dairy products worldwide, after the European Community and New Zealand.  Dairying is Australia's largest rural industry valued at the wholesale level ($7 billion).  The industry has doubled its production over the last decade.  The industry has 13,500 dairy farmers and is a significant regional employer with 60,000 direct jobs at farm and manufacturing level.</para></quote><para>The Senate committee undertook a very extensive inquiry into what was the proposed deregulation of the Australian dairy industry. Of course, deregulation ultimately did come into effect from 1 July 2000. The committee inquiry included 12 days of public hearings in each of the states—Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia—as well as hearings in Canberra. Those public hearings took place not just in the capital cities but also in regional centres in dairying areas such as Deniliquin and Lismore in New South Wales, Gympie in Queensland, Bunbury in Western Australia and Mount Gambier in South Australia.</para><para>There were 116 written submissions made to the committee, and many, many witnesses gave evidence at the public hearings. The committee, which was made up of government, opposition and Democrat members, ultimately delivered a unanimous report. I note that Senator McGauran and Senator Woodley, who were members of the committee, are present in the chamber, and I am sure Senator Woodley will want to make some remarks after me on this very detailed, comprehensive and I think excellent report on what is a major issue—that is, the restructuring and deregulation of the Australian dairy industry.</para><para>The committee came down with a set of detailed recommendations. Those recommendations went to many issues, including the timing and implementation of deregulation; the nature of the restructuring package that had been developed by the Australian Dairy Industry Council and was the subject, at that time and following the committee's report, of negotiation with the federal and state governments; the inevitable social impacts upon dairy farmers and their families; and the social, economic and other impacts on the communities in dairy regions, particularly noting that some regions were going to be severely affected as a result of deregulation. We noted that dairy farmers would seek to exit the industry in some regions, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland. We made recommendations on how those issues needed to be addressed and resolved to ensure that deregulation for farmers was not just cold turkey; that they would not be left in a position of economic and financial ruin, notwithstanding the package; and that they would not be hit on the first day after 1 July.</para><para>The committee made recommendations about prices and costs. A lot of divergent evidence was put before the inquiry as to what would happen to prices at the farm gate level and in the retail sector, and how much it would cost the farmers. Much of that evidence was based on speculation and on studies which tried to predict what would happen to domestic milk in Australia in a deregulated market. We made recommendations which went to those issues and to the role of the ACCC. We also made recommendations about the future role of cooperatives, which had been such a major part of the dairy industry. We were particularly concerned, as I said, about the dire impact that deregulation could have on some farmers and their communities in particular regions in Australia. </para><para>Many of the concerns and predictions that we had have come to fruition, unfortunately. We have seen throughout a number of regions farmers now facing financial ruin. Notwithstanding the package, which is paid for not by this government—as Mr Truss, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, suggests—but by consumers through a levy, those farmers are today in dire straits. The farm gate prices they have been receiving are far lower than what was projected to be the case and what the package was developed upon. This has been such a major issue in rural and regional areas that the government itself was forced to act and it commissioned a report from ABARE. They handed down a report which backs up everything I have just said.</para><para>This is a very serious issue today for rural and regional Australia, but what is this government's response to this 200-page unanimous report? We get one page with three lousy paragraphs telling us what we already knew when we wrote the report. I wish this was on television; this page I am holding up is what we get. Over a year after the report was released, at a time when farmers, their families and communities in the dairy industry are crying out for some help and for somebody to listen, this government hands down a report with three paragraphs. This is an absolute disgrace. This is an insult to the people in this industry who look to this parliament and to this government to listen to their concerns.</para><para>Our committee did listen, and I compliment the government members who did listen, such as Senator Crane, Senator McGauran and others. But then it got higher up the ladder to the minister and those who prepared this response, and they produced this absolutely disgraceful response. As I said, there are just three paragraphs. Words fail me as to how you could even do this to people after their participation in this inquiry. There may be only three paragraphs here, but there is one big message to those people—that is, this government does not care about you and your concerns. The National Party members in those seats do not care, and those government members are going to get a big message at the next election from people in this industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>21762</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am afraid that I have to pick up where Senator Forshaw left off earlier.

He resisted deregulation to the last moment. However, he was taking the advice of the leaders of the dairy industry in Queensland and those leaders, I believe, capitulated far too easily and the minister had no alternative, really, but to go along. So each of states deregulated, but in a climate where the federal government was saying to them, `If you do not deregulate, there will be no restructure package.' In other words, they were saying, `No deregulation, no money.' In that sort of climate what could the states do? </para></talk.start></continue><para>In this government response let us not pretend—in the words of the federal government minister—that somehow or other this was something that they had nothing to do with—hands off the federal government—that it was the states that did it and the federal government simply had to go along. That is not true. That is nonsense. There is no doubt that the federal government was holding a gun at the head of these states in terms of deregulation. There is no doubt that in the states of New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia the impact has been horrific. </para><para>The federal government knew it would be horrific. ABARE, prior to deregulation, had produced a report which described how horrific it would be and nobody actually believed it. The industry said that it could not be that bad, that the ABARE figures could not be right. We know now that in fact the ABARE figures were correct and that it is even worse than they predicted. How can any responsible government, knowing that a disaster is about to happen, knowing that there are going to be horrific consequences from what they are about to do, still say, `There is nothing we can do.' It is as though we said, `We know we are about to be invaded but our army is so weak we will all just have to go away and hide. There is nothing we can do.'</para><para>Returning to the government's response, it says:</para><quote><para>The Commonwealth's package provides a substantive response to the industry's requests for support while it adjusts to deregulation and to the recommendations in the Senate committee's report.</para></quote><para>I am afraid it hardly pays any attention to the recommendations. For example, there was one recommendation in the Senate report that the government has never recognised or responded to. That was recommendation 6: that an inquiry into the operations and accountability mechanisms of cooperatives—that is the big processors, particularly Bonlac and Murray Goulburn—be undertaken. The committee made this recommendation because of disturbing evidence critical of the cooperatives for their lack of accountability and transparency. Nowhere in this report is there any response to that. That is one of the glaring recommendations of the Senate committee which has never been attended to. And, of course, we have seen since deregulation that Bonlac, one of the drivers of deregulation, is itself in great financial difficulty and about to be taken over by New Zealand. That will be a further disaster for the Australian dairy industry. It is about time that the government took seriously the Senate's report and all the recommendations of that report. Yesterday I asked Minister Alston a question about the basis of the package. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (PETROL TAX CUT) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21764</page.no><id.no>S293</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (PETROL TAX CUT) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>S294</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>21764</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 8 February, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cook</inline>:</para><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>21764</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are continuing debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001, which is the Labor Party's initiative to remove the indexation that occurred on 1 February of the excise tax that applies to petroleum products. There are special circumstances surrounding the increase on 1 February that warrant the removal of that excise increase. As everyone would be well aware, the excise increase that occurred as a result of movements in inflation has increased the price of petrol around Australia by an average of 1.7c a litre. It is higher in some areas—my home state of Tasmania, for example—because the petrol prices are higher in rural and regional Australia, certainly higher than in Melbourne or Sydney.</para></talk.start><para>This is a Labor Party initiative. It is extremely disappointing to see that Liberal Party and National Party members will not support it—but more of that later. The Prime Minister, in leading the Liberal-National parties, made a promise to the Australian electorate that the GST would not increase the price of fuel. He clearly stated that in the run-up to the last election. But this has not been the case. The price of fuel in Australia has risen as a result of the GST. I will outline why and how that has occurred shortly, but what we have is another broken promise—perhaps a non-core promise—from the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Liberal-National parties.</para><para>Let us go back to 1 July last year. With the introduction of the GST, the commitment by Mr Howard was to reduce the excise tax to offset the 10 per cent GST. In carrying out that commitment and reducing the excise so that petrol prices should not rise, the government short-changed the Australian electorate. The reduction in excise was not sufficient to offset the introduction of the GST. The shortfall—in other words, the gain to the Liberal-National Party government as a consequence—was at least 1.5c a litre. It is higher again in rural and regional areas because the impact of the GST, being a percentage tax, collects more revenue from those areas. So the first breaking of the promise was on 1 July last year.</para><para>Secondly, the GST is a percentage tax—unlike the excise, which is a flat tax—so when there are increases in world oil prices, which I acknowledge has occurred, the increase in the base price of petroleum products, with a GST on top of them, collects more revenue for government. There is a third GST factor, which I referred to earlier. This bill deals with that. As a consequence of the GST, inflation increased in Australia. Each six months the excise tax is increased by the rate of inflation. Most of the inflation rise that occurred over the last quarter was as a result of the GST. There is no argument about that; that is well known. This led to a further increase in the price of fuel of at least 1.1c a litre. It is higher again in rural and regional areas. So we have had not one, not two, but three breaches of the promise made by the Prime Minister that petrol prices would not go up as a result of the GST.</para><para>It is difficult to identify in budget papers issued by the government the precise amount of extra revenue that has been raised as a consequence of these three extra tax grabs by Mr Howard as a result of the GST, but estimates from the Australian Automobile Association—an independent organisation—have confirmed the figures that I outlined previously. The Automobile Association estimate that this has raised approximately $1 billion in extra revenue, over and above what was projected in the budget, as a result of the introduction of the GST.</para><para>The story does not stop there. There is another tax on petroleum—the resource rent tax. When the base price of oil goes up, the money collected from the resource rent tax also goes up—a higher base and therefore more tax revenue collected. We know that the additional revenue that has resulted from the resource rent tax is about $450 million or $460 million, because it was released in the mid-year economic figures that the Treasurer released in November last year.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Which is part of the figures you quoted.

It is about $1½ billion in total. I have not included that in the figures so far. Anyway, you will contribute, Senator McGauran, and no doubt explain why you are not supporting this important initiative of the Labor Party to reduce fuel taxes. But the Labor Party believes that the extra tax collected from the taxes on petroleum products is about $1½ billion. We know about the resource rent tax—the government has owned up to that. We do not know the extra revenue as a result of the GST, and we will not know that until the full budget papers are handed down in May. We have asked for that figure, but of course the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, will not release the figure to date. They are hiding it; they are embarrassed. So that is the story about the increases that have occurred as a result of the broken promise of the Prime Minister on the GST.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have had three main reasons advanced by members of the Liberal and National parties as to why they will not support this important initiative of the Labor Party. They can be summarised as follows. Their first excuse is: `The excise policy is Labor policy; we are following Labor policy.' The second excuse is what could be called the `roads defence': `We're spending money on roads.' The third defence, which I find extraordinarily hypocritical, is: `Don't blame me. I don't agree with it, but I won't do anything about it.' That is the third excuse we are getting from the Liberal and National Party members about this issue. I would now like to turn to the first issue of excise policy. At this stage, I seek leave to incorporate some documents—and I have extended the normal courtesies and shown a copy of these documents.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The documents read as follows—</inline></para><quote><para>PETROLEUM PRODUCTS EXCISE RATES</para><para>8 Excise Reductions and on No indexation increase during the period of the Labor Government 1983-1996</para></quote><quote><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><tbody><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Date</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Cents per litre leaded petrol</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Reason for change</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>02-Feb-84 </para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>9.397</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>CPI increase</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>01-Aug-84 </para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>9.397</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>No indexation increase</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>17-May-86 </para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>19.200</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Offset lost revenue/IPP</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>14-Jun-86 </para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>18.822</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Offset gain revenue/IPP</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>19-Aug-86 </para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>23.884</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Budget increase -

Data for the years up to and including 1998-99 are consistent with the cash ABS GFS reporting requirements. From 1999-2000 onwards, data are derived from an accrual ABS GFS reporting framework, with revenues proxied by receipts from operating activities and sales of non-financial assets, and outlays by payments for operating activities and purchases of non-financial assets. Due to methodological and data-source changes associated with the change, time series data which encompasses measures derived under both cash and accrual accounting should be used with caution.</para><para>(b)	Following recent changes to the Australian National Accounts standards, the surplus measures in this table, from 1998-99 onwards, incorporate payments by the general government sector in respect of accumulated PNFC superannuation liabilities.

Some senators may be aware that I asked a question of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, about this matter today. The excuse that Mr Costello, in particular, gives is: `The Labor Party indexed excise when they were in government, so we're doing exactly the same. It was Labor policy; we're continuing it.' It is a rather extraordinary claim to make, and it is the first time I can recall the Treasurer, Mr Costello, saying, `The Labor Party's got a policy. We're going to do exactly the same thing,' as though he is bound by it. The Liberal and National parties are in government, Senator McGauran. You are masters of your own destiny. It seems quite extraordinary that, on this one issue, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, says that he is bound by Labor Party policy, when that is not the case. </para></talk.start></continue><para>But, even if he were bound by Labor Party policy, his explanation of Labor Party policy is incorrect. I could use stronger language but it would be unparliamentary, so I will not. What in fact happened when Labor were in power for 13 years is that certainly on many occasions the fuel excise was indexed to inflation. Again, the Treasurer and members of the Liberal and National parties are fond of saying that it was indexed on 23 occasions. That is correct. But there were nine occasions when something different was done. What happened on those nine occasions is listed on the first page of the documents that I have incorporated. On one occasion the Labor Party decided not to apply the indexation increase to petroleum excise, and on eight other occasions it reduced the excise rate. There are a number of reasons for that. There are nine occasions on which petroleum excise was not increased in line with inflation. So the government and Mr Costello are telling only part of the story. If they are so keen on Labor Party policy when there are exceptional circumstances, as we have here, then petroleum excise need not be increased. I put that on the record because I do not believe it is commonly known, unfortunately, and so that those enthusiasts who are following this debate in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> can see the facts for themselves.</para><para>The second excuse given by the government is what I call the `roads defence'. The defence is: `Petrol and diesel prices are high but we'll give some money back for roads.' They have done that; they have given some money back for roads—it is about $400 million a year. But they are going to collect $1.5 billion in additional revenue, and they have given back $400 million a year.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—$1.5 billion back?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—They have given back $400 million a year in road funding. So they have a net gain of over $1 billion still in the kitty. So the roads defence is only partly true, Senator McGauran. What is the use of spending money on roads when people find it very expensive to drive on them? The third set of excuses is quite intriguing. It is what I refer to as the `don't blame me; I don't agree but I won't do anything about it' set of excuses. We have had 12 members and senators so far—joined by a 13th as of yesterday—who get into the local media in their electorates and say, `We don't think the petrol price should go up as a result of the excise. We think this is dreadful.' Senator McGauran is smiling, of course, because the 12 people in the Liberal and National parties who have done this so far have been joined by Mr Katter, the member for Kennedy. Surprise, surprise! In their electorates they say, `This is dreadful.' They are lions in their electorates. They say, `We shouldn't be increasing the price of fuel excise.' But when they come to Canberra they do not do anything about it.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—They're pussycats!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—Yes, they are pussycats in Canberra.

He claimed, `It is just 1c; it is neither here nor there—who really cares?' Senator Boswell was incorrect. It is not 1c; it is closer to 2.86c and $1½ billion. So it is not an insignificant amount of money. But isn't that typical of the leadership of the National Party? I am sure Senator Ian Macdonald is going to proffer up the roads defence in his contribution. I do not think he will proffer up the `don't blame me; I don't agree but won't do anything about it' excuse because he would not be a minister if he tried to do that. It is typical of the leadership of the National Party—and they wonder why they are in such trouble in rural and regional areas. One other point: Senator Boswell alleged that the people who are appearing before our Labor Party inquiry are all Labor Party stooges. Senator McGauran, I suggest that Senator Boswell, your leader, should pick up a copy of our report and look at the appendix. All the people who have appeared at the hearings are listed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Where do you get a copy of that?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—It is on the web site.

We have people from all sorts of organisations; in fact, I suspect we had more people from the National Party than we did from the Labor Party. The overwhelming majority of them were people from community organisations whom you could not call members of the Labor Party. Of course, we will send those people a copy of Senator Boswell's offensive remarks so that they can see for themselves. So we have these three defences. And, of course, Mr Katter jumps on the bandwagon. The tough Mr Katter—he is going to introduce a private member's bill. Well, I will believe it when I see it. I would be shocked to see members of the National Party actually do something about this issue in parliament. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—He could.

They were too embarrassed to have a debate and have a vote on the legislation we are considering here in the Senate. They were just too embarrassed. As I said earlier, they are lions in their electorates—they complain bitterly about petrol prices and taxation policy—but they do nothing when they come to Canberra. They do not do a thing. Why is this issue so important? Obviously, the Prime Minister breaking his promise to the Australian electorate—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name></talker><para>—Another one.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—Another one; that is right. Another non-core promise. He broke his promise that petrol prices would not go up as a result of the GST, but not just once—three times. That is serious enough—breaking that promise goes to the credibility of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard—but what is really hurting families, particularly in rural and regional Australia, is the impact of higher fuel prices in these areas. Senator McGauran knows the impact. He will not do anything about it but he does know. He knows that in rural and regional areas petrol is an essential commodity—you are very lucky to have any public transport at all and there is no option but to drive your own motor vehicle. Secondly, incomes are lower in rural and regional areas, and Senator McGauran knows this as well. The average income in rural and regional areas is lower than in places like Melbourne and Sydney, so they have less capacity to pay. In addition, they obviously drive further distances and need to consume more fuel. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Thirdly, and most importantly, fuel prices in rural and regional Australia are higher than in Melbourne and Sydney. In my home state of Tasmania, on the north-west coast of Tasmania where I live, fuel prices last week—depending on the town—were approaching $1 a litre. Regrettably, it has always been the case that in rural and regional areas fuel prices are higher than in Melbourne and Sydney, and the GST has widened the gap. The GST and its impact on fuel is sucking the lifeblood out of rural and regional Australia. Senator Boswell might not think much of 1c, but $1 a tank is a big hit to families living in rural and regional Australia. So the legislation that the Labor Party has presented to the Senate is very important. We would like at least some people—like Senator McGauran, who knows the truth—to cross the floor and support our legislation.</para><para>Today Senator Kemp again accused us of being a high tax party. I have incorporated extracts from Budget Paper No. 1 which show the total revenue collected by the Commonwealth. On the face of it—at page 8-42—the total revenue has fallen. But, of course, this collection of revenue does not include the GST. If you include the GST, taxes as a percentage of gross domestic product—which is the relevant measurement—have gone up under the Howard-Costello government. It is the Howard-Costello government that is a high taxing party, in part because of this fuel tax issue. I have also incorporated a document showing the increase in revenue that is to be collected as a result of the changes that I have outlined. Unleaded petroleum products go up by 18.8 per cent in this financial year. Leaded petrol goes down because it is in declining use. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>21773</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have seen some stunts from the Labor Party in my 10 years in this place, but I think this one—this absolute hypocrisy on fuel prices, fuel excise, fuel indexation—beats them all. This is the bobby-dazzler of Labor Party stunts. They know that, we know that, and I think the Australian public is very quickly coming to realise that Labor's talk on excise and fuel is nothing more than talk. Talk is pretty cheap; you have to look at the actions. The old saying is right: actions speak louder than words. But let us put some facts into this debate today because, remarkably, Senator Sherry's contribution lacked any sort of factual account.</para></talk.start><para>Indexation of excise in line with the CPI occurs automatically every February and every August under legislation that was in-troduced by the Australian Labor Party. In case anyone is uncertain about it, that is the people sitting opposite us. The person who has just spoken is a member of the Australian Labor Party, and that is the party who are putting up this hypocritical piece of legislation today. They introduced indexation, they supported it, and they kept it there for the years—the all too many years—that they were in government. Why are excises indexed like that? They are indexed because, unlike value taxes, such as income tax where increases in wages automatically increase tax revenue, excise is a volumetric tax. This means that the excise is actually levied on a flat, per litre basis. Regardless of the price of petrol, the excise remains the same. It only increases by this automatic indexation or if a government should choose deliberately to increase the excise over and above the CPI.</para><para>Indexation of excise is necessary to ensure that the real value of excise keeps pace with the cost of living and does not decline over time. Whilst the government indexes excise, following on from a program that the previous government, the Australian Labor Party government, had introduced, we also index pensions and other welfare payments. In my own area, the $1¼ billion that the federal government gives to local government every year is also indexed by CPI and population growth. That is what happens on the spending side. Naturally enough, on these flat taxes indexation occurs to keep the value of that indexation. That is why the Labor Party originally introduced it and that is why we continue with that particular policy. For every additional dollar of revenue raised through indexing excise, around $2.40—that is, almost 2½ times that—is paid out through higher pensions. The government is still going backwards but, because of the very fine and sound fiscal management of this government, we are able to afford that. Certainly the indexing of excise is far below the price of indexing of higher pensions and other payments.</para><para>I emphasise again: indexation of excise was Labor Party policy. The Labor Party introduced it. The Labor Party implemented it, and Labor still support it. In fact, when Labor were in government they increased petrol excise on some 23 separate occasions. In addition, Labor indexed petrol excise as a budget measure on five occasions. I just want to explain that. When Labor were in power not only did the excise go up in accordance with the CPI but over and above that Labor increased the amount of excise by deliberate legislation in the budget procedure. They were not content just to keep the value of the excise by indexing it; they actually increased the base amount of excise on five separate occasions. Senator Sherry was in the ministry then. I ask him: why did you do that, Senator Sherry? If it is so bad now, why did you allow the excise to increase automatically with the CPI and why did you actually increase it over and above the CPI when you were in government? That is what we would have liked to have heard you speak about. I do not know who is following in this debate. Senator Mackay looks like she is going to say something. She was not around then, so I do not suppose we can—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator Troeth</name></talker><para>—It is a treat in store!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>—I am not like her. I do not bring personal likes and dislikes into it. With Senator Mackay, you can be assured of it because that is her style. Unfortunately, the only person that was involved in those decisions at those times was Senator Sherry. He has spoken. Perhaps in your summing up, Senator Sherry, you might be able to explain why you allowed the excise to go up automatically through the whole 13 years of government and why you increased it over and beyond the indexation. I would be fascinated to hear that. Perhaps you could tell one of your colleagues who is going to speak later why that happened so that we will understand it early in the debate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have this great stunt this afternoon, but let us see what the facts are on taxes on fuel. On 5 February this year, Mr Beazley was asked by the announcer as part of an interview on 3AW:</para><quote><para>Would you look at ...is it possible you'd look at taking the GST off petrol?</para></quote><para>You would think Mr Beazley would use this opportunity to follow along the line he has been following, but here is Mr Beazley's answer:</para><quote><para>I don't think that we would give that contemplation.</para></quote><para>I am surprised that he used such simple words—that is not Mr Beazley's style—but those words are so very simple that everyone can understand them:</para><quote><para>I don't think that we would give that contemplation.</para></quote><para>There was his opportunity to say, `We'll get rid of the GST.' But, no, he is going to keep it, not even going to contemplate it. So where does that leave the Labor Party? In the interview Mr Beazley was asked about removing excise from petrol, and the interviewer said:</para><quote><para>But you might look at taking the excise off?</para></quote><para>Mr Beazley said:</para><quote><para>But what you've got ...nor the excise for that matter.</para></quote><para>I am not sure what that meant. The interviewer said:</para><quote><para>Sorry, you said `nor the excise'. I must have misunderstood.</para></quote><para>I cannot blame anyone for misunderstanding, but he said:</para><quote><para>I must have misunderstood. Will you consider taking the excise off petrol?</para></quote><para>To which Mr Beazley replied:</para><quote><para>Well, if you took the excise off petrol, which particular schools would you start to shut?</para></quote><para>Of course Mr Beazley is quite right about that. Take the excise off petrol and you will have to start shutting schools, you will have to start cutting back on pensions, or you will have to increase income tax or tax in some other way.</para><para>Mr Beazley understands that, but why does he go through this charade of moving these stunt-like pieces of legislation today, knowing that, if he were in government, he would be doing exactly the same as the current government? Although perhaps he would take it even further, as he did when the Labor Party was in government, by actually increasing the excise over and above the CPI. If you need any further indication of what the Labor Party would do, can I refer you to the interview on Rockhampton TV that the shadow Treasurer Mr Crean gave—I think it was back in March last year—when he was asked about excise and whether he would remove it. Whilst I do not have his exact quote here—I think Senator Mackay was with him during that interview, so she will probably be able to give you the exact words—the words Mr Crean, the shadow Treasurer, spoke were these: `Well, the price of petrol is made of various things: the cost, various excises, state taxes. We think the mix is just about right.' That was his comment: `We think the mix is just about right.' Obviously, again, the shadow Treasurer would not change the way fuel is taxed at the moment.</para><para>Of course, when the Liberal-National Party government introduced legislation, as part of the GST package, to actually reduce the price of excise, what did Senator Cook, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in the Senate, say? Senator Cook said words to the effect that we were doing the wrong thing by reducing the excise. It was his argument at the time—and I understand that this is in a Senate report, a document that was tabled in the Senate—that reducing excise would lead to more usage, and that was bad for the environment. Senator Cook, in those days, was opposed to the reduction in excise. Today, I guess he is going to come along and vote in favour of this stunt, this sham piece of legislation before us at the present time.</para><para>All of the revenue from the GST—every single cent of GST—will go to the state governments. That was always the plan; that is how it has been legislated. The federal government gets not one cent of the GST; it all goes to the state governments. Any increase in the GST from the increasing price of petrol because of world fluctuations goes immediately and directly to the state governments; not one cent will go to the federal government. If the Labor Party are so concerned about this, why don't they get the Labor government in Queensland, the Labor government in New South Wales, the Labor government in Victoria or the Labor government in Tasmania to use some of that alleged additional GST from the increase in the price of petrol to subsidise it—to give something back to the motorists? If the Labor Party want to do that, they can do it in four states because they control the state governments there. They can give the GST money straight back to the motorists in any way they want. The absolute hypocrisy of the Labor Party position is again demonstrated by the fact that the state Labor governments are getting additional GST—if there is any—from the increase in the price of fuel.</para><para>In an attempt to build up a head of steam out in the country, the Australian Labor Party never hesitate to gild the lily a little bit and to misrepresent the facts. There are a lot of people rather confused about the real situation with petrol. They say, `Look, farmers are the lifeblood of our nation and they are paying too much for fuel.' They say that some of the miners should not be paying that much. They say—this is the public at large—`Wouldn't you think we should be encouraging railways by giving them a bit of a boost?' Others say, `Because we live in regional Australia, wouldn't you think you'd do something about getting goods out to regional Australia and bringing exports in from regional Australia to the wharves?' The Labor Party run around—I will not say they are telling lies, because that is unparliamentary—misrepresenting the truth on these issues, and so people are confused.</para><para>Let me clearly state what the position is. Yesterday, I looked into the price of fuel, both unleaded and diesel, in my home town of Ayr, way up in North Queensland. It is a country town about 1,300 or 1,400 kilometres from the capital city. I got someone to go out and find out what the price of fuel was in Ayr at the fuel pumps in two local service stations. The fuel price yesterday was 89.9c per litre for both diesel and unleaded petrol. The farmers in my town—and in any other town around Australia—are not paying 89.9c per litre for their fuel; they are actually paying, for their diesel or unleaded petrol for on-farm use, 42.2c a litre. I will just repeat that: farmers, for on-farm use, are paying 42.2c per litre for fuel. That is because they do not pay the excise and they do not pay the GST component. The same applies to miners for on-mine use. </para><para>The same applies—under this government; it was never so under the Labor government—to the railways. Nowadays, the railways and ships do not pay excise. The price per litre of diesel fuel or like fuels for railways or ships is 42.2c per litre—that is, if they have not got some commercial arrangement, and I am sure they do, that gives it to them at a price even lower than that. The owners of the trucks that run around taking the goods from the city to the country and the trucks that bring the produce from the country in to the wharves are not paying 89.9c per litre for their diesel or like fuels or unleaded petrol. They are paying not 89.9c per litre but 63.9c per litre. That is because of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme and the other concessions that the government have given. They get a rebate of something in the order of 25c, 26c or 27c a litre on the fuel they use. Of course, anyone in business gets their GST back. So instead of paying 89.9c per litre in my home town of Ayr today, those in business are paying 81.9c per litre. They are the facts: those reductions are available under this government.</para><para>I can assure the people of Australia that, if the Labor Party were in power, fuel for transport operators in country Australia cost close on 27c a litre more than they are paying now. This is because the Labor Party opposed that reduction, they opposed our package of measures, so, if the Labor Party were in government today, those transport operators would be paying 26c or 27c a litre more than they are currently paying.</para><para>That is a message that, regrettably, has not got out sufficiently. I was having a beer with a transport operator over the Christmas holidays, and he was complaining about paying almost 90c a litre for his fuel. I said to him, `But you get your GST back.' And he said, `Do I? I didn't understand that.' I said, `Not only that but you get back, through these other concessions that we have given, around another 18c a litre. He said, `I had heard something about that, but I haven't put in a return.' I was able to assure him that his fuel was not around 90c a litre, which was the fuel pump price; it was about 26c or 27c a litre cheaper. When he understood this, the next few shouts at the pub were all his! Regrettably, because our opponents have so mischievously tried to confuse the issue for very base political gain, a lot of people do not understand, and are not even applying for, the concessions to which they are entitled.</para><para>Under the Liberal and National parties, under the Howard government, these concessions have been made. I think more and more Australians are coming to understand that the excise is a flat rate of excise; it does not change with the price of fuel. I think they are also now understanding that the real reasons for those wild fluctuations in the price of fuel at the bowser have been the cost of fuel on the international market and also the variations in the exchange rate of the Australian dollar. They are the reasons that petrol prices are still too high. I agree with that; everyone agrees with that. But what a government can do about it is a different question. It is not the excise that is causing those prices; it is the international situation that has caused the variations. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>21776</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The bills that are before the House—the Excise Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001—and put up by the Australian Labor Party are bills which we can take some pride in. They address the hardship on families, the pressure thrust upon community and charity groups, and the difficulties and inconvenience being experienced by industry because of the Howard government's mean spirited fuel tax squeeze.</para></talk.start><para>This can be addressed by the passage of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001. The effect of the bill will give relief to millions of motorists from the 1 February 2001 indexation and rates of excise duty applying to petroleum. The bill will give much needed relief to people living in country areas. Labor has listened to the community through its committee going around the country; it is not a last-minute thought to try to get the country vote. We went out to the community to talk not to the hacks of the party but to a broad cross-section of community members, and many of those came forward happily to give evidence of the hardship that they face. It is a hardship brought about by the increasing price of petrol, particularly since the introduction of the GST. We have heard accounts of hardship from people like youth worker John Hackett of Port Augusta in South Australia. Mr Hackett told us:</para><quote><para>Due to limited job prospects and tertiary study facilities, within Port Augusta, many young people are forced to travel out of town to pursue their employment and education commitments.</para><para>This unfortunately is a fact of life for young people all across rural Australia.</para></quote><para>This was a young man experienced in working with youth throughout the country. He said:</para><quote><para>A substantial increase in petrol prices has put a great amount of stress on already strained budgets, particularly on those young people who depend Abstudy or Youth Allowance for economic survival.</para></quote><para>The young people that Mr Hackett was referring to do not have the luxury of an alternative means of travel; they need cars. There is no bus or train service linking Port Augusta and Whyalla, where there is a university campus. There is no bus or train service to the next major city of Port Pirie. We found that was a common situation throughout rural and regional Australia, and tertiary students cannot car pool because their lectures are generally at different times and on different days.</para><para>The President of the National Farmers Federation, Ian Donges, said of farmers and their disposable income:</para><quote><para>... obviously they have a great deal less disposable income as a result of high fuel prices.</para></quote><para>That comment was echoed right throughout the country as we were taking our evidence. It was not made by someone dragged up by the Labor Party. It was from someone who came forward to give evidence of what was affecting his constituency. Of course, if there is not the disposable income in the towns which have supported the rural communities for so long, they lose their services, they lose their infrastructure and, in turn, this places greater stress and hardship on those country communities. It is so bad that we see the football teams disintegrating because they cannot field a team. Mr Hackett and Mr Donges were addressing the same issue, but then we heard from yet another, from Wendy Bevan, Public Affairs Analyst for the Royal Automobile Association of South Australia—again, not a card-carrying member of the Labor Party. She had this to say:</para><quote><para>The level of fuel tax and particularly the treatment of excise under the new tax system is something the membership is particularly concerned about and, by the sheer volume of letters and phone calls, it has been abundantly clear that they want the RAA to act on their behalf on this issue.</para><para>These calls and letters have included requests for action, ranging from blockades, petitions, boycotts and street marches.</para></quote><para>Getting calls for blockades, boycotts, petitions and street marches is something you might expect to hear as a union secretary—as I was before coming here—from workers angry with their employer. But it is not something you expect to hear from organisations such as the RAA—a very conservative and very honourable organisation representing a large constituency. This shows that people from all walks of life right across Australia, people who are relying on their motor vehicles, are angry and they want something for it: they are asking for relief. The bill before us today is one mechanism for applying some of that relief.</para><para>We then looked for the effects this is having on the community. People taking kids to school and sporting commitments, people visiting friends and relatives, people dependent on fuel for going about their daily lives, are angry, and the anger is directed at the government and at the Prime Minister, who said that fuel prices would not rise following the introduction of the GST. It is not just the RAA who brought these things to our attention. All of the auto associations, like the NRMA and the RACV, are weighing into it. The Director of Research and Policy of the Australian Automobile Association, John Metcalfe, had this to say:</para><quote><para>AAA is particularly concerned about the impact of the GST on fuel prices, particularly since the direct effect of reducing excise and applying a GST to the retail price of petrol is to increase the gap between city and country petrol prices.</para></quote><para>Once again, we can see country people slugged for not living in a city. They get it worse, and the real effect comes out when you talk to country people. It is clearly demonstrated in a letter that was sent to the CEO of the South Australian Branch of the National Farmers Federation. The letter was from E. Teate, of Naracoorte in South Australia, who wrote:</para><quote><para>This is what we did in regional Australia to cope with the fuel prices before the latest fuel prices. We combined shopping and sporting trips wherever possible, we car pooled, mixed business with pleasure and rarely drove into town just for a social outing</para></quote><para>The letter went on:</para><quote><para>This is what we are doing to cope with the high fuel price we will pay in regional areas now. We are either giving up or not taking positions that are voluntary, such as kindergarten, school and sporting committees. We are giving notice that we will no longer be able to work in voluntary capacities in the community, e.g. coaching sport, helping in the school canteen and classrooms. We are dropping out of service-clubs and community organisations. We have given up being involved in sporting and leisure activities. We are limiting social activities and visits to see our family and friends.</para></quote><para>And that, in my submission, is something that needs to be considered: they are giving up visits to see their family and friends—the very core of our community. I was interested to hear the minister who spoke before me and the comments he made about on-farm use. Well, you are not paying that price; you are getting your fuel—unleaded petrol and diesel—cheaper. The problem is that, when families are going to sporting activities or visiting family and friends or going to the shops in town that are some considerable way away, it is not on farm. They are paying the price at the bowser; they are not getting it any cheaper. You hear stories like that of the Teates everywhere as you travel around the country. It is not restricted just to country people and people in regional centres. It is everywhere, and it is totally unfair.</para><para>The small rural and regional centres depend on volunteers for all aspects of their social structure and to keep their communities together. But this cruel increase in the cost of fuel, effective from 1 February this year, has squeezed the last drop of community spirit from many small rural centres across the country. People have had enough. It is unfair that these people are paying 98c, 99c or $1.01 as you travel across South Australia. It is unfair that they pay that price when in the city of Adelaide it is ranging from about 86c to 91c. And this was something that was going to be protected from a rise from the GST. But we have seen clearly that it was not protected. In a mean-spirited act by the government, people are now suffering and their communities are suffering with them. For so long, small rural and regional centres have depended on the volunteers for their ambulances, for their sporting facilities and for their social events—for all aspects of their social structure. That is what kept the communities together. But with this cruelness that is forced on them now—this squeeze at the petrol pump—this has all disappeared. Communities can no longer continue.</para><para>I would like to turn to something that hurts most Australians more than the increase itself. It is the effect on some organisations: the charity organisations, the churches, the voluntary groups and those who care for the disabled, the sick, the poor and the aged—this is where it hurts most—groups like Disabled People International, a voluntary group with no federal or state funding whatsoever. This group provides 200,000 vehicle trips each year for the sick and disabled in Whyalla, South Australia. They have a fleet of 14 purpose-built vehicles and they had a yearly fuel bill of between $13,000 and $14,000 before the introduction of the GST. With the GST, that fuel bill increased to $16,000. That was based on their monthly accounts. And the latest increase, they tell us, will make it go up to about $17,000 or $18,000. This is a group that is entirely dependent on community contribution and on fundraising that they can organise themselves. They have 14 vehicles that they pay for themselves and that they have to get modified at expense. When they take people to Port Augusta for dialysis treatment, no longer can they spend the remainder of the day going out to have a look around and a bit of sightseeing because they get no other outing in their time there. Twice a week, the vehicles still travel to Port Augusta to take these people and they have to pay the going rate for petrol. But Ken Wells, who runs DPI in Whyalla, has said that if petrol costs keep rising then DPI will have to further cut the services that they now provide. You cannot get dialysis treatment in Whyalla, so you go the 80 kilometres to Port Augusta. There are no bus services, unless you go at four or seven in the morning and then wait until about nine or 10 at night to come home again. DPI take them. They take the old people out for day trips to give them somewhere to go and to keep some community spirit with them. This is where it really hurts and it is this mean squeezing on charities by forcing them to have to pay these unbearable costs that has really been demonstrated by the Labor Party's inquiry. Ray Hartigan of St Vincent de Paul in Adelaide said:</para><quote><para>We've got more isolated elderly and isolated people than we've ever had before in our society. How do you get to them? Some of the organisations—</para></quote><para>he is talking about other charitable organisations—</para><quote><para>... are telling me, `We don't visit, we use the telephone to talk to them—it's cheaper.'</para></quote><para>And it is cheaper because they can no longer afford to run the cars out to visit these people, so the old, the sick and the frail simply get a phone call. That is a damning account, in my view, and it is a reflection on the meanness of the government of the day that they can do this.</para><para>These are real accounts from real people who care for others, for people who are suffering as a result of the squeeze put on them by the latest increase in fuel charges. It is for that reason that it is an honour to stand here today and speak in support of the bills before us, which has been designed to provide much needed relief for those people suffering as a result of the higher costs brought about by the 1 February fuel increases. I suggest to you that they are worthy of the full support of the Senate. I commend the bills to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>21779</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001. This is a debate not simply about high fuel costs—because that is a concern for the government—but about Labor's credibility. We have listened with interest to Senator Buckland's chapter of woes as he travelled around the country as part of Labor's complaints forum. I am sure we have all heard and are concerned about many of the stories that he told. But the real cost to regional Australia was imposed by 13 years of Labor through high inflation, high interest rates, the cost price squeeze, high taxes, bracket creep and many other aspects of the Labor government's history, which we are easily reminded of and very conscious of with the prospect of Labor getting another chance to be in government.</para></talk.start><para>Labor lack complete credibility in this debate. Labor are in a state of confusion and denial on the issue of petrol taxation. They are telling the government that we should cut petrol excise, but they refuse to commit to an excise cut as Labor Party policy. This morning Treasurer Costello said, `They want us to do in government what they would not do.' This is the height of policy laziness, and it is simple humbug. This is policy schizophrenia, and it just rattles. It has no credibility. I got some simple amusement in reading Senator Cook's introduction to this Labor legislation. I do not normally read what Senator Cook says, but I did on this occasion. He said this legislation was `to provide relief from the 1 February 2001 indexation of rates of excise duty applying to petroleum'. But on Melbourne radio on Monday, Mr Beazley confirmed not once but several times that Labor have no intention of changing the fuel tax regime if, by some misfortune for Australia, they get into power. Mr Beazley was interviewed by Mr Neil Mitchell on 3AW. Mr Mitchell asked Mr Beazley:</para><quote><para>MITCHELL: Would you look at ... is it possible you'd look at taking the GST off petrol?</para><para>BEAZLEY: I don't think that we can give that contemplation.</para><para>MITCHELL: All right. But you might look at taking the excise off?</para><para>BEAZLEY: ... nor the excise for that matter ...</para><para>MITCHELL: But sorry, I must have misunderstood—</para></quote><para>I guess he was not alone amongst his listeners in misunderstanding—</para><quote><para>Would you consider taking the excise off petrol?</para><para>BEAZLEY: If you took the excise off petrol, what particular schools would you start to shut?</para></quote><para>Mr Mitchell kept returning to the issue. He said:</para><quote><para>MITCHELL: I just want to get clear. You'd keep the excise.</para><para>BEAZLEY: We'd keep the excise ...</para></quote><para>Mr Mitchell asked:</para><quote><para>MITCHELL: Will you reduce the percentage take?</para><para>BEAZLEY: You are asking me to announce in advance the policy that we'll put forward during the course of the next election campaign.</para><para>MITCHELL: It is the principle.</para></quote><para>Mr Beazley did not answer. His minders, by this stage, were pulling their hair out. To put this debate in perspective, the indexation of excise in line with the CPI occurs automatically every February and every August under legislation introduced by the Labor government in 1983. I have some figures here which indicate the increases from 1983 to 1996. Fuel excise increased from 6.155c per litre in 1983 to 34.183c per litre in February 1996, just before we came into government. There had been over a 28 per cent increase—a 10.1c per litre increase based on budget increases. The indexation component, the part that Labor want to abolish with this legislation, was 13.234c per litre. So we saw an increase in excise of over 550 per cent in Labor's 13 years of government.</para><para>People should be very aware of that fact. Labor introduced this tax and made an absolute welter of it. I often thought that, in the time they were in government, when you saw a petrol station with a Shell sign or an Ampol sign, it should have had the smiling face of the then Treasurer Mr Keating beaming down at you. Labor made every petrol station in this country an absolute milch cow for their big spending promises. After all, when they did leave government, they left us with about $60 billion worth of public debt. In fact, their last budget left us with a $10 billion black hole—the Beazley black hole. Let us not forget the wonderful symbolism of the leader of the Labor Party, who was the Minister for Finance at that time.</para><para>Excise is indexed because, unlike value taxes—such as income tax, where increases in wages automatically increase tax revenues—excise is a volumetric tax. This means that the excise is levied on a flat per litre basis or, in the case of tobacco, per stick. Indexation of excise is necessary to ensure that the real value of the excise keeps pace with the cost of living and does not decline over time. While the government indexes excise, it also indexes pensions and other government payments. For every additional dollar of revenue raised through the indexing of excise, around $2.40 is paid out through higher pensions.</para><para>The indexation of excise was the Labor Party's policy. Labor introduced it, Labor implemented it and Labor still support it—in fact, Labor increased petrol tax through indexation on 23 separate occasions when they were in power. In addition, Labor increased petrol excise as a budget measure on five occasions, adding around 10c in additional petrol excise. Because Labor ran a high inflation economic policy, indexation averaged 5.2 per cent annually under Labor, compared with only 2.1 per cent under our low inflation management of the economy. Last Thursday, under Labor's legislation, excise was indexed by the combined effect of the September and December CPI inflation index, which was four per cent. This amounted to an adjustment of excise on unleaded petrol of 1.525c.</para><para>It is important to put down Labor's indexation record. Of Labor's 23 increases in excise through indexation, seven of those were equal to or greater than last week's four per cent. In August 1983 it was 4.3 per cent, in February 1984 it was 4.1 per cent, in February 1986 it was 4.3 per cent, in August 1986 it was four per cent, in February 1987 it was 5.6 per cent, in February 1989 it was four per cent and in February 1990 it was 4.2 per cent. Labor's February 1987 indexation of 5.6 per cent added 1.1c per litre to the price of fuel—an amount equivalent to 1.78c per litre in today's terms. Labor never granted relief to motorists for their high inflation economic management, and I am sure that they would not do it now.</para><para>Excise on petrol does not increase when petrol prices increase. Excise rates change only through indexation. Excise indexation is factored into the budget—clearly, it is—and it is therefore not a windfall to budget revenue. Any additional GST from higher petrol prices goes to the states. Every cent of additional GST—if there is any—from higher petrol prices goes to the states. The state governments are the beneficiaries, not the federal government. The economic management that they can bring to bear through having that certainty in income is very important to their programs. Senator Sherry, who is now in the chair, made the point that petroleum resource rent tax was a windfall to both companies and the government. The petroleum resource rent tax is not a component of the price of petrol; rather, it is a form of super company tax. It is also subject to a wide variety of factors, including exploration costs of companies subject to that particular resource rent tax.</para><para>I want to say something about the real reason for the high fuel costs but, before I do, I would like to conclude by saying that Labor's policy on petrol seems to be complete and utter humbug. There is no change to the GST on petrol, there is no change to the excise on petrol, there is no change to the indexation of excise on petrol and there is no change to February's indexation. Labor are policy lazy with no ticker and no principles. I do not know how they think they can get away with this sort of humbug when all the commentators, all the motorists and anybody who takes an interest in these matters can see through it—and so they should.</para><para>The real reason for the recent increase in fuel prices is the high cost of crude oil. In the last two years, the price of crude has trebled while the Australian dollar has remained relatively weak against the US dollar. Neither the government nor the opposition can change that. A decision by OPEC, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries—whose members produce about 40 per cent of world crude—early in 1999 to reduce the output despite high demand was the catalyst for the rise in fuel prices. Fortunately, these prices appear to have peaked and, hopefully, they are on their way down. Crude oil producing countries are the main beneficiaries of the rise in prices while consumers worldwide are the losers. I understand that all politics is local, but it is sobering to look at the prices that some of our world competitors and comparable nations pay for fuel. I do not propose to go through those now but I just mention that, in the United Kingdom, the price of petrol per litre peaked at around $A2.80.</para><para>Contrary to popular belief, the coalition has not increased the rate of excise since coming to office five years ago. The rate is the same, it is a flat rate and it does not increase as the price of petrol increases. Excise goes up only with indexation, something introduced by the Labor Party, who continue to bleat about the fact that it is going up by just over 1.5c per litre without saying where they would make cuts in expenditure and without promoting anything like our very substantial road package of $1.6 billion, the Roads to Recovery Program, announced last year.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name></talker><para>—Over how many years?

Coming from Queensland, you will be painfully aware of the need for expenditure on rural roads. The government's new tax system gives significant priority to reducing the cost of transport—something which is so important to regional areas. Excise reduction, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and the reduction of diesel excise on transport, together with the reformed tax system, meant the price of petrol need not rise due to the GST. The fact is that petrol prices fluctuate in response to both world crude oil prices and the exchange rate and the level of competitive retail activity in the local market. With the strength of the US dollar and oil at around $30 a barrel for crude, fuel prices will stay high in the short term, but there is some evidence that they will come off in the not too distant future.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Howard-Anderson government was the first government to reduce the fuel excise—by 6.7c a litre, equating to $2.2 billion—and it introduced other initiatives which further reduced the cost of fuel so that the introduction of the GST would not raise fuel prices. These initiatives include the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme for targeting rural and remote areas, which is worth $500 million over four years; the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme; and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. Through these initiatives, businesses are now able to claim fuel costs back. More importantly, under the new tax system, the cost of petrol has fallen by around 10c for registered businesses, where the GST on petrol can be claimed as an input tax credit. Labor voted against the tax input credit initiatives, against the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme, against the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme and against the abolition of the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on motor vehicles, tyres, and parts and accessories. All these were beneficial to motorists, especially those who live in rural and regional areas.</para><para>The coalition has continued indexation in line with the consumer price index, a policy that was introduced by Labor in 1983. As indexation is linked to the CPI to reflect the cost of living, the petrol excise increased far more under Labor, at an average of 5.2 per cent inflation between 1983 and 1996, than it has under the coalition, at a rate of 1.4 per cent inflation between 1996 and 2000. In dollar terms, petrol excise under Labor rose from 6.155c per litre to 34.183c per litre; I repeat, from 6c to 34c—a total increase of 550 per cent.</para><para>There have been calls on the government to cut the excise rate or to freeze indexation, but in order to balance the budget the government would have had to either raise other taxes to offset the revenue loss or reduce spending. Cutting the excise would not make a significant difference to prices at the bowser and would continue to undermine the budget surplus which could trigger higher interest rates, which is much more damaging to mortgage repayments and business. The announcement yesterday of the half a per cent fall in interest rates is very good news not only for Australian mortgage payers but particularly for primary industry, because the total interest bill for Australian primary industry is a staggering $2 billion per annum. Reducing the borrowing cost by half a per cent is worth a cool $50 million to Australian primary producers. That is a very, very nice reduction, and there is some encouragement and hope that further interest rate cuts may be forthcoming.</para><para>It would be economically unwise for the Howard-Anderson government to take $1.7 billion out of the budget surplus to fund a 1.5c a litre reduction in petrol excise. Like pensions, the fuel excise rates were fully indexed last week. There are always two sides to a coin. The fuel excise rose last week and so did pensions, and I do not hear—nor would I expect to hear—a call for a freeze on pensions. The bottom line is that the government does not benefit from higher prices as the excise rate remains the same. It does not receive extra excise when the price of petrol is high, nor does it receive any windfall in GST revenue as a result of rising petrol prices, because the GST is directed to the states. Country prices are more expensive due to higher freight costs, lower site volume throughput, less diversity of revenue sources, higher retail margins, lower levels of competition and regular and sometimes deep price discounting in capital cities. They all widen the difference between city and country prices. </para><para>I do not want to finish my contribution to this debate without making the point that we on this side are very concerned about high fuel prices. Nothing is more important to us for regional Australia. Regional Australians do not have a choice in transport. They do not have public transport. They have to visit their local centre for their children's education, for their children's needs and their many educational requirements and to visit the doctor. Nothing is more certain than the fact that we are concerned about high fuel prices. But high fuel prices are not caused by indexation; they are caused by a reasonably weak Australian dollar but most of all by high and unacceptable crude oil prices. Also, you only have to see the differential in prices in large country centres that I attend. For instance, in Tamworth, a city of 50,000 people, even on one day you will see a difference of between 5c and 6c a litre between petrol stations. Clearly, many factors apply to petrol prices, and indexation is only one. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>21783</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am starting to detect a bit of a theme here in relation to coalition contributions to the Excise Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001, not in terms of the points which are made—which are obviously quite valid and appropriate—but in terms of the same words being used over and over again.

I am sure that is correct. One thing that this bill has done is flush out Senator Ian Macdonald, who made a contribution earlier, and I will address my introductory comments to his contribution, because certain things need to be corrected. </para></talk.start></continue><para>First of all, Senator Ian Macdonald talked a lot about excise and told us, as has Senator Sandy Macdonald, that Labor introduced it, which we are not resiling from. He then went on to give us a big lecture about how great it is and what a terrific thing excise is—and what a sterling defence of the excise system it was! He then cited as an example, in relation to his own portfolio, the indexation of financial assistance grants to local government. They are influenced by the CPI as well: the financial assistance grants go up when the CPI and the two other escalation factors go up. What he failed to mention was that his government froze those escalation factors, reducing financial assistance grants in the first Costello budget by $15 million, and never put the money back in. Now local government is, at a minimum, about $62 million to $63 million out of pocket because of these freezes. </para><para>I think the point that needs to be made here is that Senator Macdonald supports refreezing revenue to local government but he will not freeze the excise on petrol. What is the similarity there—more money to what? Senator Sherry indicated, very ably, that this is a very high taxing government and probably the highest taxing government we have ever seen in Australia. Senator Macdonald did not mention the GST on petrol once. That is a bit odd, considering that he would be the last person standing who does not think that the GST has had an impact on petrol prices. Even the Treasurer, Mr Costello, has finally fessed up that the excise increases were largely due to the factor of the GST. It took a long time, but even he has managed to confess to it.</para><para>Let us have a look at this issue of the GST revenue going to the states. That is a matter that was covered by both Senator Macdonalds in relation to the GST being a supposed growth tax. Let me take the Senator Macdonalds, plural, through what the situation is in regard to the GST. The coalition government signed an intergovernmental agreement on the GST and the ANTS package. This means there is a transition period within which there is no increase in revenue to the states; it is status quo. The timing of that transition period varies from state to state. In Queensland, for example, it is about two to three years before that state starts to go into the black in relation to GST revenue. In Senator McGauran's home state of Victoria, Senator Lightfoot's home state and our home state, Mr Acting Deputy President Sherry, of Tasmania, it is around six to seven years before the revenue starts increasing. In that interregnum it is the status quo. There is no increase in revenue to the states, so it is an absolute furphy to say there is. Further, the windfall—which we are trying to get information on and which the government will not provide, but which variously has been estimated at around $1.5-odd billion—goes directly to the Commonwealth, not the states. Let us try to get some kind of fiscal rectitude in relation to this debate. Let us try and get some issues on the table.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—Excuse me!

Why is this bill here in the first place? This bill is here because the coalition government—or, as Senator Ian Macdonald now likes to call it, the Liberal-National government, probably because he cannot bring himself to utter the word `coalition' these days—broke its promise. That is why it is here. It is not some fantasy that the Labor Party has dreamed up. The Labor Party is here making this government accountable in relation to a promise the Prime Minister made that petrol would not be more expensive as a result of the GST. Of course, there is not one person left in this country who does not admit that petrol is more expensive as a result of the GST. All we can assume is that it was yet another non-core promise, yet another broken promise, from the Liberal-National government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to reiterate some points that have been made. The objective of this bill is to provide some relief in terms of the 1 February indexation, particularly because of the impact that it is having on regional and rural communities. I note Senator Buckland's contribution. I would like to talk particularly about those members of the Liberal-National government who are heroes at home but cowards in Canberra on petrol prices. I refer to what was described yesterday or the day before as the dirty dozen. It is the dirty baker's dozen now that there has been another one: there are 13 of them, and 13 is an unlucky number, particularly for the coalition. </para><para>This bill is good policy. It fixes the problem but it does not make any unfounded assumptions about what should or should not be done in the future. We have a very clear position on excise. I have talked about it before. We appreciate the resounding endorsement we got from Senator Ian Macdonald in relation to the excise system, and that is no great secret. What the government has not done, though, is highlight the at least eight times that we either froze or reduced the excise during our 13 years in government. Strangely enough, the excise system which a number of speakers from the coalition have repudiated was not touched in the biggest overhaul of the tax system in Australia. If it is so appalling, why on earth wasn't it changed in relation to excise? I do not think one coalition speaker has really touched on the issue of the GST either. So let us have no more contributions on that.</para><para>This is a tax on distance. It is a tax that penalises those who fill their cars up more often, travel further and do not have access to public transport. It is a penalty for all those people who live in rural and regional Australia, where petrol prices are higher and the tax grab is greater. No wonder this government is developing a reputation for looking after only the big end of town. It is no surprise that the government cannot stomach a situation of returning and freezing it because it would, therefore, be a clear admission that it made a promise which it has broken. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>21785</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>21785</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to government documents were considered:</para><quote><para>Australian Tourist Commission—Report for 1999-2000.

At the outset, I am absolutely delighted with this initiative. Backing Australia's Ability is about rejuvenating existing industries and creating in Australia the industries of the future. It is about Australia's benefiting from our own good ideas and being the place to work, with an injection of $2.9 billion over the next five years. It will build on a record level of spending by the government on innovation and related activities, with $4½ billion this year.</para></talk.start><para>Six years ago I chaired a Senate inquiry into research in universities. That inquiry made a series of recommendations across the very wide range of research that occurs in universities. The main recommendation was that most of these categories of research should have their funding increased. I am absolutely delighted that the federal government's Backing Australia's Ability, with funding of $2.9 billion, delivers on virtually every recommendation of that report. I was particularly delighted to see the increase in funding to the Australian Research Council, the ARC. These are very competitive major projects across all universities.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name></talker><para>—The CSIRO didn't get any.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—The CSIRO is an excellent institution.

The ARC has had an additional $736 million. This has doubled the success rate. I expect Senator Crossin to get up and praise the government for doing that—for delivering a massive boost to spending on research on top-grade projects. What our Senate inquiry found five years ago was that about 17 per cent of these projects were being funded, but you could have funded about 33 per cent. We judged 33 per cent as being excellent first-class projects. Under Labor they languished and reduced. They were not funded.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the disappointing things about that is that university researchers who have put a lot of work into these submissions and get rejected over and again tend to give up. So there is a knock-on effect from that lack of funding. In one hit, we have doubled that funding. The effect of that is to double the number of projects, and I think that is about right. The endorsement of that is from the chair of the ARC, Professor Vicki Sara, who had this to say in her media release on 29 January 2001: </para><quote><para>The Government is sending a clear message to our best and brightest researchers that their ideas and skills are crucial to innovation and therefore Australia's future. It provides strong and appropriate incentives and increased opportunities to not only stop the so-called "brain drain" but reverse it. It sets out a vision and a pathway for the best researchers and most promising young minds to develop their ideas in Australia.</para></quote><para>Of course, this has been a major problem. The academics out there are applauding this. Their very best will now have the opportunity to stay because they will get funding under this scheme. Under the Backing Australia's Ability policy there will be an additional $176 million for world-class centres of excellence in universities. This is particularly in the key areas of information and communications technologies and biotechnology. These are the fields that are going to drive the future of the Australian economy. Again, Professor Sara wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian,</inline> commenting on and praising this initiative. She said:</para><quote><para>The Government's plan, I believe, will lead to Australia being a world leader in several fields, such as biotechnology, genomics, biodiversity and quantum computing. New businesses and exciting and fulfilling jobs for our young people in these high technology sectors will emerge and grow.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>It has set out a vision and a pathway for our best researchers and most promising young minds to develop their ideas in Australia.</para></quote><para>Also under Backing Australia's Ability is the continuation of the research and development Start Program, with funding of $535 million. This has been set up in a way that has very cleverly got around the problem that existed in Labor's previous scheme. Labor had set up a scheme which was being extensively rorted by unscrupulous people. We quite rightly scrubbed that when we came into government. To get the special tax concession under this scheme there is an employment criterion that goes with it, and this should cut out the previous rorting that existed under Labor's scheme up until 1996. We are selectively delivering the 175 per cent tax concession so that the money is spent on real research. Professor Simon Marginson, from the Monash Centre for Research into International Education, said on radio 3LO on 29 January:</para><quote><para>The Government announcement picks up a major area, which is scientific research and, in particular, its application to industry, and will stimulate industry research and development I'm sure.</para></quote><para>Of course, this has been one of the big downsides in research in Australia for a very long time—the lack of research by industry by international comparisons. What this does is deliver research and development very strategically and in a very focused way—that is, money comes in from industry and goes out in new product and services. This also applies to another area of research that has received a massive boost under the Backing Australia's Ability $2.9 billion program—that is, the expansion of the cooperative research centres, with an additional $277 million encouraging greater access by small and medium sized enterprises. The CRCs are actually one of the best research tools ever developed in this country because they require a financial contribution and a research contribution by both industry and universities working in partnership. I have seen a number of these in operation. I am thinking particularly of the CRC in beef in the New England district. One of the things they do through scientific testing, programming and proper feeding is deliver the type of beef that is preferable to the Japanese palette. They actually have designer beef. It is cut, frozen and delivered by jumbo jet directly into Japan. This has all come about because of a CRC.</para><para>Another brilliant one is the Photonics Centre, which is in Sydney. I have visited this place on three occasions. In 1994 they were in a basement of the medical school at the university, producing high-density optic fibre, world leading optic fibre, for computer networks. When I saw them three years later, they were in a research park at the University of Sydney. When I spoke to them at a dinner recently, I found out that a lot of it has been spun off into private companies and a lot of those academics at the university have gone with those companies, and a number of them are now millionaires out of the processes they have developed. This is a new way, and a new wave, of business innovation in Australia. It has been backed by this government with an additional $277 million. So you will find that things like the Photonics Centre will expand into the future.</para><para>Mark Paterson, who is the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was quoted in his media release on 29 January in response to the Backing Australia's Ability program as saying:</para><quote><para>... this `whole of government' innovation strategy is endorsed. In its implementation, Government has committed itself to a partnership approach with the business and education sectors as strong linkages between all players in the innovation system are fundamental to obtaining maximum value for Australia from the public and private funds that are currently, and proposed to be, invested in innovation activities.</para></quote><para>So there we have extra government funding of $2.9 billion across a very wide range of types of research. This will increase the amount of research and development in Australia. It will move a whole range of new products out from laboratories and into the marketplace and indeed help Australia become an innovative economy as we move into the 21st century.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centenary of Federation: Northern Territory</title><page.no>21790</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>21790</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to give the people of this country a bit of a glimpse of what we will be doing in the Northern Territory to celebrate the Centenary of Federation. Events will occur between 17 and 19 February commemorating the bombing of Darwin. Federation Frontline Month commemorates the special role that the Northern Territory played in the front-line defence of Australia during the Second World War. The highlight of this month will be a number of special events held from 17 to 19 February to commemorate the bombing of Darwin, which was the first attack by a foreign nation on Australian soil since European colonisation. These events will involve the participation of a number of survivors from the first bombings, RAAF personnel, Tiwi Islanders performing a particular dance—the aeroplane dance, I understand—a RAAF fly past and a 21-gun salute. Sirens will sound at 9.58 a.m. Central Standard Time on 19 February to remind Australians of the air-raid warning sirens that sounded at that time on that day on that fatal morning 59 years ago. This ceremony will then be followed by a laying of wreaths at Stokes Hill wharf in memory of those Darwin wharfies who were killed during the bombing. The people of Australia will join with the people of Darwin to commemorate the bombing of Darwin. It will be a day of national commemoration, shown live on ABC television, remembering all those who died or were injured in an event that played a crucial role in making Darwin and the Northern Territory what they are today. The bombing of Darwin commemorative event is designed to leave a lasting legacy of knowledge for the Australian people, many of whom either have forgotten or do not know about the bombing of Darwin. This event will place the bombing of Darwin in the nation's memory.</para></talk.start><para>I would now like to provide some background on what happened on that fateful day, 19 February 1942. It was, by all accounts, a typical Darwin wet season morning when the air-raid sirens sounded, giving a belated warning to the residents of Darwin of an imminent air attack by Japanese forces. While it was not totally unexpected, Darwin was ill prepared for what was to occur. Singapore had fallen just four days earlier. The 188 Japanese dive-bombers and zero-fighter planes involved in the raids on Darwin were launched from four Japanese aircraft carriers in the Timor Sea. The attack itself was planned and led by the same commander responsible for the infamous attack on Pearl Harbour 10 weeks earlier. Early on the morning of 19 February 1942 the Japanese aircraft had passed over Bathurst Island, flying in formation—Bathurst Island being some 15 minutesflying time north of Darwin. The Catholic missionaries there radioed Darwin, warning them of the attack. However, people in Darwin believed that the missionaries were mistaken and the RAAF failed to act on the advice from the missionaries. As the bombers began their run over the city, much of Darwin's population went out to watch, thinking that the planes were American. How quickly they found out how mistaken they were.</para><para>In that first wave of bombings, Darwin's police barracks, police station and the government office attached were destroyed, as was the post office, the telegraph office, the cable office and the postmaster's residence. The main damage, however, was in the harbour, where a number of a Australian troopships had been sunk along with the American destroyer the <inline font-style="italic">USS Peary</inline> and a number of cargo vessels. Eight ships were sunk, two were breached and later refloated, and many of the other 35 ships in the harbour were damaged by bomb or machine-gun fire. On the Darwin harbour wharves, over 30 wharfies were killed carrying out rescue work in the face of continual bombing and strafing. The second bombing attack on that day concentrated on the RAAF airfield at Parap, doing serious damage to the airfield and planes. </para><para>A subsequent royal commission determined that at least 243 people died in the bombings and hundreds of others were injured. However, recently, these figures have been significantly revised upwards, with some claiming that the real number was more likely in the thousands. In reality, we probably will never know how many people actually lost their lives in those first attacks. As a result of the two attacks on that day, Darwin was left almost completely destroyed. These were the most serious of the 64 air raids on the Top End which continued until 12 November 1943. At that time it was determined by the authorities that the national interest dictated that the scale and severity of the attacks should not be publicised. As a result, the history of the war years and the loss of life in Darwin during that time have largely gone unrecognised. It is now time to rectify that situation. </para><para>One of the highlights of Federation Frontline Month will be the display at Parliament House in the Northern Territory of the bullet-torn flag which flew over Government House in Darwin on the morning of 19 February 1942. It was the first Australian flag to receive enemy fire on Australian soil during World War II. In his book, <inline font-style="italic">Australia's Pearl Harbour—Darwin 1942</inline>, Douglas Lockwood describes the attack on the Australian ensign which happened during the bombing of Government House. He says:</para><quote><para>Fighter pilots machine gunning men on the ships and in the water became aware that the Australian blue ensign was flying from the flagstaff on the lawn of Government House. This appeared to infuriate them and they fired at it continuously in an attempt to shoot it down. But while riddled with bullet holes (the large star was completely shot away) the flag continued to fly. The administrator, Charles Abbott realised that this was the first flag damaged by enemy action on Australian soil and as such had historical significance. Another was found for the flagstaff; the damaged one was lowered and has since been preserved in the War Memorial at Canberra. On the day peace was celebrated the flag flew behind the then Governor General, then the Duke of Gloucester.</para></quote><para>Since the end of the Second World War that flag has been on display at the Australian War Memorial here in Canberra. It recently travelled to the Northern Territory and is on display in the Territory at the moment. It has been suggested that it would be more appropriate for the flag to return permanently to Darwin. I support those sentiments and I call on the Northern Territory government to start negotiations with the federal government for the permanent return of the flag from whence it came. I pledge, Territorians, to do whatever I can to assist the Northern Territory government in this endeavour. I believe it is significant and important and a piece of the Northern Territory's heritage. Yes, there is an acceptance that perhaps it is a significant reminder of what happened to all Australians during that time, but I think in this month when we commemorate the bombing of Darwin, as a sign of recognition for what Darwin endured during those times, it would be fit and proper for that flag to be returned to the Northern Territory and displayed there.</para><para>Darwin today is a confident and outward looking multicultural city with a population of over 100,000 in its immediate and surrounding environment. It is somewhat ironic that the bombing of Darwin in many ways actually put Darwin on the map. It resulted in the construction of much physical infrastructure that has allowed the Territory to develop to what it is today. It also highlighted to our policy makers Darwin's strategic importance, leading to further major infrastructure development in the 1970s. Darwin's importance was again reflected in the Hawke Labor government's decision to relocate the bulk of Australia's ADF forces to the Top End of Australia. As a result the Australian Defence Force is now an integral part of our Top End community. Darwin's role during the East Timor peacekeeping exercise showed again how pivotal that city is in relation to linking the rest of this country with what happens in South-East Asia. The Federation bombing celebrations will commemorate those Australian and overseas military personnel and civilians who lost their lives in the attacks and in their defence of Australia. They also celebrate the fact that we have enjoyed peace for most of that time, allowing for the ongoing development of the Northern Territory. We should not forget the sacrifices of those people killed in the bombing of Darwin, nor the over 100,000 young men and women who were involved in the frontline defence of Australia during those dark days. I also want to pay tribute to the indigenous and Chinese population, all of whom played an important role in the ensuing conflict and in the redevelopment of Darwin and the Northern Territory. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Liquefied Natural Gas: Proposed Shell Takeover of Woodside</title><title>Fuel Excise</title><page.no>21792</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Fuel Excise</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>21792</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I want to make some comments about the proposed Shell takeover of Woodside. I make these comments as a Western Australian senator, of course, and as a senator who is very much aware of the contribution that Woodside and the LNG industry have made to the economy of Australia. The argument is essentially who gets control of Australia's LNG industry. It is the most profitable business Australia has ever seen and could one day generate nearly 10 per cent of the country's export income. I think it is a shame that if this takeover proceeds our LNG industry will essentially be run from Europe and not from Australia. I do not believe that is in the national interest. I know that the FIRB is currently considering this and has requested more time to consider it further, and that ultimately the government will have to decide whether or not it is contrary to the national interest for such a takeover to proceed. It would be absolutely and utterly neglectful of me, in terms of my representation of my state, not to voice an opinion that I believe that it would not be in the national interest, to say nothing of it not being in Western Australia's interest, if this takeover was to proceed.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6E4</name.id><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator Tambling</name></talker><para>—The Northern Territory is the same.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>—Exactly, Senator Tambling, the Northern Territory is the same. I think we are very careful about the way in which we try to develop these projects, and we are very proud of the way in which the companies have progressed them over the years. It needs to be remembered that LNG demand has grown 350 per cent since 1980, to 92 million tonnes a year. Presumably the Kyoto protocol means that LNG demand growth over the next two decades could be almost as stunning as it has been for the last two decades, if not more so. It has been estimated that the annual seaborne LNG trade would reach between 160 million tonnes and 210 million tonnes by 2020. Today the Woodside managed North West Shelf gas project exports around 7.6 million tonnes of LNG, an 8.3 per cent market share. There is a good chance that Woodside managed LNG exports could double or treble in this time, in which case Woodside could be worth considerably more than it is today.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With any of these takeover bids, I always worry about the staffing levels. I always worry about the content and of course the return to Australia. As I said, the Foreign Investment Review Board asked for more time to consider the bid, I think it was the week before last, which has certainly reinvigorated the debate, to say nothing else. The $12 billion North West Shelf project has a pull on the national consciousness that makes it very different from other takeover bids and some of the more contentious recent takeovers. It is a symbol of our ability to compete in the wider world. I do not think there are too many people in Australia who are not conscious in some way of the outstanding work that has been done by Woodside over many years and the way in which that has contributed to the national economy. There is a question of where Australia's national interest transcends the concept of globalisation. I think this is the classic example. I think that success for Shell would mean that Australia's only world scale energy development would be seen to be passing into foreign ownership and control. There are few I know who would say that that is in fact in the national interest. I wish to put those comments on the record tonight, and as a member of the government I do hope that the government looks wisely at this. I know that it will be considering very much the national interest.</para><para>The other issue that I would like to talk about tonight, as debate expired this afternoon on the particular issue, is the question of the Labor Party's record on fuel taxes. I have been very concerned over recent months with the hyperbole that has been coming out of the Labor Party and in particular the leadership of the Labor Party about the issue of fuel taxes and the impact of the goods and services tax, but more particularly the question of excise and the freezing of excise. I would not mind if the Labor Party came to this debate with clean hands and did not have a record that is just absolutely immaculate in setting taxes, increasing taxes and maintaining taxes, and doing it by sleight of hand while at the same time promising to reduce them!</para><para>Firstly, it is important that the people of Australia realise that Mr Beazley has given a commitment to keep the goods and services tax. Secondly, he has given a commitment not to abolish excise. Therefore, I want to look at the Labor Party record as to what they did when they were in office. It needs to be remembered that Mr Beazley was a senior minister in that government. When Labor came to office in 1983, petrol excise was 6.155c per litre. When it left office, petrol excise was 34.83c per litre. That is a mere increase of over 28c per litre or 450 per cent in their term of office! This is coming from a party who says that there should be a freeze on excise.</para><para>Labor introduced excise indexation in August 1983: the first year they were in government. As indexation is linked to the CPI, petrol excise increased far more under Labor—an average of 5.2 per cent inflation between 1983 and 1996—than it has under the coalition—an average of 2.1 per cent in the four years of the coalition government. That is 5.2 per cent as opposed to 2.1 per cent. Since coming to office in 1996, the coalition has never increased petrol excise as a budget measure, continuing the usual indexation in line with CPI. By contrast, on five occasions the Labor Party legislated to increase the petrol excise over and above the inflation adjustment. These increases amounted to 10c per litre, with 5c of that—7c for leaded fuel—announced in their infamous 1993 tax hike budget, after promising in the election that there would be no increases in tax and that the personal income tax cuts were l-a-w. So they abolished the l-a-w personal income tax cuts and increased these. Not once did the Labor Party compensate motorists for their CPI indexation or their discretionary increases in fuel excise. Labor's 1993 petrol tax hike raised an extra $4.1 billion in three years, or $3.7 million per day. You can probably understand why I am so annoyed at the way in which the media keep on faithfully reporting this nonsense coming out of the Labor Party when their track record shows that they are the party that not only introduced excise but also increased it and are not going to abolish it or freeze it.</para><para>Labor's discretionary budget increases of around 10c per litre are equivalent to 25 per cent of today's excise rates. The coalition government's fuel tax was even more generous in the original tax package, but guess what? Labor opposed them, and they were further watered down by the Democrats. The tax cuts for fuel would have been greater had it not been for the Labor Party. How can the Labor Party now come in here and say that there should have been more? They had their opportunity; they could have voted for it, but they did not. They just voted against everything and against the goods and services tax. They are now trying to pretend that they are still opposed to a goods and services tax, while giving a commitment within their own ranks, saying, `We will not abolish it.'</para><para>I think it is very important that the people of Australia are not conned any longer by the Labor Party, who are the makers and breakers of all these issues. They just keep on increasing the taxes when in government and then trying to create an impression when in opposition that they will abolish them. They will do no such thing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dairy Industry: Deregulation</title><page.no>21794</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>21794</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This afternoon there was a debate to take note of the government's response to the report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee,<inline font-style="italic"> Deregulation of the Australian Dairy Industry</inline>. Because of the amount of business that was on this afternoon, that debate was interrupted by the commencement of general business at 4.30. This evening, I want to highlight the quite outrageous position that dairy farmers in this country are being faced with. I would like people to recall that this government has been suggesting that the opposition is policy lazy.</para></talk.start><para>The dairy industry is a major export industry in this country. A lot of people who make their living from the dairy industry are, in many respects, the cornerstones of regional communities. There was a report prepared by the committee, of which I am a member, which involved taking evidence right around Australia from organisations that represent dairy farmers and regional communities, from organisations that are involved in competition policy, from government bodies, from the city, from the country—a whole range of people. I think there were 106 submissions presented to the committee. The evidence was about the problems that the industry faced, the problems that particular regions would face and the issues and the pressures that the committee felt would ultimately lead to deregulation by any means.</para><para>One thing that the report did highlight, that the government has chosen not to deal with in its response, was the fact that when the Howard government took office in 1993 it knew that the Domestic Market Support Scheme would end—and that it would end on 1 July 2000. It knew that. Did it take any steps to change that? No. It had the means to seek to extend the Domestic Market Support Scheme, but it did not want to do that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—It was the Kerin plan.

The reality was that whilst that scheme continued there was going to be a continuation of regulation in the white milk or market milk states. The government knew this; the report is very clear. This is a unanimous report of the committee, which I understood Senator McGauran participated in. The government knew this, but the government decided that it would do nothing. So the industry, as the government now admits, brought forward a plan to say, `The Domestic Market Support Scheme is going to end. There is going to be some form of deregulation. We have to make sure that it's deregulation with as soft as possible a landing.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>Did they have the resources of government available to them? No. The industry had to make all of the running. They presented the government with a plan. The government sat on that plan for months and months, and finally said, `These are the aspects of your plan that we are prepared to wear. We are not prepared to put up a penny of taxpayers' money. This package can only be funded by an industry levy.' And that is what the government said in its pathetic three-paragraph response to this committee's report.</para><para>The industry came forward with a package. They had to do all of the work. The industry were facing deregulation at the end of the DMS Scheme by one means or another, and what did the government do? They said, `We will legislate to put in place your package, conditional on all of the states removing regulation. That is a condition we impose when we put the Dairy Industry Adjustment Act into legislation. That will only happen when all of the states deregulate.' So, of course, those states had very little choice. There was a package of measures to try to cushion the effect of deregulation. As was the unanimous finding of the Senate committee, deregulation was going to occur by one means or another. So the states had no choice. The states had absolutely no choice if they were going to be responsible to their industry. New South Wales and Queensland, which everyone knew would suffer major effects from deregulation, were being faced with the prospect of deregulation with no package and with an attack on their regulated system from the producers in Victoria, who produce two-thirds of Australia's milk—no-one has gainsaid that. The government knew that, but the government did nothing but impose upon the states a package which they had no choice about.</para><para>Now we see the government suggesting milk marketing arrangements. This is in their three-paragraph lazy response to the substantial report, the unanimous findings, of the Senate committee. They say that they remain a matter for the states. The states had no choice. For months Mr Truss has been saying that, where the problems have been occurring in northern New South Wales, southern New South Wales and Queensland, they are a matter that has been caused by the states. Frankly, that is not the truth. The truth of the matter is that the states had no choice because, if they did not remove regulation, the provisions of the Dairy Industry Adjustment Act could not be applied to those states. So they would have had to live with trying to maintain their regulation against producers in a state that produces two-thirds of Australia's milk and—as Senator McGauran well knows—produces it much more efficiently than producers in northern New South Wales and in Queensland and in the Bega Valley, for that matter—that is the evidence that became before the committee. In relation to that, the states are then being told, `You have to ante up some money.' How much money did the Commonwealth put into this package, I wonder? Absolutely nothing.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—It put in $1.8 billion.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—Senator McGauran suggests $1.8 billion. They did not put one cent in, because all of the money in the package is paid for by the levy, and the levy is derived from selling the milk, and the milk is produced by the farmers, not the Commonwealth government. So Senator McGauran is trying to mislead the Australian people if he is saying, as I thought he was saying, that the Commonwealth government put up $1.8 billion. They did not put up a cracker. The adjustment package is paid for in relation to farm exit for other farmers, but in the case of the dairy industry it is paid for by the package. So, if you are in the dairy industry and you are taking the farm exit package, you get a measly $45,000. But the Commonwealth do not even pay that. They will pay it for other industries but not the dairy industry. In the dairy industry that $45,000 comes out of the $1.8 billion package which is paid for by the milk levy. And the $45 million regional adjustment package the Commonwealth did not put up either. All of that again came out of the $1.8 billion package which is paid for by the dairy levy. So not one cracker have the government put up. They try to blame the states for everything that is going on. They have not paid even a cent to the dairy farmers in this restructure. They were lazy for years as we headed towards inevitable deregulation—a matter, as I say, that has been agreed to unanimously by an all party committee—and then today they hand down a response to the report which, if you took the heading out of the document, is about 14 or 15 lines—14 or 15 lines for a major industry.

There are ten relevant types of funding administered by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB).  These include funds provided for the administration of Area Consultative Committees, funds provided under the Regional Assistance Programme (RAP), the Indigenous Employment Programme [and its predecessor, the Training for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders Programme (TAP)], the Working Women's Centres, the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme, the Small Business Incubator Programme, Job Network, the Community Support Programme, the Return to Work Programme and the Work for the Dole Programme.</para><para>	It is questionable how accurate the data on the amount of funds provided under each of the above programmes would be if attributed by electorate.  This is because funds are not allocated, approved or accounted for by federal or any other electorates.  </para><para>	In the case of ACCs and RAP, the programme is based on a structure that involves 56 ACCs which together cover all of Australia.  All potential projects (other than those of national significance) are channelled through these 56 ACCs.  ACCs, which consist of local representatives, make recommendations with respect to the potential projects.  Ultimately however, decisions about the funding of projects are made by a delegate within the National Office of DEWRSB.</para><para>	All administrative funding allocations for ACCs and RAP, together with information collected on the projects supported by the program, are based on that ACC structure.  Many ACCs cover a number of federal electorates in whole or in part.  Moreover, many projects that are funded under RAP cut across a number of ACCs.  In short, to attempt to move from an ACC basis to an electorate-based approach in order to quantify the allocation of funds is fraught with difficulties.  Arbitrary judgements would have to be made about how much of a project or ACC related to a particular electorate.  For example, the single ACC in Sydney, GROW, covers wholly or partially 28 electorates.  For the 2000-2001 financial year a notional allocation of around $17 million is available for new RAP proposals endorsed by ACCs.</para><para>	In the case of IEP (and TAP) the same difficulties arise in taking an electorate-based approach to quantifying funds approved under the various elements of the programme, namely, Wage Assistance, Structured Employment and Training (STEP), the Corporate Leaders for Indigenous Employment Project, National Indigenous Cadetship Project, Placement Incentives for Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP), the Indigenous Small Business Fund and the Voluntary Service to Indigenous Communities Foundation. These various elements operate differently and, as mentioned above, are not categorised by electorate. </para><para>	To attempt to identify individuals living in the electorate of Bass who may be the beneficiary of assistance under the various elements of the program is, at best, problematic.</para><para>	For the 2000-01 financial year, the amount allocated to the Indigenous Employment Programme is $55.428 million.</para><para>	Similarly, expenditure on the Small Business Incubator Programme is not reported or appropriated on the basis of electoral or regional boundaries.

RTW funding is not allocated by electoral boundaries.  RTW funding is allocated to labour market regions (LMR) and the electorate of Bass falls within the LMR of Hunter and North Coast.  Funding for the electorate is based on the proportion of people in the LMR who would require RTW assistance in the electorate.</para><para>	Contracts commenced in March 2000 and will continue until February 2002.

Funding provided to WFD activity sponsors and Community Work Coordinators (CWCs) based in the electorate of Bass in 1997-98 totalled $93 646, 1998-99 $426 487 and 1999-2000 $650 309.  WFD programme data is based on date approved; some funds may have been dispersed in the following financial year.</para><para>	The allocation of business to Community Work Coordinators (CWCs) (and sponsors in previous rounds of the programme), is based around ESAs.  CWCs are required to make available WFD places for eligible job seekers resident in the ESA for which the CWC is contracted.   ESA boundaries do not coincide with federal electorate boundaries.  </para><para>	Therefore in the case of the federal electorate of Bass, whilst these projects/activities are located in the Bass electorate, and most participants would reside in the Bass electorate, participants may have been drawn from parts of the ESA/s that are located in neighbouring federal electorates.  Furthermore, projects/activities located in other parts of the ESA/s that fall into neighbouring federal electorates may recruit participants living in the Bass electorate.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: People with Disabilities</title><page.no>21809</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3103)</subtitle><id.no>3103</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>21809</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 October 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Is the GST payable on modifications made to motor vehicles for use by a person with a  disability.</para><para>(2)	Is the GST payable on hydraulic/electric wheelchair lifting devices fitted to motor vehicles used by a person with a disability.</para><para>(3)	Under what circumstances, if any, would the GST be payable on any of the above when used by a person with a disability.</para><para>(4)	Why did the department provide conflicting advice to a caller with a disability initially telling her she was required to obtain a `disabled certificate' from Health Services Australia to obtain a GST exemption, then acknowledge, in a subsequent telephone call, that no such form existed.</para><para>(5)	What level of training have taxation office staff been given in relation to the complex issue of the GST payable on goods and services for people with disabilities.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>21809</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) to (3)	The following medical aids and appliances, associated with the use of a motor vehicle by people with disabilities, are GST-free if they are specifically designed for people with an illness or disability, and are not widely used by people without an illness or disability:</para></quote><para>·	a special purpose car seat;</para><para>·	a car seat harness specifically designed for people with disabilities;</para><para>·	a wheelchair and occupant restraint;</para><para>·	a wheelchair ramp;</para><para>·	a hydraulic/electric wheelchair lifting device;</para><para>·	motor vehicle modifications.</para><quote><para>Hydraulic/electric wheelchair lifting devices specifically designed for people with an illness or disability and not widely used by people without an illness or disability, are GST-free irrespective of who actually uses them.

This agreement was entered into with the approval of the Commonwealth Treasury.

The royalty payable to the Commonwealth on individual base metal coins would increase to 25 per cent when sales of those coins passed 250,000.

develop methods to test the sustainability of current recommended management practices for dryland agriculture.  Economic, social and environmental considerations will be used to measure the long-term viability of these practices to achieve sustainability.  Policy-makers, collaborating with industry and community, will use the results of Landmark to help develop strategies for addressing the critical sustainability issues facing the Murray-Darling Basin.  An important tool developed from the project will be the ability to map areas of different land use and to monitor the progressive change in land use practices over time.</para><para>The Landmark project consists of a number of sub-projects or 'tasks' aimed at:</para><para>Facilitating industry and community input to Landmark and communicating project results (Task 1)</para><para>Describing current recommended management practices for dryland agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin (Task 2)</para><para>Examining whether current recommended practices are sustainable in the long term (Task 3)</para><para>Developing recommendations about which areas of the Basin are most likely to require assistance to improve the long term sustainability of dryland farming activities (Task 4)</para><para>Analysing the impact of government policies on dryland agriculture and the need for changes to promote more sustainable land use (Task 5) and</para><para>Developing cost effective methods to map land use change and to measure changes in management practices to assess whether long term economic and environmental goals are being achieved (Task 6).</para><para>(2)—</para><para>(a)	Each sub-project or task has its own terms of reference.
