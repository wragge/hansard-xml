Late yesterday afternoon, a virus was detected on the parliamentary computing network. The virus, known as `Nimda', is particularly damaging, being spread not only through infected emails but also by accessing other infected Internet sites. The latest virus detection software is used to protect the parliamentary network. However, because of the sophistication of the virus, the software is not able to prevent the virus entering the network when users visit other infected Internet sites. As from approximately 9.15 a.m. today, the Internet email facility has been reinstated, which will allow emails to be read and sent. Emails carrying the virus are being successfully denied entry into the network. Staff of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff are currently considering ways of being able, once again, to provide access to the full Internet service, while ensuring the integrity of the network is not compromised. I can assure senators that every effort is being made to return the service to normal as soon as practicable.</para></talk.start></speech></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>27465</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—A petition has been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>SAMAG Magnesium Plant</title><page.no>27465</page.no><no.signed>4160</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>EP5</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Ferguson</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate, in Parliament assembled</para><para>The humble Petition of the undersigned respectfully shows that:</para><para>The residents of Port Pirie and districts strongly support the SAMAG Magnesium Plant proposal and believe that all South Australian Senators and the Federal Government should support the plant being located at Port Pirie.</para><para>Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate should undertake all efforts to ensure the SAMAG proposal at Port Pirie, South Australia, receives equivalent funding support to that of the Queensland Magnesium Project.</para><para>And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</para><presenter><no.signed>4160</no.signed><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name><name.id>EP5</name.id></talker><para>Senator Ferguson (from 4,160 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><para>Petition received.</para></petition.group><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>27465</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>27465</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline> to move, on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 may be proceeded with before the Legal and Constitutional References Committee reports on its provisions.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline> to move, on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the government business orders of the day relating to the following bills may be taken together for their remaining stages:</para></motion><para>Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 1998 [2001]</para><para>Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001</para><para>Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001</para><para>Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001 and two related bills.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> to move, on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the following matter be referred to the Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services for inquiry and report by 31 January 2002:</para></motion><para>The effectiveness and efficiency of the current rules governing early access to superannuation benefits on existing compassionate and severe financial hardship grounds.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> to move, on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services inquire into the following aspects of the general insurance industry in Australia, and report by the last sitting day in March 2002:</para><para>	(a)	motor vehicle insurance; and</para><para>	(b)	public liability insurance for community and sporting organisations,</para></motion><para>with particular reference to:</para><quote><para>	(a)	the cost of insurance products;</para><para>	(b)	the conduct of insurers; and</para><para>	(c)	the adequacy of the existing consumer protection regime, including industry `self-regulation' and complaint and dispute resolution services, but not including any reference to matters contained within the terms of reference of the Royal Commission into the failure of HIH.</para></quote><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>27466</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move that the Space Activities Regulations 2001, as contained in Statutory Rules 2001 No. 186 and made under the Space Activities Act 1998, be disallowed.

It is appropriate that the work of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee be noted in relation to all of its work but particularly in relation to important pieces of legislation such as these are. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, along with the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, performs a very important task which is often underestimated and not recognised—that is, to scrutinise bills, as the title of the committee suggests, and to examine them not in terms of policy grounds but in terms of fundamental legal principles, including civil liberties, retrospectivity and other grounds. It is a contempt of the work of that committee for the Senate to basically proceed with bills such as these as speedily as is being proposed without examining the sorts of concerns that the committee has in relation to these bills. Not having been on the committee and not having seen the report, if the Clerk or an attendant would provide me with a copy of it while I am speaking, that would be nice.</para><para>I think the focus of that committee's work needs to be examined. There is no doubt that there are some significant problems in these bills in regard to those basic legal principles. Leaving aside the policy debate for the moment—that is not what this committee does; we can debate that at another time—these legal principles are very important. These bills undermine some of those principles in quite a fundamental way. I have not seen the committee report, but I would be very surprised if it does not highlight them. The fact that the report has just been presented and no senator in this place, other than those on the committee, has had an opportunity to examine it makes this an important matter to consider.</para><para>The committee looks at things such as whether bills and acts of parliament trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties; make rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent on insufficiently defined administrative powers; make rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent on non-reviewable decisions; inappropriately delegate legislative powers; or insufficiently subject the exercise of legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—Madam President, I raise a point of order.

There have been a number of occasions where I have wanted an Auditor-General's report and so on. We are often caught in a position where we are not giving due respect to reports because we are not able to read them properly before we have to get up and address them.

The usual procedure, which other senators are probably aware of but others listening to the debate may not be, is that the committee examine bills according to those principles that I just read out. I would suggest that all five of those principles are probably breached by these bills, which makes it quite serious, and that the committee should examine them according to those principles and, if concerned, seek the minister's advice. The minister should then respond to that and that response then be incorporated in further reports so that the Senate as a whole can take that into consideration.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This report seeks advice from the minister on a number of matters. For example, on the <inline ref="R1412">Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001</inline>, it seeks the minister's advice as to: </para><para>·	whether the provisions have the effect of making lawful acts which are currently unlawful ... </para><para>·	why the validation is expressed so widely ...</para><para>·	whether the actions which are retrospectively validated must have complied with guidelines as to conduct or other internal regulatory procedures, and what remedies would be available to a person where, for example, a Commonwealth official took action which was `improper' ... and</para><para>·	whether the phrase `an intention to enter Australia' refers to Australian land or Australian territorial waters.</para><para>Those have been identified, but of course we do not have the advice from the minister about the concerns that have been raised in this <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline>. Concerns are also raised about:</para><para>·	why it is thought necessary to prohibit the institution of proceedings in relation to (presumably otherwise unlawful) detention; </para><para>·	whether the powers to detain and search are to be carried out on the high seas or in Australia's territorial waters; </para><para>·	why, given the availability of telephone warrants, it is appropriate that searches of detainees be conducted without a warrant; </para><para>·	whether this bill is seen as dealing with `extraordinary circumstances' or a situation of emergency, and why these powers are not subject to a sunset clause. </para><para>Again, these are extra concerns raised with just with one of these bills. The provisions in the bill that are highlighted empower people to detain persons without any charge. The <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest </inline>also expresses concerns about the retrospective operation of the <inline ref="R1413">Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001</inline>. It expresses concerns about significant definitions able to be amended subsequently by regulation—the so-called Henry VIII clause—expresses concerns about the wide discretion involved in the consequential provisions bill, expresses concerns about provisions that remove access to the courts and seeks advice on how court proceedings have been used by offshore entry persons to frustrate the resolution of their immigration status. It also deals with the <inline ref="R1391">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001</inline>, which I will not touch on because it is before a Senate committee at the moment, so we will have the opportunity to examine that further.</para><para>A quick perusal of this <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> makes it quite clear that the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills—which, as I remind senators, is not a policy committee; it does not examine the whole issue of how we deal with unauthorised arrivals—only examines those basic legal principles. I think, particularly in the Senate, we should consider these in regard to the impact of legislation that we may pass about trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties, about making rights and liberties unduly dependent on administrative powers which are inadequately defined and about making those rights and liberties dependent on non-reviewable decisions. Unfortunately, the Migration Act is already crammed full of those sorts of things, but these bills are even more packed full of them. They inappropriately delegate legislative powers and insufficiently subject the exercise of legislative power to parliament scrutiny. They do the lot.</para><para>This package of bills, as this <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> shows, contravenes all of those basic principles that this committee examines. Those basic principles of civil liberties and the rule of law, the basic principles that go to the separation of powers and the foundation of the entire system of government in this country are the sorts of things that these bills undermine and these are the sorts of things that are outlined in this <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline>. </para><para>I should also add that the committee is a cross-party committee: there is no, as there never is, any dissenting report. The committee is chaired by Senator Cooney, quite ably, and also contains Senator Crane, Senator Crossin, Senator Ferris, Senator Mason—some fine legal minds amongst them—and Senator Murray, from the Democrats, another person with fine attention to detail and some of those fundamental principles of accountability.</para><para>I remind people of the purpose of these committees. Why do we have a committee like this that does that hard work? It is not political work; it is not work that seeks to get publicity. It is behind-the-scenes work that scrutinises legislation for the basic fundamentals of it. It is, I believe, contemptuous of such committees for the Senate not to take into account the work that they do and the concerns that they raise and to try to rush through consideration of matters before advice has been returned to the committee from the minister. We are basically preventing this committee from doing its job—and let us not forget that this committee and the Regulations and Ordinances Committee do an incredibly important job. They actually save the rest of us a lot of work: they go through and look for these basic legal principles and draw them to our attention and seek to get answers to them before we have to deal with them in the chamber as a whole. That is an important aspect of this committee's work. </para><para>The committee has raised serious concerns about these bills that have not even been introduced into the Senate yet. We should take note of this report and I believe seek to get the minister's answers to the many concerns that are raised within it before we proceed further on those bills. That is a point that I would seek to make later on today if such questions arise, but I do urge all senators and, indeed, others who are interested—those in the media—to examine this <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> that raises some, amongst many, concerns in relation to these bills that I believe should be examined.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Senator Brown, you gave notice of wanting to adjourn the debate.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>27471</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I now have the <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> and, although I failed speed reading school back in 1970, I have been able to look at it and I will proceed, but I would endorse the point that Senator Ray made that it is not satisfactory for us to have to debate documents that we have not had an opportunity to look at. </para></talk.start><para>This is a very important report from the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, as Senator Bartlett has just said. That committee looks at bills coming before the Senate to ensure that they do not infringe on civil liberties, that they do not inappropriately delegate legislative powers, that they are clearly defined and, in effect, that they represent good legislation which has been subject to parliamentary scrutiny and do not infringe long held values that this nation stands for. This committee, which I might point out does not include Senator Bartlett or me sitting on it, has raised a number of questions which should be answered before the Senate deals with these matters. On the matter of retrospective validation of any action, the committee has sought the advice of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs as to:</para><quote><para>whether these provisions have the effect of making lawful acts which are currently unlawful, or which would be unlawful if they occurred in Australia ... </para></quote><para>It has asked the minister:</para><quote><para>why the validation is expressed so widely, and whether it would operate to validate all actions by an officer during the relevant period (including, for example, an action which caused the death of, or serious injury to, a person detained on a vessel) ...</para></quote><para>It has asked the minister:</para><quote><para>whether the actions which are retrospectively validated must have complied with guidelines as to conduct or other internal regulatory procedures, and what remedies would be available to a person where, for example, a Commonwealth official took action which was `improper' but which was validated by the bill ...</para></quote><para>I have been very concerned about that. If we are getting retrospective legislation and here is this to cover the tracks of the minister or some other person who acted not just improperly but potentially illegally since the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> picked up the asylum seekers in the waters off our northern coast, I do want to be party to it. Retrospectively validating improper or illegal actions is, I do not think, the right way for parliament to proceed. The committee has also sought the minister's advice as to:</para><quote><para>whether the phrase `an intention to enter Australia' refers to Australian land or Australian territorial waters.</para></quote><para>We do not have the minister's advice on those matters. On the matter of detention and search of persons, the committee has asked the minister's advice as to:</para><quote><para>why it is thought necessary to prohibit the institution of proceedings in relation to (presumably otherwise unlawful) detention ...</para></quote><para>It has asked the minister:</para><quote><para>whether the powers to detain and search are to be carried out on the high seas or in Australia's territorial waters ...</para></quote><para>And:</para><quote><para>why, given the availability of telephone warrants, it is appropriate that searches of detainees be conducted without warrant ...</para></quote><para>This is a very important question. The committee has also asked the minister:</para><quote><para>whether this bill—</para></quote><para>that is, the <inline ref="R1412">Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001</inline>—</para><quote><para>is seen as dealing with `extraordinary circumstances' or a situation of emergency, and why these powers are not subject to a sunset clause.</para></quote><para>Indeed, that is something that the minister mooted just a week ago. On the matter of mandatory sentencing—and let us not forget that this is the first time we have seen mandatory sentencing appearing in federal law—the committee sought the minister's advice `as to why it is appropriate to give the executive control by limiting judicial discretion in these circumstances'. In other words, after the long debates we have had about the Northern Territory and mandatory sentencing, and the general consensus in this place at least that sentencing should be a matter for the courts, here we have legislation coming before us to give the executive control by limiting the courts' discretion in these circumstances. Is it right for politicians through this course of action to be telling judges what they shall or shall not do when it comes to sentencing? Once we step across the border and support that, once we step over the limit and support that, where does it end? These are very important questions for the opposition to be considering.</para><para>The committee then looked at the <inline ref="R1413">Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001</inline> and it put a number of questions to the minister. It is seeking the minister's advice on why the explanatory memorandum does not indicate why the dates variously applying to the implementation of this law for Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and so on have been chosen, and whether any person will be disadvantaged by the retrospective operation of these provisions and, if so, who. We need to know these things if we are going to act with political as well as legal prudence in considering these important bills. </para><para>The committee has also sought the minister's advice as to the head of power which authorises the excision of various parts of Australia from the migration zone—that is, from Australian law—in particular, the Migration Act. It has looked at the Henry VIII clause, schedule 1, item 1 of that bill, and it seeks the minister's advice as to whether it is appropriate that such a significant definition is able to be amended by regulation—that is, by the minister's request through a regulation which comes before the parliament. We do not have the minister's response on that. On the matter of wide discretion, the committee points out that the bill proposes to insert a new section into the Migration Act which gives the minister an apparently unfettered discretion to determine whether an application for a visa by an offshore entry person is a valid application. </para><para>The committee also has a number of questions on the <inline ref="R1414">Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001</inline> which will be seen in the report. When it comes to the matter of a bar on certain legal proceedings, the committee has asked the minister how court proceedings have been used by offshore entry persons to frustrate the resolution of their immigration status. If the minister is putting legislation before us to counter that, then we need to have the government tell us where the courts have been frustrated by this process. I await the minister's advice on that. </para><para>On the <inline ref="R1391">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001,</inline> when it comes to drawing inferences from a refusal to produce documents under proposed new sections 91B and 91W, the committee seeks the minister's advice as to why it is appropriate that unfavourable inferences be drawn in administrative proceedings and what the consequences of drawing those unfavourable inferences might be. When it comes to the drafting note, item 10, schedule 1 to this bill, the committee notes that it consists solely of the heading of the item with no substantive enacting words. That is an extraordinary comment on the fact that this is legislation on the run. </para><para>Finally, we are going to hear quite a bit more of this this morning. I appeal to the opposition. You know, from the feedback that is coming from thinking Australians throughout our community, that there is high alarm in the community—not least amongst Labor voters—about the way the opposition appears to be joining the government in making legislation on the run and effectively moving towards a parliamentary railroading of this legislation. I caution against it. It is the wrong way to go. I also appeal, and I will be making this appeal later, for this legislation to go to a committee—I will put the date of that committee Tuesday next—to allow the opposition at least to have the decency to support the public having some input into this legislation in the coming days, much the same as is going to occur with the regional forest agreement legislation. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>27473</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Capital and External Territories Committee</title><page.no>27473</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>27473</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>27473</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories entitled <inline font-style="italic">Risky Business: Inquiry into the tender process followed in the sale of the Christmas Island Casino and Resort</inline>, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of the committee's proceedings, minutes of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the tabling statement incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The statement read as follows</inline>—</para><para>Madam President, the opening of the Christmas Island Casino and Resort in 1993 had a profound impact upon both the economy and the community of Christmas Island.</para><para>It boosted employment, encouraged the growth of a tourism and small business sector, almost doubled the population of the small island community, and had a positive effect on Christmas Island as a whole.</para><para>Unfortunately, the casino and resort closed in 1998.

This inquiry examined in some detail the circumstances surrounding the tender process of the disposal of the failed Christmas Island casino resort and its subsequent sale to a company known as Soft Star. The salient facts in this business process are that the Christmas Island casino resort was granted a 99-year crown lease for a 47-hectare block of land upon which the facility was built. The resort was a major employer on Christmas Island and a major stimulus to the Christmas Island economy. The closure of the resort in 1998 has had a devastating effect upon the social and economic structure of Christmas Island, with up to 250 people leaving the island immediately after the casino's closure.</para></talk.start><para>The Christmas Island Chamber of Commerce estimates that the island's population has fallen from 2,600 to 1,300 since the closure of the casino. It has been 15 months since the sale of the facility and over three years since the start of the sale process, and the casino and the resort remain largely closed. Let us be quite clear in presenting the report about what the closure of the resort and the sale of the casino have meant for Christmas Island—the island depended very much on the operation of the casino for income, economy and livelihood—and what it now means for those people who are still awaiting the realisation of the promise that the casino be reopened. Our dissenting report highlights the opposition's many concerns relating to this process, such as the purpose clause of the lease; the conversion of the leases from leasehold to freehold title and the conduct of the negotiations with ComsWinfair—the company that I believe would have by now opened the resort and the one, it seemed on the face of it, to which the resort should have been sold. Of course, the casino and the resort was sold to Soft Star Pty Ltd. People reading this transcript, and who want to know about this process, should be aware that Soft Star Pty Ltd is connected to the APSC—the owners of the space base—to which this government last month appropriated many millions of dollars to assist in getting the space base operating.</para><para>Much hinges on the interpretation of the purpose clause of the Christmas Island resort lease, which is now where the focus of the future of this resort is placed. The lease says:</para><quote><para>The Lessee shall use the premises only for the purposes of a hotel-casino and ancillary thereto, for personal services, retail and non-retail shops, recreation, accommodation and entertainment facilities or such purpose as may be approved in writing by the Commonwealth.</para></quote><para>Evidence was presented to the committee that the purpose clause of the lease is permissive and not mandatory and that therefore failure to reopen the casino does not appear to constitute a breach of this lease. We do not accept that. Even if this interpretation were accepted, non-government members could not understand why this government failed to ensure that the operation of a casino and resort was mandatory within the purpose clause of the lease, remembering the importance and the contribution of the casino and resort to Christmas Island's economy and social infrastructure. </para><para>However, our interpretation suggests that the purpose clause of the lease means that it was mandatory, that there was an obligation on the Commonwealth government to ensure that, in the sale of the casino and resort, the future owners—Soft Star in this case—were mandated and that they must open and operate it as a casino. It appears to non-government members of the committee that the current leaseholder is in breach of the lease by failing to reopen the casino and resort. Opposition members on the committee do not accept the assertion made in the majority report that the committee understands that the Commonwealth has no ability to compel the owner of the facility to use it for the purpose of a casino and resort. We do not accept that. We believe that the Commonwealth has an absolute ability and an absolute obligation to compel the owner of the facility to open it as a casino. We say that the current operator should be given 12 months to do so or that the lease be revoked. We know, of course, that that will lead to court action.</para><para>I draw the Senate's attention to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> of September 15 and 16 where Soft Star say that negotiations are under way with potential managers to reopen the casino and that they are `doing what they need to do and will see how quickly it can be done.' Who with? Who is Soft Star talking to? What is the time line? We have heard this time and time again. In fact, Soft Star put out a press release in June saying they were about to reopen the resort, but we are still waiting for that to happen. We are continually being led around. The people on Christmas Island are being continually misled by Soft Star's promises to reopen this casino.</para><para>The other important issue is the conversion of the lease from leasehold to freehold. Given the importance of a functioning casino resort to the tourism and small business sectors of the island economy, we feel that it would be highly inappropriate to approve the conversion of the resort leases from leasehold to freehold title, even on a conditional basis. Non-government members are concerned that the loss of direct control over the lease by the Commonwealth would impact negatively upon the community's ability to influence the use of the casino and resort by the current owner or by any other subsequent owners. We are also concerned at the lack of consultation with the Christmas Island community, again, and the lack of consultation with the Christmas Island Shire Council, again, regarding the conversion of the resort lease from leasehold to freehold—which is a prospect that this government is currently considering.</para><para>In short, the opposition members of the committee feel that in light of continuing uncertainty in the redevelopment of the complex, and its reopening as a fully operational casino and resort, the approval of Soft Star's application for conversion of the leases from leasehold to freehold title would remove any influence the Christmas Island community could have over the management of such a vital economic resource. Further, the non-government members of the committee were concerned about the result of the tender process and the subsequent sale to Soft Star. We believe that ComsWinfair clearly emerged from the tender process as the only viable tenderer with the experience, financial resources and intent to refurbish and reopen the casino and resort to its full operational capacity. It would appear that any outstanding conditions between ComsWinfair and the Commonwealth were and could have been essentially resolved as of January 2000, and that ComsWinfair anticipated resolving all outstanding issues in the shortest time frame possible.</para><para>The other thing is that, in relation to the sale to Soft Star Pty Ltd, the opposition members of the committee did not think it was appropriate to begin negotiations with Soft Star before the termination of the tender process, nor was it appropriate that probity and financial background checks were not applied to Soft Star before the sale of the property. In short— and there are many more things I would like to say about this report—we believe the tender process for the sale of the Christmas Island resort was flawed from the outset. We believe the Commonwealth's handling of its role in the process and its responsibilities to the Christmas Island community have once again been totally inadequate.</para><para>In closing, I would like to add my thanks to the committee secretariat, to the secretary Richard Selth and to the people who work in that committee, in particular to Emma Herd for the work in producing this report. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned. </para></interjection></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES (COMPENSATION) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27477</page.no><id.no>R1395</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RETIREMENT ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1384</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>27477</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>27477</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together.

He made a number of recommendations to improve these processes, and to minimise the burdens and frustrations for all parties—but especially those waiting for their compensation payouts to be released to them. </para><para>Currently, 50 per cent of every dollar recovered by the Commonwealth is consumed by administration costs. This bill will provide for a saving of $6.5 million in the first full year of operation. The proposed amendments simplify the recovery process for notifying claims, and streamline the processes to allow a clearer and more manageable path from claim to resolution of incurred Commonwealth debt. The proposed reforms in this bill will significantly reduce the number of settlements and judgments that are required to be notified to the Commonwealth by setting the minimum amount of a judgment or settlement that must be notified at $5,000 or above.</para><para>Importantly, the bill eliminates any necessity for the notification of a potential judgment or settlement. This removes the excessive requirement placed on insurers and/or the injured party to notify the Commonwealth of a possible compensable case, regardless of the likely success of any claim for compensation.</para><para>The bill will also provide a genuine power to audit the integrity of claims and to allow a more effective checking process of claimant details and medical history to ensure that there is an appropriate recovery of Commonwealth debt. More emphasis will be on the claimant to provide assurances, through the provision of statutory declarations, on the level of Medicare or residential care costs associated with their judgment and settlements.</para><para>The advanced payment option that currently allows claimants to receive 90 per cent of their judgment or settlement moneys once the case has been resolved has been retained for the time being. In addition to that arrangement, a provision has been included to allow the Commonwealth to set a sliding scale of the advanced payment option by regulation, which will allow claimants to receive a better targeted share of their award initially on settlement or judgment. This will provide flexibility in the future to ensure that injured persons receive as much as possible of their settlement as early as possible. That predetermined percentage will still be forwarded to the Commonwealth for reconciliation of debt. The balance will, as now, then be forwarded to the claimant upon debt clearance. This will result in the debt to the Commonwealth being more effectively recovered and the claimant having greater and faster access to more of their money without having to wait until final debt liability is verified.</para><para>The review examined the appropriateness of continuing the advanced payment options, considering that at the time of their introduction they were only to be a temporary measure. This was the case as the initial period of recoveries resulted in major administrative backlogs in processing the claims by both insurers and the Commonwealth. As the processes have been streamlined over time and further streamlining occurs through these proposed changes, such a temporary arrangement should be strategically removed. This helps lawyers and insurers more than the claimants. This bill, therefore, includes a provision for the insertion of a sunset clause for the advanced payment option arrangements from 2004. This will provide an introductory period of time to enable the new streamlined arrangement to be bedded down.</para><para>The new arrangements will be simpler, more efficient and keep impositions on claimants to a minimum. Simpler claiming and administrative processes will allow the speedier release of final compensation settlements or judgments and reduce the worry and red tape for recipients and their families.</para><para>Mr Pooley has the thanks of the government and the parliament for his hard and considered work, as do those who played such a constructive role in contributing to the review which has led to this very important and, indeed, landmark legislation.</para><para>—————</para><para>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RETIREMENT ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS) BILL 2001</para><para>The purpose of the retirement assistance for farmers scheme was to meet welfare and rural adjustment objectives by providing an opportunity for low income, pension age farmers and their partners to gift the farm to the younger generation without affecting their access to social security payments.  The legislation provides for the scheme to finish on 30 June 2001.  There are however some farmers who, while otherwise eligible under the scheme, had not finalised the transfer of their farm by 30 June 2001.  The purpose of the bill is to provide those farmers with extra time in which to take advantage of the scheme.</para><para>In effect, the bill allows an extra period of time to finalise transfers for those farmers who contacted Centrelink prior to 1 August 2001 to enquire about their eligibility and who are subsequently advised by Centrelink that they would attract the benefits of the scheme if the transfer was undertaken.  These farmers can still qualify for assistance under the scheme provided the transfer is finalised within 3 months from when Centrelink responded to their enquiry.</para><para>The bill also provides for similar arrangements in respect of farmers applying for Department of Veterans' Affairs income support pensions and who wish to take advantage of the scheme.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Denman</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para><para>Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED STOCK AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27478</page.no><id.no>R1387</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>27478</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>27479</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>27479</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>Today I introduce a bill to modernise the conduct of the Commonwealth Government Securities market.  </para><para>The bill will remove regulatory barriers to the electronic issue and transfer of Commonwealth Government Securities, including Treasury Bonds and Treasury Notes. </para><para>The bill will put in place reforms to the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911 to enable Commonwealth Government Securities to be cleared and settled electronically alongside a range of financial products under the Corporations Act 2001, as amended by the proposed Financial Services Reform Act 2001.</para><para>The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill will provide a legal framework for the electronic transfer of Commonwealth Government Securities that is flexible and that promotes an efficient and innovative market.</para><para>The bill will create a more efficient business environment for market participants by opening up the conduct of the Commonwealth Government Securities market to clearing and settlement facilities involved in the broader operation of the financial markets.</para><para>The bill will make clear that non-government clearing and settlement facilities regulated under the Corporations Act may be appointed as Registrars under the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act in addition to, or instead of, the Reserve Bank.</para><para>However, the bill will not preclude the Reserve Bank from continuing to have a role as a Registrar in providing for the electronic recording and transfer of the ownership of Commonwealth Government Securities, in addition to its role in the recording of transfers of ownership of Commonwealth Government Securities in paper form.</para><para>The bill will enable the Commonwealth to create equitable interests in Commonwealth Government Securities.

It is appropriate to also utilise the opportunity of this motion to draw attention to what is actually happening in this chamber today and what has happened in this parliament over the last day or two.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The motion is that `these bills may proceed without formalities'. If this motion were agreed to, it would have the effect of suspending any requirements for stages of the passage of the bills to take place on different days, for notice of motions for such stages and for the printing and certification of the bill or bills during the passage. It is a mechanical motion that is used to facilitate easy passage of legislation to stages of consideration and it is normally passed without dissent and without comment, because there is opportunity to consider legislation and to look at the detail of it in the various later stages of the debate. But that is under normal circumstances and these are far from normal circumstances in the parliament at the moment in relation to these bills and these are far from normal circumstances in relation to this government's treatment of the whole issue that is addressed by these bills. </para><para>The Democrats do not believe that these bills should proceed without formalities because we should not suspend any requirements for stages of the passage of the bills to take place on different days. These bills should be considered on different days and that is why we oppose that part of the motion. We believe that, because the bills have only just been introduced—probably about 42 hours ago, maybe slightly less—and because they deal with such significant issues, clearly they should not proceed without formalities. </para><para>The bills were introduced into the House of Representatives less than 48 hours ago. Some of them were not available on the parliamentary Internet until late yesterday afternoon. The explanatory memoranda certainly were not available until late yesterday afternoon. That is less than 24 hours ago. That is completely inappropriate. That is problematic for us as parliamentarians. Of course, we can get hold of the bills when they are introduced in the House of Representatives but getting commentary from the community about issues in legislation like this is virtually impossible. At 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon, I spoke to a number of people who are experts in the area covered by these bills. They still had not had an opportunity to look at the bills. I still have not had an opportunity to get any feedback from them about the impacts of these bills. </para><para>To suggest that we should allow these bills to proceed without formality I think makes a mockery of the proper legislative process that this chamber, in particular, utilises. We can forget about the House of Representatives; it never considers bills properly anyway. But the Senate has a responsibility to examine legislation properly. Amongst ourselves, we might be reasonably good at considering legislation and examining its detail but I do not profess to be an expert on everything and I rely very heavily on feedback from people who do have expertise, from people who work daily in whatever area is involved, and I have not had an opportunity to get that feedback. Indeed, in many cases, people have not had the opportunity to even examine the legislation. So this is a serious concern to the Democrats and that is why we oppose what is normally a straightforward mechanical motion. </para><para>It is worth noting what the impact of this mechanical motion is. It is something that we do not normally examine, that we do just wave through, assuming that those words are said for some sort of procedural purpose but do not have any real meaning. But those words that we hear all the time—`that the bills proceed without formalities'—have quite significant impacts. It is appropriate not only to be aware of what those impacts are but also that we make a considered decision about whether we should allow that to occur. We believe that in this instance we should not allow it to occur. It is in effect a fast-tracking motion. In virtually all circumstances that is okay, in our view, but let us not be under any illusion that these bills are anything other than quite extraordinary. </para><para>As we have already seen this morning in the brief opportunity we have had to consider the <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee there are fundamental concerns about these bills that go to the heart of the rule of law. To just wave them through without consideration and give permission for them to be brought on today—if the Senate so chooses—or for other notices of motion for various stages of the bill to be moved without notice is not appropriate given the extraordinary nature of these bills. That is why we are taking the unusual step of opposing this motion, because these are extraordinary bills. They contravene civil liberties in any number of ways. They contravene the basic underpinnings of our rule of law. They are of dubious constitutional validity in some circumstances. They savagely impinge on human rights of individuals and they undermine our obligations in relation to a range of international conventions. That is just on a first glance at the bills. That is without feedback from people who have expertise in this area. That is with initial consideration of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report. We can tell that already from having a quick glance through these bills. Imagine what more we will find. </para><para>I hear more with each comment I get back from people about some other hidden atrocity within these bills. I will not go into detail on that matter now because it is not relevant to the question. The question before the chamber is whether the bills should proceed without formalities. I certainly will go into that matter when the bills do come on for debate which, hopefully, will not be today because these bills should not proceed without formalities. They should be put off for consideration in an appropriate fashion. Other proposals, which have been foreshadowed already, will be put before the chamber about a better process for doing that. </para><para>If there were some indication from the government or the opposition that they would support these bills being referred to a committee, even to report back next week, then we may be willing to support this motion and indeed not debate them because we would at least believe that we would have the opportunity to consider the bills. In a sense that is a suggestion to both the opposition and the government that if they support these bills going off to a committee, even just for a few days scrutiny, we would be less inclined to oppose them proceeding without formalities and, I would foreshadow, less inclined to oppose them being taken together as well, because at least there would be some opportunity to examine them. </para><para>We are not seeking to frustrate consideration of these bills in any unreasonable way. We are simply trying to draw attention to every stage of the proceedings in the passage of these bills and to draw to the attention of the Senate, the media and the public more generally what is occurring each step of the way as we wave through these bills. These bills have had very serious fundamental legal concerns raised about them. That is not even addressing the issue of the best policy approach to deal with the huge numbers of asylum seekers and refugees throughout the world. We can deal with that when it is relevant to the question before the chamber.</para><para>There have been serious concerns raised about the basic legal principles contained in these bills. We hear repeatedly from the opposition, and I think it is a fair enough point, that the government and the cabinet are packed to the gills with lawyers—some very esteemed lawyers with great expertise in the principles of law. I would be surprised if many of them have even had the opportunity to examine these bills in any detail. I would be interested in the feedback and expertise not only from those out in the community but also from those in the government, who, I know, have the expertise and the ability and who also have concerns about not just the treatment of refugees but also the legal principles involved in these bills. I think there would be many in the coalition parties, particularly the Liberal Party, who would be extremely concerned about the legal principles alone involved in these bills, leaving aside the policy aspects. I know there are others in the opposition who have concerns as well.</para><para>What needs to be emphasised and drawn to the attention of the public in relation to these bills is not only the content of the bills—which I will not debate now because it is not the question before the chair; we can debate that later—but also the process that is being followed. Let us go back to the structure of government, the separation of powers—that is, the role of the courts, the executive, the cabinet or the government, and the parliament—and the three arms or legs balancing each other not just in terms of the content of the bill but the process being followed here. The process is basically subverting what, I believe, is the genuine will of the parliament. </para><para>The party system in this place is so rigid and all of us are subject to that—some to a lesser degree than others—but I recognise that it is a feature of our political system. I have no doubt, and it is quite clear, that there are many in the opposition who are concerned about and opposed to these bills. I have no doubt that there are a number in the coalition parties who are concerned as well. It is quite possible that if a majority of people in this chamber were free to express their personal opinion on these bills they would oppose them. </para><para>Unfortunately, the power of the executive over the parliament and the power of the party system over the parliament has now got to a stage where, I believe, this is a clear example of the will of the parliament possibly being overturned and overridden. That is of great concern in terms of the fundamental underpinnings of our whole system of government. One of those three arms or legs, whichever you prefer, is clearly being weakened to a significant degree in relation to these bills and this process that we are currently following. I believe this is something that really should send alarm bells. People can have different views about the best policy approach to deal with the growing number of refugees throughout the world—numbers that are probably going to increase significantly in the next few days or are increasing as we speak—but, leaving that to one side, this goes to our whole system of government and our legal principles. </para><para>Once the parliament steps aside and allows the executive to take on board such significant powers, not just in terms of the content of the bill but the process that is being followed with this legislative process, then this is not just about the rights of unauthorised arrivals and asylum seekers but about the rights of the Australian community. Once it is accepted practice to allow some of those fundamental legal and procedural principles to be undermined, to be ignored or to be waived, to empower the government to be above the law—which is what at least one of these bills does in that it empowers delegates of the government to be above the law—then we are seriously undermining the whole fabric of the protection of the civil liberties and the legal and human rights of the Australian community. </para><para>It is easy to think that this only applies to somebody else—people we do not know, people who do not have a face, people who are not Australians and whom we do not have to worry about. Once you support principles such as these, you put at risk the fundamental rights of the entire community. That is something the public is not aware of and I think they need to be made aware of. That is why we believe sufficient time should be given to consider this legislation. That is why we are concerned about the process that is being followed here. That is why the Democrats will take the step of opposing the motion that the bills proceed without formalities and putting on the record, in a procedural sense, why that should not be supported.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>27483</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not intend to speak for a long time on the question before the chair, which is that the bills may proceed without formalities.

I understand the question before the chair currently—something that has been heard many thousands of times: that the bills may proceed without formalities—is a standard procedure used to expedite the business of the Senate. For the first time since the new procedures for dealing with the stages of bills have been adopted, this current question is being debated. That is a first. This is the first time this question has ever been debated. If there is a vote on it or different views on it, it will be the first time that has occurred also.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The point here—and I would just like to deal with the substance of the question before the chair comparatively briefly—is that the standing orders of the Senate provide for bills to be dealt with on different days. I think that is the most simple explanation. In other words, a first reading is dealt with on one day, a second reading and committee stage is dealt with on another day and, under the standing orders, the third reading is dealt with on another day. Take, for example, standing order 112, which relates to the first reading of a bill. Standing order 112(4) says:</para><quote><para>After the first reading, a future day shall be appointed for the second reading of the bill, and the bill shall be printed.</para></quote><para>So this motion before the chair, this question before the chair, is basically to override that standing order and allow the bills to proceed without that formality, that formality being `a future day shall be appointed for the second reading'. In other words, the second reading can occur on the same day.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—It is because in the old days printing took a little bit longer.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—Yes, that is probably a valid point, Senator Campbell, but I think also there are new procedures in the Senate which are to streamline some of these arcane standing orders. In relation to the third reading of the bill—this is once the second reading and the committee stage have been concluded—the third reading is governed by standing order 122 of the Senate. Standing order 122(1) says:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>When the report of the committee of the whole is adopted, a future day shall be fixed for the third reading.</para></quote><para>So again this question before the chair is to override standing order 122(1), as has occurred on each and every occasion a bill has been debated in this place literally for decades; that standing order has been overridden. It might be a reasonable thing for someone to point out that perhaps it is time to review these standing orders and modernise them so we do not actually require a question that the bills proceed without formalities. However, that is the question before the chair and they are the standing orders that are overridden by it, as in our view they ought to be and as they have been in the case of every other piece of legislation since this procedure has been adopted by this chamber, and we do not see any reason why the usual procedures should not apply here.</para><para>The next question that will come before the Senate is of course that the bills be taken together and read a first time. That is debatable also. I do not know what the intention of some senators in the chamber will be in relation to that question before the chair, but it has hitherto been accepted effectively as a formality. But the whole idea of this question is to expedite the second reading. In other words, you can go through all the stages of a bill—first reading, second reading, committee stage and third reading—effectively consecutively without delay, without having to wait a day. This is the point that I would make to Senator Bartlett and also to Senator Brown, who is in the chamber and who has indicated he will be opposing the question before the chair. This means that, in the truncated sittings program we have in this parliament, there will be a very significant delay in this legislation.</para><para>I appreciate that there is a lot of public interest in these bills; I acknowledge that, and it would be silly not to acknowledge that. I also appreciate that this is a high legislative priority of the government. I accept that priority, and the opposition believes that a strong case can be made for this legislation progressing without delay. We made a very different case, as you are aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, for the Commonwealth electoral bill, which the government wanted to progress quickly through the chamber and which does not have any priority and does not have the same level of public interest or national interest. We made our views on that very clear and they stand in the record of the Senate, and that will be the consistent position of the opposition.</para><para>These three migration bills that are before us, the <inline ref="R1413">Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001</inline>, the <inline ref="R1414">Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001</inline> and the <inline ref="R1412">Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001</inline>, are urgent bills. I do not think it is appropriate in this circumstance to use a hitherto unprecedented device to delay the debate on these bills. I always think that, if you can, it is better to debate the substance of the bills, as opposed to using procedural devices or mechanisms to stop them coming on, though I acknowledge and I have always acknowledged—and I will not be hypocritical about this—that at times governments might propose to the Senate questions that are so outrageous that you have to use whatever capacity you have under the standing orders to make a clear point.</para><para>I am sure there will be a substantial debate on these matters. I do not doubt that the senator who has spoken to this question, Senator Bartlett, will engage in it. I do not doubt that Senator Brown will engage in it—fair enough—and that a number of other senators might also. I certainly accept, as would the opposition and, I am sure, every senator in the chamber, that these are matters of very great public interest, that they are serious questions of public policy and that they do deserve the attention of the parliament. Mr Acting Deputy President, because of that, we actually ought to get to the substance of the issue. Let us debate what these bills are all about, by all means.</para><para>I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will not be engaging in any delaying tactics on this package of bills at all. In fact, I proposed to the Manager of Government Business as recently as half an hour ago that we actually try to move this process along by including some other bills, if it is possible, in a cognate debate if that would have the effect of saving time. But I also made the point to the Manager of Government Business that it is possible that the Australian Democrats and other senators—minor party or Independent senators—may have such strong views that that would not be helpful. I acknowledge that. I understand how these things work. If it is not a helpful suggestion—although it certainly sounds helpful in terms of the processes as we all understand them— and if it were to have the unintended consequence of delaying debate, that is not our intention.</para><para>We will not be contributing at length to the second reading debate. On this package of bills, we will be minimising the number of opposition speakers. The opposition has made clear its general view in relation to this package of legislation. I accept that it is always difficult to make such a comment and it shows how courageous I am to say that we would not be speaking at length, with Senator Schacht handling the bill!</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—That's dead right.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—I know how courageous I am in saying that!</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—I'm under no limitation.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—That is not quite right, Senator Schacht.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Gagged by my own side—all right.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—That is about the size of it, Senator Schacht. The key point here is that there is no filibuster on this as far as the Labor Party is concerned, and we will not engage in it. We believe that it is better to debate the substance of these bills.

We have made a clear point about the nature of the <inline ref="R1340">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2001</inline>, and I hope the government has that on board. There are these migration bills and a number of other bills that have genuine legislative priority, that have clear national importance and that ought to be dealt with as soon as we possibly can, and certainly prior to an election being called. That is the real time constraint here.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us acknowledge it: we all know that there is a federal election around the corner. We all know that there is a certain amount of business that needs to be done. It is never what the government asks for—be it a Labor government, a non-Labor government or a `Callithumpian' government. You always put up a wish list—that is the way it goes in this business—but, contained within that ambit claim, there is always legislation that does need to be dealt with. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, this legislation fairly, squarely and clearly fits that bill. It is for that reason that I do not think we will be contributing any further to the question that the bills may proceed without formalities.</para><para>I want to make our position clear: we want to get on with the substance of the debate and, in saying that, we understand that there will be difficult views in the chamber. Senators have a right to express those views in the chamber, as they do. The Australian Labor Party has always defended that right when it has been exercised by senators, and I do not think that even our harshest critics would argue that. We have always defended the right of senators to deal with legislation before the Senate on its substance and, wherever possible, we have allowed for a reasonable amount of time to debate key priority legislation. There is no difference here, and I thought it would be worth while, in this circumstance, outlining the approach of the opposition and the import of the unprecedented debate that is occurring on the question that the bills may proceed without formalities.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>27486</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The core of the argument used by Senator Faulkner was that we get to the substance of the issue in the debate on the second reading.

Indeed, there has not been Senate scrutiny, as the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee process highlights. Senator Faulkner said that it is extraordinary and a precedent that Senator Bartlett and I are not in favour of the removal of all impediment—that is, formality—to the bills proceeding forthwith. Let me take you to that part of the standing orders of this place where the procedure of bills into and through the Senate is dealt with. Standing order No. 111, subsection (5), says:</para><quote><para>Where a bill ... is first introduced in the Senate ... and a motion is moved for the second reading of the bill, debate on that motion shall be adjourned at the conclusion of the speech of the senator moving the motion and resumption of the debate shall be made an order of the day for the first day of sitting in the next period of sittings without any question being put.</para></quote><para>It goes on under subsection (6) to say:</para><quote><para>Paragraph (5) does not apply to a bill introduced in the Senate or received from the House of Representatives within the first two-thirds of the total number of days of sitting of the Senate scheduled for the first period of sittings after a general election of the House of Representatives, but consideration of such a bill shall not be resumed after the second reading is moved in the Senate unless 14 days have elapsed after the first introduction of the bill in either House.</para></quote><para>Senator Faulkner has said that that has ceased to be general practice in this place. But I would remind senators that these standing orders are to ensure that the Senate does deal with legislation in a way which stops railroading of legislation by the government, which may have a majority in the House of Representatives, and which does ensure that the community has an opportunity to have input. Senator Faulkner, and no doubt the government, will acknowledge that these bills are a matter of high public concern—not just interest but great concern. They are front-page news today. If you look at the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> and see the pictures of the two asylum seeker children staring through the wire in Nauru, you understand that the matters in these bills are important, because they are changing the law to remove not only the rights of those children, as they have stood until now, but the rights of Australians who feel concerned about the rights of those children.</para><para>Senator Faulkner referred to standing order No. 112, subsection (4), which deals with the first reading of a bill in this place. It says:</para><quote><para>After the first reading, a future day shall be appointed for the second reading of the bill, and the bill shall be printed.</para></quote><para>The fundamental intention of the Senate in that standing order is and always has been that there is time for the Senate not only to consider the legislation but also to get public feedback. When you go on to standing order 114, subsection (2), on the second reading, it says:</para><quote><para>An amendment may be moved to that question by leaving out `now' and inserting `this day 6 months', which, if carried, shall finally dispose of the bill.</para></quote><para>We do not want to dispose of the bills; we want the bills to be properly looked at and we want the Senate to fulfil its obligation to the people of Australia to allow some input.</para><para>I point out to the opposition that Senator Faulkner has underscored the basic contradiction in the opposition's support for the government in shoving this legislation through so quickly when he said that the constitutional review bill, which is to do with Liberal Party funding, should be held up so that people have the time to look at it. He indicated that that bill was much less important than this package of legislation and was trying to argue that, therefore, this legislation should be dealt with differently because it is important—to wit, put it through the Senate without proper public input or proper reflection by senators on the gravity of the matter that it contains. That is the opposition arguing against its own position. It is saying, on the one hand, `We've a piece of legislation which is for political advantage and may not be high in the affairs of the nation, although probity of political process is certainly involved. Hold that one up, because it gives our opponents a political advantage or allows our opponents to use parliament in an untoward fashion.' But on the other hand, the opposition's view is different when it comes to important legislation which goes not just to matters of immigration but to fundamental matters of prudence about the way parliament is a check on the executive and the Senate is a check on the House of Representatives and the Senate, as a house of review, has an obligation to allow the Australian public to have input. The opposition says, `Scrap that.'</para><para>That is a perverse argument which belies the fact that the opposition, no less than the government, wants to railroad this extremely important legislation through the Senate for political purposes to get it off the agenda in the run-up to the election. The opposition feels wounded by the government's handling of this matter. I say to the opposition: the problem is that you did not take the contrary point of view right from the outset. The first day when the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> picked up the refugees off our northern coast, the opposition should have stuck to the time-honoured principle which says, `Give those people a fair go.' The government was not going to; the Prime Minister was not going to. The opposition should have taken a lead there, and had it taken a lead the outcome would be very different now in terms of public regard for the way the opposition has handled the matter. It has taken the worst of all paths and that is as far as possible, with one exception, to support the Prime Minister in going the wrong way, in a heavy-handed way— which we now have to deal with in the Senate—ending up with an abuse of law and an abuse of a time-honoured practice in this nation of ours. What we are being asked to do today is to push through legislation which has not yet had community review and proper public review. </para><para>Later this morning I will be moving that these matters be put to a committee and the indications are that again the opposition is going to oppose that. How can the opposition justify that tactic? How can the opposition—like the government—say: `We oppose the public having an input into this debate. We want this debated even before we know what the ramifications of this legislation, as requested by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee on which we have members, are. Even before we get government answers to these fundamentally important questions which the three bills raise, we want to debate and dispose of this matter'? It is as if it is taking orders directly from the executive suite, from Mr Howard's office. Of course it is not, but what it is trying to do is shadow Mr Howard so closely that people will not perceive a difference and believe that the public out there is going to say, `Oh well, that's that matter; we don't have to think about that when we are going to the ballot box.' Wrong move. </para><para>The public expects an opposition to be positive in the interests of the nation. If positive opposition here does not involve standing in support of basic civil liberties, rights and laws that are fundamental to the Australian precept of a `fair go', it should at least insist that the Senate not be used as a rubber stamp for legislation on the run, as Mr Beazley called it, coming from the Prime Minister's office in the run-up to an election.</para><para>I acquaint the committee with the early alarm that there is in legal circles in this country about this legislation and the way it is being handled by reading a media release of the last 24 hours from the Law Council, which is opposed to this legislation. The media release says:</para><quote><para>The Law Council of Australia says that it opposes the combined effect of the legislative package of six Bills introduced into Parliament yesterday.</para></quote><para>It is referring to other bills which I understand from Senator Faulkner the opposition would like to see rolled into this process. It continues:</para><quote><para>“Fundamentally, these Bills substantially cut the rights of asylum seekers to have access to our legal system to establish a claim as a refugee”, says Law Council President, Anne Trimmer. “Australia voluntarily accepted this obligation when it ratified the Refugee Convention and made it part of our law. Any person within the territory of Australia, whether an unauthorised arrival or not, must have a right of access to the courts, in particular to have decisions of government officials which affect their rights reviewed by the courts”.</para><para>“Some of the Bills relate to matters which are already covered by Bills that have previously been introduced and not passed, and are rightly languishing because they could not command support. These include the Bill to block judicial review, and the Bill to block `class actions' by asylum seekers”.</para><para>“Labor has previously strongly opposed these initiatives. Why is there now bipartisan support for such draconian measures?” asks Ms Trimmer. </para></quote><para>The Law Council goes on to say:</para><quote><para>In the last three years, the Federal Government has been advocating strong measures to address the boatloads of unauthorised arrivals, by seeking to limit these people's access to the legal system. These initiatives deny people affected by an adverse decision by a Federal Government bureaucrat the right to have that decision independently reviewed by [the] court. The Labor Party has consistently opposed these initiatives.</para><para>The Law Council believes that the proposed restrictions on access to judicial review are not necessary or consistent with the basic principles of fairness. Rights of judicial review for this category of decision are already very restricted. Previous legislation designed to restrict the use of judicial review has not succeeded in reducing the number of applications for judicial review by the courts. Similar problems exist in the legislation attempting to restrict the use of class actions.</para><para>The Border Protection Bill seeks to effectively exclude parts of Australian territory from the operation of Australian law, because the Bill prevents people who have landed in certain parts of Australia from accessing Australian law. Australia is a signatory to the Refugee Convention, and has undertaken to give effect to the obligations contained in the Convention.  “It is contrary to the spirit of the Convention, and the operation of our legal system, that the legal rights of refugees are restricted or removed in certain parts of Australia”.</para></quote><para>There is more to that press release. I have another one from the President of the Australian Council of Civil Liberties, Mr Terry O'Gorman, expressing great concern and attacking the mandatory sentencing components in these bills, which were introduced into the federal parliament just two days ago, relating to changes in the Migration Act.</para><para>The opposition is on a real test here, being part of the process of railroading legislation that is important and fundamental to Australia's precept of civil liberties. The rights of individuals both Australian and non-Australian within our territories are at stake. If the government has not changed position on this legislation, philosophically Labor has. I counsel Labor to reflect upon that and, even if it does not, to do the right thing by exposing itself to the concerns of its own constituency in this matter. We should proceed with probity. We should proceed with the fundamental delay that is required to allow feedback to be heard. Therefore, I oppose the motion.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Paul (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Calvert)</inline>—The question is that these bills may proceed without formalities.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>11:13:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

I will not debate the bills; I will simply debate the substance of the motion before us, as detailed under standing order 113(2). I will not be seeking to call a division on this. We do not want to unreasonably hold up the proceedings of the Senate, but we do want to draw attention to the questions that are being put before us and the issues and the importance of this process that we are going through. Given the unseemly—one might say, obscene—haste involved in this, I think it is necessary that as much opportunity as possible is given to the public, the media and those interested in these issues to be aware of not just the detail of the bills but the process that we are going through in relation to them.</para></talk.start><para>The effect of the motion that has been moved by Senator Ian Campbell is to allow the questions for any of the several stages of the consideration and passage of the bills to be put together in one motion. It would allow consideration of the bills to occur together in the committee of the whole and for the reading of the short titles only on every order for the reading of the bills. I do not have a problem with the reading of the short titles only on every order for the reading of the bills—I can live with that—but, again, taking the bills together goes to a procedural issue. Again, it is a machinery motion, but machinery motions have practical consequences.</para><para>One of the practical consequences is that this will again potentially limit the opportunity for consideration of these bills because, even though these bills come as a package of measures, taken individually each bill is separate and distinct—particularly the <inline ref="R1412">Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001</inline>. You could argue that the <inline ref="R1413">Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001</inline> and the <inline ref="R1414">Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001</inline> are linked—and in that sense I could probably support these being dealt with together—but the border protection bill is clearly a distinct bill. There are distinct concerns raised about it. Indeed, it is specific and generic to court proceedings that may well still be current. I have seen reports that an appeal in the case dealing with the activities of the government in regard to the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> is still being considered and may well proceed to the High Court. So that is quite feasibly still before the courts or still part of court proceedings. The border protection bill goes to the very heart of that proceeding.</para><para>I think it is therefore important that the border protection bill be dealt with separately. There are very distinct and specific questions in relation to it and, indeed, about the order of priority for the package of bills. The Democrats believe that in regard to this bill, which basically seeks to overturn the proceedings that are currently before the courts and retrospectively validate any illegal action, we should see what the court proceedings produce. Unfortunately, the migration area has a sad history in our country. A lack of attention to proper legal principles and processes and an overturning of basic legal rights and civil rights are probably more prevalent in the migration area in our legislative history than in any other area, and that goes right back to 1901 and the introduction of the White Australia policy. We have seen 100 years of a range of quite shameful actions by the Australian parliament in the overturning and undermining of basic rights in the migration area. The border protection bill is another development in that sad history.</para><para>There was a bill—I cannot recall the name of it—passed by the larger parties in this place some time back that again sought to retrospectively overturn and invalidate a decision of the High Court in the migration area. I am fairly sure that related to a refugee matter—certainly, it was a migration matter. Again, I think that shows the dangers involved. I talked before, in the debate on the previous motion, about the fundamental underpinning of our system of government: the separation of powers. I think we have done some dangerous actions in the past in reducing the roles of the courts that are enshrined in our Constitution and the protection that they provide for Australian citizens as well as others.</para><para>The border protection bill is another bill that engages in that dangerous practice. It seeks to retrospectively validate actions which may well have been illegal and on which court proceedings are currently under way. The Democrats believe that bill should be considered separately. It should not just be squashed in together with other bills that deal with excising Christmas Island and other territories from our migration zone. It is a separate bill, with separate and very distinct characteristics and components. It has, as with the other two bills, been introduced only very recently, with absolutely no public consultation, and there has been virtually no opportunity for public consideration since these bills have been introduced. To try and rush all these bills through together simply reduces further the opportunity for consideration of the important matters that are contained in the bill.</para><para>As I stated before, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, through the <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline>, highlighted significant concerns about each of these three bills—separate concerns distinct to each bill, which of course we have not got any response to yet—not concerns about the package as a whole, with one bunch of questions. Senator Brown will move a motion, which we will consider later on, about referring these three bills to a committee. Again, as I indicated on the previous motion, if there were support from the opposition for even a brief consideration of these three bills by the public in a Senate committee, we would be less concerned about this motion that the bills be taken together.</para><para>But, given the obscene haste in relation to these bills in a matter as fundamental and crucial as those dealt with in these separate bills, allowing a machinery motion to go through that would expedite passage of these bills without the opportunity for complete consideration is something that we, the Democrats, would be concerned about. There are significant concerns and they should be properly examined. If a committee had the opportunity to do that, then at least there may be some recognition of the validity of the bills being taken together.</para><para>I do not know if it is unprecedented to try and oppose bills being taken together. I would think that bills probably have been separated before where it is appropriate. Perhaps it is not common, but this is not common legislation, these are not common times and the sorts of things being attempted in these bills are not common. Extreme circumstances require extreme vigilance on the part of the Senate, particularly in an atmosphere of concern, uncertainty and apprehension. This is precisely the time when bodies such as the Senate should take a calm, considered view of legislation and should not just allow itself to be caught up in the torrent of fevered apprehension, some of which has been quite deliberately whipped up and exacerbated by this government in relation to these issues. It is a crucial issue and that is why we believe that these bills should not be taken together.</para><para>I add a further point that is not just in relation to legal principles and process: let us not forget that these bills deal with life and death issues. That might sound dramatic, but it is absolutely the case. These are life and death issues. You cannot get a more serious issue than that and there cannot be a more serious responsibility for a body like the Senate than dealing with life and death issues. They are much more important, I would argue, than even all those niceties about civil liberties, legal rights, the underpinnings of our rule of law and fabric of the Constitution—although they are all pretty important too! Life and death stuff, I think, is pretty significant: we have had a lot of death that people have had to deal with in recent times and it is not much fun. It is very disturbing for people. Plenty more of that could potentially occur and we, in relation to issues like this, should make sure that we absolutely uphold our responsibility to examine those things properly in a calm and considered way—and it is sometimes hard to stay calm when you are dealing with life and death issues—and that is something that would best be met by considering these bills separately. That is why we oppose this motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>27491</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree with what Senator Bartlett has said.

The chamber will realise that the reason that there is some fuss about it at this time is to ensure that we have a proper opportunity to consider the measures in the legislation that has come before us. All I am doing is appealing both to the government and the opposition to just give us a bit of time. In the end, I may not change how I think about the matters at the present moment, but there are issues which I would like to canvass with a range of contacts that I have got in this particular area. </para></talk.start><para>It is quite significant, as has been said by Senator Bartlett, that the <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> has alerted us to certain key situations, particularly about the border protection legislation. I have only just got the <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> in my hands. I will not repeat what has been said about it: I presume Senator Bartlett has pointed out what is in here in support of his argument.</para><para>I am going to vote against the motion that they be taken together. You can do that objectively because, as Senator Bartlett has pointed out, they are distinct pieces of legislation with different objectives. I am going to vote against this type of proposition for the first time in the 26 years I have been here, and I will do so just as an appeal to give us a bit of time. Give us until next week to have a look at the ramifications of these bills. That is why I am opposing what would normally be a formal proposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>27492</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I hear what Senator Harradine has just had to say. I am motivated similarly to appeal through this procedure, to the opposition in particular, for time to be allowed for these hugely important matters to be discussed. As Senator Bartlett said, and I cannot run them off as well as he did, not only matters of jurisprudence and civil liberties and suchlike but matters of life and death are being considered in this migration legislation. It gives power to the Australian government, and therefore involves the assent of the Australian people, to deal with people in desperate situations and determine the outcome that will occur there. </para></talk.start><para>I read somewhere in the last couple of days that many people could be given cause to think again about the government's approach to asylum seekers when one of those boats founders and bodies start washing up on the shore. I hope we do not have to come to that point to reconsider the direction in which the government is going. It is proper that we take time to think through the very important ramifications of these three bills, which ought to be taken separately. Certainly, if not all three bills are taken separately then the first and the second bills ought to be dealt with separately because they are about quite different matters. I will come to that in a moment. I want to complete quoting the pertinent comments coming from the Law Council of Australia on the matter. Their media release quotes the President of the Law Council, Anne Trimmer, as saying yesterday: </para><quote><para> ... the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>case raised many complex issues about the power of the Federal Government to act in the manner that it did, and the operation of the Migration Act in such cases. The decision should be studied carefully before any legislation addressing this issue is enacted. </para></quote><para>We cannot say that we have studied the issue carefully. It is patently obvious that the Senate has not carefully studied the issue simply because the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which has put questions to the government on this matter, has not been able to get a response and the Senate does not have that response. Ms Trimmer said: </para><quote><para>The Law Council does not pretend that there is an easy answer to resolve the problem of unauthorised boat arrivals. The political handling of the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> crisis sent a very mixed message to the international community. The legislative package—</para></quote><para>that is, the one we are dealing with today—</para><quote><para>will only serve to compound perceptions that Australia is ignoring the basic human rights of asylum seekers and its international obligations in relation to such people. </para></quote><para>The media release went on to say: </para><quote><para>Several commentators in the last few days have correctly identified that Australia's policy towards asylum seekers should not be another casualty of the terrible tragedy in the United States last week. </para></quote><para>The media release quotes former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald </inline>of two days ago: </para><quote><para>If we want the boat people to go away, we have to go to the source of the problem and persuade other countries that we should all act more effectively and more humanely. </para></quote><para>Ms Trimmer concluded with these words: </para><quote><para>Short-term political considerations should not be the driving force for the policy of either of the major parties—</para></quote><para>she could well include all parties, Independents and others—</para><quote><para>when you are dealing with the lives and safety of people fleeing from desperate situations. </para></quote><para>Finally, the media release states: </para><quote><para>The Law Council urges both major parties to rethink these policies which will—</para></quote><para>in the council's view—</para><quote><para>undermine Australia's accessible and fair legal system. </para></quote><para>They are very sobering comments, and the opposition should heed them. I do not think any of us are going to say that the awesome tragedy in the United States, the heinous terrorist attack on the United States of just eight or nine days ago, is a totally overriding matter which is, quite rightly, diverting public attention from other matters being dealt with by the parliament. I am intrigued by the fact that there has been so little debate in this place about the terrorist actions in the United States. I asked a question about the matter on Tuesday. I am not sure if other questions have been asked or other motions put; certainly legislation has not come before us in this huge public debate. The parliament—including the opposition— has been galvanised by other important matters like the Ansett collapse, but I would ask it to be as judicious and as thorough in not just looking for solutions but in analysing the government's propositions in this matter as it has been in that matter. </para><para>These three bills are different. If you go to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, a multiparty committee of the Senate which has met in response to these bills and given its report to the Senate just two hours ago, it says that the <inline ref="R1412">Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001</inline>:</para><quote><para>... proposes to validate certain actions taken into relation to vessels carrying persons reasonably believed to be intending to enter Australia unlawfully. These provisions: </para></quote><para>·	apply to any action taken by the Commonwealth or others in relation to particular vessels in the period commencing on 27 August 2001 and ending on the day on which the bill commences—</para><para>that is, is enacted. Secondly, the provisions of the bill: </para><para>·	specify that any such action was lawful when it occurred—</para><para>that is retrospective, making anything that may have happened in dealing with the asylum seekers illegal. Thirdly, these provisions: </para><para>·	provide that no proceedings against the Commonwealth or others may be instituted or continued in any court in respect of these actions.</para><para>There is one exception, and that is High Court action against improper use of authority by a Commonwealth officer. That matter is brought into this legislation only because senators, including me, drew attention to the fact that the <inline ref="R1404">Border Protection Bill 2001</inline>, which was rushed into this place three weeks ago, attempted to be unconstitutional in that it tried to override people's access to the High Court. That is one of the glitches that has been picked up in the current legislation. Notwithstanding that, I draw the attention of senators to the fact that news overnight reported that an appeal to the High Court is being contemplated on the Federal Court full bench decision.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—It's not going to happen.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—The injudicious senator opposite says, `It's not going to happen.'

If that is the case, it should alarm opposition senators and government senators alike, because that is not a proper use of the parliament.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—We make the laws.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Senator McGauran says, `We make the laws,' and my response to that is that we also should abide by the laws. In this legislation, as the Senate committee pointed out, there is a move to make lawful any breach of the law that has occurred in the last month in dealing with asylum seekers. Senator McGauran may interject that, `We make the laws,' but I put it to him, his minister and his Prime Minister that we abide by the laws, too, or we take the consequences. You do not come in here with retrospective legislation to say, `If we have acted illegally, we will simply make it okay.' Tell that to the average citizen out there in relation to whatever matter in which they may have been netted by the law, and ask them what they think of politicians who bring in retrospective legislation to cover their own tracks when it comes to potential breaches of the law. I ask the government—and I will be pursuing this very vigorously in this debate—what are the breaches that the government is concerned about? What advice has it had? It can tell me in general terms that it has been in breach of the law in dealing with the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> asylum seekers, because prima facie that has happened and that is why this retrospective legislation is here.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The <inline ref="R1414">Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001</inline>, the second bill at hand, is very different. Its intention is to excise Christmas Island, the Ashmore and Cartier Islands and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands from Australia in terms of the application of the Migration Act, and there are regulations to allow that process to continue. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs may remove any other prescribed external territory and may also remove any prescribed island that forms part of a state or territory—and there we have the real problem, that Tasmania comes within that definition. I am not, as a Tasmanian senator, ever going to support a piece of legislation that treats our state differently from all the other states.</para><para>The government and even the opposition might argue that no minister is going to regulate to remove Tasmania from the conditions or the law of immigration in this country. If that is the case, we should not leave that potential there. This is a Henry VIII law which potentially enables a minister to regulate to excise further parts of Australia's territory for the purposes of the Migration Act—and, under regulation, those laws could stand for months before parliament had an opportunity to overturn them. I do not believe we should be giving the minister those powers. This bill to excise parts of Australia from the migration zone is very different to the <inline ref="R1404">Border Protection Bill 2001</inline>. The third bill, the <inline ref="R1412">Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001</inline>, is consequent upon the previous one. It provides powers for the Commonwealth to deal with people who find themselves washed up, floating into or in some way or other in an excised offshore place, such as Christmas Island or the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</para><para>It is an unusual move—and it may be unprecedented—to want to have these bills dealt with separately. But the consequences of these separate and different pieces of legislation are huge, so they should be dealt with not only separately but also very carefully and with time allowed for better public scrutiny and input to the Senate. I believe this chamber will be failing in its constitutional role as a house of review if it does not allow at least some days for public input on these important pieces of legislation. </para><para>These are rough, turbulent and fearful times for our nation; all the more important that the Senate scrutinise government legislation which aims to change long held values, remove rights and circumscribe civil liberties with regard not only to asylum seekers but also to Australians who find themselves, one way or another, involved with asylum seekers who are seeking to come in by an unlawful manner, because of their desperation in fleeing from circumstances which most Australians, I might say, could scarcely conceive of.

We cannot imagine that, under the Senate procedures—even by putting these bills together—there will be any limit on any senator to debate these matters, to move amendments in the committee stage, to speak as long as they like—often to the frustration of others, particularly managers of government business who do not want people to speak that often—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—They can vote on them separately, as well.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—They can vote on them separately.

I therefore believe that the concerns of the senators who want to separate them are not warranted in this case. I would be very surprised if, by the time we finish the debate on these bills at the third reading, they have not had plenty of opportunity to express in every way they like their concerns, their opposition and their amendments to aspects of these individual bills.

sovereignty, including in the matter of entry of people to Australia, will be protected by this parliament and the government.</para><para>The Australian public expects its government to exert control over our borders, including the maritime borders to our north.</para><para>In the light of growing threats to our borders I am introducing a package of three inter-related bills today. </para><para>These bills are the Migration Amendment (Excision From Migration Zone) Bill, a consequential bill, and finally a bill to enhance our border protection powers and confirm that recent actions taken in relation to vessels carrying unauthorised arrivals, including the MV Tampa, are valid.</para><para>Before providing an overview of the objectives of each of these bills, I need to explain why we are doing this - why we are doing what the Australian public expects we should do.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Growth of unauthorised boat arrivals</inline></para><para>We all know about the dramatic increase over the past few years in the number of unauthorised people who have been arriving in Australia by boat - we read about it every month in our newspapers.</para><para>In the late 1970's we had some unauthorised boat arrivals from Vietnam, in the late 1980's some from Cambodia, and in the mid 1990's some from the People's Republic of China.</para><para>However these were comparatively small in numbers, and importantly Australia could have been considered as a country of first asylum for people fleeing some of these countries.</para><para>What has changed since then has been the growth of organised criminal gangs of people smugglers who are motivated not by any desire to help others, but by base motives of greed.</para><para>This form of organised crime is found throughout the world and preys on people who are unwilling, for whatever reason, to go through normal procedures for entry to the country of destination.</para><para>Many of the people moved around the world by these smugglers have either no protection needs, or have bypassed effective protection arrangements in countries closer to their home, simply so they can achieve their preferred migration outcome.</para><para>To give some indication of the way in which people smuggling has affected Australia, in the financial year 1998 to 1999 there were 921 unauthorised arrivals by boat on Australian shores.</para><para>In the financial year 2000 to 2001 this number had increased to 4,141 unauthorised arrivals.</para><para>In the last full calendar month - august 2001 - no fewer than 1,212 people arrived in an unauthorised way on Australian shores.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Work of government to combat people smuggling</inline></para><para>So it is apparent that these criminal gangs have been targeting Australia, among other countries.</para><para>We as a government have worked assiduously to counter this evil trade.</para><para>We are working with other governments and with international organisations towards prevention of the problem by minimising the outflows from countries of origin and secondary outflows from countries of first asylum.</para><para>We are also working with other countries to disrupt people smugglers and intercept their customers en route to their destination.</para><para>However, regardless of much effort by many governments, law enforcement agencies and international organisations, the illegal trade in people smuggling persists. </para><para>The smugglers don't care what happens to the people who get on boats arranged by them.</para><para>They don't care what happens to the boats themselves.</para><para>They don't check to see whether the people being smuggled are criminals or genuine asylum seekers.</para><para>The only thing they care about is getting paid.</para><para>According to media reports there are at least another 5,000 people currently in Indonesia and Malaysia who are waiting for arrangements to be finalised with the people smugglers for travel to Australia by boat.</para><para>Further media reports indicate that the smugglers are determined to collect their payments and continue their dirty business.</para><para>We also know that the steps we have taken, and will take, to front up to the most recent arrivals, are being watched as a sign of how determined we are.</para><para>We have to act to show our strong determination that these smugglers don't get their own way.</para><para>The Australian public demands it.</para><para>The government is determined to stop these smugglers, and this package of bills is an important step in achieving our goals.</para><para>The third in this package of bills will provide for minimum mandatory sentences for people convicted of people smuggling offences under the Migration Act.   </para><para>The changes will provide that repeat offenders should be sentenced to at least 8 years imprisonment, whilst first offenders should be sentenced to at least 5 years.</para><para>Those provisions will send a red light to would-be people smugglers.</para><para>This first of the three bills is designed to fulfill the commitment the Prime Minister made on the eighth of September to excise some Australian territories from the migration zone.</para><para>The territories principally involved are the Ashmore and Cartier islands in the Timor Sea, Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, and offshore resource and similar installations.</para><para>The government has also decided that the territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands should be excised from the migration zone with effect from noon yesterday, the 17th of  September.</para><para>These territories will become `excised offshore places', which will mean that simply arriving unlawfully at one of them will not be enough to allow visa applications to be made.</para><para>The effects of this bill will be limited only to those who arrive without lawful authority.</para><para>Australian citizens and others with authority to enter or reside in the territories will not be affected.</para><para>I will shortly be introducing the second in this package of bills, which will deal with consequential matters flowing from the decision to excise these territories from the migration zone.</para><para>The third bill that I will introduce today will deal with validation of the government's actions in relation to vessels carrying unauthorised arrivals, such as the MV Tampa, and to enhance our border protection powers.</para><para>The package should not be misinterpreted as `fortress Australia' legislation.  </para><para>Australia will continue to honour our international protection obligations.</para><para>We can be, and we are, justly proud of our immigration record and our welcome to settlers from all over the world.</para><para>Since 1945, almost 5.7 million people have come to Australia from other countries. </para><para>Almost 600 000 of those have come to Australia under our refugee and humanitarian programs.</para><para>Today, nearly one in four of Australia's 19 million people were born overseas. </para><para>Australian society has embraced people from around 150 different ethnic groups and nationalities.</para><para>A central part of Australia's commitment to migration has been its open and generous refugee resettlement programs. </para><para>On a per capita basis, Australia is second only to Canada in its generosity to refugees and people of humanitarian concern.</para><para>Australia's record is impressive against any measure and has been achieved by the determination of many governments to ensure that our programs are transparent and fair. </para><para>However, the success of migration to Australia also depends on the integrity that our programs have demonstrated.</para><para>This integrity cannot be maintained if Australia's maritime borders can be crossed at will.</para><para>The message that we, as a country, want to send has two elements:</para><para>·	Australia is a country whose nation building record owes much to those who migrate here, and we will continue to welcome those whom we invite.</para><para>·	But, we will not tolerate violation of our sovereignty and we are determined to combat organised criminal attempts to land people illegally on our shores.</para><para>In summary, this is an important package of bills for both the government and the Australian people. </para><para>It will significantly reduce incentives for people to make hazardous voyages to Australian territories.</para><para>It will help ensure that life is made as difficult as possible for those criminals engaged in the people smuggling trade.</para><para>Most of all, it will help ensure that the integrity of our maritime borders and our refugee program is maintained.</para><para>I commend the bill to the chamber.</para><para>—————</para><para>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL</para><para>This bill is the second in a package of three bills designed to ensure that Australia has control over who crosses our maritime borders.</para><para>The purpose of this bill is to make some consequential amendments to the Migration Act and Migration Regulations following the excision of some Australian territories from the migration zone in respect of unauthorised arrivals.  </para><para>The clear message of the bill is that people who abandon or bypass effective protection opportunities will not be rewarded by the grant of a permanent visa for Australia.</para><para>There are over 22 million refugees and people of concern to the UNHCR world wide and limited resources available to deal with them. </para><para>The refugees convention does not confer a right on any of these people to choose their country of asylum.  </para><para>It is clearly up to Australia to determine who can cross our borders, who can stay in Australia, and under what conditions such people can remain.</para><para>This bill therefore provides strengthened powers to deal with people who arrive unlawfully at one of the territories beyond the migration zone.  </para><para>These include powers to move the person to another country where their claims, if any, for refugee status may be dealt with.</para><para>Related provisions in the bill will preclude the institution of legal proceedings relating to such people in any court - apart from the High Court.</para><para>Finally, the bill amends the Migration Regulations to implement a visa regime aimed at deterring further movement from, or the bypassing of, other safe countries.</para><para>It does this by creating further disincentives to unauthorised arrival in Australia by those who seek to use smugglers to achieve a resettlement place they may well not need - a place taken from refugees with no other options available to them.</para><para>Unauthorised arrivals and those who leave their countries of first asylum will be able to be granted only temporary visas for Australia.</para><para>They will not have any family reunion rights.</para><para>For people such as those who have recently attempted to enter Australia by boat there will be no access to permanent residence, and their period of stay on temporary visas will be limited to three years, after which their situation will be reassessed.</para><para>I commend the bill to the chamber.</para><para>—————</para><para>BORDER PROTECTION (VALIDATION AND ENFORCEMENT POWERS) BILL</para><para>This bill is the third in a package of three bills designed to ensure that Australia has control over who crosses our maritime borders.</para><para>The purpose of this bill is to enhance our border protection powers and to confirm that recent actions taken in relation to vessels carrying unauthorised arrivals to Australian waters are valid. </para><para>Those who enter our territorial waters contrary to an express direction from the government should not be rewarded by being allowed to stay in our waters or, even worse, by having the opportunity to enter our land territory. </para><para>This legislation will ensure that there is no doubt about the validity of our border control powers and the government's actions in relation to vessels such as the MV Tampa. </para><para>The protection of our sovereignty, including Australia's sovereign right to determine who shall enter Australia, is a matter for the Australian government and this parliament. </para><para>Consequently, sections 4, 5 and 6 ensure that actions taken in relation to the Tampa since 27 august of this year are taken for all purposes to have been lawful when they occurred.</para><para>This also extends to actions taken in relation to the `Aceng', a boat from Indonesia which later attempted to enter Australian waters near Ashmore Reef.</para><para>The bill also will enhance the border protection powers found in the Customs Act and the Migration Act, including the provision of powers to move vessels carrying unauthorised arrivals and those on board.</para><para>It is essential to have these powers.</para><para>They will be exercised in line with our international maritime obligations to ensure the safety of those concerned.</para><para>The maintenance of Australian sovereignty includes our sovereign right to determine who will enter and reside in Australia.</para><para>The provisions in this bill are overwhelmingly in Australia's national interest.  </para><para>In fact one of the great enduring responsibilities of a government is to protect the integrity of Australia's borders.</para><para>Finally, the bill provides mandatory sentencing arrangements for people convicted of people smuggling offences under the Migration Act.   </para><para>These offences apply where 5 or more people are smuggled and carry a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment.</para><para>The changes will provide that repeat offenders should be sentenced to at least 8 years imprisonment, whilst first offenders should be sentenced to at least 5 years.</para><para>The mandatory sentencing arrangements will not however apply to minors.</para><para>I commend the bill to the chamber.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of these bills be adjourned to the first day of the 2001 summer sittings, in accordance with standing order

It knows, as well as all the rest of us do, that whatever supporters of the government might think, there are a huge number of opposition supporters who want to have this legislation properly dealt with, and that means properly scrutinised. I have already spoken about the Law Council of Australia and the Council for Civil Liberties being seriously alarmed, opposing this legislation at the outset and drawing attention to very serious shortcomings of the bills at hand.

Is the opposition really going to support Prime Minister John Howard in railroading this legislation through the Senate without an opportunity for the people of Australia to have a look at it and comment—not least the experts in this country who deal with matters of immigration, law, human rights, and our obligations under a range of international treaties dealing with the handling of refugees and with human rights? </para><para>As I understand it, it is a fundamental of Labor Party philosophy, if not policy, that human rights be protected and not be summarily passed away by the railroading of legislation through the parliament. I believe that, whatever else it may think about the Senate, it accepts that this is a house of review where the excesses of an executive government in the House of Representatives can be—if not stopped— slowed down, so the public has an opportunity to have a look at what we are dealing with. If the opposition does not support this move to enable the public to give us input before we finally deal with this legislation, it is falling into line with the Howard government philosophy and cutting the people of Australia out from this debate. It cannot do that; it should not do that; it must not do that. In the run-up to an election—where it is a concern that Prime Minister Howard is motivated not only by the idea of improving his stocks in the public domain but also by seeing the polls go that way and, worst of all, by the overshadowing awful tragedy in the United States—we cannot allow to slip through this place legislation which is going to affect immigrants, illegal or otherwise, to this country and Australian citizens' rights for a long, long time to come. </para><para>For the first time in federal law, mandatory sentencing appears.

I want to talk about this further in the debate on the second reading of the bill, but let me just refer to it at the moment. The bill provides for mandatory sentencing of five years or eight years for citizens of Australia or other people who are involved in bringing groups of five or more `illegal' immigrants—that is, asylum seekers—into the country in the future. As I understand it, had that law applied when the East Timorese were illegally in this country—after they had been told to go—during the occupation of their country by Indonesia, and the nuns and others from the Catholic Church and others in the churches were giving those people refuge, it is not drawing too long a bow to say that they may have been subject to this mandatory sentencing provision. The Labor Party ought to look very carefully at that. I want to see what the Labor Party's legal advice on this matter is, because this is alarming stuff. As I said, I will come to it later. This legislation also overrules all other laws of the country. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESI-DENT</name></talker><para>—Senator Brown, could I interrupt you for a moment.

This package of legislation removes the right of citizens to have access to the courts of this country. I reiterate that all this is happening in a background of a potential appeal to the High Court, consequent on the ruling of the Full Bench of the Federal Court in the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>issue. Therefore, it has very serious ramifications as far as the time-honoured tradition of upholding people's basic rights to appeal to courts is concerned in this country.

If it were not for the Senate that effort to overrule the High Court, which I think would have failed because it was unconstitutional, would have gone through this place. The Labor Party is now taking part in a similar process of railroading through this place legislation with enormous consequences as far as legal and human rights in this country are concerned. We go now to the business of excision of parts of the country, dividing the country up for the application of law differently in one place to another. Where does that end? This is the start of a process which is open-ended. It is even open-ended in this legislation as it allows the minister by statute to draw the line differently, to include other external territories and, indeed, all other islands that are part of states or territories, including my home state of Tasmania.</para><para>One would agree that it is unlikely to occur, but that potential should never be allowed under legislation which treats all states equally. I will be moving to amend that provision when we get to debate the bill.

The bills, as I indicated and will be saying when we get into the second reading debate, are very important bills and are dramatically different from the bill we debated here three weeks ago. I have gone into the content of the legislation. One of the really important differences with the main bill is that we have actually seen it before it reached the chamber, whereas on the previous occasion we did not even see the bill prior to its entering the chamber. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party, the opposition party in this place, did not get a chance to look at the bill prior to it being introduced in the House of Representatives.

If it is bad legislation, we will oppose it, we will block it and we will not allow it to pass.

I have spoken already today on this matter to a small degree, as people may have heard, and I will not repeat some of those points. This is a specific motion and I will speak specifically to it. It deals with one of the fundamental roles and responsibilities of the Senate, which is to ensure that legislation put forward by the executive is considered properly—put very bluntly: that we know what the hell we are doing when we vote on the thing. Quite frankly, there is no doubt that, if these bills were voted on without consideration, lots of senators would not actually know what the hell they were doing and what we were really letting ourselves in for, let alone what we were letting asylum seekers in for, if we passed these bills.</para></talk.start><para>I think the ramifications and consequences in a whole range of areas are things that not only the public but many in this chamber are not aware of. Surely, in our role as a parliament, as a Senate and as a legislature we have the responsibility to be aware of what it is we are inflicting on the Australian public and, indeed, on the world. These bills will not only deal with, and have an impact on, the domestic level; they will obviously have an impact internationally on people who are seeking protection from persecution. They may be put at greater risk of not getting that protection. I believe the bills will have international significance in the future direction of the ongoing debate about how to deal with the problem of asylum seekers, displaced people and refugees. As I and many others have said a number of times, it is a global problem; it is not just an Australian problem. Indeed, our exposure to it is a lot less than for many other countries. It is a debate that is flourishing and ongoing, not just in Australia but in many parts of the world. It is a debate that is probably going to intensify if the conflict eventuates that is likely to occur as a result of the terrorist attacks in the United States.</para><para>I hope that the international cooperation that is unfolding in relation to a response to that terrorist attack includes international consideration of and cooperation on what to do about the consequences for those who are victims of any conflict—the consequences for not only future refugees but the existing ones. Clearly, the global community has failed to address that issue effectively. That is why people are seeking protection as unauthorised arrivals, rather than going through the UN system. The UN system, whilst it tries its best, is dramatically flawed, and many people cannot access protection and there is not much likelihood of gaining protection. With that system not working, it is no surprise that people pursue other avenues to get protection and safety. We need to be working cooperatively internationally to ensure that there is a better system or that that system improves dramatically. Otherwise, regardless of what laws we put in place here, the issue of people arriving here illegally will continue. It is a problem being generated by the persecution of people not only in Afghanistan but in many places around the world and by an inadequate international system for providing assistance to those people.</para><para>There is no perfect or easy solution, but this, as sure as hell, is not a solution. In terms of international ramifications, the concern I have is that Australia is looked to in relation to these issues. Many people have commented on our history in relation to refugees. We used to have a proud history that was influential in a global sense, in getting at least some improvement. The situation, such as it is at the moment, is due in no small part to the work that Australia and other nations have done in making that operate. Now that we are sending out these strong messages that we have changed our approach, both through our actions and legislation here and through direct commentary and contact with other governments, the way we are now going to deal with it is to try to stop people accessing protection. We have seen that already in the last few weeks and we see it in these bills.</para><para>It would not be unreasonable for other countries that bear a much greater burden than we do to look to Australia's lead and say, `Australia is obviously willing to trash the refugee convention through its legislation and is basically seeking to prevent people from accessing protection; we'll do the same thing.' Do you think that will solve our problem? No, it will make it worse. I think the international aspect is one that has not really been given much attention, not surprisingly, because of the immediacy of the situation and the impact on people arriving here. But I think it is also very dangerous in that international sense. That is just one issue that we will not be able to properly examine unless we get this put to a committee and are given advice and input—not just from people who work here in Australia with asylum seekers. I believe that, when you are dealing with legislation that goes right to the heart of some crucial international conventions, the opposition is quite right to be critical—and, along with others, it has been incredibly critical of this government's disgraceful undermining of international obligations in the human rights area. This legislation goes to the heart of some of those international issues on an international problem, and yet we are not going to have the opportunity to get a proper insight—nor any sort of insight—into what the likely international consequences will be. It is a global problem; we could have global input, but we are not going to enable ourselves to be aware of that now.</para><para>I have been involved in Senate inquiries before into some of these issues. I have to say that, before I came into this place, I was horrifyingly ignorant of some of these issues—and I am not suggesting that I am now fully across all of them. It is only through being able to examine some of these issues in detail that I have some appreciation of the significance of these issues and the fact that they have major international ramifications as well as local, domestic ones. </para><para>The Democrats strongly support this motion as an attempt to get at least something of a spotlight on what are, in my view, some of the most significant bills that we are going to consider, with ramifications that I do not think anybody has really thought through, beyond obviously the government thinking about their incredibly short-term, incredibly narrow, immediate political self-interest. That is clearly their motivation. The national interest does not rate with this government in relation to this issue. Put simply, political self-interest has been put first, second and last on the part of this government. For some time, but particularly at this moment, that is what has been driving their attitude and their rhetoric in relation to this. The social damage they are causing—the social division, the trashing of our international obligations, the trashing of the fabric of human rights—obviously does not count when it comes to short-term political gain. That is a great shame. </para><para>It is the role of the Senate, I believe, as a body independent of the government—the primary parliamentary body—to keep a check and a balance on the activities of government, to be able to operate, at least to some extent, beyond that short-term political gain of the government of the day and to take into account national and global interest. Unless we support this motion, again we will be passing up an opportunity to do that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>27505</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the motion to refer this migration legislation to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. It is important to have it go to the references committee so that we can question people from the various departments and others from the community on the ramifications of these pieces of legislation. This cannot adequately be done in the chamber, and that is why we have these committees—to consider and to invite people to give us their advice about the measures and the ramifications thereon. I want to say very clearly that I agree that this issue before us does raise a number of questions, including the question of the detention of persons without lawful authority. As I understand it, this legislation is going to be retrospective in respect of that matter. I have seen some legal views on this. We need further advice—or at least I do. You might be able to make your decisions, but I need further advice on this. One of the ways of getting this out in the open is to enable people to give evidence before a committee, and this legislation does raise the question of detention of persons without lawful authority.</para></talk.start><para>It of course raises the importance of Australia being able to protect its own borders lawfully. It highlights Australia's obligations under the refugee convention. It will put the spotlight on those obligations that require us to give refuge to those with a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. However, it also raises the very important issue of people smuggling and organised groups or gangs making a considerable pile out of human misery. I think that, unless tackled, people smuggling will put at risk the credibility of the refugee determination system itself, and that concerns me. I understand some of the points being made by the government and the opposition, but I do not believe the remedy is in denying the rights of others. This makes me very concerned.</para><para>I have a suggestion to the government, and I will make it during the debate, if we have much of a debate, at the committee stage. I say to Senator McKiernan that I understand what he says: if it goes to a committee and the report date is next Wednesday, what chance do we have to advertise for submissions and all the rest of it. But, to be frank, that is not of our doing, is it? Here is the legislation and the government wants it pursued. As has been indicated, the betting around the place is that we will not be back again after next week—I do not know about that— and so we have to consider the matter before the end of next week. Even a truncated inquiry would assist me and, I believe, other legislators in this important task.

Last night I outlined the compelling reasons why that should happen and, moreover, why people should be given time to make their submissions on a matter which is extraordinarily important in my home state of Tasmania and also in Victoria and New South Wales in particular. The fate of Australia's tall forests and rainforests in the south-east corner of this continent is very much at stake. What I did not say but what is obvious is that it is three years since the last committee hearing into this matter and in that time the regional forest agreements have been implemented and their functioning has become a reality. It is very important that the Senate gets to know about the functioning, or malfunctioning, of those regional forest agreements.</para></talk.start><para>I pointed out last night that one of the extraordinary shortcomings has been the forest practices code in Tasmania, which was supposed to give us the protection of the environment in those places being logged under the regional forest agreement, which of course is Mr Howard's document.

It clarifies questions of mobility of ongoing employees between the Australian Public Service and the Parliamentary Service, with the aim of maintaining a high standard of staffing within the Parliamentary Service over time.</para></talk.start><para>It may be appropriate at this time to put in a general thankyou to all the staff that work in the Parliamentary Service, who keep this place running and make our lives easier—be it the attendants here in the chamber, the Hansard staff, the invaluable staff in the Library or those who work in the Joint House Department. I would like to especially thank Shirley Simper from the office of the Leader of the Democrats, whose commitment to work and efficiency has long been recognised by our senators and staff.</para><para>The Australian Democrats have a long and proud record of support for the public sector, unmatched by anyone in this place. It is important to remember that this government has a poor record on the Public Service. It has no commitment at all to a strong, independent Public Service and has at many times made attempts to politicise that service. In the last decade, public sector jobs have disappeared as funding for many core services has been withdrawn. Instead of slowing, the winding back of the public sector looks set to continue as competition policy, contracting out and privatisation move into top gear. That means more job losses, lower levels of services— especially in regional areas—and higher prices for many services.</para><para>The casualisation that has occurred in many workplaces has also occurred within the public sector. It must be recognised that mobility rights are included only for ongoing employees, allowing them to have a career path within or between the Parliamentary Service and the Australian Public Service. However, the entitlements for leave for the growing class of non-ongoing employees in the public sector will continue to be paid out in cash at the end of their contract. This bill clarifies their role and is indicative of the actual situation both within the public and private sectors. The Australian Democrats support this bill as we recognise that ready mobility between the Public Service and the Parliamentary Service ensures an ease of attracting a high standard of public servant to the Parliamentary Service and vice versa.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>27509</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators for their contributions and commend the <inline ref="R1390">Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2001</inline> to the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>27509</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>27509</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>27509</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:</para></motion><para>Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2001, and the</para><para>Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001.</para><para>I also table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The statements read as follows</inline>—</para><para>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 2001</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Purpose of the Bill</inline></para><para>This Bill is designed to secure the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs' (DIMA) private sector sources of personal information, by way of amendment to portfolio legislation.</para><para>The amendments will ensure that DIMA will continue to receive information that is necessary to carry out its core activities and functions.

This bill deals with the Retirement Assistance for Farmers scheme, which commenced operation on 14 September 1997. It was a scheme which was established to enable farmers of pension age or of low income to gift or transfer their farm to other members of the family without it affecting their access to social security entitlements. At that time the then minister, Minister Anderson, announced with great fanfare that this scheme would result in some 10,000 farmers taking advantage of the scheme and arranging for the intergenerational transfer of their farms. As we have subsequently found out, the great predictions made by the minister at the time and subsequent ministers looking after agricultural matters or dealing with regional Australia were completely wide of the mark. In fact, as I understand it, only 2,000-odd farmers have made use of the scheme. Notwithstanding that failure of the government's original estimates, we have supported the operation of the scheme. </para></talk.start><para>This bill actually extends the finalisation date of the scheme. It was due to finish on 30 June 2001. However, some farmers, we understand, may have sought to access the scheme following that date or enquired about their eligibility who would still be eligible to take advantage of the scheme if the date were to be extended. So this bill does enable the scheme to be extended for up to a maximum of three months following that date upon which those farmers contacted Centrelink. So it is dealing with a specific, defined class of farmers who have already commenced the process of accessing the scheme. </para><para>I am not sure whether or not that actually includes any members of the coalition government who may be concerned about their future representation in this place, As I know a number of them are, they may need to consider what they will be doing in retirement once they leave this building, either voluntarily or by virtue of the result at the ballot box. In any event, they will not be eligible for the scheme unless they have already made application but, for the reasons that I have advanced, we will still be happy to support the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>27511</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The legislation provides for the Retirement Assistance for Farmers scheme to finish on 30 June 2001.

It is imperative because, unless citizens have the power to access and independently scrutinise government information, there is little prospect of having a genuinely deliberative and participatory democracy.

The amendments proposed by the bill give effect to an announcement made in the last budget. The critical change in this legislation is that the government has decided to introduce twice yearly indexation of Commonwealth superannuation pensions under the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, commonly known as the CSS, and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, commonly known as the PSS. This indexation will occur twice yearly on 1 July and 1 January for movements in the consumer price index for the previous half year. This will reduce the delay between the inflationary effects faced by superannuation pensioners and income adjustments. The change will commence from 1 January next year. At the present time the indexation arrangement is yearly. </para></talk.start><para>The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services, of which I am deputy chair, has considered this issue together with the issue of the rate at which the indexation occurs. I will come to that issue a little later. The Senate committee handed down a report in April 2001 titled <inline font-style="italic">A reasonable and secure retirement.</inline> The committee held a number of public hearings at the request of not just Commonwealth public superannuants but state public superannuants. It is important to point out that the problems we were dealing with and reviewing, as identified by former public servants, have an impact on Commonwealth public servants and state public servants. There is a variation of approach between the two jurisdictions. In the report on page 50, table 7 outlines the pension indexation arrangements for  Commonwealth and the main state superannuation schemes. Until this bill is passed and takes effect, the Commonwealth frequency of indexation is annual. The Commonwealth military scheme is annual. Indexation is annual for Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales. Frequency of indexation is biannual for Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. </para><para>The government announced in the budget that former or retired public servants who were members of the CSS and PSS will receive an important change in their indexation arrangements from annual to biannual. However, what surprised me and the Labor opposition was the exclusion of two categories of former Commonwealth public employees. One was the exclusion of former military personnel and the other was the exclusion of former Papua New Guinea government superannuants. In the former case, there are some 57,000 military superannuants. In the case of former PNG superannuants, I think the number is a few hundred. It was certainly surprising to the Labor opposition that, for some reason never really explained by the government, the retired military personnel and former PNG public servants were to be discriminated against and excluded from this change to indexation provisions. It has never been explained why this exclusion was to apply. Former PNG public servants and retired military personnel were formerly employed by the Commonwealth. To this day I do not believe we have received a satisfactory explanation. </para><para>Understandably, of course, former military personnel—some 57,000 of them—and people who are currently serving in the military were concerned about the discrimination that was proposed with this change to indexation arrangements. I received some representations from military personnel, both current and retired, about this matter. It was the view of the Labor Party that, as the government had accepted the principle that the indexation arrangements should be changed from yearly to biannual, that principle should apply also to the former military personnel and former PNG public servants. I think late afternoon on Monday or Tuesday of this week the government belatedly recognised the discrimination against military personnel and announced that the twice yearly indexation would be extended to 57,000 recipients of military superannuation pensions.</para><para>I would like to acknowledge the work of the shadow minister for defence science and personnel, Mr Laurie Ferguson. He was very active in the campaign to ensure that military superannuants were not discriminated against in the way that the government proposed. The government backed down on what was a shocking announcement in respect of military personnel. Mr Ferguson, on two separate occasions, had called for the minister, Mr Scott, in the other place to reverse this discrimination against retired military personnel and, finally, the minister accepted that advice. This issue reflects very poorly on the way in which the Liberal-National Party handled the superannuation indexation arrangements of military personnel.</para><para>I would also like to place on record the efforts of the Regular Defence Force Welfare Association. I acknowledge their persistent lobbying since this was announced in the budget and the contribution they have made to the government backdown on the indexation of the pension arrangements of military service personnel. I referred earlier to the report of the Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services. Government, Democrat and Labor members of that committee unanimously recommended that this change should occur to the arrangements for all public servants. The government's inclusion of that recommendation in its budget during May must be the quickest response to a committee recommendation that I have seen in recent times. There are a lot of other recommendations that they have spent years with, and some we have never had a response to.</para><para>I should also point out that our recommendation went to ensuring that state governments changed annual indexation to biannual indexation. As I read out earlier, there are three state governments that have annual indexation. Those are Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales. I think it is very important that we have a consistent principle applying to former public servants. Whether they were in the armed forces or were former police officers or ambulance officers or were in the general public service, we should have a consistent approach to their indexation arrangements around the country. In winding up, I would call on the Queensland, South Australian and New South Wales governments to ensure that the arrangements relating to frequency of indexation are changed for their former public servants. It would be absurd to have different arrangements in some states from those in other states in the Commonwealth. I would go further: regardless of whether they are Labor or Liberal states—one of them is a Liberal state and there are not too many of those left nowadays—but in the case of South Australia—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name></talker><para>—Not for long.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—Not for long, that is right. But whoever is in government we should ensure consistency of superannuation arrangements in respect of indexation around the country. I would go further and argue that the Commonwealth should legislate to ensure that we have a consistent approach, because I do not see how the continuation of inconsistent indexation arrangements can be tolerated.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Another issue has been raised by former public servants at state and Commonwealth level, and that is the base at which their pensions are indexed. At the present time, according to the survey I have pointed to, it is the CPI. Commonwealth and state public servants were seeking a change to the base of the indexation arrangements, either to some sort of wage indexation movement or to average male ordinary time earnings, which apply to current pension arrangements. </para><para>The committee did consider this, because it is an important issue and I understand the concern of retired public servants on this. I will not go into all the detail, but we asked the finance department for an estimated cost, if this change were to be made—this is in respect to Commonwealth responsibilities only—and the finance department told us that the cost would be approximately $700 million per annum. Therefore, regrettably, the majority of the committee—government and Labor—could not make that recommendation, based on the requests received. In the representations made since the committee's report was handed down, there has been some reasonable prima facie material presented to me at least to suggest that there is a question mark over the way in which the finance department arrived at the figure it gave to our committee. I do intend to seek further information about the finance department's estimates of the costs. I will have to check with my office whether that has gone into the department but, if I have not yet formally put it on notice, that request for further information will be going to the department, and hopefully we will receive a response very quickly.</para><para>In conclusion, the Labor opposition is, obviously, supporting this legislation. We are pleased to see that the government, after causing some months of worry for military personnel, has belatedly come to the view that it cannot discriminate against military personnel and has by way of amendment included in this legislation the 57,000 current recipients of military superannuation pensions. Obviously, this will impact on a growing number of military personnel as they retire. It is unfortunate that they have been worried and concerned about their exclusion from the announced provision, and belatedly that has been accepted. With the passing of the legislation here today, there will be a welcome change to the indexation arrangements for public servants more generally, and military and PNG pension indexation arrangements.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>27516</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to put on record the Democrats' support for this bill.

It had been the intention of the opposition to make fairly lengthy submissions on both bills when the bills were listed in the normal place on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. They have now been brought forward into non-controversial legislation. The government has sought the assistance of the opposition to expedite passage of both bills, and we have assented to that proposition. Accordingly, I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate my speech in the second reading debate on this bill.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows—</inline></para><para>The Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 2001 seeks to amend the telecommunications access regime contained in the Trade Practices Act 1974. It seeks to streamline the telecommunications access regime in a number of ways. </para><para>My colleague in the House of Representatives, Mr Smith, has outlined in some detail the Opposition's position on this Bill, and on telecommunications competition issues more generally. I will not repeat what Mr Smith has already said about this Bill.</para><para>However, I would like to speak briefly about the Senate inquiry into the Bill and then I will move a second reading amendment.</para><para>The Senate Environment, Communications IT and the Arts Committee reported on its inquiry into this Bill earlier this week.  Labor Senators provided a dissenting report to that Inquiry which set out one particular concern that had been raised by witnesses during Committee hearings. </para><para>This concern related to one of the ways the Bill seeks to streamline the telecommunications access regime, namely, by limiting the evidence available on appeals to the Australian Competition Tribunal (ACT) generally to that available to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).</para><para>A number of witnesses, including telecommunications carriers and the ACCC, called for the ACT's merits review of ACCC decisions to be abolished.</para><para>This issue arose in the context of the new section 152DOA in the Bill, which specifies the matters to which the ACT may have regard when it is conducting a review of a determination of the ACCC in arbitrating a telecommunications access dispute. </para><para>At present, review by the ACT is a re-arbitration of the dispute, and the Tribunal may have regard to any information, documents or evidence which it considers relevant, whether or not those matters were before the ACCC in the course of making its initial determination.</para><para>Proposed new section 152DOA will, in effect, limit the Tribunal to consideration of information, documents or evidence which were before the ACCC initially.</para><para>The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill explains the need for this amendment by stating that determinations by the ACCC “involve a lengthy and complex hearing process” and that restricting the material which the Tribunal may consider “will ensure that the Tribunal process involves a review of the Commission's decision, rather than a complete re-arbitration of the dispute”.</para><para>The Explanatory Memorandum also states that “Although this option should reduce delay in the review of Commission decisions, it will reduce the extent of Tribunal review. On balance, it is considered that the limitations on the review are justified on the basis of the length and depth of the Commission's arbitration process.</para><para>The primary concern of the carriers who are seeking to abolish the merits review altogether is the time and delay in access pricing decisions, particularly when there is a merits review and the lengthy process commences de novo.</para><para>The carriers had some valid arguments for abolishing the merits review. In particular they argued that:</para><para>·	In this fast-moving market, it is only feasible for one body to consider the basic matters because the availability of a review process (in addition to avenues of judicial review) gives competitors an opportunity to delay if it is to their competitive advantage. Witnesses representing the carriers were particularly concerned that the review de novo by the ACT can be utilised for `regulatory gaming', that is, using the regulatory resources and muscle of the organisation at every opportunity to frustrate competitive entry through exploiting the regulatory regime to try to exhaust competitor resources.</para><para>·	The ACCC process is already lengthy, more thorough and performed by people with greater expertise than the ACT review, so the value of merits review is dubious. The length and detail of the first instance process by the ACCC questions the need for a merits review.</para><para>·	The ACCC better placed to determine these matters because it has the background expertise and experience, whereas the ACT has never considered a telecommunications pricing issue and has no resources of its own.</para><para>·	The integrity of the ACCC process is adequately protected by the avenues of judicial review to the Federal Court or the High Court on matters of law, which is comprehensive and searching into the reasoning and analysis of ACCC decision making.</para><para>A variety of reasons were given for the existing arrangements being unsatisfactory. These included: </para><para>·	Delay is a considerable concern for the industry, particularly as it relates to price determinations, because it creates lengthy uncertainty, is detrimental to competitive interests and delays investment decisions to the ultimate detriment of consumers</para><para>·	Another concern with the merits review is that it may tend to have an intimidating effect on smaller access seekers. That is, if even relatively larger players are being taken to the tribunal, and the matter is being dragged out from scratch, the smaller access seekers will be deterred from even taking a matter to the commission. This is not in the interests of competition.</para><para>·	The merits review is presently as of right. There is no restriction of frivolous or vexatious matters for the de novo review. It has been suggested that this encourages `regulatory gaming' as it means there is nothing to prevent Telstra bringing a review before the tribunal for a tactical or strategic delay to competitors and would-be access seekers.</para><para>As well as the witnesses supporting the abolishment of the merits review, contrary views were expressed. Reasons for supporting the existing arrangements included:</para><para>·	The enhanced appeals process (that is the merits review to the ACT) is an important part of the framework that specifically regulates telecommunications.</para><para>·	The provision for merits review acts as an effective “insurance policy” against any mistakes that may result from the regulatory system. The risk of error occurring in regulatory decision-making and the costs of such error are very high.</para><para>·	Appeals on questions of law do not provide a sufficient foundation for the confidence necessary for investment.</para><para>The Committee was advised that abolishing the merits review by the ACT might have some detrimental consequences such as:</para><para>·	Deterring investment in regulated or potentially regulated telecommunications infrastructure because of a perceived regulatory risk. This would increase the costs of raising capital and reduce expenditure on investment.</para><para>·	Setting a damaging precedent for other infrastructure industries affected by regulated decisions.</para><para>·	Introducing uncertainty about investment, or returns on investment, and reducing incentives for continued investment.</para><para>·	Eroding the accountability of the decision maker (ie the ACCC). That accountability appropriately accompanies the wide discretion of the regulator in making decisions. A high degree of scrutiny of the ACCC's decisions is also warranted by the impact of its decisions and the significant economic consequences.</para><para>The Department of Communications, IT and the Arts advised the Committee of the reasons for including the amendment in the Bill which limits the information that can be brought before the ACT, instead of abolishing the appeal for the ACT:</para><para>·	The provision strikes a balance between competing interests, which is clearly the case given the competing submissions to this inquiry.</para><para>·	Merits review has, since its introduction in 1997, been considered an important element of the package as a whole.</para><para>·	Merits review is a presumed right for administrative decisions, and is considered appropriate given the nature and breadth of the ACCC's powers.</para><para>·	Abolition of the merits review is a fundamental reform and no reforms of that central nature will be made prior to consideration of the Productivity Commission's findings from its inquiries into Telecommunications Competition Regulation and the National Access Regime.</para><para>So in summary of the Committee's inquiry into this Bill, Labor Senators were not persuaded, to oppose the Government's legislation. Clearly there are doubts regarding the merits review by the ACT, including the capacity and appropriateness of the ACT to fulfil that role and the timeliness of outcomes.</para><para>Given the imminent conclusion of Productivity Commission inquiries on relevant matters, Labor Senators concluded that it was premature to make such a substantial change as abolishing the merits review prior to consideration of the reports from those inquiries.</para><para>In view of the different positions of witnesses and submissions to the Inquiry, consideration of the Productivity Commission's detailed analysis of the issue would be worthwhile prior to deciding on the most appropriate course of action. </para><para>In conclusion, Labor Senators recommended in our report that the issue of merits review by the Australian Competition Tribunal as a part of the telecommunications access regime be reconsidered in the context of the Productivity Commission's findings which will be available within the next month.</para><para>I believe that consideration of reforms of the regulatory regime applicable to the telecommunications industry is important to ensuring there is true competition in the industry.</para><para>And that is important to all Australian consumers.</para><para>While the Government likes to gloat about the degree of competition in the industry, Telstra receives 89 per cent of the total profits in the industry. Meanwhile Optus has eight per cent, Vodafone two per cent, AAPT one per cent and the others account for less than one percent of total industry profits.</para><para>There is still some way to go in achieving a more competitive telecommunications market. A Beazley Labor government will ensure Australians get more effective competition than this government has been able to achieve.</para><para>In that context I will move the second reading amendment in my name.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>—I thank the Senate. A second reading amendment in relation to the <inline ref="R1375">Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 2001</inline> was circulated in my name yesterday. We are going to proceed with that amendment now and I will speak to it briefly. I move:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>		“but the Senate:</para><para>	(a)	notes the lack of effective competition in significant parts of the Australian telecommunications industry;</para><para>	(b)	notes the Government's failure to respond in a timely manner to widespread industry concerns held since at least January 1999 about delays in the telecommunications competition regime, which continue to the detriment of both consumers and the industry; </para><para>	(c)	notes that the cause of the Government's failure to act has been its ideological obsession with the full privatisation of Telstra; and</para><para>	(d)	calls on the Government to urgently consider further reform as part of its response to the final report of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into the telecommunications competition regime due next month”.</para></quote><para>Paragraphs (a) to (c) of the amendment address the issues of lack of competition and the failure to adequately advance change in the telecommunications competition regime, and note the government's obsession with the full privatisation of Telstra. Paragraph (d) effectively calls on the government to restart the reform agenda in the telecommunications industry. It is important to note the large, indeed huge, amount of profits—over $4 billion per year— being made by Telstra at the moment. They represent about 90 per cent of industry profits and certainly indicate that Telstra holds a dominant market share of the various industries in which it competes. That strengthens Telstra's ability to effectively thwart even the most minimal competition reform. This is reflected in the management of the company by the current administration: their implementation of failed overseas strategies and their poor investments, all leading to significant write-downs. All of the features that I have just identified reflect a lack of competition in the telecommunications industry, an apparent exercise of monopoly power and the extraction of monopoly rents, to the harm of consumers, competitors, infrastructure users and re-sellers generally in this industry. </para><para>This serious state of affairs—in fact, the de facto re-monopolisation of the telecommunications industry—is permitted by this government, whose priority, as indicated in paragraph (d), is not advancing reform, not establishing a sound regulatory regime and not forcing the creation of a competitive market. Indeed, so poor are a lot of those elements that in his inquiry Mr Besley was unable to recommend any degree of privatisation for the foreseeable future. This amendment effectively urges the government to forget, to negate, its obsession with the privatisation of Telstra and to get on with the main game. The main game is clear to everyone: establishing a flexible and effective regulatory regime and encouraging further real competition within the telecommunications industry and a hastened improvement of retail services to rural and regional Australia—that is, further competition and reform in this industry as a matter of urgency. I commend the amendment to the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>27520</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate the bulk of my speech in this second reading debate.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows—</inline></para><para>This Bill amends Part 11C of the Trade Practices Act 1974, dealing with arbitration of disputes between carriers and access seekers over access to certain telecommunications services.  It seeks to encourage parties to settle access conditions by negotiation rather than arbitration and to reduce delays in the arbitration process.</para><para>Part 11C was inserted into the Trade Practices Act in 1997 and commenced operation on 1 July 1997, at the same time as the telecommunications industry was deregulated.</para><para>The intention was to allow for competition in the provision of telecommunications services.  Of course, Telstra and previously Telecom has always owned the infrastructure that runs to literally millions of homes and businesses in this country and it was never seriously contemplated that new carriers would all install their own infrastructure.  </para><para>Part 11C was enacted to provide a regime through which new carriers could get access to Telstra's lines into those homes and businesses.</para><para>Essentially that Part allows the ACCC to determine services to be `declared services'.  After a service has been declared, carriers who provide that service must give other carriage service providers access to the service.</para><para>Since the inception of the regime, the contentious issue has always been, not surprisingly, the terms and conditions on which that access is provided.  Most notably, the issue of price has been the major problem.</para><para>Part 11C provides 3 alternative means of setting the conditions of access: negotiated agreement between the parties, offering an access undertaking and arbitration by the ACCC.  In the first instance, it is hoped that the parties will be able to agree on the terms and conditions of access to the services.  Alternatively an access provider may offer an access undertaking.  The ACCC must assess this undertaking to ensure it is consistent with model terms and conditions set out in the telecommunications access code or be reasonable and be consistent with the standard access obligations.  Only four undertakings have been submitted to the ACCC, all by Telstra.  They were all rejected because one or more of the conditions was considered unreasonable.  </para><para>Ultimately, if the parties can't negotiate an agreement and if there is no undertaking in place for granting access, the terms and conditions must be determined by the ACCC in arbitrating an access dispute.</para><para>After the ACCC has arbitrated a dispute and determined the terms and conditions of access, it is open to either of the parties to the dispute to seek merits review of the determination by the Australian Competition Tribunal.</para><para>In June 2000, the Productivity Commission was given a reference to inquire into telecommunications-specific competition regulation.  One of the key matters it was to inquire into was the access regime contained in Part 11C.</para><para>In its draft report, the Productivity Commission estimates that in a clear majority of cases, at least 80%, terms and conditions for access to declared services are able to be agreed by negotiation between the parties.  However, negotiations have in many cases been difficult and protracted, and have resulted in delays in obtaining access to the services.</para><para>The major problem with the regime is that, quite simply, it is slow.  It takes the parties a long time to negotiate - it takes a long term to have services declared - it takes a long time for the ACCC to determine that it will not accept undertakings - it takes a long time for the ACCC to arbitrate disputes.</para><para>Some of the submitters to the Committee inquiry into this Bill were of the view that the delays were largely the result of Telstra's actions.  The suggestion was that Telstra has used every possible legal avenue available to it to avoid disclosure of information and to generally delay the process of negotiation and arbitration.</para><para>I make no judgments as to whether or not those criticisms are fair.  However, it must be remembered that Telstra is a `for-profit' organisation responsible to its shareholders and if it can legally pursue a course of action to benefit its shareholders, then it will.  It was interesting to hear a representative of a non-Telstra carrier criticise Telstra's behaviour but then admit that if he worked for Telstra, he would advise them to pursue the same course of action.</para><para>Rather than directing criticism toward Telstra and saying that Telstra isn't behaving fairly, I think we should be looking at the legislation and the actions and powers of the regulator, the ACCC, to rectify the situation if we think they are currently producing or allowing unfair conduct.</para><para>I am pleased that the Productivity Commission has reviewed Part 11C.  I hope that its recommendations will balance the need to expedite processes in relation to the declaration of services and the determination of terms and conditions with the need to preserve the rights of Telstra to seek review of administrative decisions which affect it.</para><para>I will refer to just one specific issue raised by the submitters to the inquiry into the Bill.  A number of witnesses thought that the right to obtain a review of the ACCC's arbitration by the Australian Competition Tribunal, should be abolished.  A number of very cogent reasons were presented in favour of abolition of that right of appeal.  The Committee in its report neither agreed nor disagreed with the proposal but said that the appropriate course was to await the findings of the Productivity Commission.  </para><para>I wish to make it clear that the Democrats support that position.  The abolition of any appeal right, especially one which relates to an administrative decision of a regulatory body, is a very serious matter.  The Democrats don't have a predetermined position on the issue.  However, we will require clear evidence if it is going to be the case that a single regulatory body will have the final say in arbitrations and the merit of that body's decision won't be subject to review.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name></talker><para>—I would like to make some comments about the ALP second reading amendment. Part (a) says:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>... the Senate </para><para>(a) notes the lack of effective competition in significant parts of the Australian telecommunications industry ...</para></quote><para>The Democrats support that paragraph. We still do not have significant and genuine competition in the local call market and we certainly do not have competition of any degree in most parts of regional and rural Australia. I know that there have been moves to implement competition, or to at least trial competition, in the provision of USOs, but that too seems to have stalled. Perhaps the minister could comment on how those USO pilot areas are going when he sums up in this debate.</para><para>Part (b) says:</para><quote><para>... the Senate  ...</para><para>(b) notes the Government's failure to respond in a timely manner to widespread industry concerns ...</para></quote><para>The Democrats do not support that paragraph. The government has made some attempts in the past to finetune the processes for obtaining access to the telecommunications infrastructure. It has perhaps been a case of rearranging the deckchairs on the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline> because, in general, the whole negotiation-arbitration process has been slow and arduous. Whether you attribute the delays to Telstra, the ACCC or the access seekers, or to the mere fact that arbitrating these disputes is very complex, I have not seen the ALP or anyone else for that matter put forward serious proposals to significantly speed up the process.</para><para>Part (c) says:</para><quote><para>... the Senate ...</para><para>(c) notes that the cause of the Government's failure to act has been its ideological obsession with the full privatisation of Telstra ...</para></quote><para>The Democrats do not support that paragraph. I agree that this government has an ideological obsession with the full privatisation of Telstra, but even if we agreed that there has been a failure to act in relation to the competition regime, I do not think that one relates to the other all that well. In my view, the government would be more likely to push for greater competition in pursuit of selling Telstra. The more competitors it can point to, the better it can say that the regulatory regime is working and the more it can advocate that there is no longer a need for government control of Telstra. We simply cannot see that it is correct to suggest that there is some causation between a desire to sell Telstra and dragging the chain on competition reforms.</para><para>Part (d) says:</para><quote><para>... the Senate ...</para><para>(d) calls on the Government to urgently consider further reform as part of its response to the final report of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into the telecommunications competition regime due next month ...</para></quote><para>Again, the Democrats do not support that paragraph. We think it is pretty meaningless. It simply calls on the government to urgently consider further reform; it does not indicate what sort of reforms or whether there should be a modification of the current processes or a complete overhaul of the regime. That Productivity Commission report is due to be handed to the Treasurer on the 22nd of this month, just a few days from now. We will shortly be going into an election and further reform will not realistically take place until early next year.

We will not be supporting any of the Democrat amendments, much as I welcome Senator Allison's concession that the government did in fact make some pro-competition amendments back in 1999. In terms of ideological obsession, this term appears no less than five times in Mr Smith's speech on the second reading. So clearly the caucus subcommittee thinks this is one of those buttons that if you press it often enough you might get a few people out there responding. I think it is pretty clear who has got the obsession with what. As Senator Allison points out, the logic is somewhat deficient. I am grateful to her for indicating that she thinks that we are more likely than our opponents to press for serious competition.

You will put every other carrier out of business. So I am grateful for those comments. As far as the Productivity Commission is concerned, we will certainly respond constructively to that.

In respect of Senator Allison's concern about the USO, we are committed to promoting the competitive provision of services through the USO contestability of pilots. These pilots represent an innovative approach whereby subsidies that support the provision of loss making services are also used to create an incentive for telecommunications service providers to enter regional and rural markets. </para></talk.start></continue><para>More than $65 million in per services subsidies has been made contestable under the government's USO contestability of pilots. Contestability was introduced on 1 July 2001, so it is still too early to judge how successful they might be. They are set to run for three years and competitors can enter the contestable areas at any time during this period. Prior to entering the market, competitors will have to analyse the market, develop a business case, enter into arrangements for services and equipment and possibly even install infrastructure. The current downturn in financial markets has also not helped in making it more difficult for service providers to access the capital necessary to expand into these new markets. Through this important structural change to the regulatory regime, the government has provided the opportunity for all carriers and carriage service providers to compete with Telstra for the USO subsidies. The government will be closely monitoring developments, and it is envisaged there will be an initial assessment of the pilots in December next to determine whether any fine tuning might be desirable.</para><para>I would like to make a few remarks about the merits review debate that has been going on. The bill is aimed at streamlining the current competition arrangements. It is clearly not the end of the discussion. The Productivity Commission review will provide an opportunity to consider more wide ranging reforms. No doubt the question of retaining merits review will again be raised in that debate.</para><para>The government does not support the removal of merits review at this stage. However, in the context of the Productivity Commission's response, we will again consider the strength of the competing arguments on this matter. We will also look closely at the behaviour of the parties and the extent to which current disputes are being resolved commercially before coming to a decision. In recent days, my concerns about the willingness of all parties to achieve a commercial resolution of the PSTN dispute have been heightened. Therefore, I want to make it plain that the government will not sit idly by and allow early resolution of this issue to be frustrated by manoeuvring for tactical advantage. </para><para>Merits review is meant to provide an opportunity for a second consideration of an ACCC arbitration. It is not meant to be an opportunity for attempting to delay outcomes for commercial advantage or for prolonging industry uncertainty. While the government acknowledges the need for a suitable process to determine the appropriate methodology for the calculation of future interconnect charges, it does not believe there is any good reason why other matters leading to substantial industry uncertainty cannot be resolved in the near future.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8HC</name.id><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator Harris</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.

This matter was listed at another place on the order sheet. The government sought that it be changed to non-controversial and the opposition has cooperated in that process. We are still keen for our second reading amendment to be put and discussed, so the sin that was committed before is repeated in this instance because I will be seeking leave to incorporate my remarks and then speak to the amendment that has been circulated in my name. I so seek leave.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows—</inline></para><para>Today the Senate is presented with a Bill that amends the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. The Interactive Gambling Act passed the parliament several months ago in an ill-conceived attempt by the Government to ban Australians from accessing a few reputable and well-regulated Australian casino sites.</para><para>Labor outlined a detailed policy response to interactive gambling, which, unlike the Government's ineffective Act, would have seriously limited problem gambling by Australians on the internet. Unfortunately the Government did not follow our lead.</para><para>This Bill today addresses some unintentional effects of the Interactive Gambling Act. Had the Government not responded to the considerable criticisms of the Senate Environment, Communications, IT and the Arts Legislation Committee inquiry, a good deal more amendment than this would have been necessary, so flawed was the Government's Bill.</para><para>My memory of the rather extensive debate in the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 was that Senator Alston said the Government was motivated by one primary or dominant consideration:</para><para>·	Not to restrict existing land-based gambling facilities because they were</para><para>1.	already in existence and</para><para>2.	regulated by the States</para><para>·	Prevent further extension of gambling into new areas such as cyberspace as a tool of social policy.</para><para>The basic justification put by the government was to at least prevent the further growth of gambling problems in new forms of communications.</para><para>During the committee stage of that act the government introduced amendments which prohibited the advertising of interactive gambling services.  Those amendments were agreed to without debate.</para><para>One can make a number of points of that new part 7A of the Act relating to the prohibition of advertising of interactive gambling services.</para><para>Firstly this appears to be only the second time the Commonwealth parliament has imposed a blanket prohibition on the advertising of a particular product or service.</para><para>The only other example or precedent lies in the area of prohibiting tobacco advertising and that legislative prohibition took place only after</para><para>·	Extensive community debate</para><para>·	Consideration of state and territory laws</para><para>·	Review of Commonwealth and state existing policy.</para><para>The essential rationale for tobacco advertising prohibition was a community health and protection of children debate.</para><para>In any event there was extensive community/press/parliamentary debate.  In part 7A of this Act there was no such debate.</para><para>Accordingly one can properly conclude from a government perspective that the prohibitions on advertising are no longer considered a threat to the principle of free speech in this country.</para><para>In moving the amendments to the Interactive Gambling Bill on 28 June 01 Minister Alston said and I quote “the advertising ban would only apply to interactive gambling services that are banned by the bill”.</para><para>However, it has since come to the government's attention that the Act may inadvertently prohibit the advertising of land-based casinos which also provide interactive gambling services to overseas customers.  Section 61BA (1)(e) defines an interactive gambling advertisement as any writing, visual image or audible message that promotes any words that are closely associated with an interactive gambling service.</para><para>If a land-based casino uses its name for its legitimate interactive gambling services, then there is a chance that the name will become closely associated with the interactive gambling service.  This would then prevent the casino from using the name in advertising its land-based services.</para><para>So the government policy position behind this bill is clear.  It is to permit not prohibit those land based gambling facilities that also offer interactive gambling services to overseas customers the ability to advertise those services.  This is of course a commercial necessity because it allows the offeror of interactive gambling services to overseas customers the ability to draw upon the brand name of the land-based facility.</para><para>This is of course commercial common sense but contrary to the governments stated policy of limiting the spread of social harm by limiting the spread of interactive gambling.</para><para>So this bill under discussion today represents the first big backflip over the Interactive Gambling Act 2001.  </para><para>The prohibition on advertising was so critical that the government introduced a then new part 7A into the act and it was passed by agreement with the minor parties without parliamentary debate.</para><para>We now see the unintended consequences of an intellectually slothful approach to policy making in the form of this amending bill.</para><para>So to summarise the position of the government with respect to the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 and this amending bill</para><para>·	It breaches long standing commitments to protection of free speech</para><para>·	It bans the advertising of interactive gambling services to overseas customers </para><para>·	Because it refused to engage in parliamentary debate the government cast its net too wide and now has to bring in an amending bill </para><para>·	This amending bill now permits the advertising of gambling services to overseas customers where such gambling services are associated with land based gambling facilities</para><para>·	The policy position behind this amending bill is at complete odds with the policy position as outlined by Senator Alston in the Interactive Gambling Act 2001</para><para>·	The amending bill has neither coherent nor intellectual strength as it is counter to the governments stated justification to limiting the spread of gambling on the internet.</para><para>The Opposition will not oppose this Bill, however I would like to reiterate the reasons why we believe the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 was a big mistake, why the Government's policy approach is flawed and why the Act is totally inappropriate and untenable. </para><para>My concerns, and I have detailed them before in this place, are as follows:</para><para>1.	The Interactive Gambling Act does not prevent Australians from accessing Internet Gambling services.</para><para>2.	The easiest sites for Australians to access are overseas sites, some of which are run by criminal and Mafia elements. It is nearly impossible to distinguish reputable sites from those of dubious probity.</para><para>3.	Problem gamblers are likely to be the ones who will be desperate enough to circumvent restrictions on accessing Australian and foreign sites, and will most likely fall prey to unscrupulous operators who will not limit expenditure. Strictly regulated Australian sites would have reduced gambling problems more than this Act will.</para><para>4.	The Act permits Australians access to internet wagering and wagering is hardly immune from gambling problems.</para><para>Turning then to my first point, the Interactive Gambling Act does not prevent Australians from accessing Internet Gambling services. There are a number of reasons for this.</para><para>·	The Act stops Australians from accessing the safest sites in the world but allows them to access the most dangerous sites. </para><para>·	If Australians want to access the services of Australian or foreign IGSPs, they are still be able to, even if those IGSPs claim not to accept Australian customers. Australians can still access reputable Australian and foreign IGSPs even if they refuse to accept Australian customers. </para><para>·	The sanction in the Act for providing interactive gambling services to Australians is not a very persuasive deterrent and is unlikely to be enforced. This will especially be the case as the Government has failed to provide additional funding for the already under-resourced Australian Federal Police. </para><para>·	There are significant numbers of disreputable foreign sites of dubious probity which Australians will be able to access. Some gamblers might favour those sites, particularly those susceptible to problem gambling. </para><para>This leads me to my second point that the easiest sites for Australian to access will be overseas sites, some of which are run by criminal and Mafia elements. It is nearly impossible to distinguish reputable sites from those of dubious probity.</para><para>Despite the Minister himself stating in a Ministerial media release on interactive gambling that there are “very disturbing examples of how Internet gambling organisations actually feed the addictions of problem gamblers”, it is not Australian gambling operators; rather, it is offshore operators who are engaging in such activity. And the Government has left Australian gamblers at the mercy of these gambling sites that feed addictions.</para><para>Australian sites comprise less than 2 per cent of the Internet gambling sites worldwide. Some protection this Act offers.  All the Government has done is prevent Australian gamblers from accessing the strictly regulated sites. </para><para>This leads to my third point that it is problem gamblers that are likely to be the ones who will be desperate enough to circumvent restrictions on accessing Australian and foreign sites, and will most likely fall prey to unscrupulous operators who will not limit expenditure. </para><para>My fourth and final point is that Australians can still access internet wagering. Wagering is hardly immune from causing gambling problems.</para><para>The Government excluded interactive wagering from the Act despite the fact that wagering is as much a problem in terms of problem gambling as any other form of gambling.</para><para>This Government has never been concerned to protect problem gamblers. If it had been so concerned it would have done something during its last two terms to address the real problem - the land-based forms of gambling that are causing huge social problems. </para><para>The Government couldn't even come up with a sensible and effective policy for interactive gambling that would minimise interactive gambling to the greatest extent possible. Even when we told them what it was. They even initiated a Productivity Commission inquiry that said the same thing we did.</para><para>The most notable thing that the Act does is prevent Australians from accessing the world's best, safest and most consumer-friendly interactive gambling sites - the Australian ones. </para><para>Wagering is not any safer than any other form of gambling. Wagering is not immune to the social effects of problem gambling. </para><para>The Opposition took a very different approach to the issue of interactive gambling. Our primary concern was and is to ensure that problem gambling arising from interactive gambling is kept to an absolute minimum. </para><para>We remain concerned that the Government's Act will not control or limit problem gambling in the online environment. </para><para>The Opposition continues to believe that the most effective way to manage interactive and Internet gambling is, overwhelmingly, to have State and Territory cooperation in formulating and implementing a national regulatory regime.  </para><para>There is no evidence to support the Government's conclusion that its ban will limit problem gambling. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>—I thank the Senate.

Instead, the government's Interactive Gambling Act bans a few strictly regulated Australian sites. Paragraph (ii) expresses the opposition's concern that I discussed earlier in my incorporated remarks that the impact of the act may be to exacerbate problem gambling in Australia by barring access to regulated online gambling services with in-built safeguards. The act still allows access to unregulated offshore online gambling sites that do not offer consumer protection or probity, placing those most vulnerable to problem gambling at an alarmingly high risk. As I discussed earlier, it leaves Australians at the mercy of unscrupulous gambling operators who feed addictions.</para><para>Paragraph (iii) condemns the government for not extending current regulatory and consumer protection requirements applying to offline and land based casinos, clubs or wagering venues to online casinos and online wagering facilities. Paragraph (iv) expresses the opposition's concern that this act damages Australia's international reputation for effective consumer protection laws and strong workable gambling regulation. Australia has a fine reputation internationally for its regulation of gambling. By failing to regulate this industry, the government is causing further damage to Australia's international reputation.</para><para>Paragraph (v) condemns the government for singling out one form of gambling in an attempt to placate community concern about the adverse social consequences of gambling. The government has singled out a form of gambling that has been around for some time now but has not revealed itself as a significant cause of gambling problems. This act was an attempt to detract the public's attention away from the real gambling issues related to more prevalent forms of gambling which the government has done nothing about.</para><para>Paragraph (vi) expresses the opposition's view that the act is not technology neutral or technically feasible. Even the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has contradicted his own policy guidelines for the regulation of content of online services that he announced in July 1997 with the act.</para><para>Part (b) of the second reading amendment calls on the government to take a new approach, the approach recommended by Labor numerous times over the last 20 months. This is a comprehensive approach that will restrict problem interactive gambling to an absolute minimum, and the elements of our recommended approach may be found in paragraph (b).</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>27529</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I put on record that One Nation will not support Labor's second reading amendment.

Those two amendments moved by One Nation would have removed all of the problems that the Labor Party is professing now.

But his ongoing and monumental failure in dealing with this issue for the past five years shows that he does not have the ticker to deal with the scams and the rent rorts of his own party and he is not fit to run the country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ansett Australia </title><page.no>27531</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>27531</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, and it follows my question to him yesterday about the conditions placed on the sale last year of the 50 per cent of Ansett held by News Ltd to Air New Zealand. Is the minister aware of a statement from an Ansett manager, Ms Sandy Brookes, that she was required by Air New Zealand to regularly transfer Ansett funds to Air New Zealand? Is he also aware of comments by the Ansett administrator, Mr Mentha, that sweeping Ansett accounts in this way demonstrated the entanglement of affairs of the two airlines? Given that I raised this matter yesterday, has the minister sought advice as to the government's knowledge of Air New Zealand's control of the management of Ansett putting that airline—Air New Zealand—in breach of a key condition imposed on the company by the Treasurer and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>27531</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think Senator O'Brien's question is a little bit wider than the issue he has raised in the last couple of days. On the issues Senator O'Brien mentioned about the transfer of funds and the activities of management, ASIC has commenced a formal investigation into the collapse of Ansett. I am advised that the replacement of the Ansett administrator does not disrupt ASIC's investigations, and ASIC will work with the new administrator in the same way it worked with the previous one. The focus of the ASIC investigation will be on possible breaches of directors' duties under the Corporations Act and on compliance with the insolvency trading provisions of the act. Also, my advice is that ASIC has written to the New Zealand securities commission requesting that it conduct inquiries into the adequacy—and I think this goes to one of the points that you raised—of financial disclosures made by Air New Zealand. The matters touched on by Senator O'Brien deal with a much wider issue than is involved with the conduct of the management of Ansett. As I have mentioned to him, these matters are under investigation by the relevant authority, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this.</para></talk.start><para>The only other aspect of this I raise is that all of us would have wanted Ansett to continue. Ansett has a great history, and the failure of this company is one which has quite rightly caused massive concern amongst Australians—and I think we all feel very greatly for the 16,000 employees who are involved. While we would have preferred all of the conditions that were specified were met, the fact is that, once a company collapses, to our great regret, that does not appear to be able to happen.

Senator Conroy called out `Don't mention this!' and `Don't mention that!' Senator, in deference to you, I will not mention Mr Carl Zimmerman. I will not even raise that issue. The last 5½ years have demonstrated the value of having a firm and steady hand at the helm of the Australian economy. This responsible approach of the government stands in stark contrast to the reckless and gross incompetence of the Hawke and Keating governments. All I have to mention is that famous Keating phrase which echoes down the years: `the recession we had to have'. Through their gross incompetence, they deliberately plunged the economy into a recession.</para></talk.start><para>I am pleased to say that even in what can obviously be described as very difficult times, the growth of the Australian economy has remained strong. I refer the Senate to the fact that the GDP grew at 0.9 per cent in the June quarter, placing Australia at the head of the industrialised world. So much for the efforts of the Labor Party to talk the economy down. So much for Senator Cook's effort to claim that somehow tax reform had mugged the economy. I believe there was no person in Australia more depressed than Senator Cook when the latest national accounts figures came out and confirmed the very strong growth in the Australian economy and gave the lie to the Labor Party argument that somehow tax reform had held back the growth of the economy. </para><para>Further, the recent figures on the current account deficit show that, as a share of GDP for the June quarter, it was the best figure for 21 years. That is my advice. Let me remind the Senate that home mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest levels in some 30 years. Under Labor, home mortgage rates rose as high as 17 per cent and were heading north. Combined with this action on the growth front and on the interest rate front, let me also remind the Senate that we have delivered some $12 billion of income tax cuts. Under the coalition, real wages have grown steadily, at an average of 2.5 per cent a year, compared with the almost stagnant growth under the former government. They gave us 13 years of stagnant growth in real wages. I do not often mention Senator George Campbell in a praiseworthy fashion, but Senator George Campbell has pointed this out himself. </para><para>Also I can point to the fact that independent research recently conducted by NATSEM shows unambiguously that families at all income levels are better off than they were under the Labor Party, and the poorest families in particular have benefited the most.

Unfortunately, it is a matter of record that, with the Ansett planes going down and therefore the Kendell planes going down, there is simply not the capacity within Australia. I am advised that Launceston and Burnie will receive a limited air service for the rest of this week. Qantas and its subsidiary Southern operated a return flight from Melbourne to Launceston yesterday and will again today and tomorrow. Burnie and Wynyard will be without services until Friday when a 36-seat Dash 8 will operate across Bass Strait. The Launceston to Melbourne run will be serviced by a BAe 146 seating approximately 80 passengers, with the exception of yesterday and today when a 737 will be doing that.</para><para>The main way we can help Tasmania is to get all the aircraft formerly used by Ansett into the air as soon as possible. The government is working with the administrator to the limit of our ability. I know the administrator is doing what he can to get those aircraft back in the air. There are aircraft available. There are pilots there willing to fly them. There are ground crew there willing to load them and there are certainly passengers there wanting to fly. Business commonsense would say that in the very near future something will happen. It is at this stage a matter for the administrator. The government is working very closely with the administrator. Anything we can possibly do to assist in that process we will do. We are trying to fix the short-term problem and I realise the short-term problem is very difficult. We really have to look towards the intermediate term and try to get those aircraft back in the air so that people who want to go to that magnificent destination, particularly at this time of year—I guess any time of the year—that great conference destination, Tasmania, can do so. The best thing we can do is get the airline system operating, and that is what the government is trying to do.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>27536</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

The fact is that, while our economic management of the nation is superb, that is not always repeated at the corporate level. It must be said that Pasminco, regrettably, have run into significant difficulties, partly as a result of the collapse in zinc prices, over which no government or company can have any influence, but also, regrettably, over the way in which they ran their hedge book, which, if you have followed their activities, presumed that the dollar would go up; of course it has come down.

So the company, as recently as last week, were giving private and public assurances that their circumstances were satisfactory, and certainly to their credit they had made very good provision for their employees. The entitlements of employees rank ahead of unsecured creditors, and Pasminco have very few secured creditors, given their assets backing, et cetera. So, to their credit, they made sure that in their circumstances, if anything were to occur, their employee entitlements were covered.</para><para>I was pleased to receive that letter and the assurances of what is the new managing director of the company that their asset sales program was on track and that they expected in any event that their operations would continue, whether or not they were put into administration. Yesterday afternoon, after question time, I was advised that they would be announcing yesterday evening that they would be placing the company into voluntary administration. Their statement and the advice to me at that time was that they would continue the operations, and that is indeed the case. I have said that the government are willing to do whatever we can to work with them to ensure those operations can continue and that we would do whatever we could to attract buyers for their assets. </para><para>This company does have a good suite of assets.

I simply put before you that there has been a longstanding practice in this place that, if someone has said something which either is clearly unparliamentary or has caused clear offence and they are asked to withdraw, they do. The practice has been not that people get up and say, `Did you hear?' and not that they get up and say, `If I said something that was unparliamentary, I would withdraw'; the practice in the Senate that has got some standards has simply been to say, `I withdraw.' I will leave it at that. I heard what Senator Mackay said. If she wants to evade it and lower the standards of this place, fine.

First of all, it is unparliamentary to treat colleagues in that way.

It is vitally important for those of us in public life that we separate our private interests from our public obligations so that we are seen to act in the public interest and not to serve our private investments. That is a fundamental principle and it is a principle that has been tarnished beyond recognition in the course of this government. It is now widespread—the currency of common argument—that the ministerial standards of this government are at an all-time low and that the Prime Minister, in refusing to enforce his code of ministerial conduct, is himself, therefore and thereby, culpable in lowering those standards and culpable in protecting those members of his government who have done things that have brought their private interests into conflict with their public duty.</para><para>The most recent example in which all editorial writers of all the major newspapers in Australia were of one view concerned the Minister for Small Business, Mr Macfarlane, who in his Liberal Party branch in Queensland was knowingly associated with a scam to evade the GST. All newspaper editorial writers called for Mr Macfarlane's head. They said that he should resign, but the Prime Minister defended him and thereby set a new low in parliamentary conduct. So it is not at all surprising that, given that example from the Prime Minister, we have an example from Senator Minchin, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, that emulates the very low standard of the Prime Minister.</para><para>All of us in this chamber know ex-Senator Parer.

Senator Parer stood down from the ministry after the 1998 election and quietly regained his previous coal industry directorships after leaving the Senate early in 2000.

There is nothing wrong with him having those directorships, but there is a lot wrong with him having those directorships and pretending to be an impartial servant of the public interest inquiring into energy policy in Australia.

I asked him specifically about the collapse of Pasminco and he did not, in response to that question, deal to any extent with the implications of that collapse for the 3,800 workers employed by the company. They have `managed the economy superbly' in a set of circumstances where major companies are falling over like tenpins. We have had today the announcement about Pasminco, the situation with the Ansett collapse, and the threat to the 73,000 jobs, we have had the circumstances of the collapse of One.Tel—and the minister responsible for that in part is in the chamber and may want to respond—and HIH, both with significant numbers of jobs involved. But here is a government that is `managing the economy superbly'.</para></talk.start><para>What was the response by the ministers responsible for those policy areas when those companies collapsed? They said they did not know about it: `We didn't know, we weren't responsible.' Senator Alston did not know about the One.Tel collapse. Minister Hockey did not know about the HIH collapse. Minister Anderson has no idea when he was told about the Ansett collapse, and certainly denies ever being told anything, despite a whole raft of evidence to the contrary to say that he was aware and that he had been advised about the Ansett collapse as far back as June this year. He vehemently denies knowing anything about it. We have also seen the spectacle, yesterday and today, of the responses by Minister Kelly to the consequences of the collapse of Ansett. </para><para>Here is a set of circumstances that are all occurring within a framework in which Senator Minchin is getting up and saying that they are managing the economy superbly. You have to ask the question: for whom are they managing the economy superbly? It is not for the workers who have been impacted by the collapse of those major companies, and it is certainly not being managed superbly in the interests of a range of companies who are currently under threat in terms of their continued operation within this economy.</para><para>But it is not unusual to hear that hyberbole or that ideological material coming from Senator Minchin because this is a minister who, since he has had the Industry, Science and Resources portfolio, has not had a clue what has been happening within his portfolio. He has been more concerned about being out there playing politics within the Liberal Party than he has been about running the policy agenda within Industry, Science and Resources. You only have to point to a couple of examples that have occurred to reinforce that message. Look at what happened over the TCF scheme, the SIP scheme. Here is a minister who sat around for 12 months on a scheme and allowed a major company in Victoria, Bradmill, to go under because he refused to provide resources and support for that company at the time when the company most needed it. He subsequently came to the point of amending the scheme to allow moneys to be made available after the company collapsed, not when the company actually needed the resources. </para><para>Here is a minister who has recently admitted he did not know that the ASIS scheme in the auto industry, which was supposed to be capped at $2 billion, was going to cost the government $2.8 billion. He did not know that. He had to be corrected by someone from his department. Here is a minister who is absolutely remote from what is happening in his portfolio. He is not in touch with what is happening in the industrial community. It is no wonder these companies are collapsing and these government ministers consistently say, `We do not know about it.' <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>27552</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to rebut some of the remarks made by Senator Cook and Senator George Campbell and to contribute some of my own. I was quite surprised that neither of the senators I have mentioned brought up much news, if any at all—except that I think Senator George Campbell mentioned the collapse of Ansett, along with that of a couple of other well-known companies, HIH and Pasminco—about the fact that it now appears that 11 of Ansett's jets were sold off and leased back. The jets were four old 767-200s and seven of the more modern, later model Airbus 320s.</para></talk.start><para>Instead they railed against the government for its excellent management of the economy, the figures of which are manifest everywhere—not least in low unemployment, low interest rates and high incidence of profits. This country is one of the best in the OECD. Of all the 29 countries in the OECD, Australia has the best growth potential. Even before the tragedy of the twin towers in the United States of America, the United States was going into recession. It was going to have two or maybe three quarters of negative growth. This country does not have that. This country is going to have at least 3.8 per cent annual growth, probably more. In spite of the unfortunate collapses of those major companies—and they are major companies; HIH was a major insurance company, Ansett is a major icon company carrying 40 per cent of Australian passengers and Pasminco is one of the big lead zinc smelters of the world—this economy is actually booming. </para><para>But I was surprised that no effort was made on Ansett. I think that no effort was made on Ansett by the senators I have mentioned simply because they have lost it. The opposition has lost it. When the opposition brought out the Transport Workers Union heavies, to get them involved and demonstrating, I heard some of those people speaking in grunts or monosyllables and I do not think that anyone in Australia could understand what they were saying. Why not come out and say: `Let us look at what has happened to this company of Ansett. Why did it collapse? Why was it allowed'—if this proves to be the case—`to sell off 11 jets only a few months ago, with Air New Zealand pocketing the money and letting the liability stay with Ansett?' What is wrong with that? Why rail against a government that has done so well for this economy since 1996 when we came to office. </para><para>In the 13 years that Labor was in power, it retreated. You will recall 11½ per cent unemployment. It was quite extraordinary. There was $90 billion worth of foreign debt. Some of the legislation that was passed then was with respect to regulatory interference in the Australian economy. This is what this opposition is talking to today. They are saying that the government should interfere in the private sector. We know what happens when government interferes in the private sector. </para><para>This government is saying, `Not only will we roll back the GST and partly destroy a cash flow—a growth tax—to the states, but we are going to give part of that GST—6½ per cent—to local government. We are going to raise spending on research and development, we are going to raise spending on the universities, and we are going to raise spending in all other areas and we are going to roll back taxes at the same time.' Then they are going to say that their government should pick up the tab for collapsed companies. They are going to say that not only should they pick up the tab for private sector companies that collapse, but they should also pick up the tab for foreign companies that collapse in Australia.

Yesterday, he said the government was doing a wonderful job with the economy. Over the last several months small businesses have experienced higher than normal levels of bankruptcies which have been created because of problems with the implementation of the GST, the squeeze on cash flow and the unnecessary paperwork. That is a bellwether mark about how bad the economy is going at the hands of the government, through its own work. We have seen the collapse of major companies— One.Tel, HIH, Ansett and, today, Pasminco. In total, the collective debts are running at well over $10 billion or $12 billion. Even if you were Alice in Wonderland, like the minister, you could not say that the economy was doing well. Major companies are going down the gurgler leaving massive debts and workers are losing their jobs. There has not been a period like this, with such major companies falling over, for many years. The only problem that these companies have is that Stan Howard is not their chairman.

I noticed yesterday that the Speaker of the House of Representatives, a member of the Liberal Party, ruled that it is now unparliamentary to call someone a New Zealander.

It is unparliamentary to call somebody a New Zealander, because of their attack. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Why don't they point out, as we did yesterday, that one of the major directors of Air New Zealand is Sir Charles Goode, a scion of the Melbourne establishment—a man who is the bag carrier, the fundraiser, for the Liberal Party. He is on the board. He is chairman of the ANZ bank. He is part of the old boys' network which collectively shares it around amongst themselves, and he is a senior member of the Liberal Party. Wasn't he telling his mates, like the Prime Minister and the minister, `Listen, something is going wrong with the company I am a director of, Air New Zealand. We have made a stupid acquisition. We can't run, we can't manage, we can't fund Ansett.' No, apparently he did not tell John Anderson. This man who runs the Liberal Party in Victoria, who is the fundraiser, did not tell anybody in the Liberal Party how bad things were. He is going to have to face the music.

The Democrats have repeatedly asked, including today and yesterday—and many others have asked—what the full cost is of housing the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> asylum seekers in Nauru and what the long-term cost is. We know that there is a $20 million special sweetener. We know that there are millions and millions of dollars in expenses for the Defence Force. We know that extra money has been spent on construction of facilities. But we do not know what the costs are; the government will not tell us, nor will they state whether there are any accountability measures to ensure that the money is directed to what it is intended for. This is an important matter—it is always important to have accountability measures—particularly given the facts that are coming to light about the nation of Nauru and the issue of financial impropriety there. </para><para>The ABC's <inline font-style="italic">Foreign Correspondent</inline> program made serious allegations concerning financial impropriety in the business dealings of the Nauru President. The Nauru Justice Commission also believes that there has been a serious misappropriation of funds by the Nauru government and the Nauru Phosphate Corporation. The OECD believes Nauru to be a significant money-laundering centre and its recent report recommends member states apply countermeasures in their financial dealings with it. Money laundering can be linked with both organised crime and, most interestingly in the current circumstances, the financing of terrorism. </para><para>The Australian public is entitled to know what role the Nauru government will have in administering funds—substantial amounts of taxpayers' funds—that are provided in relation to this issue; what businesses the Australian or Nauru governments have engaged to provide services to the asylum seekers from the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> and others, and quite probably for future asylum seekers as well; the extent to which Australian taxpayers' funds will be passing through the Nauru financial system; and, the extent to which the Australian government has complied with the OECD recommendations on financial dealings with Nauru. The minister was not able to and did not answer that today.</para><para>In speaking of engaging services on Nauru, we find in a report which has come out from the ABC in the last few hours that the local police in Nauru have imposed an information block-out on the camp in the centre of the island where the asylum seekers have been transferred. The police have blocked the only access road to the camp on the orders, they say, of the private security firm hired to act as guards at the camp. Once again, this is outsourcing on top of outsourcing. This is a private security firm instructing the police what to do. How much are they being paid? What controls are in place? Where are the accountability measures? This government will not tell us. </para><para>The government's approach to this issue has been a shambles from start to finish. It has had a totally inadequate and unworkable approach to the serious issue of asylum seekers, refugees and displaced people. Even in this one area millions of dollars of taxpayers' money is being spent with no accountability. We have no idea of how much is being spent. We see the clamp down again—no information is allowed out. This action to block access to the camp came after a number of detainees came to the fence of the camp to speak to reporters. What a crime! How terrible it is to speak to reporters! Obviously, we cannot have that. </para><para>It is clearly the intent of this government, wherever possible, to prevent access to information even about the reality of the human situation that these people have experienced. The government is not providing information about the money being provided, the accountability mechanisms that are in place and whether they have followed the OECD recommendations to counteract and deal with money laundering— the widespread financial impropriety that is identified in that OECD report. This is a significant money laundering centre. It is probably one of the worst in the world, if you look at that report. It breaches all sorts of criteria on all sorts of grounds. There has been no information on this from this government. It is typical and says it all. This is the one place the Australian government has managed to find to assist it out of the debacle that it has got itself into. It has had to get the bribe from the federal government to go ahead. The federal government is basically buying its way out of this debacle of a policy with no accountability and with a nation that has any number of black marks against it and it is providing no information at all. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>27555</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>27555</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—Some four weeks ago Senator Ray said in the chamber:</para></talk.start><quote><para>If I were a real muck-raker, I would have run out the fact that a senior Liberal minister went down to the panel beater at Collingwood and got his electorate car repaired and paid for the repairs with cash.</para></quote><para>Having since, on a number occasions across the chamber, made calls to me to come clean about why I paid cash to panel beaters in Collingwood, Senator Ray then threw caution to the winds yesterday and had no inhibitions at all about naming me publicly in the Senate.

Since 1 July last year, which of course is the relevant date, given the allegations relating to the GST, to my knowledge my Commonwealth funded car has not been repaired at Collingwood or anywhere else.

At the same time, we took the opportunity to have the same panel beater carry out repairs to damage which had been inflicted some time earlier and which was unrelated to the accident. When this work was completed, I attended the panel beaters with my wife, paid for the repairs, being $1,150 plus GST of $115 totalling $1,265, by way of credit card. I have both a copy of the original invoice, which makes it clear that the total amount including GST was paid in full, and also a photocopy of my credit card statement, which shows that the same amount was debited to my account on the same date, 21 October 2000.

It is very difficult to believe that the panel beater would have claimed that the amount was paid in cash when they must have known from their records that it was not. I have since endeavoured to make contact with the panel beaters, but I understand that they have gone out of business. The more likely explanation is that Senator Ray heard that a car belonging to me had been repaired by the panel beaters and in his breathless excitement to dig up dirt somehow allowed himself to be persuaded that the amount had been paid for in cash. The only other explanation is that Senator Ray knew at all times that it had not been paid for in cash but just thought he would throw around some dirt.

This is especially relevant for outsourced programs.</para><para>The Committee believes that when work is contracted out by an agency, the contractors' staff should be put through the same security checks as the agency's own staff and should have the same level of fraud awareness.

The community understanding of fraud, both in Australia and overseas, would not generally encompass acts such as inappropriate accessing of taxpayer files.  The Committee considers it would be useful for the ANAO, in its preparation of a better practice guide on fraud control, to develop subcategories of fraud to clarify the nature of the fraud for the purposes of fraud reporting.  The Committee has recommended accordingly.</para><para>In the second report selected, Audit Report No. 22, the Committee examined the strategies developed for<inline font-weight="bold"> Fraud Control in Defence</inline>.  It was cognisant of the fact that there was scope for improvement in Defence's corporate governance with reference to fraud control.  For instance, Defence's Chief Executive Instructions did not comply with the Commonwealth fraud control policy requirement to review its fraud control arrangements every two years.  The audit found that Defence lacked a suitable fraud intelligence capability, thereby making it difficult for Defence to estimate accurately the extent of fraud in or against Defence.</para><para>Although the Committee accepts that the amount of fraud detected in Defence has been fairly consistent over the past five years, the Committee questions whether Defence has been as diligent as it could be in detecting fraud, given that its asset register `is not in good shape' and fraud investigation is undertaken in four separate areas:  the Inspector-General's division and the military police in each of the services.</para><para>The Committee is not convinced that the financial and administrative systems Defence has in place are sufficient to obtain an adequate organisational view of the occurrence of fraud in Defence.  The Committee recommends that Defence address the shortcomings in its asset registers and develop a fraud intelligence capability.</para><para>I now turn to the final ANAO report the Committee reviewed in this quarter—Audit Report No. 26, <inline font-weight="bold">Defence Estate Facilities Operations,</inline><inline font-weight="bold"></inline>which<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>sought to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the management of the Defence estate, given its importance in supporting Defence in the achievement of its mission.</para><para>The Committee was told that following its creation in 1997, the Defence Estate Office (DEO) had made a significant effort to develop and implement a strategic, corporate-focused framework for the delivery of maintenance work through its Facilities Operations Program.  Initiatives, such as the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract, focus on economies and efficiencies that earlier approaches and/or methods lacked.</para><para>Having considered the evidence, the Committee is not satisfied that all the problems have been addressed effectively.  Defence's poor record in contract and project management shows that Defence still has a long way to go before DEO staff are able to effectively exercise their responsibilities for properties and assets with a gross replacement value of $14.8 billion.</para><para>May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking on behalf of the Committee, the witnesses who contributed their time and expertise to the Committee's review process.</para><para>The Chairman has asked me to thank my colleagues on the Committee who have dedicated their time and effort to reviewing these Auditor-General's reports.

They are:</para><para>·	the Committee's Ninth Report of 2001 titled, RAAF Base Townsville Redevelopment Stage 2, Townsville, Queensland; and </para><para>·	the Tenth Report of 2001 titled, Redevelopment of the Army Aviation Centre Oakey, Queensland. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RAAF Townsville</inline></para><para>The first report relates to the ongoing redevelopment of RAAF Base Townsville. </para><para>RAAF Base Townsville is one of a chain of airfields maintained for defence and surveillance of the northern areas of Australia. </para><para>Together with the RAAF Base Scherger in Weipa, North Queensland, RAAF Base Townsville provides operational and support facilities for the air defence of northern Queensland and its approaches.</para><para>The Base is a joint user airfield, supporting both military and civil aircraft operations. The civil aviation facilities are capable of accommodating general aviation, domestic and international operations. </para><para>The Defence White Paper 2000 has reiterated the importance of cover over the maritime approaches in the defence of Australia. I should note that a Defence presence in northern Australia has bipartisan support. </para><para>Over the last five years the RAAF Base in Townsville has become the largest mounting Base of the Australian Defence Force. During regional crises such as those that occurred in Bougainville, the Solomon Islands and East Timor, the Base was used primarily to train personnel for overseas activities. During the East Timor crisis, there were 17 nations training at the Base.</para><para>Since 1972 continuous upgrading of the RAAF Base Townsville have been the subject of Committee reports. The most recent report was the Stage 1 Redevelopment tabled in 1999. </para><para>The need</para><para>During its inspection of the Base, the Committee saw at first hand inadequate and aging facilities. The Committee needed little convincing that the redevelopment project was appropriate and timely.</para><para>Staged Development</para><para>I would like to make some comment about staged development projects submitted to the Committee by the Department of Defence. </para><para>The Committee was concerned to learn during the course of the inquiry that some elements in the Stage 1 redevelopment were deferred to a subsequent stage, even though they were considered a priority for Stage 1. </para><para>In particular, I refer to:</para><para>·	the Ordnance Loading Apron that was approved by the Committee during the Stage 1 inquiry; and </para><para>·	the cancellation or possible deferral for 10 years of the Light Tactical Aircraft facilities.</para><para>The Committee is of the view that it must be able to determine the relationship between the individual stages of proposed developments in order to enable it to make considered recommendations for each individual stage. The Committee has therefore recommended that Defence provide in its statement of evidence for each stage, an overview of the full scope of the redevelopment, including the specific cost for each element of the proposed work.</para><para>With regard to the Stage 2 Redevelopment at the RAAF Base Townsville, the Committee recommends that the project to proceed at the capped budged of $72.5 million.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Army Aviation Centre</inline></para><para>I now turn to the second Committee Report I have tabled today. </para><para>This Report refers to the Redevelopment of the Army Aviation Centre at Oakey in Queensland.  It involves the upgrading of the Army Aviation Training Centre and includes facilities for the introduction of the armed reconnaissance helicopter and the Army component of the Australian Defence Force Helicopter School.</para><para>The Committee has found the proposed work necessary and recommended it proceed.</para><para>Need</para><para>The need for the redevelopment of the Army Aviation Centre has four elements. They are:</para><para>·	first, the Government's decision to move the Army component of the Australian Defence Force Helicopter School from Canberra to Oakey;</para><para>·	secondly, the strategic decision to retain the Oakey base in the long term;</para><para>·	thirdly, the acquisition of a new armed reconnaissance helicopter for the Australian Defence Force; and</para><para>·	fourthly, the inadequacies of existing facilities at Oakey.</para><para>The training of pilots, ground crew and maintenance technicians for the armed reconnaissance helicopters will be undertaken at Oakey.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Redevelopment Options</inline></para><para>Defence advised the Committee that, in view of the decision to retain the Oakey Base in the long term, the options of rebuilding elsewhere or demolishing the majority of existing buildings and starting again were not economically viable.</para><para>To rebuild elsewhere would not only incur the budgeted cost of this project estimated at $76.2 million, but would also incur the additional expenditure to replace existing suitable infrastructure. </para><para>There would also be significant costs associated with the relocation of personnel.</para><para>Defence also advised the Committee that considerable scope exists at Oakey for refurbishment of existing facilities and this will be further examined during the detailed design phase.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Project Cost</inline></para><para>The estimated out-turn cost is $78.5 million - that is the current estimate of the cost of the proposed works, including escalation and contingency. </para><para>Defence informed the Committee that it will refine the details of the scope of works through value management workshops and further develop the designs for each facility. </para><para>Defence is confident that the project will be able to be delivered within the budgeted out-turn cost of $76.2 million.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Other Issues</inline></para><para>While Defence does not believe that there are heritage issues associated with the project, the Australian Heritage Commission expressed concern about the possible impact on areas of both cultural and ecological significance. The Committee has therefore recommended that Defence consult with the Australian Heritage Commission to ensure that sites of both cultural and ecological significance are protected.</para><para>Defence has assured the Committee that in line with the Commonwealth's commitment to improve energy management and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency is a key objective in the design, development and delivery of Defence facilities.</para><para>In this context, the Committee welcomes the commitment by Defence to consult with the Australian Greenhouse Office on energy efficiency matters on all future major Defence facilities projects.  The Committee also welcomes Defence's decision to engage an expert energy adviser for the Oakey project.</para><para>An important aspect of the Committee's investigation of public works is the opportunity for stakeholders to raise concerns with the Committee about a proposed work. </para><para>In the case of the Oakey project, the Jondaryan Shire Council, within whose boundaries the Oakey base is situated, raised a number of concerns.  They concerned:</para><para>·	the proposed new civil terminal;</para><para>·	the impact of Base traffic on local roads; and </para><para>·	the need for additional water supplies and sewage treatment.</para><para>The Committee has recommended that Defence continue to consult with the Jondaryan Shire Council on these issues. </para><para>On the evidence presented by both Defence and the Jondaryan Shire Council, the Committee is satisfied that a mutually beneficial outcome will be agreed to. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>As I have already indicated, the Committee supports the redevelopment of the Army Aviation Centre at Oakey and has therefore recommended that the proposed work proceed at an estimated cost of $76.2 million.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27559</page.no><id.no>R1323</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>27559</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Boswell</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>27559</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>27559</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>The Bill amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to provide additional funding for projects involving partnerships between communities, industry and education providers as well as projects which provide support for vocational learning for Indigenous secondary students.  This funding is being targeted in response to recommendations in the “Participation Report for a more Equitable Society”, the final report of the Reference Group on Welfare Reform, chaired by Patrick McClure.  </para><para>In particular, the Government will provide $8.6 million over 4 years to promote better links between communities, industry and education providers and build self-reliance for Indigenous people through encouraging Indigenous secondary school students to complete Year 12 and to progress to tertiary and further education.  Funding will be used to implement programmes aimed at promoting early intervention strategies to improve education outcomes for Indigenous school students.</para><para>The initiative will draw on the experiences of the Polly Farmer Foundation `Gumala Mirnuwarni' project which has been successfully operating in Western Australia.  The project vision of the `Gumala Mirnuwarni' project is to improve the educational outcomes for Aboriginal students in the Roebourne area to a level commensurate with the broader population so that they are able to compete effectively for apprenticeships and commercial cadetships, or to pursue further education and employment opportunities.  This partnership model and related networks will be used to seek out interested communities, businesses and industry bodies willing to participate in the initiative.  The outcomes will be achieved by the students themselves as participants with the active support of their families;  individual schools supporting improved outcomes for the students;  the businesses that offer the students workplace learning and post-school training opportunities;  the TAFE/VET providers that may be engaged to deliver elements of the students' skills development;  and other `auspicing' type bodies such as Indigenous education consultative bodies.</para><para>The Bill also amends the Act to provide funding to non-profit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations following changes in the operation of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986.  The changes, which came into force on 1 April 2001, restrict the eligibility of charities and other non-profit organisations to tax concessions to a maximum of $30,000 of the gross taxable value of the benefit per employee.  This requires organisations to pay Fringe Benefits Tax at the rate of 48.5 cents in the dollar on the taxable value of these benefits - about $30,000 per employee.</para><para>This will have a significant impact on some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations which must offer competitive salary packaging to attract suitably qualified staff, especially in remote areas.  The Bill provides $2.86 million over 4 years to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations can continue to provide competitive salary packages which is a significant way in which Indigenous organisations attract suitably qualified staff, especially to organisations located in remote areas.  This will ensure that such organisations, and the students who are educated by those organisations, are not disadvantaged by these changes.</para><para>I commend this Bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the 2001 summer sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (CRUDE OIL) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27560</page.no><id.no>R1403</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>27560</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Boswell</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>27560</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>27560</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>The Excise Tariff Amendment (Crude Oil) Bill 2001 contains amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921.</para><para>On 15 August 2001, the Government announced an overhaul to the Excise Tariff Act to encourage oil exploration and production both onshore and offshore, perhaps leading to associated increased gas discoveries.

second reading speeches incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speeches read as follows</inline>—</para><para>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</para><para>Bankruptcy was devised as a shield that might be used, in the last resort, by an impecunious debtor to seek relief from his or her overwhelming debts.  </para><para>Over the years, some unscrupulous debtors have learned to use bankruptcy as a sword to defeat the legitimate claims of their creditors.  </para><para>This Bill will clamp down on those who use bankruptcy in a mischievous or improper way.  </para><para>By doing so, we will protect those in the community who must become bankrupt, from the odium and stigma caused by a few who abuse the process.  </para><para>By restoring the integrity of the system we will promote confidence in it.  </para><para>This aim will be achieved by a series of linked measures.</para><para>There will be a new discretion to reject a debtor's petition where it is apparent that the petition is an abuse of the bankruptcy system.</para><para>The early discharge provisions, which have permitted some bankrupts to emerge from bankruptcy after only 6 months, will be abolished.</para><para>The trustee will be given stronger powers to object to the discharge from bankruptcy of unco-operative bankrupts, thus extending their bankruptcy for 2 or 5 years.</para><para>A new `cooling off' period of 30 days will be introduced so that most debtors will not become bankrupt until 30 days after presenting their petition.  </para><para>This will allow creditors an opportunity to negotiate with the debtor about alternative strategies.</para><para>Finally, the Courts' power to annul a petition which is an abuse of process will be specifically confirmed as available even if the debtor is insolvent.  </para><para>Bankruptcy will still be available to people in severe financial difficulty who simply need a fresh start.  </para><para>However, these new measures will encourage people who can and should avoid bankruptcy to consider carefully other options, such as a debt agreement, and will make bankruptcy tougher for those bankrupts who do not co-operate with their trustee.  </para><para>Consultation</para><para>The amendments proposed in the Bill reflect the outcome of more than two years of consultation with various stakeholders in the personal insolvency field.  </para><para>In particular, there has been consultation with members of the Bankruptcy Reform Consultative Forum, a peak consultative body that the Attorney-General established in 1996 to facilitate better consultation between the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) and key groups with a stake in the bankruptcy laws.  </para><para>An Official Receiver's Discretion To Reject A Debtor's Petition</para><para>Official Receivers will be given a limited discretion to reject a debtor's petition where it appears that, within a reasonable time, the debtor could pay all the debts listed in the debtor's statement of affairs and it is apparent that the debtor's petition is an abuse of the bankruptcy system, such as when the debtor has singled out one creditor for non-payment, or is a multiple bankrupt.  </para><para>This measure is directed at blatant abuses of the system.  </para><para>It is not envisaged that any petition will be rejected under this proposal without personal or telephone contact first being made with the debtor by experienced ITSA staff.  </para><para>The exercise of the Official Receiver's discretion to reject a petition will be subject to external administrative review.  </para><para>Early Discharge Provisions To Be Abolished</para><para>The minimum standard period of bankruptcy is 3 years.  </para><para>However, about 60% of bankrupts are eligible for early discharge after 6 months, although only about half of those actually apply.  </para><para>The Bill proposes the abolition of the early discharge provisions of the Act.  </para><para>They are most often cited as the cause of concern that bankruptcy is too easy.  </para><para>The reduced period of bankruptcy is seen to discourage debtors from trying to enter formal or informal arrangements with their creditors to settle debts, and provides little opportunity for debtors to become better financial managers.  </para><para>Early discharge can also be quite discriminatory.  </para><para>A debtor who has an income sufficient to make contributions to the estate, or whose estate has assets available for distribution to creditors (factors which disqualify them from early discharge) is by no means necessarily less worthy of early discharge than a debtor whose estate has no money.  </para><para>In addition, allowing only those whose debts do not exceed 150% of income to apply, discriminates against women who have joint debts with, and generally a lower income than, their spouse.  </para><para>Abolishing early discharge will overcome these anomalies.  </para><para>Strengthening Of Objections To Discharge</para><para>For the unco-operative bankrupt, stronger objection-to-discharge provisions will mean that the bankruptcy can more readily be extended by a trustee filing an objection to discharge.  </para><para>The objection-to-discharge provisions allow bankruptcy trustees to file an objection to the bankrupt's automatic discharge before the end of the 3 year standard period of bankruptcy.  Depending on the grounds of objection, the bankruptcy period can be extended by 2 years or, in a serious case, by 5 years.  </para><para>The Bill proposes that certain grounds of objection be classified as `special ground' cases, where only the facts will be needed to found the objection.  </para><para>This will make it much easier to sustain the objection than is currently the case.  </para><para>The special grounds will apply to deliberate actions by bankrupts which frustrate trustees, and add unnecessarily to the costs of administrations.  </para><para>A reviewer will not be able to cancel an objection by taking into account any conduct of the bankrupt after the time when the ground first commenced to exist.  </para><para>This will overcome a deficiency in the present law which can encourage a bankrupt to co-operate with the trustee only at the last moment, that is, when a review hearing is imminent.  </para><para>Cooling-Off Period</para><para>The Bill proposes the introduction of a mandatory 30 day cooling-off period in relation to debtor petition bankruptcies under which debtors will not become bankrupt until 30 days after presenting their petition.  </para><para>The protection from creditors afforded to debtors for the 30 day period will allow debtors who have acted hastily in petitioning for bankruptcy to reconsider their decision.  </para><para>If, on reflection, they are satisfied that bankruptcy is not the best option for them, they will be able to withdraw their petition.  </para><para>The cooling-off period also will allow the creditors the opportunity to negotiate with the debtor to choose an alternative that avoids bankruptcy.  </para><para>The cooling-off period is not appropriate in cases where, for example: </para><para>·	the debtor has attempted an alternative to bankruptcy in the past 12 months;

Indeed, even those on the other side of this chamber know in their heart of hearts that this promise has been broken. The new tax system, particularly the GST, has been extremely damaging in so many respects to the Australian community.</para><para>Let me address the implementation of this unfair and regressive tax. There is clear evidence that this tax is having a devastating impact on small business and ordinary Australians who are least able to withstand its impact. We already know that the GST has not spared the overall economy, with economic growth less than half the level it was before the GST's introduction and with almost weekly announcements of proud Australian companies going under, turning belly-up. </para><para>We also know that the GST has been bad for jobs. While Peter Costello's <inline font-style="italic">A New Tax System</inline> document promised `the combination of higher growth and improved work incentives will deliver more jobs and lower unemployment', we know that the GST has been devastating on employment. Since the introduction of the GST, the rate of job growth has flatlined and the unemployment rate has risen. We have seen the following: a fall in the number of full-time employed persons of 87,700; a fall in full-time male jobs of 68,400; a rise in the unemployment rate of 0.7 percentage points; a rise in the number of unemployed of 77,500; a drop in the rate of growth in jobs of 0.6 per cent, after peaking at 3.7 per cent in July last year; and a rise in youth unemployment from 20.8 per cent to 23.5 per cent. The source for those figures is the Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force figures of 13 September 2001.</para><para>In terms of the impact on small business, the Society of Certified Practising Accountants—the CPA— survey of 600 small businesses released this week shows that all sectors of small business believe the GST has had a negative impact on their business. The survey confirms small business anger at the new tax system can no longer be dismissed as a transitional problem. More than a year after the introduction of the new tax system a staggering 72 per cent of small business say that it has increased their workload; 56 per cent of small business believe it has had a negative impact on their cash flow; just 19 per cent believe it has improved their business, with 39 per cent rating it as having a negative impact on their business activities; and just seven per cent say it improved payments of debts, with 40 per cent finding that the new tax system slowed down payments by debtors.</para><para>Regardless of whether they are in the city or the country and regardless of their turnover, the findings are the same for small business: the GST has been a disaster. Government attempts to improve the hated—and I use that word advisedly, because everywhere you go the reaction is one of pure hate— business activity statement, the BAS certificate, have also been a dismal failure, with just 17 per cent of small businesses using the new form. This puts the lie to government claims that small business does not want further reforms to the GST and the BAS certificate and backs the claim by Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia chief executive, Rob Bastian, that Labor's proposals for simplifying the new tax system have strong backing in small business.</para><para>We are now uncovering much evidence of how Australians outside of the major centres—the capital cities—have been particularly badly hurt by the GST. In this chamber, some months ago, I put up a proposition that the Senate conduct an inquiry into the impact of the GST on Australia, to see whether the promises made for it by the government prior to its introduction have in fact been kept by the government—in other words, an accountability inquiry, truth in politics. Has the government delivered what it promised to do? It is sad to report that this chamber did not find a majority to support that inquiry. Only the Labor Party voted for it. </para><para>As a consequence, since we were not going to conduct an accountability check—I was amazed that my parliamentary colleagues in the Australian Democrats, the so-called keep-the-bastards-honest party who hold accountability at the top of their totem pole as the raison d'etre for their existence, did not want to conduct an accountability check to see what electors in this nation thought of their actions— the federal parliamentary Labor Party set up its own inquiry, and many of the findings of that inquiry submitted to us by ordinary voters and constituents in a number of electorates around Australia are very important. We set up this inquiry because we thought it was high time that Australians got to tell their own stories of how the GST has impacted upon them and how they see relief from the worst ravages of the GST being best targeted.</para><para>Our inquiry has found that its impact on regional centres and smaller communities across Australia has been devastating. In Queensland, for example, the inquiry heard that 38 small businesses have gone under in the Caboolture shire alone since the introduction of the GST. This is a matter that should be of concern to the member for Longman, who, in his capacity as parliamentary secretary for small business, was telling small businesses in the area that the GST would be a boon for them. The inquiry found that the true story is very different, as 38 small businesses had in fact gone under. Small businesses in the Caboolture shire—those that are still in business—are in fact struggling to keep their heads above water. They are being buried under GST paperwork. `Our paperwork has tripled' was a comment frequently heard by the inquiry.</para><para>The compliance cost of the GST continues to be a nightmare. The government would have small businesses believe that the problems associated with the GST have been bedded down. This is clearly not the case. On the contrary, small businesses resent being tax collectors for the government—another typical comment. `I haven't worked 30 years in my business to turn out to be a tax collector for the government' was one small business comment we received. Comments similar to that were made everywhere our inquiry went. Here is another typical comment:</para><quote><para>I'm in business to make money, not to provide the Government with a free service.</para></quote><para>That was another frequently heard comment. That one was made on Bribie Island, also in the Longman electorate. A similar view was expressed in Gladstone and Bundaberg in the electorate of Hinkler. Mr Paul Neville is the National Party member for Hinkler, and in the local media he attacked the inquiry for listening to the electorate. It seems to me that the sooner the Labor candidate for Hinkler, Ms Cheryl Dorran, is elected the sooner the constituents of that federal electorate will have someone in Canberra prepared to represent their true grievances and their real wishes in this parliament and not someone who, like the current member, is simply prepared to patronise the genuine concerns of his own constituency.</para><para>Throughout regional Australia there was testimony on the tremendous costs associated with meeting Taxation Office GST requirements. The inquiry heard from one small business operator in North Queensland who, 15 months after the introduction of the GST, is still having to get a computer service provider to come in every week to ensure GST compliance. At $60 per hour it is a cost they, understandably, can ill afford. These are real Australians putting forward their real concerns about the real costs this regressive tax has imposed on them.</para><para>Beyond compliance costs, the hit the GST has made on the hip-pocket of small business customers has in turn led to a drop in the earning capacity of small businesses themselves. It is, after all, a vicious cycle. As one businessperson explained to the inquiry, `It is not just the GST's direct impact on small business that is the problem, it is its impact on the spending capacity of our customers.' People simply do not have the disposable income anymore to support small businesses. The GST has destroyed small business cash flows in regional centres. Businesses told us that they could no longer afford to take on new staff, as a direct result of the costs of the GST on them. In some cases, they have had to reduce the staff devoted to their core business and, instead, direct resources towards GST compliance.</para><para>We did hear of two thriving occupations in the wake of the GST's introduction: accountants and computer salesmen. Needless to say, this development was not looked upon fondly by the small businesses that have to shoulder the burden of extra accountancy fees and extra costs for computers and other electronic accounting equipment. Nor did they say that the cash grant given to them by the government met anything like the real and genuine costs incurred by them in reconfiguring their accountancy systems and in having to buy new automatic and electronic accounting machines.</para><para>The cash flow problem is a serious one and one that is having an ongoing impact on small business. They are telling us that they simply do not have the capacity to expand or even maintain that business. As one small business damagingly said:</para><quote><para>I've made more money than I ever have, but I'm now worse off.</para></quote><para>Another said:</para><quote><para>My [GST associated] bank charges have now overtaken my advertising budget.</para></quote><para>Many small businesses are becoming disillusioned. One small business bluntly told the inquiry:</para><quote><para>The GST is discouraging entrepreneurial activity. So business is not an attractive option anymore.</para></quote><para>Labor's parliamentary inquiry has also heard how the GST has impacted on Australians least able to afford it. Pensioners, students, the disabled and low income earners dependent on charities are all worse off. In fact, the evidence points strongly to all low income Australians being worse off. The inquiry received in Wonthaggi in Victoria last week a submission from a woman who is completely dependent upon a disability pension. Her plight mirrored that of many people who have shared their stories with us. She detailed just how hard things were for her since the introduction of the GST. She said in her submission:</para><quote><para>Before the GST I could manage quite well, but now I'm just not coping.</para></quote><para>In another submission made to the inquiry, an ex-service pensioner from Sale in Victoria presented evidence to us of just how badly the GST has impacted on his livelihood. Not only did he receive a 1.6 per cent increase in his Comsuper pension, despite reasonably believing that all pensioners would get a four per cent increase in their pension—because that is what he was told by the government—but also his part-time job hours were radically reduced. Like many people, this gentleman has lost over 300 hours in work when compared with the previous year, and his employer told him quite unequivocally that it was the result of a dramatic fall in revenue at their hardware business since the introduction of the GST. The result of such a substantial loss in earnings, combined with having to pay the GST, has meant that this man and his wife have a substantial reduction in their already very modest way of life.</para><para>The reasons for this kind of impact are clear. The GST is an unfair and regressive tax. Those on fixed low incomes pay it on everything, except on some food. They pay it on their utility bills—that is, on their gas and electricity. They do not pay it on their water, but they pay it on the necessary requirement, especially in country Australia, of a telephone. They pay it on their household insurance, and following the collapse of HIH household insurance premiums have gone through the roof and the GST has risen as a consequence. They pay it on their education needs and, in the case of those with young families, they pay it on everything associated with the raising of young children.</para><para>I am surprised that I have not heard anyone from the government benches say, `But they do not pay it on education.' Go out and ask Australian families whether the GST is exempt from all education needs for a family, and you will receive a hoarse laugh. It is not payable on the direct education provision but it is payable on every other element of education needs, and for families with young children it is a significant slug. I was also told by a young mother, `If you are going to roll back the GST, please, for families with young children in nappies, take it off nappies first.'</para><para>Australia's charitable organisations have been severely damaged by the GST. As one welfare organisation said to the inquiry, it is as if `all welfare organisations have been tarred with the same brush as tax cheats'. I heard several times from those who volunteer their time for charitable and worthy community pursuits that they were very angry to hear the Treasurer, Mr Costello, call upon Australians to give up an hour a week to engage in voluntary work. As was pointed out to me by people coming forward from the community, the GST gave most non-profit organisations far more than an hour a week in additional paperwork and headaches. They do need an extra volunteer hour, but that is thanks to Mr Costello and the compliance paperwork mountain that charities now have to deal with weekly. These volunteers highlighted that many former volunteer bookkeepers and treasurers had given up assisting these organisations because of the stresses imposed on them by the GST.</para><para>Australians are desperate for some relief from this regressive tax. They understand that the government has scrambled the tax egg with the introduction of this tax and that any responsible future government cannot easily unscramble it. But they do not believe the Howard government and the Australian Democrats when they say that nothing can be done to make this tax fairer and simpler. They want roll-back and they want to return to a situation where tax compliance does not dominate their lives. Labor are committed to rolling back the GST on two principles: (a) we make it simpler and (b) we make it fairer. This is Labor's agenda. We have been listening to the people of Australia and to Australian small business and, at the coming election, we will present the Australian electorate with a well thought out, thorough and considered set of measures that will make this tax fairer for all Australians and simpler for those who have to bear the paperwork burden so that small business can get back to its core activity of doing business rather than being tax collectors for the government.</para><para>I conclude my remarks by saying that no-one who spoke to us believes any of the promises that the government made before it introduced the GST. No-one believes that they are better off—as the Prime Minister said they would be—because of the GST. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>27567</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One might be unkind enough to suggest that Senator Cook has become obsessed with the GST when there are much more important issues around that warrant the time of this chamber. I recall on the last general business Thursday, which in sitting terms is only four sitting days ago, that Senator Cook and his Labor Senate colleagues raised the GST in a similar notice of motion in terms of the government's botched implementation of the GST. Today they are trying to go one better. In this unbelievable approach that the Labor Party seems to be adopting to issues, they are actually seeking to condemn the government for introducing the GST at all. What an absolute farce that is.</para></talk.start><para>We heard Senator Cook today, apart from butchering the English language with terms like `flatlining'—whatever that means—talk about `real Australians' and their `real concerns'. Let me tell Senator Cook and his Labor colleagues what real Australians want with regard to their real concerns. They want real leadership and real policies. That is what the Prime Minister and the present government are providing for them and that is why, as the polls show, support for the present government is overwhelming. The reason for that is that the government provides a very stark contrast to the Labor Party opposition and its leader, who have no policy and no ticker. </para><para>We also heard Senator Cook talk about the fact that you cannot unscramble the eggs of the GST. Let me say to Senator Cook and the Labor Party that, if you genuinely and truthfully believe that the tax reform implemented by this government, in particular the introduction of the goods and services tax, is doing damage to Australians and, as you claim—I say falsely claim—in particular to small business and is regressive, you would commit to get rid of it. That is the logical approach to policy. If you believe that something already there is bad, you get rid of it and you replace it with something that you believe is better. </para><para>Senator Cook, at the end of his remarks today, said that you cannot unscramble the new tax system eggs. Earlier, we heard the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, say that you cannot change this new tax system, that you cannot get rid of it, because you cannot unscramble the eggs. The fact is that the present Howard government had the courage to unscramble the eggs of the ramshackle tax system we inherited from the Labor government. If you really want to unscramble the eggs of this tax system, if you really believe it is as bad as you assert it is, then of course you can unscramble the eggs. We had a tax system in place for decades that was well established and well entrenched, but the present government, as I said, had the courage to unscramble the eggs of that tax system and introduce a desperately needed new system. </para><para>What were the features of that old tax system? We had exorbitant rates of personal income tax, we had high rates of company income tax and we had a wholesale sales tax that was skewed because it taxed only goods and not services. The feature of that tax was that it was 50, 60 or 70 years out of date, because in its indirect aspects it was a tax system that was introduced in the 1930s. In those days, the bulk of people's spending was on goods and, therefore, an indirect tax system that taxed goods was quite reasonable. However, at the dawn of the 21st century, when most people spend their money not on goods but on services, which under that old, outdated system were completely free of taxes, that tax system had become unfair. It was skewed against manufacturing industry, it was skewed against goods and, in particular, it was skewed against my state of South Australia, where the motor industry is central to the economy. The high rate of wholesale sales tax on motor vehicles was one of the features of the old, outdated tax system.</para><para>That is why we abolished the wholesale sales tax, as a very important part of the much needed tax reform we introduced. We also abolished financial institutions duty as being an unfair, unreasonable tax. We also significantly reduced income tax and company tax. Company tax is now down to 30 cents in the dollar, while the cuts we made to income tax are worth some $12 billion to the Australian community in total gross terms. In addition, we significantly increased payments and pensions. Those are the changes; we unscrambled the existing eggs and made major reforms. If the Labor Party really believe that the system we have now introduced is as bad as they feign to assert it is, they can certainly unscramble those eggs and go back to the old system. But they will not do that, because in their hearts they know that the new system is so much better and that it is delivering benefits to the Australian community.</para><para>I referred a few moments ago to the motor vehicle industry. It has been enjoying boom times since the introduction of the new, fairer tax system, because we have removed a significant degree of the burden of taxation from goods and spread it more fairly right across the range of goods and services. In addition to that, as I said, we have introduced significant income tax cuts, which give people more spending power to spend across that range of goods and services. That is demonstrated in the strength and health of the Australian economy. That, above all, is proof of the benefit of the new tax system. Despite the fact that there is a general slowdown in the international economy and in many other countries, the Australian economy has remained strong, with the highest rate of growth in the OECD. That is a direct result of the fact that we had the courage and the capacity to make significant changes to the tax system. </para><para>The opposition Labor Party lack that courage. They are a party with no policies. They simply flip-flop, hoping to surf into government on a measure of disaffection with some aspects of government policies. As I said earlier in my remarks, the disaffection now, as is clearly shown in the polls, is with the Labor Party and their lack of policies and their clear lack of leadership, and that will remain to haunt them through the election. The Labor Party are completely without policies in this and all other areas. It is rumoured that when parliament finishes sitting at the end of next week, it may well the end of this session of the parliament. Although no-one knows, we may be about three weeks away from an election campaign, and yet we have heard absolutely nothing from the Labor Party in terms of the policies that they are going to put to the Australian people at that election. Again, that contrasts dramatically with what the present government did at the last election, when we spelt out our proposals for tax reform in great detail. We had the courage to put those details to the Australian people, and those details were endorsed at the 1998 election, and then we proceeded to implement the new tax system.</para><para>So, as I said, if the Labor opposition really believe that this tax system is not of benefit to the Australian economy and the Australian people, then they will change it and introduce a completely different tax system, and the only alternative is to go back to the old system, increasing income taxes, reintroducing the wholesale sales tax, reintroducing FID and reintroducing all the other outdated taxes this government got rid of, to the benefit of the Australian economy. The reality is that in their hearts the Labor Party know that this tax reform has secured lasting benefits for all Australians. In their hearts, they really support it. That is the real reason they have said they will not abolish it. It is not this furphy about not being able to change it or to unscramble the eggs: as I said, that is quite possible.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name></talker><para>—I am shocked.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name></talker><para>—It simply requires some political courage, some policy courage and some leadership, Senator Ludwig, which are things that you and your leader lack.

This government has been very effective in implementing the new tax. It was a massive change to the tax system and any massive change, whether it is a change to tax or to any other area of government policy, is going to have teething problems. However, the important point about this government is that we listened to the community and, when those teething problems became evident, we moved to deal with them and to overcome them. In particular, we simplified the business activity statement so that some of the complaints in relation to that were no longer valid. We offered small business the opportunity of only doing an annual reconciliation of their GST, and we made a number of other changes to the administration of the new tax system, to overcome those implementation teething problems.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The community appreciates that, and that is reflected in the rising support for the government in recent weeks—support which occurred well before any of the recent events. Well before any of the recent events the government's community support was on the rise; it has simply been re-emphasised and reinforced by the events of recent days. As I said, in their heart of hearts the Labor Party know that this system is going to be of benefit to our economy and to all Australians through the 21st century, and that is the reason why Labor will not get rid of it. Continuing their carping criticism, the opposition have introduced the notion of roll-back: `We're going to have roll-back; we're going to keep the tax, but we're going to roll it back.'

Labor would remove the GST from some items—that, I assume, is the way that Senator Ludwig believes it is going to be made fairer. Yet, on the other hand, they talk about the complexity of the system for small business—roll-back is only going to make it ever more complex. The more exclusions and exemptions you have from the GST, the more complex it is, the more difficult it is and the harder it is for small business to meet its compliance obligations. Everyone knows that the best indirect tax system is a system that is across the board on as many items as possible, at the lowest rate possible, so that compliance is relatively simple; and that is what this government has done in its tax reform program. It has introduced a simple system at a low rate, and of course that rate will remain low because of the safeguards put into the legislation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What are the other options for roll-back?

I have been talking for the last 10 minutes or so about our major tax reforms— something which the Labor Party in 13 years in government did not have the courage to do, despite the fact that Mr Keating at one stage wanted to do it. He was overridden by the unions and overridden by Prime Minister Hawke, who did not have the ticker to implement it. We have made major tax reforms. We have introduced major reforms to the area of workplace relations which have resulted in enormous gains in productivity in this economy. Of course, the consequential benefit of that for everyone is that we have had significant increases in real wages without the problem of inflation—unlike what happened with the Labor Party in government, when there were real declines in wages. The Labor Party are the party that claims to represent the workers, yet throughout their period in office they presided over declines in real wages. The Liberal-National government under Prime Minister Howard, on the other hand, have produced real wage increases of significance while keeping inflation low, because the workplace relations reforms we introduced unleashed a massive bout of productivity improvement—again, the best in the OECD. So that is another policy of ours, Senator Ludwig.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What other policies are there? We have had policies on gun control which were very important for this community, and there have been a number of other policy initiatives that have made Australia over the last five or six years a much better place in which to live and work. That is why the economy of Australia has performed so much better than the economy of any other developed country over this period. Our policies are out there; they have been implemented carefully and steadily over the last five or six years in government.

If a Labor Party government perchance gets into office at the next election, we know only too well where its policies will originate—the policies we have heard nothing about yet and probably will hear nothing about until after the election. We know where the policies, when and if Labor gets into government, will come from: they will come directly from the trade union bosses, who will force them down the throat of a compliant Mr Beazley, that would-be Prime Minister without any ticker.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is the contrast between the two parties that will be vying for the support of the public in the next month or two for the future welfare of Australia. We have a government that has been in office now for five or six years and has had the courage to implement massive reforms. We have put those reforms to the people in elections. We have sought and obtained mandates for those reforms. We have subsequently implemented them, and they have been of enormous benefit to the Australian community and its economy. In contrast to that, we have a Labor Party that will not provide any policies and will not provide any leadership. So the motion that has been put forward today simply does not stand up to scrutiny. The benefits of the tax reform that the government have introduced are clearly evident. They warrant support, and they will continue to have the support of the Australian community—as they did at the last election when we put them up as our policy and as they have retained since. There is no doubt that under a future Liberal-National Howard government this country will go forward beneficially. Its community will benefit strongly from this tax reform, as indeed it does from all of the other reforms we have initiated.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>27571</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to join the debate on the motion by Senator Cook here today. Essentially, the motion we have before us contains three issues. The first issue is the breaking of a promise. We all remember that it was the Prime Minister of this country who said and promised to the community of Australia that he would never, ever introduce a GST. The second issue goes to the impact of the GST on small business, on low and middle income earners and on families— something that I think the previous speaker knows little of. The third issue in the motion is about the botched implementation of the GST.</para></talk.start><para>It is some months ago that the Labor Party, in this place, undertook to establish a full Senate inquiry into the operations of the GST. I think that was an eminently sensible thing to do at the time. There are good reasons to have an inquiry at the moment into the GST and into its impact and its implementation. The GST, as we know, is the most radical change ever to the tax system of this country. It is now more than 12 months since the introduction of the GST, and I believe it would be good public policy—in fact, it is good business practice in any operation—to undertake a review when major changes have been implemented. I think, 12 months down the track, 12 months after such a radical and enormous change to the taxation system, there should have been a full Senate inquiry into the impacts of the GST and its implementation.</para><para>However, the Senate, and I believe the community of Australia, is aware that coalition senators in this place, along with the Democrats and other senators, did not want to open the GST and its implementation to scrutiny by the Australian public. I understand that. I understand that, for political reasons, the Liberals, the Nationals and the Democrats would not want scrutiny of their GST and its implementation. But I cannot understand that, for good, sound public policy reasons, these parties would not have wanted the Senate to do its job—that is, to review the implementation of government policy. It was an appropriate time to undertake a proper review to find out what has happened in the last 14 to 15 months and to find out if there was a way to make it better.</para><para>And so it was left to the Labor Party to fill the void and to conduct its own investigation into the promises that the government made about the GST, about its implementation and about its impact on the community. The Labor Party, over the last few months, has conducted an inquiry in over 30 centres across the country. I was part of the inquiry in the centres of Cairns and Townsville in North Queensland, and it was very beneficial to me to meet with a range of people—businesspeople, pensioners, students—who came to that inquiry. I would like to take this opportunity to thank those people for their participation, for their submissions and, most importantly, for their honesty and, in many cases, in opening up the books of their businesses to scrutiny. Thank you to those people.</para><para>The first issue that came to mind when going through the inquiry and the first promise that people talked about was that `everyone's a winner with the GST'. You will remember that Mr Costello, in answer to a question on notice in May 2000, said:</para><quote><para>All Australians ... will be better off under The New Tax System.</para></quote><para>Unfortunately, we did not get a lot of evidence to support that contention. There was a small cafe operator in Cairns who came to the inquiry—a blue-collar cafe in a working-class area—and he certainly did not welcome the GST. He talked about the increased paperwork. He talked about the fact that his stock prices had risen 35 per cent to 40 per cent. Importantly, he talked about the impact on disposable income in the community and that, as a result, he had completely lost all his pensioner business as those people had less income to purchase his product.</para><para>But the most interesting observation that he gave to the committee was the story that he told about Mr Warren Entsch. He told us that Mr Entsch, the member for Leichhardt, came to his cafe before July last year. The cafe operator complained to him about the GST and what he thought would happen to his business as a result. Mr Entsch, at that time, bet him $100 that his small business would not be worse off 12 months after the introduction of the GST. The small business person took that bet, and we heard how, some 12 months later, Mr Entsch returned to the cafe, admitted that he had lost the bet and paid his $100. Through his actions, Mr Entsch has admitted that small business people, in particular this cafe, were worse off under the GST. He puts a lie to Mr Costello's statement that `all Australians will be better off under the new tax system'.</para><para>To return to the actions of Mr Entsch: what did he do? He paid up on a bet. That is all he did. He has not done anything else in the parliament to assist this small business person or, in fact, all the small business people in the electorate of Leichhardt. In fact, at the time of the GST inquiry, one of the Howard government's ministers, Mr Tony Abbott, was in Cairns. We heard him on local radio saying how well he thought that small business was coping with the GST. Certainly, this cafe operator did not agree with that. It is a shame, I think, that Mr Abbott and Mr Entsch did not take the opportunity to talk with people who are grappling with this new tax system and its implementation.</para><para>We also heard from a woman who has established a small business as a wedding coordinator. It had been operating for 15 months prior to the implementation of the GST and we heard from her 14 months post. Prior to the GST she had arranged six Australian weddings—she does a lot of overseas weddings as well, but we will talk about the Australian experience—since the GST she has only arranged two, and one of those was booked prior to the introduction of the GST and without the knowledge of those people that a GST was charged. She was angry because it is a tax, she believes, on her service. There are no input tax credits that she can claim back. It is a tax on her ability to do her job. She believes that now that people have less disposable income they are undertaking to arrange their weddings themselves.</para><para>The second promise we canvassed in the inquiry was that no small business would go under because of the GST. We had some very sad evidence from Mr Brian Proudman, a bookstore owner from Cairns. Proudman's bookstore has been operating in Cairns for nearly 20 years. He warned prior to the introduction of the GST that there would be a problem. He said that there was confusion at start up and that there was no information from publishers. Prices increased. Paperbacks went from $13.95 to $16.95, hardbacks from $35 to $49. He said that as a result people were choosing to purchase their paperbacks, in particular, from supermarkets. He had completely lost what he called his cash business, the money that kept his family going.</para><para>Mr Proudman was a bookseller who took a lot of pride in ensuring that he had a wide range of books for the Cairns community. His business has closed down. He had a turnover of over $750,000. We are not talking about a small operation here. He lost 50 per cent of his turnover and now this business is not in operation. That family planned to sell their business, probably a few years down the track, as a going concern and that that money would be for their retirement. They were proud businesspeople; they are now looking to the old age pension to keep them in their retirement.</para><para>We heard also from a bookshop owner in Townsville, who said, `It is a tax against employment.' She said that there was no cash flow to pay the wages of her staff. The costs were increasing so much that she was unable to employ more people even though in her case turnover had increased. We heard also from a person who provides<inline font-style="italic"></inline>Yellow Pages services in the north. She said that, of her 400 clients, many more two-person businesses simply did not answer her call when she rang to re-establish their bookings in the Yellow Pages. They were not there. We then move to the third promise that small business red tape will be slashed by the GST. We remember Mr Reith saying in 1998:</para><quote><para>We've also taken the opportunity in our new tax plan to significantly reduce red tape for small business.</para></quote><para>The taxi owner that we heard from in Cairns does not agree. He told the inquiry that he knew from personal experience that Mr Howard had broken his promise that everyone would be a winner and that the GST would slash red tape. He said that the GST had impacted on both his tourism business and the other major part of his business, which is pensioners who use taxis to get around. Since the GST, his business is down between 10 and 13 per cent from the year previous. On top of that, he complained of the paperwork. His drivers do a statement once every month, so he has to provide those figures for his drivers. He also has to do quarterly reports and he does four investment activity statements on top of his usual business and personal tax returns. He has gone from a situation where he had one form of compliance to some enormous number, when you add all of those up. Now he is faced with the Ansett debacle where he knows that the 40 per cent of his business that is tourist related will be significantly hurt. He also talked about the impact of the GST on petrol prices. No wonder taxi drivers are leaving the industry in droves.</para><para>We also heard from the operator of a quite significant guest house offering mid-range and backpacker accommodation. He has six full-time and five casual staff. It cost $4,500 for his start-up computer costs. His wife is a fully qualified accountant and she estimated that it took her 200 hours just to establish the system so that they could comply with the GST. Now she takes half a day to complete the BAS. Remember, we heard from the Treasurer that it was going to be a half-hour job. He also has problems with invoices and the itemising of the GST. He explained that every time he receives an invoice the GST has to be calculated on every single item, and he suggested that there may be another way that invoices are provided.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—There is.

He described the GST as a tax on his kudos, a tax on his skills and a tax on his artistic talent. He initially registered with the Australian Taxation Office but found that the paperwork was so burdensome that he was doing more paperwork than potting. He has now deregistered himself from the ATO. The word to describe his attitude to the new taxation system is, I think, `furious'. He was so angry and annoyed about what it had done to his operations that he was almost shaking.</para><para>The fourth promise that we looked at was that the GST would create more jobs. In August 1998 we heard Mr Costello say:</para><quote><para>The combination of higher growth and improved work incentives will deliver more jobs and lower unemployment.</para></quote><para>We heard from a small business called Aussie Bush Hats operating in Cairns that is basically reliant on the tourism trade. They employed 9½ staff and, as good small business people, they knew that they would have to use computers to operate their business after the GST. They installed a new computer and some new software. To this day they are still paying $60 an hour for a technician to come and talk to them about how they can fix this computer and its software. The proprietor of that business complained that the government had provided her with very little advice and support about how best to purchase the computer systems and software that would assist her. Her partner works in the shop of an evening and she tells us that she spends until 11.30 every night correcting the computer and that, while she runs a computerised system, she does the whole thing by hand as well because she has no confidence in it. We also heard from a small business operator in Townsville who was told by the tax office that she was behind and would have to wait to receive the form to comply with the BAS. In fact, she said that they had to wait seven weeks. She made the interesting observation that in her business she finds that she cannot be seven weeks behind in the payment of bills and is surprised that the Australian Taxation Office can be.</para><para>The next promise was that the GST would not be a tax on a tax. The Townsville City Council told us that in fact it is. While they do not charge tax on their basic rates, the costs of compliance have led to an increase in the rates they have had to charge. They have had to pass on those costs to the community. We also heard from the Endeavour Foundation in Queensland. They talked about compliance costs too. They said that, as a large organisation, they have had the capacity to deal with the GST, although it has meant increasing compliance staff and fewer staff for their welfare services. But they made the very significant point that those very small charities with one or two employees that are essentially run by volunteers are really at risk and that they have had to pick up the slack of those organisations, which simply cannot do the work. We were told that a lot of organisations find it very difficult nowadays to attract someone to take up the position of Treasurer because of the responsibilities of that position and the potential liability that position has.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—And complexity.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84L</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name></talker><para>—And complexity, you are quite right. Finally, we heard from a student who talked about the impact of the GST on students. He said that he was very angry because the government had promised that the GST would not be a tax on education. He said that students do pay GST on textbooks and that everything has increased, from accommodation through to medical costs. He said that the GST is discouraging people from full-time education and that low income students—which most are—find it easier to just go and get a job and leave university. He also said that the GST is working against the long-term national interest.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I note that Senator Chapman said earlier that it would be simple to just remove the GST. That shows how out of touch this government is with the community. We have gone through a process of engagement with the community and, while everyone recognises that the GST is an unfair tax—it is a tax on distance and a tax that disadvantages those people who are less well-off—the cost to the community to change it again and go back to another system or find another system would in fact be too great to bear. All the small businesses that we spoke to said that the GST had been a nightmare, but they did not want enormous change. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>27575</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When perusing recently the September edition of <inline font-style="italic">Charter</inline>, the journal of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, I was attracted by an article by Kurt Rendall. Kurt is a partner of the chartered accountants firm Rendall Kelly and a man who is well versed in his experience with small business. The tenor of the article suggests that small businesses are starting to feel a lot more comfortable now with tax reform and the GST. He said that they are feeling comfortable despite the media hype and, might I add, despite the strenuous efforts of the ALP. It is not only the media but the ALP along with the media who are leading this campaign about the alleged problems. But Kurt's view in this article, through his experience with hundreds of small businesses, was that they are becoming much more comfortable with the concept of tax reform and the GST.</para></talk.start><para>No-one will honestly deny that there have been problems. Of course there will be when you tackle an issue of the enormity of tax reform and the GST changes. But do not forget that a lot of the changes were due to matters that were brought upon as a result of actions within the Senate. Mr Rendall concludes:</para><quote><para>One year into it and it is beginning to work and, by a large, SMEs are now coping quite well.</para></quote><para>I was interested in a number of the examples that were provided by the last speaker. I have to question a number of them. The comment was made that the lady who conducted the wedding business—and I presume she also provides food et cetera—had no input credits. Obviously, this lady is getting some very bad advice because, if she is not claiming any input credits, she is paying far too much tax. So rather than beat up this story, why not direct this lady to a proper accountant so that she pays the correct tax and not too much tax? I find it unbelievable that a person would be conducting a business of that nature and not be entitled, as was alleged here today, to any input credits.</para><para>Then she went to the taxi operator. Yes, there has been something of an exodus from the taxi industry, but what have we found? A lot of these people were part-time workers on social security. This has picked up on the black economy, because a lot of these people were working for cash and also often claiming social security. Now, of course, with better identification and business numbers, they have had to leave if they wished to retain their social security benefits. So, yes, there has been an exodus, but it is because this was part of the black economy that the GST has picked up on—people who should have paid tax but were not paying tax and people who were claiming social security and at the same time moonlighting.</para><para>Then she came to the potter. The potter was pretty smart, because he had a very small business. Actually, the complaints that I get are not from the potters of this world who have a low level of income derived from their business in crafts and hobbies and these sorts of things. We are told that they are competing very effectively. As she admitted, the potter changed from being a GST business to not paying GST. But at the same time, the potter will have to pay tax on inputs. As we all appreciate, most of the work of a potter is in the creative process and the time that they take. They are personal services, which the previous speaker admitted, and, because there is no GST added to those personal services, those sort of people are in a better competitive position compared to those whose businesses are much larger.</para><para>The position of the Labor Party is that we have got to have roll-back. If you ask the professions and the business community about roll-back, they are appalled. They say, `After all we have been through, we will have to start again and to change.' We have heard about l-a-w law under the Keating government. Will the state premiers, who get all this GST, allow a possible future Beazley government to roll back one of their most important sources of revenue? So, while Labor's intention might be to roll back the GST, what would be the reality? A number of state premiers have indicated their opposition to the concept of roll-back, particularly to the extent that has been suggested. The reality is that Labor would say, `We tried, but the state premiers would not agree.' Where would that leave the credibility of Mr Beazley? These are issues that we all have to be very much aware of.</para><para>When I looked at the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper </inline>today and saw this motion, I thought, `Senator Cook really must have an old gramophone, which he has got out, has wound up, and he has put on one of his favourite records—the GST,' because, after what I have just said about Kurt Rendall, it is out of date and repetitious. Given all the important issues that are facing Australia at the present time, we could have had a good debate on stranded passengers, Ansett problems, superannuation issues or the international scene. But, no, we go back and regurgitate issues of a couple of years ago that have really passed people by. People are now getting on with their lives. </para><para>The debate has failed to acknowledge the offsets. Labor has just looked at one part of the equation—the GST. There has been no talk about the other tax reforms: the fact that 80 per cent of Australians pay tax at the rate of 30 per cent or less—a terrific incentive to work—and the withdrawal of all those other taxes that had been built into the system. We have not heard about the success of the Australian economy and the success of our exports. Yes, part of that success is due to the low value of the Australian dollar, but the other factor that has to be recognised is the absence of all those escalated costs—government charges in the form of taxes—that were there previously but are no longer there. This amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars for exporting companies. So it is not surprising that Australian exporters are doing very well due to a combination of two issues: the low value of the dollar and the fact that there is no GST on exports. Seldom have we seen so many primary industries doing so well at the same time. The Australian economy is going along quite nicely.</para><para>Another thing I could not believe is that we are talking about all the problems with the GST and, in the same breath, we are talking about the problems that seem to be associated with it—One.Tel, HIH and Ansett. I could not quite see the connection there because I am sure the GST must have had a very insignificant impact on any of those issues. Perhaps that has got clouded in the overall debate but, in the way it has been presented as a GST related problem in the context of the motion before us, I find it extraordinary to start talking about those sorts of failures.</para><para>I thought I would go back a little bit in history, so I went back to 1998 preparatory to the GST. A lot of people were in favour of it and we heard about the conditions that were going to be put down for tax reform and how different organisations were going to judge the government on the basis of whether it was fair, just and delivered. People spoke about making the system fairer and more competitive—fair enough. They spoke about the tax system making victims of low and middle income earners. I will tell you about the impact because these really are the big winners. There was a worry that it would destroy jobs. There were all the sorts of things that the Labor Party are regurgitating now. But the reality is that all these concerns have dissipated in light of the way the government has responded with its GST. Another concern was that the states and territories would be starved of revenue. What did our government do? They made sure that all the GST, to the last cent, went to the states and the territories. Again, that worry has dissipated. </para><para>There were allegedly five foundation principles for the introduction of a better taxation system. One was the elimination of as many existing indirect taxes as possible. That elimination list is really quite formidable and I think we all know them. There was the wholesale sales tax, BAD and FID. We are all familiar with those. That was the first principle. Full marks on the first of the five foundation principles for a better tax system.</para><para>The next principle was the introduction of a national tax on consumption set at rates between 10 and 12.5 per cent on as broad a base as was practical. We introduced it at the lower limit of what was required—10 per cent—and no increase. That was going to be vetoed by all the state premiers. The third principle was a remodelling of federal and state financial relations to ensure the states and territories had access to sufficient sources of revenue to facilitate the rationalisation of their existing indirect taxes. Delivered 100 per cent—100 per cent of the revenue goes to the states. Full marks on point 3 to the Howard government. </para><para>The fourth principle was a reduction in rates of tax on income and simplification of business arrangements. What has happened to tax? At the corporate level, it has gone from 36 per cent to 34 per cent to 30 per cent. Delivered in full. What has happened at the private level? As I mentioned before, 80 per cent of Australians are paying tax at the rate of 30c or less. Marvellous! Full marks on that. The fifth principle was a reworking of the interplay between tax and the social security system to reduce the poverty trap confronted by low and middle income earners. If you are honest and look at people in the social welfare area, you will see we have done a great deal to remove poverty traps. We will never remove them all, but if we have not got close to full marks on that we are pretty close. Ask ACOSS and all those sorts of organisations whether the government has made a genuine attempt to remove these poverty traps and it will rank very highly.</para><para>Out of these five foundation principles, the Howard government has performed exceedingly well since 1998. I thank Senator Cook for moving this motion, because this is probably an appropriate forum in which to use these measurements that were laid down well before the GST came in as to what society really required of tax reform. We would have to be in the high 90s on all of those, if not at 100 per cent on some of them. Helen Clark, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, believes the tax has been very well accepted and that no-one seriously thinks it will ever be changed. She was asked in an interview: `Does it apply to things like tampons, for example, and, if so, have you ever thought of lifting the tax on items like that? Helen Clark said no. I think it is true to say that, once you start differentiating between classes of goods, you get into anomalies which can be a bit hard to explain. So why don't you listen to your sister across the Tasman? </para><para>The Institute of Accountants says that the more products that are GST free adds to the complexity and that the poor shopkeeper who is selling a mix is going to find things more difficult. Whether you ask university people, whether you ask the Small Grocers Association or whether you ask the local accountant, according to Mike Bannon, who reports in Sunday's <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, more exemptions, as envisaged by Mr Beazley, will produce more uncertainty and disputes between the ATO and taxpayers, and self-interest groups will be relentless in their claims for more exemptions. And so the problem goes on.</para><para>Let us look at the situation when the Labor government was under the leadership of Paul Keating and even in the lead-up to the change of government, when there was still a Labor government. What did we find? A very perceptive Asian, former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew, spoke quite often about what he called the `white trash of Asia'. But what about Lee's successor? We have now come to a new generation, a new Prime Minister and a Liberal-National coalition, and the position has really changed. There are different aspects. In many parts of Asia we are concentrating on fast growth, but in terms of forgetting the fundamentals he says, `Australia didn't; they are winning the race.' In fact, now that Asian values like cronyism have gone out of fashion, Australian regulators have lent expertise to Taiwan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Hong Kong to help local authorities develop better regulatory and statistical services. In other words, in terms of winning the economic region's race, Australia is right up there, according to the Singaporeans— and so we are.</para><para>We overcame the problem of the Asian crisis and we were referred to then as a `miracle economy'. It is true that the world has a lot of problems, but we are fairing much better than others. Why are we fairing so much better? We have got rid of a lot of government debt, and we have good economic management. We have repaid $50 million and that money has been going to health, education and other areas. Where would we be in the future in terms of the needs of a growing elderly population if we did not have a strong indirect tax base? But we have it. We could not go on just slugging the workers with higher and higher rates of tax. </para><para>Under 13 years of Labor government there were problems. The perception of Australia was not good. The perception of Australia in terms of productivity was slipping, and that has been reversed under our government. We have an efficient form of taxation, we have a very fair taxation system as far as families are concerned and as far as business is concerned, and Australia is well positioned to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>27578</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am happy to support and extend Senator Cook's and Senator McLucas's contributions to this debate. I think it serves, at this stage and following Senator Watson's comments, to go back to the motion proper. Senator Cook moved:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate condemns the Government for introducing a goods and services tax after promising `never, ever' to do so and for the damage that this regressive tax has done to small business, middle- and low-income earners, and particularly Australian families, through the botched way it has been implemented and continues to operate.</para></motion><para>I am not sure where Senator Watson referred to issues such as HIH and One.Tel—and I admit that I was in another meeting during part of Senator Cook's contribution, so Senator Watson may have sought to make some reference to contemporary issues—but I am really not sure how we got to be talking about the `white trash of Asia', either.</para><para>Today, I want to spend some time revisiting issues raised by a number of senators in this debate. I, as did Senator Cook and Senator McLucas, attended some of the inquiry meetings into the operation of the GST. I found this a very useful experience, involved as I was in the original Senate inquiry into the potential impact of the GST and a new tax system. The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee reported on its inquiry in March 1999, and it is interesting to note that many of the issues we foreshadowed in that report have become significant issues in the implementation of the GST.</para><para>Senator Watson referred to the issue of jobs, and I encourage senators to review a lot of what was said, with specific reference to a number of particular sectors and the likely impact of the GST on those sectors. The main one that comes to mind in contemporary circumstances is tourism. It is simply not the case that the tourism sector has not complained about the implications for employment of the introduction of the new tax system. In these contemporary circumstances, they are obviously even more concerned that they are, in a sense, bearing the double whammy of the current problems associated with Ansett and the ongoing implementation problems associated with the GST—not only in terms of their situations as business operators but also in terms of the level of demand for the products that they deal with.</para><para>I could spend quite some time today—and I suspect I will not have that time—going through a number of the issues that were raised at the meetings in both Boronia and Rowville in Melbourne by the large number of people who responded and attended those inquiries into the GST. I need at this stage to remind the Senate, following some of Senator Watson's comments, that the Labor Party sought to establish a Senate review—and Senator McLucas has covered some of this—and it is disappointing that, given some of Senator Watson's comments, the government did not actually participate in that review. If he believes that, as in some of the examples that Senator McLucas raised, people have been badly advised or that their problems—and he accepts that their problems are legitimate—could be corrected through better advice then I am sure that that contribution from the Australian community that responded to information about this inquiry would have been very welcome. But, as Senator McLucas pointed out, the government and the Democrats did not want an inquiry—or, indeed, an inquiry that would report before an election. </para><para>Senator Chapman, referring to the Labor Party, said, `They know it's good.' He said that we know the GST is good. However, Senator Watson pointed out by characterising Senator Cook as somewhat like a broken record that he is aware that we have consistently, repeatedly and for a very lengthy period of time, even before this government sought to introduce the GST in the first instance, referred to the problems associated with a GST. So where Senator Chapman gets the notion that we know it is good, I am really not sure.</para><para>I concur with Senator McLucas. This notion that, if we are really serious about the problems that we believe exist in the system then we should just get rid of it, reflects an approach that is simply out of touch. My experience in the inquiries and the discussions that I have had with people about the implementation of the GST is that the community does understand. I contemplated a few analogies of how they might understand that once this system has been put in place it is not something that can be simply undone. It is not a complicated notion. One example that was put to me was a rail analogy. You do not build a railway line and then shift its destination or change the infrastructure, but you can still change or deal in a different way with how people get on or off the railway line and which people or which goods or which services get on or off. That is the situation with the GST. </para><para>We are left with a system that cannot simply be `gotten rid of', in Senator Chapman's words. However—and the government has to acknowledge this as well, if you look at the changes that they have made in recent times—there are modifications to the system that can be made to improve it. Much was made about the concern of the business community with this notion of roll-back. I suspect that Senator Watson did not quite mean to say it this way and was perhaps not reading correctly from the note that he referred to, but he was suggesting that the article by Kurt Rendall suggested that business was `getting more comfortable with the tax and the ALP'. I suspect he meant to say something else there. </para><para>But the community is also becoming reassured that the notion of roll-back is a notion of improving the system and if change is to occur, it is to simplify and remove anomalies. The best example of that is the business activity statement. Business is concerned about further changes. They have had enough difficulty dealing with the changes that have occurred thus far, but at the same time they also say that there are still significant problems and that the changes that have occurred to date have not resolved a number of them. That is a fine balance that you can resolve only through adequate consultation. </para><para>As I said, I could spend time today going through the individual experiences of the several people who gave us their stories in Melbourne, but the examples raised by Senator Cook and Senator McLucas covered a fair range of the situations and the issues affecting people. They also covered issues such as the anomalies in the system that could be rectified to make it simpler rather than, as the government seems to frequently suggest, make it more complex. They also gave examples of areas where simple and straightforward reform would make it in some ways fairer. The latest example of that arrived in my in-box today. It was a letter to the Prime Minister from Smokenders. This is an example of their concerns with the GST. They say:</para><quote><para>The GST is charged to smokers who use established counselling and cessation programs, while it is not charged for quit-smoking pharmaceuticals, patches, gum, quit-smoking hypnosis and acupuncture. This tax is costing the smoker more to engage in behaviour modification therapies than drug or alternate remedies.</para></quote><para>The question is posed in the letter to the Prime Minister:</para><quote><para>Why do counselling and cessation programs have to charge the smoker GST?</para></quote><para>The reason I use this example is that it is not the only one. We have had evidence put to us in this inquiry on several occasions of examples where people have been asked by representatives of the government to put forward their issues, their anomalies and their problems and suggest how they might be managed or resolved. They often have done that and they have provided us with examples of what they have provided to the government but then afterwards the calls do not get through or the calls do not get returned. That raises the question that, if the government is prepared to accept roll-back, of a sense, in relation to issues such as the nature of the business activity statement, petrol, caravan parks and beer, what do these other organisations need to do to get some movement in terms of their areas of concern? </para><para>This review undertaken by the Labor Party has been such an important measure because we have said in a comprehensive way, `This system has been in place 12 months now. Let us find out the details of the problems of its implementation and let us look at what can be done to improve that system.' Our view about improving is not, as has been beaten up by some, the notion of change for change's sake. It is an attempt to make this tax fairer and simpler. The response that Senator Chapman suggests of `Just get rid of it' is obviously quite irresponsible. Senator Chapman suggested to us in this debate today that there are serious problems with our notion of removing it from some items. I listened to Senator Watson's contribution about this issue and he quite rightly pointed out that the exemptions to the operation of the GST were as a consequence of a Senate action and this is why it was so important for us to review how effectively that Senate action is affecting the implementation of this tax.</para><para>Again, this is why it was so disappointing that both the government and the Democrats did not want to find out the answers to those questions before an election. We have looked at the consequence of that Senate action in terms of the exemptions that currently exist and we have looked at those areas where anomalies are creating problems. They are some of the issues that we will address when we look at how we review some of those matters. </para><para>Senator McLucas gave some examples of where you have businesses operating where the exemptions apply and the difficulties they have in dealing administratively with the components of their business to which the exemptions relate and the components to which they do not. I suppose the Smokenders example is another one where issues such as the health type exemptions create problems and distort markets as well. But we have not seen the government take a serious look at any of these issues. There seems to be this blind, head in the sand type approach. Senator Kemp characterises it best by saying, `Yes, but you like it; you are going to keep it, too', and that was reflected by Senator Chapman in commenting, `They know that it's good', when the reality is that there are a number of implementation problems that need to be addressed. The only people looking seriously at trying to do that at the moment are the Labor Party. To continue down the path this government has gone down with these ad hoc pragmatic responses, which is the fairest way to characterise some of what has happened in relation to items in that list that I referred to before—BAS, petrol, caravan parks and beer—is not a systematic way of running an appropriate tax system. Until the government gets serious on that score, I think the cynicism that exists within the business community will continue. </para><para>Senator Watson, I do not know who Kurt Rendall is. I will refer to the article to which you brought our attention in this debate. But I think I should balance it with the concerns expressed elsewhere from members of the business community. Before I do that, I will just make one point which reflects on some of Senator Watson's contribution. He said that the GST came in with a lot of promises. Yes, that is right. He made a select reference to those that he thought we had had a reasonable score on. But of course there are others. One such promise was, for example, that it would improve the integrity and simplicity of our tax system. I am not sure who believes that that has occurred. Another promise was that it would create a better quality of business, because GST reporting brings operators closer to their business. I am not sure who within the business community really believes that. Let us look at some of the other things that the business community has said. </para><para>On this anniversary of the GST's introduction, a survey by the Australian Industry Group found that almost 70 per cent of businesses were suffering GST related cash flow problems—70 per cent is very high—and that the GST was placing a massive burden on small companies, with a 40 per cent increase in tax administration costs. The Labor Party's small business spokesperson, Mr Joel Fitzgibbon, gave us a tidy representation of some of these surveys. I will refer to an excerpt of a speech that he made on some of these issues. Further, the AIG survey found that the time taken to administer tax has increased by 65 per cent to eight hours a week. This is precious time which small business owners and operators are forced to spend collecting tax for the government, when really this time should be devoted to the actual running of their enterprises. In the inquiry that we are running at the moment the small business view on this has been extraordinarily strong. The survey also found that the government's changes to the business activity statement had, as I mentioned earlier, only a minimal impact on the burden of red tape. So, according to the AIG survey, no, we still do not have it quite right. I am sure that small business operators have concerns about further changes but they would also be concerned to see it continuing as it is if they do not believe that it is quite right yet. </para><para>The CPA Australia survey that has been discussed most recently found that 39 per cent of small businesses believe that the GST has had a negative impact on their overall  business performance and 56 per cent said that the new tax system had a negative impact on their cash flow. A survey by Hall Chadwick looking at independent retail grocers found the average total cost of compliance for their members was more than $12,000 per business. Senator Watson said that we needed to look at the compensations. Well, the comparison there in terms of that level of cost nowhere near matches the compensations given to small business. </para><para>A Victoria University small business research unit found last October that small business owners were devoting one full working day each week to GST related paperwork. Australian Business Limited's survey in May found that 65 per cent of small businesses cited the GST as hurting their cash flow. In May and August this year, the Yellow Pages index survey found that, of the seven most important reasons small businesses were critical of the federal government's policies, six were directly related to the goods and services tax and completion of the business activity statement, including key indicators such as cash flow, debt and profitability. The Australian Bureau of Statistics' national survey in June 2001 found that small businesses had the most pessimistic profit expectations of the business sectors, medium and large. </para><para>CPA Australia's July 2001 research found that 59 per cent of firms responding reported negative cash flow and only 22 per cent felt that the tax changes had improved their performance. Linking that back to the original promise of the system, I repeat that only 22 per cent felt that the tax changes improved their performance. Forty-two per cent—almost double— said that it had had an overall negative impact. Further, 84 per cent of businesses surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers in the same month believed their overall tax compliance was more complex than before the introduction of the GST, while 59 per cent of small businesses feel that their cash flow has been hit by the GST. A spokesperson for one of Australia's leading banks says, `The feedback we're getting from small business is it is a tough competitive environment.' <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>27582</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, George (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator George Campbell)</inline>—Order!

I have spoken about the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and their corporate plan many times. It is interesting that they have tabled their corporate plan for consideration at this time. What is not before the Senate at the moment is the response by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to the order of the Senate of yesterday for the production of documents relating to the Ansett catastrophe by 5 p.m. today, nor has there been an explanation for this. </para><para>Obviously, the minister and the government are quite happy to stand in contempt of the Senate on this matter. They obviously have no intention of explaining to the Senate why they have not met the timetable laid down by the Senate. I remind government senators and the minister that the wording of the return to order is on page 31 of today's <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. It required the production of documents by 5 p.m. today. I stress that the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government had the opportunity to come in here this afternoon and explain why they were unable to meet that timetable or what timetable they were able to meet or give some other explanation for their non-compliance with the order of the Senate. </para><para>They have chosen not to do so. They have allowed the matter to run on. I guess they are expecting that somehow we might forget that this was due today and they would simply get away with not responding to it. I can assure them that that will not be the case. If they think that we are simply going to accept that they will continue to hide from the public the material which is essential for the public to understand just how culpable this government is in relation to the Ansett failure, then they are sorely mistaken. I remind the government that the Senate has authorised the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee to conduct an inquiry into this matter. If they believe that that will not be pursued, then they are also sorely mistaken. </para><para>CASA is one of the bodies that has to be satisfied that Ansett, if it is capable of getting back into the air, is capable of meeting the obligations laid down under the regulations and administered and monitored by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Other aircraft brought into Australia have to be operated in accordance with the provisions of any air operating certificate issued by CASA. The aircraft have to comply with certifications given in relation to aircraft operated in Australia. All of those questions are relevant to what the future of aviation will be in this country. </para><para>In terms of the return to order, it would have been of great interest to the Australian public had the Minister for Transport and Regional Services done as he was required by the Senate and produced any analysis and report prepared by the Department of Transport and Regional Services relating to the application by Air New Zealand to the Australian government for approval to take 100 per cent ownership of Ansett Airlines. It is interesting to note that today Minister Anderson could not get his lines right as to whether his government was favouring Qantas or Ansett or taking an even-handed approach to that matter. The fact of the matter is that the government have done nothing to allay the concerns of the public in relation to this matter and they stand condemned.

This treaty, along with others, was considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on Monday. Unfortunately, I was not able to get to that hearing because of other commitments. That was a source of frustration because there were a number of questions I would have liked to have asked on that treaty. The national interest analysis that was tabled along with the treaty states that it provides a framework for collaboration with Russia in a broad range of space projects. There are two proposed spaceports: the Asia-Pacific space centre proposed for Christmas Island and the spacelift facility proposed for Woomera, which would use wholly Russian launch vehicles, and the agreement is necessary to facilitate both. The agreement is a critical step in facilitating those proposed projects and any further projects that may emerge in the future.</para><para>The Democrats, including Senator Stott Despoja and others and I, have spoken a number of times about the importance of promoting science and the space industry. I do not want in any way to be seen to be talking against opportunities for expanding space exploration, on the proviso of course that that is done properly and effectively in a cutting edge way and in a way that is environmentally sound for Australia and global interests. The Democrats do have some concerns in relation to the history of the space exploration industry, the Russian space launch industry, particularly environmental aspects. This national interest analysis talks about it being necessary to facilitate some of these projects including Christmas Island and Woomera and others in my home state of Queensland, potentially including the almost pristine Hummock Hill Island in central Queensland, which is proposed for a rocket launch site. This national interest analysis talks about costs and benefits. There is not a mention of the environment at all in it. Surely the environment is part of our national interest and should be considered by the Australian government as part of an agreement. In the Democrats' view, you do not simply sign an agreement to enable transfer of technology without examining or putting in some requirements and procedures in relation to environmental matters. We believe that is a significant omission, and one that needs questioning.</para><para>Our concern relates to environmental performance. More than 2,000 tonnes of space litter from the Russian space program is scattered across areas of Russia, with major environmental effects that have only recently come to light. The safety council of the Russian federation assessed the environmental impacts of the release of toxic rocket fuels and noted that a serious ecological situation exists at the spent-stage fall sites for the first stages of rocket boosters, with ground and surface water toxic concentrations many times more than acceptable levels. Significant contamination of vegetation happens as a result of atmospheric transportation of vapours and aerosols with rocket fuels. </para><para>The fuel that has been used traditionally in the Russian space industry is not necessarily the same fuel that is likely to be used on Christmas Island. I understand that kerosene and liquid oxygen is the proposed fuel for Christmas Island. But there are still concerns about that fuel that I believe need to be properly considered. The Democrats have received information that Russia's space industry has done so much damage in Uzbekistan that Uzbekistan has terminated the Russian space program there and is giving Russia two years to wind up their program. So in that circumstance we think we need to look at what we are doing in expanding our operation in that direction.</para><para>In June this year a conference in the Netherlands discussed the viability of green rocket fuels. The Democrats believe Australia should be at the cutting edge of that sort of technology with rockets and rocket fuels. What is the future of green rocket fuels and can Australia be part of this innovation, rather than relying on old fuels and countries with particularly poor environmental records? I am not saying we should not explore the space industry with Russia, but we should ensure that we do it in a cutting edge way that ensures environmental issues are properly addressed. Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Multilateral Treaty Action</title><page.no>27584</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>27584</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>I will speak briefly on this also, partly to highlight the importance of this document and again to highlight the fact that often these things are not properly considered. This list contains a range of proposed multilateral treaty actions that are currently under negotiation or consideration by the Australian government or are expected to be so within the next 12 months. There is a significant number. Whilst a lot of them are what might seem to be fairly benign machinery ones, there are also others that are potentially extremely significant. This is not a bad thing at all. The Democrats are strong believers in international cooperation in a range of areas, and the more constructive multilateral agreements we can get in place the better. But the important thing, from the Democrats' view, is that there is proper scrutiny and adequate scrutiny of those negotiations and what those agreements may lead to. The treaties committee that has been established, one of the positive initiatives of this coalition government, does provide some mechanism for doing that, but it tends to look at treaties after they have been developed and tabled, such as the one I was just speaking to previously. It tends not to be able to engage very often in the preliminary stages, and this is an area of concern.</para><para>One area of concern relates to economic treaties, particularly in the area of trade and the World Trade Organisation. One of the effective activities of the treaties committee, where it did look at something before it was locked in and was still under consideration, was the multilateral agreement on investment. Sufficient concern raised by and generated from the community level by a whole range of groups, including the Democrats and many others, created enough pressure for the committee to have a look at it. When they had a look at it, they saw a lot of flaws, sufficient that the whole thing fell over.</para><para>I know the agenda is still there and that people are still working away behind the scenes within some bureaucracy to try to reinstigate some of that in another guise, which shows the importance of ongoing vigilance. There are other ongoing discussions and negotiations that I think also need to have the spotlight shone upon them. The treaties committee is tabling a report into the World Trade Organisation next week, I think, so I will not pre-empt anything that is in that. But there is significant concern developing in the Australian community about what is known as the GATS—General Agreement on Trade and Services— agreement and an agenda on the part of the federal government and other governments, or probably even more so on the part of the Australian bureaucracy in many parts, to advance that particular agreement which, if adequate safeguards are not put in place, could significantly endanger the quality of provision of basic public services such as education, health and a whole range of other areas.</para><para>There has been very little public discussion or debate or even awareness of the fact that this is under way. Indeed at the next stage of negotiations later this year it is potentially going to be advanced further and we are likely to again find ourselves in a situation, if there is not sufficient scutiny of negotiations such as these by the Australian government, that agreements such as these will find us locked in and potentially unable to prevent inappropriate international competition in areas of basic public services. In the Democrats' view, there are inadequate safeguards in place at the moment to prevent that from being so.</para><para>Already there are examples in other countries of public interest provisions being put in place by governments in relation to public services and environmental measures that are being challenged and overridden on the grounds of free trade in those service areas, and that is a great concern. Whilst some may want to argue that there are positives in that and that it should be embraced, the Democrats do not share those views, but we are willing to have the debate. The key thing is that we need to have the debate, but we do not believe that the debate is occurring or that the awareness is there. We certainly wish to flag our concern about that particular issue and the need to have proper consideration of significant treaties and agreements such as that in advance, rather than after the fact. That is not occurring in the area of the GATS agreement, and the Democrats strongly support moves to have more attention given to that proposed agreement.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title> Consideration</title><page.no>27585</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to government documents were considered:</para><para>Airservices Australia—Sydney Airport—Maximum movement limit compliance statement for the period 1 April to 30 June 2001.

I was a full member of the inquiry into the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. I replaced Senator Cooney for the purpose of that inquiry, and I was therefore a full member, with full voting rights. The report that was brought down by the Privileges Committee refers, at paragraph 5, to this fact:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee met during a break in estimates hearings, that is, before the article based on the draft report appeared in <inline font-style="italic">The</inline><inline font-style="italic">Australian,</inline> to discuss the matter. It made admirably exhaustive but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to discover who might have disclosed the draft report.</para></quote><para>I believe that was a meeting that was held on the night of 20 February and I, unfortunately, was not invited to that meeting. The following day I received from the secretary of the committee, Ms Pauline Moore, an email which confirms that very fact. The email says:</para><quote><para>Dear Senator Hogg</para><para>I am sorry that we did not get in touch with you yesterday about the meeting held last night. This was the result of each of two groups thinking the other had contacted you.</para><para>With respect to the letter from Senator Payne—a written response to Senator Payne is required from all those who either had access to the report (the Secretariat) or were sent a copy (Senators and their staff, where applicable).</para></quote><para>It goes on to say that the committee will meet to consider the matter. I responded to that email, and my response to Senator Payne, dated 22 February, was as follows:</para><quote><para>Dear Senator Payne,</para><para>I cannot explain the disclosure.</para><para>I was not invited to the private meeting of the Committee held on 20 February and so I am not familiar with the circumstances relating to any alleged disclosure.</para><para>Anyway, whatever the circumstances, it wasn't me, if that is what you were asking or wanted to know.</para><para>Yours faithfully</para><para>John J Hogg</para></quote><para>So I made it quite clear in my response that I had not been invited to the meeting of 20 February, when the issue of an unauthorised disclosure of a draft report of that committee had been raised, and nor was I aware of any alleged disclosure.</para><para>The report of the Privileges Committee then goes to the issue of the conduct of the inquiry into whether there was a breach of privilege because of the early disclosure of the draft report. On the conduct of the inquiry, the report notes at paragraph 10:</para><quote><para>On receipt of the reference, the Committee of Privileges wrote to the editor in chief of <inline font-style="italic">The</inline><inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, as well as to all current members, and the secretary, of the Legal and Constitutional Committee, seeking comment on the matter. All responses to the committee's letter are included at Appendix B to this report...</para></quote><para>Unfortunately, the secretariat of the Privileges Committee for some reason did not write to me. There was no letter to me at all; I was not consulted. When one reads appendix B, one will find that there is a response from Senator Cooney, who at that stage was a participating member of the committee, and you will find no response from me at all.</para><para>The real reason I am speaking tonight is to get to the tawdry response of the secretary of the committee—and that is the only way to describe it. The response of the secretary of the committee leaves me outraged and appalled at the unprofessional and scurrilous attack on me, the Clerk Assistant (Committees), Senator Bishop and, undoubtedly, others by innuendo. Let us look at the scurrilous way in which I was attacked. The letter from the secretary of the committee, Ms Moore, to the Chair of the Privileges Committee, Senator Ray, in no way mentions my letter of 22 February to Senator Payne, but says:</para><quote><para>I refer to your letter of 13 August on the above matter. The following events may or may not have some connection.</para></quote><para>`May or may not'—that is trying to have a go at my character and that of others who are associated with me. The heading reads:</para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Prior to the unauthorised release of the above report:</inline></para><para>I requested the Clerk Assistant (Committees) to advise Senator Hogg that the Secretariat was far too busy to write what amounted to a separate report on issues essentially irrelevant to the inquiry ...</para></quote><para>What a hide for them to determine that I do not have the right to a dissenting report if I wish to write it! This is what we have got from this upstart of a secretary of the committee. The letter goes on:</para><quote><para>... and that, as this `dissenting' report was being requested long before the Chair's draft was available, as well as being irrelevant, it was contrary to Standing Order 38(2).</para></quote><para>So what! I am a member of this Senate and, if I want to put in a dissenting report, I will do so. It then goes on:</para><quote><para>I was subsequently advised by the Clerk Assistant that Senator Hogg insisted on the report proceeding—</para></quote><para>of course I did; of course I insisted that there be a dissenting report—</para><quote><para>and had told the Clerk Assistant this dissent was a `payment of a debt', or words to that effect.</para></quote><para>What does that imply about my character and my relationship with the Clerk Assistant (Committees)? This is a load of rubbish. No-one in their right mind would write this. It goes on—and this gets better:</para><quote><para>Senator Hogg requested that the Chair's draft, when available, be emailed to Senator Bishop.</para></quote><para>Let me say that, in my ignorance at that stage, I thought that Senator Bishop was a participating member of the committee and was entitled to a copy of the report. When it was pointed out to me by the secretariat that that was not the case, fine, I backed off. But let us look at how this is used. It goes on:</para><quote><para>As Senator Bishop was not a member of the Committee, Senator Hogg was told by the Secretariat this was not possible.</para></quote><para>I accepted that. But then they include a paragraph entitled `After the unauthorised release'. What do we have here? Innuendo after innuendo. It says:</para><quote><para>Two of the Secretariat staff working on the dissent went to Senator Hogg's office by appointment to meet with him and Senator Collins to discuss it; when they arrived, they were told to return later. Shortly thereafter Senator Bishop left the office.</para></quote><para>What do we have—spies running around this place trying to check up who is in whose office? Anyone who knows my office knows that the door is wide open. You look straight into my office. There is no secret about what goes on in my office, and if people want to walk in to talk with me they can. But we get this nonsense from this person who claims to be a responsible and professional member of the secretariat of a committee of this Senate. All I can say is that it leaves a hell of a lot to be desired when they can write this letter and not include anything about the fact that I had written to the chair of this committee—and the secretary of the committee would have been aware of the letter in which I clearly outlined that I had no knowledge of, or no association with, any leaking of any report. To impute that some association between me and Senator Bishop then led to some form of leaking is completely scurrilous, completely unwarranted and, when one reads this within the context of the report, leaves my character open to quite a deal of question which is quite unfounded and quite baseless. I believe it shows that there is a lack of professionalism and a lack of any integrity in the secretariat of that committee. I can understand why that committee must have difficulties in working with the secretariat when they have such a person leading the secretariat.</para><para>I believe that an unequivocal apology is due to me. This letter was given under the privilege of parliament, and this is the only place that I have to redress the issue that I raise here tonight. This letter, singly, is a disgrace to this Senate and to a committee of this Senate and I would like to see at some stage a total withdrawal of any inferences in that letter made public by the author of it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>27587</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In taking note of the 100th report of the Senate Committee of Privileges, I refer to page 10 of the report—the page just referred to by Senator Hogg—and read into the record some comments made about me in the last paragraph of the letter dated 27 August by Ms Pauline Moore, the secretary of the committee, to Senator Ray. Under the heading `After the unauthorised release' it says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Two of the Secretariat staff working on the dissent went to Senator Hogg's office by appointment to meet with him and Senator Collins to discuss it; when they arrived, they were told to return later. Shortly thereafter, Senator Bishop left the office.</para></quote><para>That is the end of the letter. It seems to me that that raises a number of issues. For the record, I want to state that I never participated in this particular committee report, did not attend any of its deliberations and never had access to or saw the committee report until after it was a public document tabled in this place. It seems that this letter from Ms Moore to Senator Ray raises two issues. Firstly, it is apparently the practice of this committee and this secretary and some or all of her staff members to keep records of the attendance of members of parliament at various offices in this place. How is it anyone's business that a member of parliament, either in this chamber or in the other house, attends the offices of other senators—as they do regularly all day every day—to discuss routine or other business? And why is it the business of the secretary of the committee and her staff to keep written records of the activities of members of parliament in this place and then put them in public documents under privilege? As Senator Hogg said, it is simply outrageous. The apparently grossly improper activities of committee secretariat staff in keeping tabs on the activities of members of parliament should be the subject of an inquiry by the Clerk of the Senate. I formally request that.</para><para>The second issue it raises is that of the professionalism and the ability of Ms Pauline Moore to carry out her duties as a member of the staff providing support services to the various senators in this place. I say that because there is a clear implication in her correspondence of improper behaviour by me. She linked attendance at a meeting with later events without a shred of evidence suggesting any such linkage at all. So, in my view, it would be quite pertinent for the Clerk of the Senate to pay heed to this correspondence and the comments that are now formally on the public record and to institute an inquiry into the professionalism of Ms Moore and other persons who may have been involved in these activities and report accordingly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>27587</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— First of all, I thank Senator Hogg for warning me that he was going to raise certain issues out of the 100th report of the Senate Committee of Privileges. I also indicate to Senator Hogg that there was a failure by the committee to write to him on these matters because we wrote to current committee members and not to people who had been substituted in. This was a failure on my part: not only did I not remember that I suggested that he go on this committee and suggest to Senator Carr that he replace Senator Cooney on it; it completely escaped my mind when all the correspondence came to me to send to existing members. That was an oversight by the chair. I apologise for it.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, I do not think any member of the committee ever thought that Senator Hogg would be responsible for leaking to that particular journalist. It is inconceivable that a member of the Right faction of the Labor Party would leak a story to a former Centre Left member of the Labor Party—unless you are exceptionally clever! I have to say—and Senator McGauran is present tonight and a honoured member of the Senate Committee of Privileges—that we do have enormous difficulty in tracking down leakers. I have to say—and I have said it for the record before—that leakers of Senate reports are inevitably senators. Let us not cast a shadow of doubt over other organisations, secretariats and all the rest; these reports are inevitably leaked by senators. The odd senator has been caught. We did catch one two or three years ago because he gave a televised press conference leaking the report. He did throw himself on the mercy of the Senate. So it does happen, but normally you do not catch a leaker. If you look at the report, at least one of my colleagues in the Senate was pretty straightforward. He said:</para><quote><para>It would appear that the document in question was `leaked', and that such a leak may have been calculated to politically damage a member or members of the Legislation Committee, given the political context and the subject matter at the time. Certainly, that seems a credible theory.</para></quote><para>That is code for: there was a Liberal Party preselection in New South Wales and maybe it was leaked for that purpose. Who knows? I do not know. I have no idea who leaked it.

You are right: I will not have a guess whatsoever. And Senator Greig, at least, does not have a guess either. But one thing I think he is right about—and I am probably right about—is that it was a senator who had access to the report. As I said, tracking down any leaker is usually beyond the powers of the Senate Committee of Privileges, no matter what talent is therein assembled. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Could I also say that the committee—and I am not going to go into the discussion of the committee—did receive a letter from Ms Moore. It was noted, I think, by committee members that maybe it was a strange letter. I have to also say that we never had any intention to censor any letters. I think it is our responsibility to publish all the replies unless they are totally defamatory, and I do not think this falls into that category exactly. However, I do not think this is a very wise letter. In the very opening paragraph, the letter states:</para><quote><para>The following events may or may not have some connection.</para></quote><para>If they do not have any connection, we do not want to hear from the person. The last sentence in the larger paragraph, where the letter mentions `a “payment of a debt”, or words to that effect' is pure scuttlebutt, second-hand hearsay knowledge, and I do not know why it is there. It has no relevance to our inquiries into leaking. As for the reference to Senator Mark Bishop, I have say for the record that, whether or not Senator Bishop is on this committee, Senator Hogg has the right to discuss those issues with Senator Bishop or a staff member any time he likes. There is, of course, a requirement on Senator Bishop not to disclose any of this material, and he would not. But we do discuss issues with colleagues and with staff.</para><para>For heaven's sake, we have had plenty of these committee reports find their way into a minister's office and then over to departments, and that does take things a little too far. We have been a bit cross about that over the years when it has occurred, and we have had grave suspicion that some of the minority reports to references committees have been departmental reports, et cetera. But the more innocent explanation is really that the department wanted to be prepared to respond properly. Quite often, we have found that departments do not understand Senate privilege. Many of them have taken education courses of late and have made progress in this regard, and that is quite pleasing. The letter goes on to state:</para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">After the unauthorised release:</inline></para><para>Two of the Secretariat staff working on the dissent went to Senator Hogg's office by appointment to meet with him ...</para></quote><para>Yes, Senator Hogg may well have been busy, but then it goes on to state:</para><quote><para>Shortly thereafter Senator Bishop left the office.</para></quote><para>So what? He has left my office on a few occasions. Sometimes he has been happy, sometimes he has been unhappy, depending on the nature of our conversation. More often than not, I think he will concede, he has had a very nice coffee there.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator Mark Bishop</name></talker><para>—That's right.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—But so what? In summary, we are not in the position of ever censoring the material that comes to us. I do not think that is appropriate. The only time we ever censor material is in a section 5 right of reply, which we are instructed to do—and always in terms of negotiating with the complainant. So we had no choice but to put that letter in our report. But it was a very strange letter. It was one that I think drifted aimlessly all over the place. It is full of innuendo—for what purpose, though, I cannot divine. I think it would have been better not to have come.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the things possible here is that the Clerk Assistant may well draw that committee secretary's attention to all of the previous correspondence sent to the Privileges Committee by other secretaries. That would be a very good educative process, to see how all of the other secretaries over the years have responded. Nevertheless, if such a letter had come in and referred to me, I have to say, Senator Hogg, I would have been pretty concerned, as you were tonight.</para><para>I would like to finish by saying that we have had a record number of references of leaked committee reports. Really, it is getting beyond the pale. Why do people leak committee reports? They leak them basically for brownie points, don't they? They leak them to pre-empt the rest of their colleagues or to do damage to someone. It is not really a proper procedure to do that to your colleagues. Often it is only to get a bit of publicity a day or two before the report is about to be published.</para><para>If you think that you are getting brownie points with journalists by doing it, I can tell you that as soon as you make a mistake they will be the first ones to attack you. They will attack you because they do not even respect you. They do not respect leakers along these lines. They know deep in their own hearts that it is part of their job to obtain this sort of stuff and to publish it. That is part of their job. That does not mean it carries respect with it.</para><para>When it is things like in camera evidence it becomes even worse and we wreck the whole committee system that actually is the joy of the Senate. We are all frustrated by aspects of the committee system, sure, but we have to have something productive that at least delineates us from the other place, that justifies our existence. It is little wonder that various parliamentary institutions from around the globe come here to see how the committee system operates—the estimates committees, the standing committees, the references committees and the legislative committees—because rarely is it so accurately defined and effective as in this chamber. Senators have to take responsibility for protecting that committee system, and they will not do so by leaking reports and by leaking the internal discussions within those committees. You would have to say that an overwhelming majority of senators in fact abide by the rules and respect their colleagues.</para><para>It is a real disgrace, I have to say in conclusion, that we are up to the 100th report of the Privileges Committee. I cannot remember what the number was when I took over the chairmanship, but I think it was about 55 or 60. We have had all of those cases, the majority of which have been leaking cases. In conclusion, I think these matters can be resolved internally. They had to be raised here. They could be raised nowhere else, because this letter itself was a privileged document.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>27589</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to committee reports and government responses were considered:</para><para>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade—Joint Standing Committee—Report—Australia's relations with the Middle East.

I particularly wish to acknowledge the death of Andrew Knox of Adelaide, who has already been referred to in other remarks by members of this chamber. Andrew was a former official of the Australian Workers Union, a union that I had the privilege of being an official of and general secretary of for a number of years. I pass on my sincere sympathy to his family and friends. Just as we have seen out of that terrible tragedy in New York the goodness in human spirit rise to the fore with the efforts of the many volunteer service workers such as firemen, police, ambulance officers and thousands of members of the general public of New York to assist in the recovery and rescue operations, I also wish tonight to refer to some work being done by two Australians.</para></talk.start><para>Some weeks ago I was visiting my duty electorates on the North Coast, Cowper and Page. I met Mr and Mrs Barry and Michelle Wicks, who live at Harwood on the Clarence River, just north of Grafton. Senator Ridgeway, who is in the chamber tonight, would know this area very well. Barry and Michelle Wicks are retired people. Barry is a retired boatbuilder. They were distressed by the devastation that was inflicted upon the people of East Timor after the vote for independence there. They were particularly distressed to see the destruction of many thousands of fishing boats and the consequent destruction of the livelihoods of many East Timorese people living in the coastal regions. </para><para>As I said, Barry is a retired boatbuilder. He and Michelle decided that they would try to do something practical to assist the people of East Timor. Barry set about using his skills and the equipment in his garage at home. He put in some capital of his own and last year he commenced building some boats, some canoes, which could be used by the fishermen of East Timor to try to get their lives back together. As part of this project, which has become known as Aussie Boats for East Timor, they also sought sponsorship. Since they first began this project, they have managed to involve community organisations such as Rotary, surf clubs and shire councils, including the Maclean Shire Council near where they live, which have contributed funds and other resources to the project. One of the ironies of the project is that early this year, while Barry and Michelle were involved in building their first couple of boats for delivery to the people of East Timor, major floods occurred in the North Coast region and their property was flooded. It was with some degree of irony that Barry found himself trying to build these boats while his property was under severe flooding. But he pushed on and the first boat, out of a target of 100 boats, was delivered to the East Timorese people earlier this year.</para><para>Since then, he was informed that the Chinese government had donated a large number of outboard motors to East Timor. This provided a certain degree of synergy to his project. He then set about redesigning the initial boats that he was intending to build and came up with a design which could incorporate the outboard motors that the Chinese government has donated. He and Michelle have now constructed a number of these boats. The cost is about $1,200 per boat, so it is not a huge amount; but, when you are talking about building 100 of them, of course it adds up. A number of the boats have already been delivered to the people of East Timor.</para><para>There is another side to this very generous and practical voluntary work performed by Barry and Michelle Wicks. They have also taken on some local unemployed people, who have been assisting with the project. In the process, Barry has been teaching them skills such as how to operate machinery, some basic woodwork skills and boatbuilding skills. Michelle, who runs the administrative side of this project, has been teaching these people some computer skills. So there is a positive spin-off from this project to assist local unemployed people in the region.</para><para>Tonight I want to put on the record my immense thanks to Barry and Michelle and also to give public acknowledgment to what I believe is a very worthwhile project. As I have said, they are intending to produce—and are well on the way—over 100 of these canoes, which will be sent through to East Timor and will certainly restore the livelihoods of many of the fishing people there. There is an old saying that I am sure we are all aware of: if you give a person a piece of fish, you can possibly feed them for a day; but if you teach them to fish, or provide them with the means to fish, you can feed them for a lifetime. That is what Barry and Michelle have done: they have given back to these people a means to earn their livelihoods.</para><para>Their work has been acknowledged by the newly formed Fisheries and Marine Environment Service of East Timor. Mr Richard Mounsey, the United Nations Principal Fisheries Adviser, wrote to Barry and Michelle in June this year:</para><quote><para>Dear Barry and Michelle Wicks,</para><para>The Fisheries staff of East Timor's newly formed Fisheries and Marine Environment Service (FMES) thank you both for your efforts to help the poorest fishermen in East Timor. The fishing group in Fatu Hada also thank you most sincerely.</para><para>The new boat (fatty) is performing well and the fishing group testing it are reporting that they now have a real chance to get back on their feet. Three families are operating the boat and they are feeding themselves, putting some money away for future repairs and maintenance, able to buy basic fishing gear and still make a modest income ... They also believe things will get better as they learn new skills and can afford better gear.</para></quote><para>It is a project that I believe we should all give great support to. I understand that approaches for assistance have been made to government departments including AusAID but as yet it has not been forthcoming. Indeed, I wrote to AusAID at the end of August—27 August, I think—asking them why they had not provided any assistance to this most worthwhile project. To date I have not received a reply and I hope that I get one soon. I commend to the Senate this most worthwhile project which is helping the people of East Timor.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Care of Indigenous Children</title><page.no>27591</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>27591</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak about the care of indigenous children in this country.

One of the first things that the Director-General, Ms Carmel Niland, did when she took on the role was to deal with the suffering and circumstances within the community by first of all apologising to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in New South Wales for the role of the department in the removal of children from their families. She went on to say sorry and, on behalf of the department, expressed her regret about the department's involvement over a long period of time—and even in recent days—in that dark chapter of our history. DOCS also, as an adjunct to dealing with the symbolism, revised its policy on service delivery to Aboriginal people, and it essentially based its new commitments on the principles of self-determination and participation. </para><para>It took a lot of courage to recognise that the department was contributing to the problems, that it had a bad track record with Aboriginal people and that it needed to do something to redress that perception as well as look at what was happening substantively out on the ground. Essentially that meant looking at the questions of inequity in relation to services, the lack of access and the absence of opportunity to participate in a lot of the matters affecting communities and affecting children. The department also responded by drawing up a new corporate plan and a new business strategy, and I believe it is implementing a much more rigorous and transparent reporting mechanism to better meet the needs of Aboriginal children in New South Wales. </para><para>I am not suggesting for a moment that these measures by DOCS have comprehensively addressed the needs of Aboriginal families in New South Wales. At this stage it is perhaps too early to draw any conclusions one way or the other. Nevertheless, I think it is a positive initiative and one that is heading in the right direction. There are genuine efforts being made in some states to turn their record on the care of indigenous children around, and I acknowledge that these positive steps are being taken.</para><para>I also acknowledge that some states are making a much more concerted effort than others, according to the degree to which they prioritise the need to improve the lot of indigenous children. The inconsistency in response between the states lies at the heart of the problem, and is one of the indications of the fact that there are no legislative or policy standards being set by the Commonwealth with regard to the wellbeing of indigenous children. It is not good enough for the Commonwealth to simply point the finger at the states and territories and tell them, as the parliamentary secretary did earlier this week, that they `need to do more'. We all know that. But, as in so many other policy areas, the Commonwealth need to be raising the standards, they need to be setting the benchmarks and they need to be providing a national legislative framework that all jurisdictions can comply with. </para><para>This is a message that has been delivered to the Commonwealth on many occasions, and not just on this occasion in response to what has been said by the parliamentary secretary. We only have to look at the reports that have said exactly the same thing over the past 10 years. The first being the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1991, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report into the separation of children from their families in 1997 and, only last year, the Senate committee report into the stolen generations that I had the privilege to participate in.</para><para>Each of these landmark documents have recognised that many of the social, economic and cultural problems that confront indigenous communities stem from past removal policies and contemporary practices. The reality is that some of the contemporary removals are often brought about by the fact that the juvenile justice system operates more to remove children from their families rather than for remediation and rehabilitating them within their own community. The lack of parenting skills in the Aboriginal community is a result of parents themselves having been removed from their own families in communities. Contemporary removals are also often brought about by the cumulative effects of poverty, domestic violence and poor access to support services to address these problems.</para><para>As the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee reported last year in its inquiry into the stolen generations—and the various statements from numerous witnesses—the key solution to some of the current separation practices is to implement national standards legislation regarding the treatment of indigenous children. That conclusion was supported by the Australian Democrats in our minority report to the same Senate inquiry. More recently, the Secretariat National Aboriginal Islander Child Care—or SNAICC, as it is commonly known—issued nine principles that it regards as critical to the achievement of a better future for indigenous children. As the national peak body representing indigenous children's interests, these nine points represent the minimum acceptable policy response that we should expect from both the present government and the opposition, particularly considering that we are possibly only a few weeks out from a federal election being announced.</para><para>In light of the gravity of this issue, I think it is important to bring to this chamber's attention the nine principles identified by SNAICC. The first principle deals with acknowledging, in the symbolic sense, and dealing with the question of an apology. The second looks at the need to reduce the number of children being removed from home for child welfare and poverty related reasons. It is important to point out that the current rate for the removal of indigenous children is six times the rate of removal for all children. The third point is about providing access to family support services to prevent family breakdown and reduce the number of indigenous children removed from their families by state welfare authorities.</para><para>The fourth point that SNAICC makes is the need for a national commitment to early childhood development through the expansion of the Multifunctional Aboriginal Children's Services and other early childhood services. In terms of behaviour, we have to get in there early and recognise that unless you actually try and stem the tide of behaviour in terms of what children see, unless you actually deal with the habits that are developed from such an early age, then we run the risk of children from a young age through to adolescents ending up with the wrong types of habits and repeating a lot of the mistakes of the past. We have an opportunity to make sure that we can establish national benchmarks for government services. I would hope that, given the comments that were made by the parliamentary secretary, Chris Gallus, the government is not shirking its responsibility and that it is prepared to lead on this matter. Quite frankly, when you consider the range of legislative options that exist out there amongst the states and the Territory, they are not delivering those options and they are exacerbating the problems already in the community.</para><para>The aim is really to show that our kids are important, to put a human face to it and somehow to draw attention to the needs of those kids and their situation. I think the challenge for us is to think about our behaviour and its impact upon children. Children learn from observing our behaviour—not just behaviour within families and the behaviour of friends and community members but also the behaviour of political leaders and governments. Too often children witness behaviours which carry messages of violence and neglect and indifference instead of all of those qualities that are required to support the nurturing process and provide encouragement.</para><para>In closing, our children will continue to face an uncertain and difficult future if our political leaders fail to respond to the issues being put forward by SNAICC. They are worthy of consideration. Perhaps the government may read them and perhaps the government and opposition will take them on board.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ansett Australia</title><page.no>27593</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>27593</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not think there is anyone in this parliament, or in Australia for that matter, who does not greatly regret the collapse of Ansett Airlines—the long troubled Ansett Airlines.

The founder of Ansett, Sir Reginald, was a Victorian identity, a very colourful one and a much liked one.

But Ansett did not collapse because of any government policy, nor can competition policy be blamed for the collapse of Ansett. It really is a question of management of this particular company. This was a private company fully owned by the board of directors of Air New Zealand. The Air New Zealand board cannot claim to have been at arm's length from Ansett. It was fully 100 per cent owned by Air New Zealand. Some of the board directors have attempted to claim that they have pawned off Ansett, that it was not integrated in every single way with Air New Zealand. To think that the directors had the cheek to pay themselves a bonus in regard to their performance that year! That is highly questionable and greatly mystifies all who stand back from the board and see the collapse of Ansett. It needs to be looked into. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The government believes that there is, in fact, scope for the board to be brought to account within the law, if possible, and we are going to pursue why the board misled the public in regard to their responsibilities for Ansett Airlines. The government has taken steps in the meantime in regard to guaranteeing the statutory entitlements of the Ansett workers; and this includes 100 per cent of long service leave, 100 per cent of unpaid annual leave, 100 per cent of unpaid wages and 100 per cent of unpaid pay in lieu of notice and up to eight weeks of their redundancy entitlements as per the community standard.</para><para>This is the safety net the government has put in place. No-one is sure of the end cost. It is around the $400 million mark, a substantial contribution by this government. With such a massive collapse of a major airline, we cannot expect that there will not be a wave effect throughout regional areas, and there was. There was an immediate effect of stranded passengers within the rural and regional areas. And as a National Party senator, I can say this was our most immediate concern.</para><para> One week or thereabouts on from the collapse, the regional services have come back to near normal. Qantas already had many of those routes, so there was just the delay factor—waiting in the queue to get a seat. Qantas also picked up many of the time schedules that the Ansett regional services were unable to pick up and that disappeared from sight, the main Ansett regional service being Impulse Airlines. Qantas stepped into the breach very well. They have picked up most of the regional services. But other regional airlines, not connected to Ansett, have been able to pick up many of the routes and take the extra passengers. The market in regard to rural and regional services has worked. </para><para>Of course there is still a delay, as there is already for us to get out of the parliament—and I don't mean my speech, either! Most of us go home on a Thursday night, myself included, but we will have to wait until tomorrow morning. That is a minor concern, a minor problem, compared to the problem of the collapse of the whole industry. </para><para>It also has a cascading effect, as we know, on the tourist industry, which the government is looking at, and I have no doubt that it will take the proper steps—within the bounds of what a government can do at the collapse of a private industry—to help the tourist industry. Adjustments will and have been made to meet the new demand, and there is going to be a reduction in the competition factor. We hope, in the medium to long term, that Qantas, Virgin Blue and other airlines will step into the breach and address that competition factor—because we simply cannot leave Qantas as the only airline servicing the domestic market.</para><para>We must recognise that this is a very difficult situation that has affected many people—particularly, as I have said, the employees—and will affect the Australian economy or, if nothing less, this industry. It has a knock-on effect. The opposition have managed to attack us in the Senate for three days on this issue, asking, `What are you doing?' We have told them what we are doing with regard to the employees. I notice that, come Thursday, they have not been able to sustain the argument. The question has to be asked: what would the opposition do? Do they have the skill to manage this most difficult problem? Do they have the care to manage this situation? </para><para>There was a precedent set when they were in government. Such problems always blow up in government, and a government must have the management skill and the care to be able to handle these problems. No government is going to sail through their term trouble free. There will always be problems. The issue is how you manage them, whether you have the skill and whether you have the cabinet and the Prime Minister to handle the problems as they blow up. What did the Labor Party do when they were faced with a similar situation—the collapse of Compass Airlines? They did nothing. They did nothing at all. There were thousands of employees attached to Compass Airlines. Did they get their entitlements underwritten by the government? No, they did not. Thousands of ticket holders were stranded. Did the government step in with measures to ensure that those who were stranded or those who lost the value of their ticket were supported? No, they did nothing of the sort. Of all they have asked us to do, they did none of it when they were in government.</para><para>The tourism effect of the collapse of Compass Airlines, particularly in the state of Queensland, was enormous, particularly the knock-on effect. Did the Labor Party do anything to prop up the tourist industry? No, not at all. In fact, Mr Beazley, on the announcement of the collapse of the Ansett Airlines, told us to step in and keep this private business going, saying that it would cost us only $100 million for the next two weeks or something. But what did they do when Compass collapsed? The Prime Minister used the following quote in question time in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, and I will repeat it in the Senate. Brian Gray, the former chief executive of Compass Airlines, on 22 December 1991, said:</para><quote><para>I went to the government on Wednesday and I asked for some relief—</para></quote><para>some support—</para><quote><para>Kerin, Beazley and Collins—</para></quote><para>who was then the minister for transport—</para><quote><para>... came in and sat down and before I even opened my mouth, Kerin simply said there could be no cooperation from the Commonwealth government. He said, `Under no circumstances will we help you by any means.'</para></quote><para>The then minister for transport, Senator Collins— who has since left this parliament—said:</para><quote><para>It would not have mattered, frankly, if the airline had asked the government for $1 billion or $10 ... the facts are that the government is not a private bank for private airlines.</para></quote><para>What opportunism you have taken with the collapse of Ansett Airlines.

To say that we now have a service in the bush is absolutely ludicrous. The other day in the debate to take note of answers at question time Senator Sandy Macdonald said that, for those of us who live in Bathurst, all we now had to do was drive up to Orange. Orange used to have three to four services a day operated by 36-seater aircraft. Bathurst had three services a day: two of them were operated by 19-seater aircraft and the other service was operated on a share basis with a 36-seater. Can you tell me that one 18-seater aircraft takes the place of those seven services? Of course it does not.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Extra flights have been put on.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name></talker><para>—Senator McGauran does not even comprehend that there is only one service a day going into that community—or there will be until this weekend. There is one service a day going into Orange to cover the two communities—in fact, to cover three because it has to cover Parkes as well. You are adding a couple more services there. I am talking about something like 20 services a day. And you say that one service with an 18-seater aircraft will cover that when the minimum seater aircraft that were running were 18 or 19-seaters and most of them were 36-seaters. Let us get this fact out there and known by people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Broken Hill, the absolute wonderful epitome of the Australian bush, the outback, mining, unionism and history of this country, is only getting a service from today—and that is one 19-seater service a day via Parkes which they have to share. It used to have one 36-seater service to and from Sydney a day and two 19-seater services from Adelaide a day. There are no services to Adelaide for Broken Hill. Broken Hill now also has to contend with the issue of Pasminco going into voluntary administration. I know that the line of lode or accessible ore body there is just about finished, but the community does not need that.</para><para>They operate a lot of their health services through the Royal Flying Doctor Service. It is a Royal Flying Doctor Service base, so it has a base hospital. But, if people in Broken Hill require treatment and care at the teaching hospital level, they have to go to Adelaide. There is now no regular public transport service by air for families to get down to Adelaide to be with their sick and injured and presumably—because they have been transferred to Adelaide—critically ill family members unless they take the six- or seven-hour drive down the road. They cannot go by air to Adelaide. Adelaide is the city that Broken Hill relates to for its specialist treatment and specialist services.</para><para>The other thing that has happened to Broken Hill because of all of this, I hear today, is that a mining conference that was going to be held in Broken Hill at the beginning of October has now gone to Adelaide. This is what this community is having to suffer through the crash of Ansett Airlines and, more to the point, of the subsidiaries, because it was Kendell and Hazelton that operated the flights to there. They operated excellent services. They were a bit pricey but at least they had a service. </para><para>The government keeps talking about competition. To hell with competition. We want a service. Competition is fine where you have a large community, but we are talking about rural and regional areas that do not support competition because they are not large enough. We have to have the service. In a community like Broken Hill, with a 20,000-odd population, they have a right to have some sort of decent air service. As I say, they are going to have a part-time share one through Parkes at present on a 18- or 19-seater aircraft, when they used to have one from Sydney on a 36-seater which they shared with Dubbo. But, from my experience of taking that flight, very few people got on and off at Dubbo. It was a refuelling spot only for the Saabs. </para><para>They do not have that Adelaide connection, and that is critical. The RFDS are having to run flights down and back to Adelaide each day to take down the necessary pathology specimens and things that need to be read and need to be handled in Adelaide and they are bringing back urgent pharmaceuticals that are needed and urgent blood supplies that could be needed. Because this is a base hospital, they do a lot of surgery. These are the sorts of things that are going on, and the government members and the minister say, `Oh, but there are services, there are now planes flying.' They are flying, but they are flying in such reduced quantities that it needs to be recognised that these communities are still suffering in a major way.</para><para>On the issue of Hazelton and Kendell, and Hazelton in particular, both of those airlines were commenced by individuals who were pioneers in the Australian aviation industry. In the last two years or so, they have been taken over by Ansett. When the Hazelton takeover was under way and being negotiated Qantas also expressed an interest, but the ACCC said, `No, Qantas cannot have it because there will be no competition.' Fine. On the routes that were operated into Armidale and Tamworth and Dubbo there would have been competition with Qantas, and maybe on some of the routes up the North Coast, but on the routes to Orange, Bathurst, Parkes, Narrandera—which still has not got any service back yet—Griffith, Moruya and Merimbula there was no competition because it was the only airline going in. We did not care who took over those airlines because all we wanted was a viable airline to keep operating.</para><para>I put out a press release in February of this year when this was being discussed and negotiated and when the ACCC had said `Competition above all else'. I put out a press release and basically said to the ACCC, `You can take your competition policy and do whatever you want with it, we want a service and we want a service with an airline that is viable.' When I read back my press release this last week, I thought how prophetic my words were, that I actually could pick the issue that was going to be of major significance.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—How pathetic!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name></talker><para>—You think it is pathetic that I was concerned about that, Senator McGauran?
