namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 963. </para></motion><para>I do that because I do not think anyone in this place could say that this is not an urgent matter. Port Moresby has been paralysed by the protests over the last six days. There has been a curfew and three students have been shot dead. We need to be aware of what is happening in the capital city of this neighbouring country which very much depends on Australia for its wellbeing and which is now racked by the imposition by international monetary authorities of a program that includes broadscale privatisation of assets in Papua New Guinea. It is quite different to the democratic system in Australia where there is redress for this sort of thing. It has to be understood that in Papua New Guinea, as in so many poorer countries, the imposition is from outside and it rolls over the top of the democratic system of that country.</para><para>You will note, Madam President, that my motion, besides expressing deep sadness and concern at the death of the students—and I understand from news reports that students will be bringing forward evidence today about the police involvement in the death of those students—and while recognising the right of Papua New Guinea to plan its future without selling its major assets, also puts forward a positive alternative. Part (c) of the motion calls on the international funding and banking agencies to aid PNG's debt repayments by requiring foreign logging, mining, fishing and tourism companies, including BHP, for example, to pay a fair and adequate royalty for their exploitation of this small, but beautiful, nation's resources. This is the classic case of a poor country having its resources extracted and the management of its affairs being taken over basically by multinational forces, including private corporations, beyond its control. </para><para>What is happening in the logging of Papua New Guinea forests and mangroves by huge corporations, including Chevron from the United States, is totally reprehensible. The return to the Papua New Guinea people is not commensurate with the damage being done to their environment. Just two days ago we had a delegation, including an elected MP from the Fly River district, talking about the extraordinary environmental damage caused by the Ok Tedi mine which, through cyanide and taling spillage into that river system, has caused the death of that system for tens, if not hundreds, of kilometres. Because of the silting of the river, there is flooding of the riverside areas where the crops are grown by the indigenous people, the loss of those crop lands and the forced migration of those people. They did not ask for that. They are not being compensated for that. They have not become rich over that. It is deplorable behaviour by BHP and other corporations from outside. They would not be allowed to practise that sort of environmental and social dislocation in this country. But they go to a Third World country and become a law unto themselves—and this motion draws attention to that. </para><para>The motion should be debated. Papua New Guinea is in uproar. The students are representing a different point of view. The young people of Papua New Guinea are saying, `We don't want everything going into foreign hands, out of our control, under this international capital system.' I urge the Senate to vote for this debate, seeing formality has been blocked by the Labor Party. Change the motion, if you will, but take notice of the fact that there are horrific events occurring in Papua New Guinea, and we should not ignore them.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>09:48:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.

Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989.  The Bill also contains amendments of a minor machinery nature to other portfolio legislation including the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981, and the Ozone Protection Act 1989.  These amendments are of a technical nature, and are intended to rectify a small number of operational anomalies and unintended consequences of drafting.</para><para>The main purpose of the amendments to the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 is to ensure that Australian companies cannot avoid the Act's requirements by selling hazardous wastes to foreign companies.  </para><para>In September 1997, an Australian company sold hazardous waste to a foreign company and the foreign company then arranged for the waste to be exported.  This breached Australia's obligation under the Basel Convention not to allow the export of hazardous waste to another country unless that country has given its consent.  As required by the Basel Convention, the Commonwealth was obliged to bring the wastes back and dispose of them in Australia.</para><para>The police investigation into the export led to the conclusion that the foreign company was in breach of the Act but was beyond the reach of Australian Courts.  </para><para>The Commonwealth was unable to prosecute the Australian company because the sale of the waste was not an offence under the Act.  These amendments are intended to prevent this situation arising again, by making it an offence to sell hazardous waste to a foreign company unless an export permit is in force.</para><para>Other amendments to the Act will allow ministerial orders to be made in a more effective and appropriate manner in incidents of this kind.  They will also deal with administrative matters such as clarifying the definition of hazardous wastes.</para></quote><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day of the 2001 spring sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>25316</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Legislation</title><page.no>25316</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.</para></motion><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—I would like to record my no vote on that.</para></talk.start></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ENVIRONMENT: SHARK FISHING</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>25316</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>25316</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I ask that general business notice of motion No. 881, standing in my name for today and relating to shark finning and unsustainable shark fishing, be taken as a formal motion.</para></talk.start><para>Leave not granted.</para></speech><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title><page.no>25316</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>25316</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Pursuant to contingent notice and at the request of the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Stott Despoja, I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Stott Despoja moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 881.</para></motion><para>In doing so, I—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—Madam President, on a point of order: I want to say that we agree to the suspension.

It is worth noting that we are talking about the practice of catching sharks live, slicing their fins from them and, in most cases, returning the live carcasses to the water, where the sharks then suffocate and drown. It is repugnant, and I think most Australians find it as abhorrent as practices such as removing the paws from bears. Additionally, while Australia has a reasonably commendable record in the management of shark fisheries, there is no question to my mind that there is some doubt over the sustainability of some species. While I acknowledge that there is an interim ban on shark fishing in some waters—namely, in tuna fishing areas—I think the time for procrastination on this issue is long overdue and we should bring an end to the interim ban and implement a permanent ban.</para><para>Australia has one of the largest and most diverse populations of sharks in the world. This motion notes that, while Australia has banned the practice of shark finning in many states, it is still happening in the Northern Territory, Tasmania, Queensland and South Australia. Today we call upon both the government and the opposition to agree to make that ban permanent and upon the Australian federal and state and territory governments to cooperate in the development of a strong national plan of action that will end unsustainable shark finning and high levels of shark catching in Australian fisheries.</para><para>I note, for example, that most of these fins are appearing in shark fin soup. It is one of the dishes of the Chinese elite, but it has now become very common and a much preferred dish within some Asian communities. As a consequence, shark fins are much more highly sought after. There was a time when fins were taken only from the carcasses of sharks caught for their meat. That is no longer the case. They are now being caught specifically and deliberately for their fins only. Sharks are at the top of the food chain in the ocean world, and it is estimated that some shark populations have declined by an alarming 90 per cent through overfishing. They are highly vulnerable to exploitation due to their longevity, late maturity and slow reproduction rates.</para><para>Sharks often equate to about 50 per cent of unintended by-catch—that is, fish not necessarily intended to be caught when fisherfolk are catching other forms of marine life. Where some turtle excluder devices, TEDs, have become mandatory, there have been significant drops in the number of sharks caught, but smaller sharks are still being caught in prawn fishing nets. In the past, it was a common practice to utilise the fins and teeth of sharks caught as by-catch rather than live sharks so that there was no waste of shark carcasses but, with the ever increasing value of shark fins, sharks have become a targeted species in their own right. I would argue it is the Australian government's duty to take an active and strong stance on this issue, and I call upon the Senate to support the motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>25318</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move the amendment that has been circulated:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Omit subparagraph (a)(ii) and paragraph (b), substitute:</para><para>	(ii)	that Australia is a world leader in shark management, but despite an interim ban on shark finning in tuna fisheries, there are still a number of shark species, targeted for its highly valued fin, and that may be at risk in Australia from over-fishing and bycatch; and</para><para>	(b)	calls on the Government to cooperate with industry in the development of a strong National Plan of Action that will end unsustainable shark fishing.</para></quote><para>The amendment is self-explanatory.

We understand that the industry in this country is developing a code of conduct, addressing concerns such as those raised by Senator Greig. We believe the appropriate approach at this stage is to support our amendment, which calls on the government—and we understand the government agree with this—to cooperate with industry in developing a strong national plan of action that will end unsustainable shark fishing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>25318</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That is the position of the government. If the opposition had not moved this amendment, I would have moved an amendment in similar terms. It is not inconsistent with the sentiment of the Australian Democrats' argument. The difference rather refers to the methodology to get to the same objective. This government has put in place an interim ban in relation to tuna. In the interim, our objective is to negotiate what is described in this amendment as a strong national plan of action that will end unsustainable shark fishing. I therefore support the amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>25318</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Here we have the government and the opposition again calling for a plan of inaction, not a plan of action.

If good evidence comes forward that there is an alternative then let it be brought forward and we can change that. But this is simply a move to prevent any action being taken on this wasteful and destructive industry, as described by Senator Greig.

The amendment would seek to do two things. It changes the wording of the first part of my motion, introducing the word `may', suggesting that there may be some risk to Australia from overfishing and by-catch. For goodness sake, we know well enough already that there is a strong risk, and to now suggest that there may be a risk is, at best, disingenuous.</para></talk.start><para>I take the strongest objection to the notion in point 3 of the amendment, calling on the government to cooperate with industry in the development of a strong national plan of action that will end unsustainable shark fishing. There is no notion or suggestion that the ban should be introduced and maintained, and that is what I believe most strongly should happen. I note with some bemusement and confusion that, while Senator Hill began his discussion in the debate on this issue by saying that if Labor had not moved this amendment then he and the government would have, that certainly has not been the government's position over the last approximately five weeks while my motion has been on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.

In light of these continuing problems, the committee agreed to produce a second report that further underlines the difficulties it has had, and continues to have, in gaining access to material it considers necessary to fulfil its reporting obligations to the parliament. This report comprises two case studies that highlight these problems.</para><para>One of the first significant obstacles to the inquiry started with a simple request from the committee for access to the submissions to the Humphry review. Mr Richard Humphry informed the committee at the first hearing on 7 February this year that all submissions received by the review had been returned to submitters and that no copies had been taken of the originals for retention as records. Based on legal advice, Mr Humphry was under the impression that submissions did not form part of the Commonwealth's records and therefore were not covered by the Archives Act and that they remained the property of those who had prepared them. At this stage, however, the committee assumed that submissions made to a Commonwealth funded review would be Commonwealth records so it sought information on the status of the submissions. The committee wanted to satisfy itself that indeed Mr Humphry was correct in assuming that the submissions should be returned to their authors.</para><para>Since pursuing this line of inquiry, the committee has received nothing but conflicting and broken evidence about the submissions. After all the questioning and probing, the committee believes that it still has not got a full and accurate account of the matter. Apparently, Mr Humphry and his secretariat of DOFA staff sought legal advice on a number of occasions to establish the status of the submissions. The initial legal opinion upon which Mr Humphry acted suggested that the submissions were not Commonwealth records because they would be regarded as owned by the persons who prepared them. In seeking three pieces of legal advice on this matter, however, it would appear that none provided key documents, such as Mr Humphry's contract or letter of acceptance, to those giving the advice.</para><para>Over a period of three months, the committee tried to establish exactly what documents formed the basis for the legal opinion that the submissions were not Commonwealth records. Eventually, DOFA provided the committee with a copy of Mr Humphry's letter of acceptance. It seems as though this copy had gone missing in the secretariat and in DOFA for a period of six months. An important provision in this letter states: </para><quote><para>All material created, derived or provided to you for the purpose of your review shall be and remain the property of the Commonwealth.</para></quote><para>On obtaining this letter, which contains this very clear statement on the status of the submissions, the committee sought further clarification on who actually sought the legal advice, who had access to information about the terms of Mr Humphry's appointment and whether the letter of acceptance was taken into consideration when formulating the advice.</para><para>In essence, the committee was seeking information that would reconcile the terms of Mr Humphry's appointment with the disposal of the submissions. But despite repeated attempts, the committee still cannot obtain a straight answer from the department. The committee therefore calls on the Department of Finance and Administration to provide all the relevant information by Friday, 13 July 2001 so that this matter can be settled once and for all.</para><para>The second part of the report looks at the Health Group tendering process. Again, the committee found itself thwarted in its attempts to piece together an accurate picture of this process, particularly the events surrounding an unauthorised disclosure and the receipt of a late tender. The interim report detailed the sequence of events which eventually led to two Senate orders for the production of documents, one passed on 26 March and the other on 3 April 2001. The evaluation reports for the Health Group were among documents included in the order. Although the documents were provided to the committee, they had substantial sections blanked out, which meant they were of limited value to the committee.</para><para>By this time, however, the committee had become aware of an unauthorised disclosure of information during the tendering process for the Health Group and believed that access to the evaluation reports would be necessary for the committee to effectively conduct its inquiry. On 24 May, under standing order 25(15) the committee ordered OASITO to provide the full and complete evaluation reports for the Health Group. But on the direction of the Minister for Finance and Administration, it provided the committee with a set of incomplete documents identical to those already provided under the Senate's order for the production of documents.</para><para>Despite the minister's refusal to produce the requested documents in full, the committee, because of the utmost importance of this matter, believed that it should persist with its request for the evaluation reports without deletions. The committee did not ask for these documents lightly and believes that this issue goes to the very heart of government accountability. It carefully considered the government's obligation to protect confidentiality with the committee's responsibility to scrutinise government activities. After weighing up the merits of both arguments the committee was convinced that the public interest would be best served by clarifying what happened during the tendering process. </para><para>Accordingly, the committee wrote the minister on 8 June outlining its reasons for the request. It explained that during the course of inquiry serious questions had been raised about the integrity of the Health Group tendering process which it had been unable to resolve. It explained further that the information contained in the evaluation reports could be fundamental to its investigation. The committee stated clearly that it was aware of the need to protect the confidentiality of this material, that it would receive the documents in camera and that it had no intention to release information that would disadvantage the tenderers. On 15 June the minister advised the committee that he was awaiting further advice and would respond as soon as he was in a position to do so. More than one month has passed since the order was issued.</para><para>The committee reports to the Senate the minister's failure to comply with its order to produce the evaluation reports for the Health Group tender process. However, the committee has taken a decision not to pursue the documents through the Senate due to the extreme sensitivity of some of the information they contain. It is hoping that the minister's last letter informing the committee that he is seeking further advice will result in some effort being made to meet the committee's needs.</para><para>The report also deals with the irregularities that occurred during the tendering process. On 28 July 2000 one of the three tenderers received a disk which contained information relating to the other two bidders. Mr Smith, CEO of OASITO, has acknowledged that this unauthorised disclosure of information was a `very serious issue'. The committee shares his view but became even more concerned when it learned that the tenderer that had received the unauthorised information had failed to submit its bid by the closing time for tenders and had been accepted as a late tender. The committee wanted to clarify the events surrounding these two irregularities and to establish whether they had been managed properly. The committee believed that it was important to establish whether the integrity of the process had been compromised.</para><para>Again the committee encountered difficulties in accessing documents relevant to this matter. Not only has it been denied access to the legal advice obtained by OASITO and to the complete correspondence associated with the probity auditor's advice about the unauthorised disclosure but in evidence before the committee OASITO officers have had trouble recalling accurately and in detail the events that took place on the day the tenders closed.</para><para>The committee is concerned that the limited or incomplete documentation made available to it and the fragmented and sometimes vague information given by officers from both the Department of Finance and Administration and OASITO during public hearings may mislead it and thus undermine the accountability process. The committee has no way of knowing whether it is in possession of all the necessary facts. It has therefore agreed to, and has requested, the Auditor-General to consider examining these matters.</para><para>Based on its experiences so far in this inquiry, the committee believes that it has not had adequate access to key documents and has not received clear, full and accurate information during its hearings that would enable it to come to an informed conclusion on these numerous important issues. The committee is now preparing a final report to present to the Senate later this year. On the difficult matters such as obtaining access to material including evaluation reports and related legal and probity advice, the committee hopes that the minister and his departments will endeavour to meet the committee's needs. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CORPORATE CODE OF CONDUCT BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25323</page.no><id.no>S259</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Corporations and Securities Committee</title><page.no>25323</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>25323</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on the provisions of the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill 2000, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee. I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>In moving the motion, I briefly state that, while the committee in no way endorses inappropriate behaviour on the part of Australian corporations, the evidence before the committee in relation to alleged inappropriate corporate behaviour invariably concerned only a couple of incidents and there was no evidence of systemic failure. Therefore, the committee concludes that there is no demonstrated need for the bill and, indeed, the bill could well do more harm than good. On that basis, we have recommended that the bill not be passed. I thank my committee staff, David Creed and his staff, for their work on this inquiry and in relation to our report on the bill, and I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The tabling statement read as follows</inline>—</para><para>On 6 September 2000 Senator Vicki Bourne introduced the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill 2000 into the Senate.  On 5 October 2000 the Senate referred the provisions of the Bill to the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities for inquiry and report by 31 March 2001. </para><para>The Committee resolved that the reporting date be extended so that the Committee could have additional public hearings and thus as many persons as possible would have the opportunity of testifying before the Committee.  The Senate agreed to this course of action, and therefore it is today that I am tabling the Committee's report.  </para><para>The Committee received 43 submissions in relation to the inquiry, many from major stakeholders.  Industry bodies that made submissions included the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia and the Victorian Chamber of Mines.  Individual companies, such as BHP Limited, also made submissions.  Submittors, whose primary concern was human rights, included Amnesty International Australia, the FairWear Campaign, the Minerals Policy Institute and World Vision Australia.  Submittors whose focus was primarily on the rights of employees included the Australian Council of Trade Unions.</para><para>In addition to these submissions, submissions were also received from other key organisations and individuals.  The Committee is very grateful to those who took the time and trouble to make very detailed and helpful submissions.  The Committee, without detracting from other submissions, endorses a comment made by Senator Murray during the public hearings on the Bill, to the effect that the submissions from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Community Aid Abroad were of particular assistance to the Committee because they contained “detailed commentary” on shortcomings in the Bill.</para><para>The Committee also endorses Senator Murray's statement regarding the usefulness of the “positive” criticisms of a submitter such as Mr Sean Cooney.  Positive criticisms are always helpful in devising ways to remedy deficiencies in proposed legislation.</para><para>The Committee held three day of public hearings.  Forty individuals representing a wide variety of groups and organisations appeared before the Committee during these hearings.  The Committee is very grateful to these persons who so generously made themselves available to testify before the Committee.  These witnesses represented a wide variety of views and I therefore believe that the hearings were not only very comprehensive, but they also presented to the Committee a range of views on the Bill which the Committee found most useful in drafting its report.</para><para>The first issue on which the Report makes a conclusion is the 100 employee threshold.  The Bill would apply only to “Australian corporations or related corporations which employ more than 100 persons in a foreign country”.  Several submitters and witnesses suggested lowering this 100 employee threshold, thus increasing the number of corporate entities that would be subject to regulation by the Bill.</para><para>The Committee disagrees with those who suggested lowering the employee threshold.  Indeed the Committee found that even the 100 employee threshold would result in so many companies being subject to the provisions of the Bill that, given our scepticism about the benefits of the Bill, it would constitute an unacceptable “burden” for regulators.  The Committee therefore concludes that the regulatory regime the Bill would create would be unworkable.</para><para>With regard to the Bill's requirement that corporations “take all reasonable measures to prevent any serious threat to public health”, the Committee noted that the Bill does not apply to all Australian corporations operating overseas, but only to those with more than 100 employees.  The Committee finds it unacceptable that any legislation should imply that only certain corporations should refrain from threatening public health.</para><para>Moreover, the Committee believes that this part of the Bill is unnecessary as Common Law rights relating to negligence would already allow foreign litigants in most circumstances to sue in Australian courts for damage suffered from negligent behaviour.  The Committee considers it unwise to interfere with these Common Law rights.</para><para>The Bill, as has been said, would regulate Australian corporations with over 100 employees overseas.  It would also seek to regulate a holding company of such a corporation even though such a holding company may not be an Australian corporate entity.  The Bill would therefore seek to regulate, for example, as one witness noted, America's General Motors.  This would simply be unworkable.</para><para>The Bill would impose “environmental, employment, health and safety and human rights standards” on Australian corporations with 100 employees overseas.  The Committee notes that the Parliament has enacted legislation with extraterritorial application but the Committee also notes that such legislation was very focused while the current Bill is general and extremely broad.</para><para>The Committee concludes that the Bill is so generic as to be vague to the point of being unenforceable.  One example is the requirement that corporations provide their employees with, and I quote from subclause 8(2) of the Bill, “satisfactory sanitary conditions”. The Committee is aware that regulations may be made under clause 18 of the Bill, which may define what is meant by “satisfactory”.  Nevertheless, the Committee finds itself unable to recommend a Bill, the provisions of which are so vague as to cause considerable uncertainty to industry.</para><para>The Bill would require an Australian corporation to pay its workers a “living wage”.  The difficulties in determining what constitutes a “living wage” in all the countries in which an Australian may operate would involve that corporation in considerable expense and there would be no certainty, despite a corporation's best efforts, that, in the event of litigation, an Australian court would find that it had been paying its workers a “living wage”.  Australian corporations would therefore always operate under the threat of litigation.</para><para>The Committee therefore concludes that the Bill's requirement that a corporation determine a “living wage” in all of the jurisdictions in which it operates is unreasonable and impractical.</para><para>The Bill, at clause 10, would require Australian corporations operating overseas to avoid discriminating in its employment practices on the basis of race, colour, sex, sexuality, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.</para><para>The Committee in no way endorses discrimination, but clearly this section of the Bill could force Australian corporations to choose between hiring persons belonging to organisations deemed illegal in the jurisdictions in which they operate, or else face litigation in Australian courts.  The Committee finds itself unable to recommend a Bill that would force such an unenviable choice on Australian companies.</para><para>Clause 11 of the Bill requires Australian corporations to obey the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate.  The Committee in no way condones tax evasion.  However, the Committee considers it inappropriate for the Australian Parliament to enact laws requiring Australian corporations to obey the laws of foreign jurisdictions.  </para><para>Clause 12 of the Bill requires Australian corporations, producing goods and services overseas, to simultaneously satisfy both Australian health and safety standards, and the health and safety standards of the jurisdiction in which they operate.  In practice, the standards of Australian and the foreign jurisdiction may be mutually exclusive and thus this section may be unworkable. </para><para>Subclause 13 of the Bill requires that Australian corporations operating overseas refrain from “misleading or deceptive” conduct.  Considering the vast amount of litigation that a similar section in the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) has inspired in Australia, the Committee is concerned that Australian courts may be swamped by corporations bringing actions against each other.  The Committee is not convinced that such litigation would be productive.</para><para>With regard to the Bill's reporting requirements, the Committee acknowledges that reporting may be an essential part of ensuring compliance with some laws. The Committee notes advice from the Australian Institute of Corporate Citizenship that reports produced by corporations should be publicised, since publicity “encourages continuous improvement”.  The Committee concludes, however, that the reporting requirements required by the Bill would be both onerous and expensive. </para><para>The Committee concludes that the reporting requirements of the Bill are unwieldy to the point of being impossible to implement without significant costs being incurred by both corporations and the regulator.  The Committee finds that any benefits to be derived from the reporting regime would not compensate for the loss suffered due to the imposition of associated costs.</para><para>The Bill would allow civil penalties to be imposed for non-compliance with the Bill.  These penalties differ from those specified in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth), even where the offences are similar.  The Committee is unable to discern any rationale for this and concludes that enacting the Bill would lead to unwarranted confusion in the corporate world.</para><para>Various submitters and witnesses stated that the status quo was unacceptable because it was tantamount to allowing Australian corporations overseas to degrade the environment and abuse the rights of foreign workers.  </para><para>The Committee in no way endorses inappropriate behaviour on the part on Australian corporations.  The Committee notes, however, that the evidence of inappropriate corporate behaviour that was presented to it almost invariably concerned the same couple of incidents.  No evidence was presented of systemic failure and thus the Committee concludes that there is no demonstrated need for the current Bill.  Indeed, the Committee concludes that enacting the current Bill may be seen abroad as a suggestion that the laws of other nations are deficient.  Any such suggestion may harm Australia's reputation.</para><para>The Committee therefore concludes that the Bill is not only largely superfluous from the viewpoint of protecting the environment and enhancing the conditions of foreign workers, but also has a very real potential for offending foreign nations.  The Committee therefore recommends that the Bill not be passed because it is unnecessary and unworkable.</para><para>I commend the Report to all honourable Senators.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>25325</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have some brief remarks to make on this report.

In her second reading speech Senator Vicki Bourne referred to other instances of similar attempts to introduce such legislation, which while seen as inevitable by some, is still being developed. In that respect this Bill was novel and technical difficulties could be expected. </para><para>The inquiry into the Bill allowed valuable discussion of these issues.  </para><para>The majority of the Committee concluded that the Bill was unwarranted and unworkable. I agree that amendments are needed, however I reject the notion of abandoning the Bill altogether. </para><para>This Bill is about balancing the drive by Australian Corporations to support globalisation in other economic areas such as copyright laws, capital movements and international tax harmonisation with human rights, environmental safeguards and other measures. </para><para>The majority of the Committee also found that this Bill may be perceived as being paternalistic or arrogant, certainly many presented that point of view in evidence, however I disagree with this judgement as a sweeping generalisation and predicating a uniform viewpoint by foreigners. </para><para>As is the case here in Australia where opinions vary widely, foreigners have as many differing opinions, and many can be expected to view the Bill positively based on its pursuit of universal values.</para><para>Indeed evidence from PNG indicated that some Australian companies are perceived to operate with double standards. They employ techniques overseas that they would never use in Australia. </para><para>Ms Koma from the NGO Environment Watch Group in PNG told the committee that </para><para>“It would be very good if a corporate code of conduct was encouraged so that Australian companies working in Papua New Guinea were able to do what they practice overseas in their own country if our legislation is weaker than theirs.”</para><para>Greater clarity is required to define the scope of the Bill to ensure that only Australian companies are affected. There are some instances where changes are required to ensure consistency with existing domestic requirements. There are also some definitional problems where the effect could have unforseen impacts. </para><para>However the overall aim of the Bill should not be lost in technical difficulties. This legislation is setting a standard of governance that all Australian companies should be expected to incorporate into their activities. The presence of drafting problems does not detract from its value. </para><para>As my minority report sets out in detail I disagree with the conclusion of the majority of the Committee and I think there is a demonstrated need for this Bill.</para></quote><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (PARALLEL IMPORTATION) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25326</page.no><id.no>R1242</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>PARLIAMENTARY CONTRIBUTORY SUPERANNUATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1363</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>25326</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>25326</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together.

There has been strong consumer support for this move as it has resulted in lower prices, particularly for top 40 CDs.</para><para>This Bill will extend the application of that policy to key sectors of the information economy, and will enhance competition in price, availability and choice. </para><para>Australia is a net importer of copyright material.</para><para>It is therefore in Australia's interest that printed material and software products are widely available on a competitive basis.</para><para>The term `parallel importation' refers to the importation for commercial purposes of copyright material lawfully produced overseas, without the authority of the Australian rights holder.  Local rights holders currently have the ability under the Copyright Act to limit access to the Australian market for commercial distribution of software products, books, periodical publications and printed music. </para><para>The price and availability of much of this material is therefore not subject to open and genuine competition.</para><para>And unlike some other products, there is not necessarily a natural substitute for these goods. </para><para>The central aim of the Bill is to improve access to a wide range of software products, books, periodical publications and printed music on a fair, competitive basis. </para><para>The Bill does this by allowing the importation for commercial purposes of non-pirate copyright goods without the permission of the Australian rightsholder. </para><para>The Bill offers the prospect of cheaper prices and increased availability of products for all Australians, but especially for small businesses, parents and the education sector.</para><para>Retailers, particularly large retailers, are likely to support the reforms due to the beneficial impact the changes will have for them in competing and potentially extracting better terms of trade. </para><para>Small businesses will benefit from increased access to popular applications for word processing, database management, accounting, desktop publishing and graphical analysis. </para><para>The Government has carefully assessed the impact of parallel importation provisions in the Copyright Act by examining each affected industry separately.</para><para>The introduction of this Bill follows a rigorous assessment of the potential impacts of parallel importation on the Australian book publishing and printing industry, and on the local software industry.  </para><para>Despite claims to the contrary from the Labor Party and large multinational publishing and software interests, only the complete removal of copyright importation restrictions for printed material and software products will enable competitive access to these products, provide consumer benefit and promote the overall effective functioning of the economy. </para><para>Unlike the Labor party's `Use it or Lose it' policy, the Government's policy is not about benefiting foreign rights holders by reimposing restrictions on CDs, and maintaining import restrictions and monopoly distributions on books, software, computer games at the expense of Australian businesses and consumers.</para><para>As with the CD reforms, no doubt we will see spirited resistance to this Bill from opponents of liberalisation.</para><para>This time around, however we have the benefit of experience to date, as well as developments in foreign markets, such as New Zealand, to address many of the concerns and debunk many of the claims. </para><para>Many argued in 1998 that the relaxation of parallel importation restrictions for sound recordings would devastate the Australian music industry.</para><para>Dire predictions made during the CD debate that 50,000 jobs would be lost, and that the Australian record industry would have to close up shop have proved groundless.</para><para>The industry is in good shape and no evidence of job losses has materialised. </para><para>Indeed the recording industry has grown since the 1998 reforms with recent reports of around 2.9% growth in 1999 alone.</para><para>In the Australian Record Industry Association End of Year charts in 1997 (prior to the Government's reforms) there were 23 Australian albums in the top 100 albums sold; in 2000, by contrast, there were 28 Australian albums in the end of year top 100. </para><para>The ARIA singles charts tell a similar story: in 1997, there were 14 Australian singles in the end of year top 100; by 2000, that number had climbed to 19. </para><para>These figures hardly paint a picture of an industry in decline, where the production of local talent has been stymied or destroyed.</para><para>In fact, the Australian music industry appears to be in better shape now than prior to parallel importation.</para><para>The parallel importation restrictions in the Copyright Act are of course not the only factors that affect the retail price of products. </para><para>Nevertheless, in 1998, prior to parallel importation of music, CD prices were around $31.00 for new releases and rising. </para><para>In January this year, Big W and Target were selling top 30 CDs for around $21.43. </para><para>Clearly it is now possible for consumers to access top selling CDs that are over 30 percent cheaper than prior to parallel importation.</para><para>And this is despite the impact of the GST and unfavourable exchange rates relative to the US, a major source of popular music.</para><para>Claims were also made that piracy rates would soar as a result of the CD reforms, and no doubt similar claims will be made in relation to books and particularly software.  Whilst copyright piracy is a serious and real problem in many countries it is primarily a problem in countries where the enforcement of intellectual property laws is weak, and there are large informal retail sectors.  </para><para>By contrast, Australia provides a strong intellectual property regime backed by an effective court and general legal system, and has a very strong formal retail sector comprising large retailers, chains and independent outlets.</para><para>The Australian Institute of Criminology recently reported that since the 1998 amendments there is “little or no evidence of the increase in CD piracy predicted by opponents of liberalisation”.</para><para>Australia is also recognised by the International Intellectual Property Alliance as having one of the lowest piracy rates in the world.</para><para>Evidence on the impact of the CD reforms proves the Government's position that this is not an attack on copyright as an appropriate means of compensating, rewarding and encouraging creators and owners.</para><para>Copyright owners will continue to be remunerated through their contractual arrangements regardless of where their product is published or manufactured, or how it is imported.</para><para>Books</para><para>Turning specifically to the reforms as they apply to books, a 1999 review by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found that for best selling paperback fiction, the price difference with the USA had exceeded 30% on average over the previous 4 years. </para><para>Five reports to Government have dealt with the book industry: those by the Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC), the Prices Surveillance Authority, the Industry Commission (now the Productivity Commission), the ACCC, and most recently, the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee, or “Ergas Committee”. </para><para>The earliest report, by the CLRC, recommended a relaxation of some of the importation controls exercisable by copyright owners in relation to books. </para><para>All subsequent reports have recommended the complete removal of copyright owners' control over book importation on the basis that current restrictions are inappropriate and their removal would deliver lower prices and a more efficient industry.  Importantly, the majority in the Ergas Committee concluded that the removal of importation restrictions in the publishing industry was unlikely to lead to any wider losses in the Australian economy.</para><para>To enable maximum community access to competitively priced products, the Bill provides that parallel importation is to encompass all major forms of printed material.</para><para>In accordance with the June 2000 recommendation of a majority of the Ergas Committee, the implementation of the printed material provisions in Schedule 2 to the Bill will be delayed for 12 months to allow for contractual adjustments.</para><para>This recognises the fact that the book industry is more reliant on contract than other copyright-based industries. </para><para>The Government is confident that the extra time will allow the industry to adjust effectively and positively to the changes. </para><para>The Government is well aware of concerns, particularly in the printing industry, that a change from the current law, to remove the so-called `30 day rule', might reduce growth in the printing industry in areas such as Maryborough in Victoria and Netley in South Australia.</para><para>Under the 30 day rule the right to control importation of books is lost if the book is not published in Australia within 30 days of publication anywhere.</para><para>However, such concerns are misplaced and largely unsubstantiated.</para><para>The Ergas Committee noted that it had not been provided with any evidence to substantiate claims in relation to the beneficial effects of keeping the 30/90 day rule restrictions.  The Committee queried whether changes in the level of printing activity in Australia in recent years were due to the `30 day rule' or to changes in competitiveness, including as a result of exchange rate movements.</para><para>Further, the removal of restrictions should be seen within the context of special Commonwealth adjustment assistance through the Book Industry Assistance Plan (BIAP). </para><para>This program, which also provides assistance for indirect tax reform, will provide up to $240 million over 4 years, including up to $48 million specifically for the printing industry.</para><para>Software products</para><para>In January 1999 the Australian Consumers' Association published the results of a survey of current retail prices of a range of overseas manufactured packaged software products across six countries. </para><para>It found that while Australian household consumers and businesses were paying competitive prices for home/office crossover software like Microsoft Windows 98 and Word 97, this was not the case for cutting edge products, such as publishing products QuarkXPress and Adobe PageMill 3.0.</para><para>A report to Government by the ACCC showed that over the past ten years, Australian businesses have had to pay an average of 27% more for packaged business software than their US counterparts.</para><para>The Ergas Committee recognised that the benefits from these higher prices flow primarily to foreign rightsholders while the corresponding costs are borne in Australia, by Australian consumers and by industries - such as the domestic software industry - that use protected imports as inputs.</para><para>Of the top selling computer games analysed, Australian purchasers of popular PC computer games paid on average 33% more during 1998 than those in the US.</para><para>Other reports to Government dealing with the software industry have been made by the same bodies that considered the issue of book importation, namely, the Copyright Law Review Committee, the Prices Surveillance Authority, and the Ergas Committee. </para><para>To enable maximum community access to competitively priced products, all types of software products are included within the coverage of the Bill, whether used in business, education or the home, or in home computer games and pay-per-play video arcade machines. </para><para>Removing parallel importation restrictions will enable local distributors to choose suppliers on the basis of price, availability, service and reliability and to pass these benefits on to consumers. </para><para>The parallel importation of software will not interfere with the rights of copyright owners to be compensated according to their contracts.  As the Ergas Committee indicated, “supporters of retaining restrictions assert that prices in Australia are as low as they are elsewhere, so there is no basis for opposing a change which will make it clearer and more certain that market forces are at work.” </para><para>The removal of these parallel importation restrictions is expected to reduce some prices and remove the potential for price discrimination against Australian consumers.</para><para>Coverage</para><para>Technology convergence allows different types of works and subject matter to be included on the same article.</para><para>Multimedia CD ROMs are one example.</para><para>By their very nature such products contain a mixture of copyright materials, and each may have a different status in relation to parallel importation.</para><para>In many cases, such materials are secondary to the product.  However, some Australian rights holders have attempted to prevent parallel importation of sound recordings by relying on the copyright in material used to `enhance' CDs.</para><para>Provisions in this Bill will close this loophole resulting from the CD reforms by allowing the parallel importation of these `secondary' materials which will be defined as `accessories'.  An accessory, in this limited context, includes any copyright work or subject matter other than `feature' films irrespective of how it is incorporated into the product.</para><para>The Government has not fully assessed the impacts of allowing the full parallel importation of `cinematograph film' on the Australian film and television industry.  For this reason, feature films, as defined by the Bill, are excluded from this extended operation. </para><para>The Government considers that it would not be appropriate to alter the arrangements for imported film products without a cost benefit analysis specific to the industry, along with careful analysis of the likely effects on consumers. </para><para>The Bill therefore does not lift restrictions on the importation of that class of film that is the industry's most economically significant product, namely entire movies intended for cinema release, film intended for broadcast on television in commercial half hour format or longer (for the mass market including free-to-air or pay television).  Importation of the main products derived from these types of film, such as DVDs, will also remain restricted. </para><para>Enforcement Provisions</para><para>Allowing parallel importation does not mean that it will be legal to import pirate product.</para><para>On the contrary, this Bill gives very substantial procedural assistance to copyright owners in civil actions by shifting to the defendant the onus of establishing that a parallel imported copy is not an infringing copy. </para><para>In addition, where a criminal action is brought for copyright piracy, the penalties for infringement of copyright are severe: the maximum liability for importation and sale of pirate goods is $60,500 and/or imprisonment of five years for each offence, while the maximum liability for a corporation is $302,500.</para><para>Any infringing articles are also subject to forfeiture and destruction.  </para><para>Conclusion</para><para>This Bill will remove an impediment to accessing competitively priced non-pirate printed material and software products. </para><para>It will open up new business opportunities, in particular for consumers, small businesses , the education sector, parents, professional associations and community groups satisfying their specialist needs.</para><para>It will also enable Australian retailers and distributors to enter new markets and better compete with overseas-based e-tailers in the emerging Internet market for directly downloaded software, including e-books. </para><para>Copyright owners will continue to be fairly remunerated, but in the context of a global marketplace. </para><para>Australian consumers and businesses will be able to get the best deal on legitimate copyright material.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the 2001 spring sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25330</page.no><id.no>R1281</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>25330</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>25330</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>25330</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bill  and move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 makes a number of relatively minor but important amendments to the <inline font-style="italic">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</inline> and the<inline font-style="italic"> Radiocommunications Act 1992.</inline></para><para>These amendments relate to:</para><para>·	High Definition Television (HDTV) programming; </para><para>·	the allocation of additional commercial television licences in underserved remote or regional markets; and </para><para>·	anti-siphoning arrangements to facilitate the coverage of certain sporting events on pay television.  </para><para>There are also some technical amendments to certain provisions relating to datacasting services.</para><para>Currently the Broadcasting Services Act requires that any HDTV programming must be exactly the same as Standard Definition Television (SDTV) programming.  There is no flexibility to allow some limited differences between HDTV and SDTV programs, as there is between SDTV and analog programs.</para><para>The bill will enable the Australian Broadcasting Authority (the ABA) to grant an exemption authorising broadcasters to transmit HDTV demonstration programs produced solely for the purpose of allowing the benefits of HDTV to be demonstrated on the HDTV version of a television service.  Those programs can be up to 60 minutes in duration, and can be repeated.  This amendment will enable HDTV demonstration material to be demonstrated during the day.  Retailers can use this material to show consumers the benefits of HDTV receivers at point of purchase.  </para><para>The exemption will be able to be provided for up to one year with the ability to apply for renewal.  The ABA will be able to specify the period and the broadcasters to which the exemption applies and specify conditions, such as the hours in which the demonstration programs may be shown or the number of times the program can be repeated in a given period.  </para><para>The bill will also allow broadcasters to provide different advertising in the HDTV version of a television service in the first two years of digital television broadcasting. This will provide time for broadcasters to make the necessary investment and put in place the necessary equipment to provide the same range of HDTV local advertising as they provide in SDTV. </para><para>These changes increase the flexibility of the digital television framework with respect to HDTV without undermining the integrity of the simulcast and HDTV quota rules. </para><para>Section 38B of the Broadcasting Services Act provides a mechanism for the incumbent broadcasters in licence areas where there are only two commercial services, to seek a licence to provide a third service in digital mode.  The Act currently provides that the broadcasters may, within a specified period: </para><para>·	jointly seek the licence;</para><para>·	apply alone if the other declines to seek the licence; or</para><para>·	in the absence of an agreement, bid for the licence at auction. </para><para>The current provisions require both broadcasters to indicate their intention in a joint statement to the ABA. If either broadcaster refuses to respond, the other is unable to proceed to allocation of the licence.  This means that individual broadcasters are in a position to prevent the allocation of a licence for a third service in these underserved areas through non-participation in the joint election process for a third licence.</para><para>The bill amends the Act to ensure that a third licence can be allocated under section 38B, by enabling the existing licensees to apply either jointly or separately.</para><para>In addition, section 73A provides an exemption from the normal control provisions, which limit a broadcaster to owning only one licence in a licence area, where the broadcaster has been allocated a section 38B licence to provide a third digital  service in the same licence area.  However, in a limited number of cases involving  overlapping licence areas, section 73A does not provide an exemption from the control provisions for all licensees.</para><para>The bill amends section 73A of the Act to ensure that an incumbent broadcaster allocated an additional licence under section 38B would not be in breach of the control provisions in these situations.</para><para>The bill also provides for the introduction of automatic 6 week de-listing of events under the anti-siphoning regime.  The objective of the Parliament in establishing the anti-siphoning regime was to prevent subscription broadcasting licensees from acquiring the exclusive rights to broadcast important events that should be freely available to the public.</para><para>The Broadcasting Services Act does, however, give the Minister discretion to remove an event from the anti-siphoning list.  The Minister is able to `de-list' events where, for example, where free-to-air broadcasters have had an opportunity to acquire the right to televise an event, but none of them has acquired the right within a reasonable time.</para><para>In practice, events on the anti-siphoning list are unlikely to be de-listed until it can be demonstrated that free-to-air broadcasters have declined offers to obtain the rights.  It follows that pay TV operators cannot finalise their own program arrangements until the outcome of negotiations for free-to-air rights is known and the subsequent de-listing has been authorised.  This can limit the ability of pay TV operators to schedule and promote forthcoming events. </para><para>Under the current anti-siphoning provisions, events are automatically de-listed one week after the event has been held.  This ensures that pay TV operators may provide secondary coverage of listed events without restriction.</para><para>The Government's public policy objective of making available certain major sporting events free to the general public would not be served by removal of the anti-siphoning provisions of the Act at this time.  Currently, there are a total of 1.2 million subscribers to Australia's major pay TV services.  This compares with 6 million homes that are reached by free-to-air television.  </para><para>However, there is scope for amendment to the existing anti-siphoning regime to assist pay TV operators to gain prompt access to broadcasting rights, where free-to-air broadcasters have had a reasonable opportunity to acquire rights.  This is not intended to affect the availability of major sporting events to the general public. </para><para>The bill, therefore, provides for listed events to be automatically de-listed 6 weeks before commencement.  Automatic de-listing 6 weeks before the event will maximise the time free-to-air broadcasters have to negotiate rights, while providing an adequate time prior to the event for subscription services to acquire and promote the event. </para><para>If free-to-air broadcasters oppose the de-listing of an event, and can successfully demonstrate to the Minister that they have not had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the free-to-air broadcasting rights before that date, the Minister may override the automatic de-listing by publishing a declaration that the event continues to be listed.</para><para>This bill provides for enhancements to the simulcast regime for HDTV in Australia in the light of experience, for improvements to the arrangements for the provision of a third commercial television service in currently underserved regional and remote areas, and for the introduction of more streamlined de-listing procedures under the anti-siphoning regime.</para><para>The Government remains committed to ensuring the transition from analog to digital broadcasting is as smooth as possible for viewers.  This bill allows broadcasters sufficient scope to demonstrate the appeal of HDTV, and allows viewers to make informed choices about digital television products during the simulcast period. </para><para>The implementation of automatic de-listing of events 6 weeks before they are to occur will streamline the administration of the anti-siphoning regime.  It directly addresses the problems identified by pay TV operators with the current de-listing scheme, while protecting access by free-to-air broadcasters to broadcasting rights for listed events and, thus, does not diminish opportunities for the public to enjoy free-to-air coverage of listed events.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ludwig</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) proposed:</para><motion><para>That the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.</para></motion></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>25332</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I oppose the motion.

With the <inline ref="S306">Interactive Gambling Bill 2001</inline>, the government is taking a stand to prevent the escalation of the harmful effects of gambling on the Australian community. Australia is already a world leader in the problem gambling stakes and, of course, among the number of serious problem gamblers are many of the states of Australia. In 1999, the Productivity Commission found that there were some 290,000 problem gamblers in Australia with 130,000 classified as severe and the likelihood of the introduction of interactive services was regarded as constituting a quantum increase in accessibility.</para></talk.start><para>Other statistics suggest that interactive gambling is the fastest growing web based business in the world. US investment firm Beare-Stern reports in March 2001 that the number of Internet gambling web sites has doubled in the past year from 600 to 700 sites operating last year, to 1,200 to 1,400 in March. This represents two new sites coming online every day. They also estimate that online gambling revenue could grow from $US1.5 billion to $US5 billion over the next two to three years. In fact, I have seen statistics that suggest that 4.5 million Americans have already gambled online and, on any day, over one million Americans already have the habit.</para><para>The government is very concerned about the potential for interactive gambling services to increase problem gambling in Australia. While it is a matter for individual countries to decide how they will approach interactive gambling, Australia's status as one of the world's leading problem gambling nations demands that we take decisive action to protect the most vulnerable in the community. It is fair to say that over recent weeks and months there has been enormous public discussion about the ramifications of the government's approach and about precisely what constitutes serious forms of gambling, to what extent they are repetitive and addictive, and to what extent they will exacerbate social misery. We already know from the Productivity Commission that, on average, problem gamblers lose about $12,000 a year. Anyone who saw the<inline font-style="italic"> 7.30 Report</inline> would have seen the devastating tale told by two homeless men who estimated that they had both lost hundreds of thousand of dollars from gambling activities, and they had lost their families as well. There is no doubt that we are looking at not just a<inline font-style="italic"></inline>quantum increase in accessibility but also a quantum increase in social misery.</para><para>We have made some modifications that have recognised that there are degrees of social seriousness in what can occur through interactive technology. Certainly, sports betting or wagering comes into the category of activities in which a lot of people might kid themselves that they have more skill than is demonstrated in the real world—nonetheless, we all live in hope. Many sporting activities do not fall into the mindlessly repetitive category. Similarly, one can draw a significant distinction between products like instant scratchies and keno type activities in which there is a very high turnover and in which you are able sometimes to win but, more often, lose a lot of money in a very short time. Accordingly, the government is prepared to draw those distinctions and to focus on the serious area of social misery, where there are very few redeeming features and where people are almost certain to lose their money. They might win in the short term—I suppose that everyone has had the experience of cracking a jackpot—but, if you stay around for a bit longer, you will normally give it all back. There is no doubt at all that the billions of dollars that are lost from that sort of activity are lost because of the proliferation of mindless and repetitive activity.</para><para>That highlights the deathly silence on the part of the Labor Party. We know that Mr Beazley has been soft on drugs. We know that he has not been willing to do anything about pornography and paedophilia on the Internet. And now we have this extraordinary and callous indifference to what is a very serious social problem. In other words, we have weak leadership from the leader of the major opposition party in this country—a pusillanimous performance, one might say. It is because he is too lazy, because the IT nerds have rolled him in the caucus, because basically he does not bother, or because he is simply being opportunistic and he thinks that there might be a few votes out there from standing up for technology. But in the process he is totally ignoring the misery of ordinary Australian families.</para><para>I looked at what might be the most appropriate way of characterising Mr Beazley's behaviour, and I agonised long and hard over whether it really constituted sophistry or casuistry. `Sophistry' is the use of false arguments intended to deceive. When we hear Mr Beazley interviewed on this matter, he always avoids the central issue, which is: why on earth do you want to simply sit back and allow an electronic poker machine in every home and every lounge room in the country? He skates around all that and says, `There are inconsistencies, because you are not treating Australians the same way as you are treating the rest of the world,' or, `You are drawing distinctions between this and that.' But he always avoids the central issue: what redeeming features are there in allowing electronic gaming activities, given what we have seen from the enormous explosion of activity in poker machines in some of the states? The states are now very embarrassed by that and I hope that they start to do something about it, either through a uniform national code or through some of the proposals that they are talking about. But Mr Beazley uses these things as an excuse for not addressing the real issue.</para><para>The proper term is probably `casuistry', because that involves resolving problems of conscience or duty with clever but false reasoning. In other words, Mr Beazley pretends that he is concerned. We get a bit of hand-wringing—`Yeah, it's a big social problem, but we are concerned about this, that and the other; we think that the states should do more harm minimisation; and we would like to see this, that and the other.' We never see an alternative blueprint, let alone policy, because we do not get policy from the Labor Party. That is a classic example of dereliction of duty. People can talk about Mr Beazley being prolix, which is really just a euphemism for `waffle'. In many ways, the more appropriate term is `euphuism', which involves the use of high-flown language, in this case to disguise the policy vacuum—the simple refusal to tackle issues that are of concern to the Australian public.</para><para>Mr Beazley needs to understand that good government is about values and doing what you can to address serious social problems, not just finding cute technical, peripheral reasons why you will not address the main game. That is what the debate is about. Everyone in the chamber understands that things need to be done and that there may need to be compromises, but the central issue is: why on earth do you want to allow an explosion of social misery in the homes of ordinary Australians? That is the issue that the Labor Party has consistently ducked from the outset.</para><para>We acknowledge that the states and territories have been dragging the chain for a long time. They have not been able to produce a nationally accepted code for regulating online gambling. The AUS model promoted by the Northern Territory has not been endorsed by all states—in fact, we had great difficulty in even getting a copy of certain material—so it is necessary for the Commonwealth to provide strong leadership on the issue.</para><para>There have been a number of people on our side who have made very sensible contributions and refinements, and I pay tribute to Senator Tambling for his willingness to address this issue in a way that I think does achieve the central outcomes. We are not in the business of simply protecting people because of the pressure that is brought to bear; we are in the business of trying to identify what the social problems are and what governments can do about them. I would also say that people like Senator Boswell and Cameron Thompson, the member for Blair, have also been very active in taking a very close look at the difference between general lottery activities and things like scratch-its. Whilst there might be a benefit to some from the decision to exempt those products from the exemption, the fact remains that there is a very significant qualitative difference.</para><para>The bill will make it an offence for gambling operators to provide their services to persons located in Australia, and fines of over $1 million a day will apply to bodies corporate. The bill will also establish a complaints scheme for interactive gambling services hosted offshore. Australians will be able to make complaints to the Broadcasting Authority about offshore gambling services on the Internet and have these services added to approved Internet content filtering devices. The ban will apply to online casino gaming and similar services, and these include current and future services such as Internet casinos, Internet poker machines, ball by ball wagering on sporting events via a digital broadcast and online instant lotteries. All of these services have repetitive and potentially addictive qualities which are associated with problem gambling. Interactive betting after a sporting event has commenced will be within the prohibition. This means, for example, that customers will not be able to place bets on a football, tennis or cricket match after the match has commenced. We are all familiar with spread betting and ball by ball activities, which I think are just a manifestation of antisocial behaviour.</para><para>Senator Tambling has expressed concern that people will not be able to place bets on football matches after the season has started or on a cricket series after the series has commenced. That is not correct. People will be able to place bets on the result of a football season, tennis tournament or cricket series after the season, tournament or series has commenced. These are not individual sporting events but series of events. People can also place bets on the results of a football match after the season has started and before the match has started. This is made clear in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. Online scratch tickets and other types of rapid, repetitive online lotteries will also fall within the ban. These services provide rapid, instant returns and are very close in concept and design to poker machines and casino games.</para><para>Senator Tambling has also mentioned state and territory activities in relation to developing a national uniform set of regulatory standards. The only initiative of which I am aware in this respect is the AUS model being sponsored by the Northern Territory but, given that it does not have the support of all the states and territories, it is simply not a viable alternative to the government's bill. In any case, the regulatory approach only serves to provide a stimulus to interactive gambling. There is no reason to think the AUS model could control the growth of interactive gambling any more than the states have been able to control the growth of poker machines. In fact, it might simply provide an incentive for people to bypass those regimes altogether because they judge them to be too tight in not meeting their addictive needs, so this bill focuses on the providers of gambling services rather than the users. An approach that applies an offence to gamblers themselves may force problem gamblers underground, which would lessen the likelihood of them or their families seeking assistance.</para><para>The bill also has a low impact on third parties such as financial institutions and Internet service providers. It does not mandate any blocking by ISPs or banks to prevent access to interactive gambling services. The government considers that these measures impose too great a regulatory burden and would be very likely to be subject to circumvention. The bill applies only to the provision of interactive gambling services to people in Australia. It is designed to address the specific problem gambling issues that exist in Australia. Other countries must legislate to address problem gambling as it exists in their own jurisdictions.</para><para>I am aware of criticisms that the bill will force Australians to use offshore Internet gambling services. The government has addressed these concerns in the following manner. An amendment will be moved to ban the advertising of interactive gambling services, which will limit the access of offshore providers to the Australian market. An amendment will be moved to extend the offence in the bill to offshore operators, which will deter them from signing up Australian customers. Australian customers will be cautious about using offshore services, in any case, because these services are often unregulated and there is no guarantee of payouts being honoured. If the local industry is not allowed to develop, it is unlikely there will be a significant uptake of interactive gambling by Australians in any case. A survey on attitudes to a ban commissioned by the Department of Family and Community Services found that only one per cent of people would play a gambling site on the Internet if they knew a ban was in place.</para><para>The government does not support an approach that seeks uniform national regulation of interactive gambling. The regulatory approach provides, in effect, a stimulus to the growth of this form of activity. Efforts by states and territories to reach agreement on new national standards for regulating Internet gambling have not succeeded, despite the Prime Minister's announcement of the Commonwealth's concerns in December 1999, and there is no reason to think that the states and territories can restrict the growth of new forms of gambling any more than they have been able to do with poker machines.</para><para>I simply conclude by saying that this debate provides the last opportunity for the Labor Party—Mr Beazley, no doubt, will be hiding under a desk somewhere, but Senator Bishop has the opportunity to get up now—to explain, once and for all, why it is not prepared to do what can be done to stop the proliferation of electronic poker machines into the homes of ordinary Australians. And don't just give us all the other reasons that there are inconsistencies, there might be a few problems and technology keeps moving—we know all of those. In fact, the bill has a number of discretions contained within it which will enable us to at least keep up with new technological developments. But the central issue is: why won't you take a stand on principle? Why won't you come out and say that you do regard this as a social evil—a social issue and not an IT issue? Don't be hijacked by the Senator Lundys of this world who have been running around for years saying, `The Internet's sacrosanct. You can't touch it. Don't do anything about it.' That is not the approach adopted around the world these days. People know there are excesses from any new technology and that governments have an obligation to do what they can. We are not in the business of closing down the Internet. We are not in the business of stifling legitimate activities.</para><para>Our ban on pornography and paedophilia on the Internet, to the extent that it applies to Australian web sites, has been totally effective. Where complaints have been made, take-down notices have been issued. I have forgotten the precise number, but it is well over 100. The sites have been largely on paedophilia, not just on pornography, and we have been able to take those down. Surely that is a major social advance. Who wants to stand up and argue in favour of allowing that sort of activity to go unchecked? There is only one party that does, and that is the Labor Party. Having made that horrific mistake on Internet content regulation, why compound the felony this time around? At least get up and tell us where you stand, and why on earth you cannot support that part of the bill that attempts to do something about stopping the spread of interactive gaming activities into the homes of ordinary Australians. The answer is that it is all too hard.</para><para>This will be the major problem the Labor Party will have in the lead-up to the next election. They are not prepared to take a stance on issues because it might offend someone. They would much prefer to roll themselves up into a little ball and let the government take the flak. They might be behind the scenes, quietly cheering and saying that in their heart of hearts they agree and, when they go to church on Sunday and are told how bad this is, they say, `Don't worry; the government is going to fix it up.' But, of course, they will not say anything. They will just sit on their hands and look at all the flak the government will cop from various interest groups, whether it be the gambling proprietors, whether it be the horseracing industry or whether it be newsagents. Every time there is a bit of a break-out, they will say, `Isn't that good. This government is getting problems of its own.' And what will they do? They will just keep quiet. They do not have the gumption to stand up and say why they do not think this is a major social issue for Australians.</para><para>The Labor Party are a value-free zone. They are not in the business of trying to control activities, irrespective of whether they think they are socially deleterious and irrespective of whether they think some technological solutions can be applied. What will really concern Australians in six months time is Labor's abdication of responsibility—this leadership from the rear, and this willingness to sit on the fence whenever possible. That is why I say that Mr Beazley deserves an award for world's best practice in pusillanimous performance. I suspect that today will simply reinforce that position. But I am confident that, despite the Labor Party's craven capitulation, we will be able to achieve some real progress to protect the families of Australia.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mark Bishop's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>10:59:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.[ </para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

Nonetheless, if they set foot in Australia, they can be prosecuted, as has occurred in the US under the Wire Act, where persons have provided gambling services from the Caribbean into the United States. In one particularly famous case, a person went to jail as a result of a prosecution. It seems to us that that is a sensible way of not only punishing any person in particular but also drawing attention to the fact that these sorts of activities are profoundly discouraged at the very least and is a sensible way of minimising the impact of those persons who might be tempted to gamble offshore. </para><para>I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government's amendments to be moved to this bill.

The opposition is more than pleased to accept that invitation from the government.</para></talk.start><para>At the outset, I would like to make several points. Firstly, we are of the view that the flaws in this bill are persuasive—so persuasive that the government is having to substantially amend its own bill. We believe the government's entire policy approach, the entire premise for its legislation, is fundamentally and irreparably flawed. It is irreparably flawed because the government's amendments to the original bill do not make the legislation any more effective today than it might have been a week ago.</para><para>I will go through the various reasons why the opposition opposes the bill and its various flaws. I will also outline the opposition's planned approach to the committee stage debate on this bill in the Senate, which is based upon our fundamental opposition to this bill's approach, the futility of amending the bill and the unpragmatic consideration given to time for this debate. I will outline again, for the record, the opposition's approach to interactive gambling, which we profoundly believe is the only policy that will protect Australians from the harms of problem gambling—our primary concern. Finally, I will make a few comments on the government's conduct during the debate to date on this issue.</para><para>We have publicly stated for some time that we are opposed to this bill. We say that the flaws in this bill are so persuasive that the government is having to substantially amend its own bill. This is evidenced by the government's undue haste, lack of proper consideration, foresight and consultation on this issue. We say that the bill is ineffective in its present form. It is obvious from the extent of the government's amendments to its bill that the government, too, has accepted the criticism made in the Labor senators' report to the legislation committee that its original bill was flawed. Unfortunately, however, the government's amendments just tinker around the edges of the real issue, which is that the government's entire policy approach—the entire premise for its legislation—is flawed. </para><para>During the Senate inquiry into the bill, Labor senators pointed out the fundamental flaws in the bill. We showed that not only was the government's policy approach flawed but also the bill contained a host of inconsistencies, specific flaws and oversights. The range of amendments before us today suggests that the government has taken that advice on board. With this bill, we believe that the government is intent on making a mockery of Australia's capacity to sensibly deal with the challenges that new technologies present, and a great deal of the world will be watching this legislation and perhaps will move to replicate some parts of it in due course. In fact, a number of progressive countries are seriously looking into Australia's existing regulatory arrangements with a view to adopting them in their own countries.</para><para>There are a number of reasons why the opposition considers the position taken in this bill to be inappropriate. I made a number of points in my second reading contribution. I will not discuss them in detail but I will again put several points on the record as to why the bill is flawed. Firstly, Australians will still be able to access Internet gambling services. The bill does not achieve, prevent or discourage access, which surely is a critical step in achieving a ban. In fact, the bill does not even prohibit Australians from accessing domestic or foreign Internet gambling sites. Secondly, the easiest sites for Australians to access will be overseas sites—some of dubious probity. It is nearly impossible to distinguish reputable sites from those of dubious probity. So Australians will easily access some of the most dangerous gambling sites on the Internet. Thirdly, problem gamblers are likely to be the ones who will be desperate enough to circumvent restrictions on accessing Australian and foreign sites and will most likely fall prey to unscrupulous operators who will not limit expenditure. This bill, if passed in its current form, could result in worse gambling problems than if Australians were able to access strictly regulated Australian sites.</para><para>Fourthly, Australia is looking backwards while the rest of the world is trying to come up with constructive solutions. A number of countries are looking to adopt Australia's regulatory model for Internet gambling. Meanwhile, the Australian government is looking to copy a 1961 US act which has clearly failed to prevent Americans from gambling on the Internet. Australia is seeking to adopt an approach that has proven futile in preventing interactive gambling access in the United States, as evidenced by the minister's comments that a million persons a day in the United States access and use interactive gambling services in that country. </para><para>Fifthly, we repeat our criticism that it is hypocritical to allow Australian Internet gambling service providers to receive revenue from services they offer to overseas countries when those countries will be left with the attendant social problems and no funds to deal with them. That criticism stands, notwithstanding the agreement that has been reached between the government and Senator Brown with respect to overseas countries. Sixthly, the bill will have a negative impact on the Australian Internet gambling service providers. Their claims of being `well regulated' will not be credible if their own government will not allow its citizens to access their services. Seventhly, the bill still permits Australians access to Internet wagering—and, clearly, wagering is hardly immune from gambling problems. On the contrary, wagering contributes considerably to the gambling problems of Australians. The Productivity Commission made this point clearly in its report on Australian gambling industries. </para><para>In addition, the minority report by Labor senators to the Senate committee inquiry said that this bill identified a number of specific concerns about the drafting of certain provisions in the bill which would render the bill's impact uncertain and unjust. The government has taken a number of those concerns on board. The critical point is that the opposition will not oppose the government's amendments to its own bill. Our position is that the government has introduced a deficient bill and is now trying to fix it up in an ad hoc way, without addressing the underlying policy flaws. We say that it does not matter how the government tries to fix up the problems with this bill; it is the underlying rationale that is flawed: it is still not technically feasible to ban interactive gambling. The government can make any number of amendments to this bill, and it still will not achieve that purpose. The bill is beyond being rescued. </para><para>The opposition moved a second reading amendment a few months ago. We did not receive the support of the Senate. We opposed the second reading of the bill. We will oppose the bill on its third reading when we have the opportunity. If the Senate finds this bill acceptable, in spite of our warnings that it will not work, the opposition are not in a position to do anything more than to offer constructive criticism of the bill and the policy it implements and to point out the many flaws and reasons that it will not succeed. I wanted to make these comments at the outset of the committee stage because those principles will guide the opposition's conduct during the debate. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>25342</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will respond briefly to that because I think it goes to the heart of the debate that we are having. What we have done is recognise that in an imperfect world and a fast moving technology environment you cannot cover the field; you cannot actually stop everything that you want to stop any more than passing a law against murder will magically eliminate murders in the community—sadly. You can pass a law against drugs, but people still traffic in drugs. You can pass a law against road traffic conduct that is out of order, but people still infringe. It is no excuse to say that because something will not be 100 per cent effective we will therefore do nothing about it. </para></talk.start><para>I want to highlight the fact that I invited Senator Bishop to explain the opposition's alternative approach—in other words, to do the hard yards and tell us what he would do to address a serious social issue. There was not even one word of sympathy about problem gambling for the families that suffer from it or one word about what might be done about it. At one stage, he said something in passing about a regulated regime, but do the opposition in the federal parliament have any alternative to a regulated regime? Of course they do not. They mean, `We want to wash our hands of all of this. We'll do nothing; we'll leave it to others.'</para><para>The states have actually been playing around with a draft interactive gambling code since 1996. It still has not gone anywhere. It is a bit like Internet content regulation. The industry were playing around with it for years. The Internet Industry Association were again wringing their hands and saying, `Yes, we're on the case. Leave it to us.' It will take forever. Nothing ever happens. Similarly, you now find that the states and territories are, reluctantly and eventually, upping the ante a bit, but they still have not got anywhere. They still have not agreed. New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, WA want to go a lot further than the rest of the states, and of course some territories are quite feral on the subject.</para><para>Leaving it to others is an absolute policy cop-out. We have had criticisms from Senator Bishop. His speech in the second reading debate was all carping and criticisms. We had `flaws are persuasive', `undue haste' and `lack of foresight'. These are mantras. You just press button A and you throw these things in every debate. If you do not like something, you say, `We have not had enough time to consult,' as if to say, `If you had just given us a bit more time, we might have come on board.' That is where I want to highlight the hypocrisy of this. One of the things Senator Bishop said is:</para><quote><para>... the bill still permits Australians access to Internet wagering, and wagering is hardly immune from gambling problems.</para></quote><para>Why not try to do something about it?

We do not hear you say, `We would support that; this is our policy.' You do not get any of that; you just get these opportunistic criticisms. You say, `We could point to a few logical inconsistencies.' In other words, if we were having the ultimate dialectic, you would be able to demonstrate in a logical fashion that somehow we should have covered each and every aspect, no matter how difficult it might have been, and that to be absolutely perfect you would have tried to cover all the bases. That is the implication, but that is not the opposition's approach. Their approach is, `We're going to do nothing.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is why I say there is weakness of leadership at the very top. It is not Senator Bishop—he is just the messenger boy in here. The fact is that it is all Mr Beazley. The buck stops there. This guy does not have the intestinal fortitude to take a policy position and give Senator Bishop some decent riding instructions to come in here and wring his hands for five minutes and say, `Isn't this shocking? We've really got to do something about it. We don't like your approach, but what we will do is the following.' We did not get any of that. Senator Lundy would not have a bar of it for a moment. She does not want to do anything that will in any way interfere with the spread of technology, irrespective of the social consequences. I can understand you are under a bit of pressure from the far Left. But, if Mr Beazley regarded himself as a moderate with some concerns about the impact on families, you would think he would at least say something.</para><para>Ignore Senator Lundy, but look at Mr Smith. Instead of just sitting in his room, rehearsing those one-liners, polishing the fake microphone, getting it all right and getting the hair in shape, Mr Smith should actually do the hard yards, work out an alternative strategy and tell us what approach he would adopt. If you were in government, what would you do? What do you propose in six months time if you happen to fall over the line? What would you do about this major social problem? We do not hear any of that. We just get told, `The flaws are persuasive. The government's entire policy approach is flawed. It makes a mockery of technology challenges. Problem gamblers might be able to circumvent a negative impact on interactive service providers. It is not technologically feasible to ban Internet gambling.' Then there is the ultimate cop-out. Senator Bishop says that, if this bill passes, the opposition will not be in a position to do anything other than offer criticism.</para><para>This is what we are going to have in the lead-up to the next election. The Labor Party's position will be: `I'm terribly sorry. It's a major social policy challenge, but unfortunately we're not in a position to do anything other than offer criticism.' That will not get you there; it is just not good enough. The punters will not wear that. They know what has happened in the states. They know the states have done nothing for years and years. It is policy lazy. This is terminal stuff. You cannot just lie there on a life support system, hoping that enough people are going to keep you alive for the election and hoping that you can surf in on the criticisms that might be made of any government from time to time.

You can say a lot of things about your bloke, but he certainly does not have much charisma. His problem is not only that he is a waffler but also that he is a very weak leader. If you are a weak leader and you do not have policies, that is a very bad basis on which to go into an election. So thank you for confirming that you do not have any alternative policy approach.

Most people agree that that is a very hard position to defend if you are going to say that those countries will not deliver the same services to Australians. We all acknowledge the illogicality of that.</para></talk.start><para>The government is trying to limit the availability of those services in overseas countries. However, a number of amendments deal with that, and the problem is to sort them out. I am looking at Senator Brown's amendment. It parallels the amendments to be moved by Senator Harradine, and I expect we will have a larger and longer debate then, because Senator Harradine's amendments are much more detailed. At this point, I indicate that I and some of my colleagues will be supporting the government amendments and that we will not be supporting Senator Brown's amendment to those amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>25345</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Because of the importance of time today, I did not make a speech in the second reading debate on this bill. But Senator Bishop's response provokes me to stand up. Of course this is a hard issue. It is a desperate issue. It is an issue that affects 290,000 people who are problem gamblers. It is probably one of the greatest social issues affecting Australia. It results in divorce and it results in bankruptcies and broken homes and all the other social values that we hold very dear.</para></talk.start><para>I am proud of the government for taking on a hard issue like this. It is something that you are never going to get your hands right around. To take it on and to send a message out that gambling is a social problem that affects very many Australians is something the government deserves credit for. I also want to consider some of the things that have been brought up and to which the government has responded. I am thinking of a particular country horseracing centre, just out of Richmond. I went to a horseracing meeting there. There were six events. They get about $3,000 each from the TAB. If the TAB were not allowed to collect some revenue that way then we would lose country horseracing. Rural Australians are missing many facilities, but they like to go and have a social Saturday afternoon out at Richmond or other little country centres. The government did respond to that.</para><para>Some forms of gambling have been the province of small businesses, such as newsagents and chemists. When it was pointed out to the minister that the changes could have detrimental effects on small business, it was responded to by keeping scratchie lotteries—which are really interactive gambling—off the Internet. The government will receive welcome thanks from small business for including that. I understand the minister is going to make some catch-all amendment where he will have the right to continue to investigate any new product that comes onto the market. He has given me that assurance and I see him nodding his head now. If any new product is developed through state government lotteries to go on the Internet, the minister will have the right of veto on it.</para><para>Keno games, for example, come up every five minutes, so you do not have to wait long for a result. They are available on the Internet in some states. I would argue that that is interactive: a result is continually coming up and people can sit in front of their television sets with their bankcards and can punt on this interactive gambling. It is totally wrong and I am appalled by the decision by the Labor Party that it is all too hard. Everything is too hard in this place. It is a very hard place to work in. You always encounter unintended consequences, but it does not stop us trying to do something. Apparently, it stops the ALP trying to do anything, because it is too hard.</para><para>I congratulate the minister. He took on an area that has a lot of consequences and a lot of social issues.

There is a very important point about the way in which this legislation has been amended. I want to explain my Greens amendment. It adds to the government list of provisions for gaming houses in Australia which are providing Internet services. As we all know, they are not allowed to provide those to Australians, but they can provide them overseas. There is a concern that some Australians nevertheless will find ways of placing bets on these gaming houses set up here. The government provisions say, if the gaming house is not going to be prosecuted on that, it has to show that it went to some length to ascertain that the better was not physically in Australia—that is, they were not geographically here. The Greens amend-ment adds to that that you should also make sure that an Australian credit card was not used. It is a very simple but important strengthening of the government's provisions, and I commend it to the committee.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>25346</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to respond to some of the comments made by the minister on behalf of the opposition. I had been under the impression that time was fairly scarce in this debate, and all matters were going to be treated with some expedition. The minister having engaged in 10 or 12 minutes of ritualistic abuse for no apparent purpose, they are apparently not the rules that have been agreed to and accepted in this debate, and time is not of the essence. On that basis, it is probably appropriate to address in some detail the problems or the issues raised by the minister and the position of the opposition in this debate.</para></talk.start><para>In this debate there is both a real problem and a straw man being erected. Every person in this chamber knows what the real problem is. The figures are bandied about of 200,000 or 300,000 Australians who have significant gambling addiction problems. The multiplier effect is that that applies to about another one in eight or one in 10, so the real problems affect something in the order of three million Australians. Senator Allison yesterday in her speech in the second reading debate referred to those persons in terms of their enterprises, their businesses, their family relationships, their friends and the consequent social problems that attach to those 3 million Australians. I do not think anyone in this chamber does not say that that is not an existing problem, a real problem and a growing problem. If the trend line related to land based facilities continues on its current dynamic, that problem is going to get larger and larger.</para><para>The straw man erected in this debate is not to attend to the social problems in the four eastern states and South Australia, not to show Commonwealth leadership, not to show Commonwealth coordination, not to sit the states down and say, `Listen, you blokes are dependent on gambling revenue from the working class, social welfare recipients and low income areas to the tune of something in the order of $11 billion a year, and all of the social programs, all the welfare benefits you pay and all the incentives you offer to businesses to come to your states are based upon the income you receive from these people who lose $10 billion or $11 billion a year.' The solution of the government is not to sit the four or five states down through the Ministerial Council on Gambling and offer to come up with some sort of alternative to needing these funds, and to come up with some sort of constructive regulations.</para><para>The straw man that is being played out in this debate—articulated clearly by Senator Alston on behalf of the government—is to manufacture a real concern in the netherworld, in Internet gambling, in cyberspace, where there are no apparent or real problems at this stage. If there are such problems, they are of such magnitude that they are incapable of being statistically recorded in this country or in any other country, yet down the street you have hundreds of thousands of Australians, if not millions, affected. So the opposition say—based on the hundreds and thousands of letters we have received, our discussions at various committees and lobbying by the social welfare groups—what is the problem here? Is the problem Internet gambling per se? Is the problem land based gambling per se? The answer is that the problems are the social problems attached to land based gambling. That is what we say it is appropriate to address, diagnose, analyse and come up with solutions for.</para><para>All of the states for the last 10 years, whether they be conservative or Labor states—conservative states in the late eighties and early nineties and now Labor states—have chosen to abdicate their responsibilities to attend to the social problems in their communities, based almost solely on land based gambling. The states have chosen to abdicate that responsibility, so we say it is appropriate for the Commonwealth to be involved. It is a necessity for the Commonwealth to show leadership. The Commonwealth should be coordinating an approach that tries to address the social problems attached to gambling. They should be pulled into line. We say that is the responsibility of the Commonwealth government, represented in this chamber by Senator Alston. Yet we have in exchange a series of cliches: `a gambling room in every home' and `problems on the Internet'. None of those issues are being addressed. The solution to that is to support federal coordination of consistent state based regulatory regimes. That is the only way the opposition believes those social problems attached to gambling are going to be solved.</para><para>Not only does the government not acknowledge the problem or any significant role for the Commonwealth and not only does it erect a straw man; it also makes it worse. It tries to distinguish between those unfortunate souls who might be addicted to casino type gambling and those unfortunate souls who have been addicted for many years to gambling on wagering, sports betting or racecourses. For God's sake, what is the difference? It is like saying an alcoholic who is addicted to gin is different from an alcoholic who is addicted to whisky.

We are not going to do anything about land based gambling problems; we are not going to do anything about casinos; we are not going to do anything about sports betting; we are not going to do anything about wagering—so there are 17 ways to hell you can gamble—and we manufacture this nonsense that out there in the Internet there is a real problem and we are going to do something about it. Frankly, Minister, that is just a disgrace. That is the `no solution' option. That is what you have paraded here today—no solution to existing problems; a potential solution to a potential problem.</para><para>We have had now something in the order of three Senate inquiries—which I have sat through and written most of the reports for—numerous debates and much discussion in the community. Everyone in this chamber understands the issues: the social issues, the technology issues and the feasibility issues. It is pointless to continue engaging in ritualistic debate setting out positions. Our position is on the record. It has been detailed in a policy sense for at least two or three years through numerous committee reports. It has been out there in the public domain. For the government to erect this straw man and say that the opposition does not have a position or is ignoring the reality of the problems really is a nonsense.</para><para>The problem is out there in land based gambling; it is out there in casinos; it is out there in the many forms of gambling that are part and parcel of our society. And the government for its own reasons, which are still not clear to me, chooses to do nothing about it. It is completely inappropriate, verging on the improper, to try and shift responsibility or allocate blame to the opposition. You are the government of the day, you are elected, you can show Commonwealth leadership, you can show Commonwealth coordination and you can pull the states into line—or at least offer them some incentive or ability to achieve what should be a common purpose.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>25347</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Can the minister explain to the committee how the amendments that are currently before us will work?

The impact of the Interstate Wire Act in the US has been quite profound. You can talk to Australian proprietors, for example, who tell you they are very worried about even going to the US for fear that they might have transgressed by providing services to the US.

We do not have full extraterritorial powers: we cannot go off and try and prosecute them in other jurisdictions or have them extradited to Australia.

They would much prefer to deal with local organisations in whom they have confidence. If you have a ban on gambling, I think that does make a very significant difference to people who might otherwise see a billboard and be inclined to think, Well, I'll give it a go.' They have actually got to actively search and for the vast majority of the population that simply will not result in them accessing offshore sites. In fact, I think there was a study conducted by the Department of Family and Community Services which showed that, if a ban were in place, only one per cent of people would play on a gambling site on the Internet. That is about as much as you can do to try to judge in advance what people's reactions might be. </para><para>I know that Senator Harradine would say that some people will never come to Australia.

They certainly have extensive Australian connections and they need to come here, as the nearest port of call, to acquire equipment and the like. It could result in a very significant disincentive.</para><para>But there is also the other good corporate citizenship aspect, which I mentioned, that is, you do find that even the world's largest gaming houses like Ladbrokes have a disclaimer—and I think that William Hill has some disclaimer as well—which shows that they will not want to be caught up in bans of this sort and be seen to be flouting them.

Where something of concern is brought to its attention, it will be able to investigate the matter and provide information to the police, who would then be in a position to launch a prosecution. In the way that most activities progress through a chain, people normally bring certain matters to the attention of the police, but they do not provide them with a hand up brief; they provide them with a basis on which they then put together the necessary ingredients of a prosecution. Presumably, that would involve identifying the persons involved in a particular gambling activity. It may involve cooperation with other police organisations and generally they will have a responsibility to do what they can to ensure the successful prosecution of persons who might be involved in those activities. As I say, the numbers are relatively finite. If there is community concern and complaints are made, and that would include the ability for Senator Harradine to draw matters to the attention of the Australian Broadcasting Authority, there will be a chain of events that could certainly lead to prosecutions if those people visit Australia.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>25350</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Frankly, Minister, I have more things to do with my time.

I can deal with those now, if you like, but in responding to them, I will talk about the role of the Ministerial Council on Gambling and the approach being adopted by the Department of Family and Community Services. I am not sure whether Senator Harradine has a copy of the letter that Senator Vanstone provided in the chamber yesterday to Senator Woodley, but in a number of respects it addresses issues of concern to the Commonwealth that we would like to see further explored in the Ministerial Council on Gambling. All I can say in respect of Senator Brown's amendment is that we have not had the time to consider it carefully and it seems to be quite similar to Senator Harradine's amendment, about which I will talk in detail.

Am I to understand from what the minister is saying that, in obtaining a visa to enter Australia, the visa would require that gambling merchants must be licensed to operate legally in Australia? In future, would the visa requirements of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade mean that an applicant would not get a visa if the applicant has been engaged in providing services to Australia? Obviously, if there is a law in this country that it is an offence, as this legislation proposes, for an offshore interactive gambling organisation to provide services to Australia, surely anyone who has been engaging in that illegal activity would not be provided with a visa.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>25350</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This raises fairly complex issues. It is one thing for persons applying for a visa to be required to disclose whether they have criminal convictions. As we know, even that can be much more complicated than it appears to be at face value when you have spent convictions which you are not obliged to disclose, while certain authorities, like the US, take the view that you have to disclose even situations where a charge has been adjourned and then subsequently dismissed, as that can be regarded as a conviction. </para></talk.start><para>Even at that level, complex issues can arise. But to require applicants for visas to disclose the nature of activities that may or may not be subject to prosecution in Australia seems to me to put the cart before the horse. I would be very surprised if you could draft it in such a way that would even begin to provide helpful information. It would involve enormous complexity. People talk about red tape. It would mean that every applicant for a visa would presumably have to go to great lengths to explain the nature of their business activities. What would you do? Would you say, `Are you involved in any activity that might infringe the law of Australia in relation to interactive gambling activities?' Would an applicant say, `I have no idea; I have never seen the bill; I do not know what the consequences are'? Even though it might affect a minuscule proportion, every applicant for a visa would somehow have to identify the nature of his activities. Even then, he would be asked to make a self-assessment of whether he was likely to have committed an offence. It is not something that we can address on the run in this way.</para><para>Clearly, as the legislation is proposed to be reviewed on an ongoing basis, one can look at some of those possible additional approaches when people have had the opportunity to think them through. It seems to me at first glance that you would impose enormous bureaucratic obligations on those who apply for visas and those who process them, with probably very little reason to think that you would throw up any useful information. You would be much better off to look at web sites that offer services to Australia and then try to track down those people. As I have said, the numbers are not in the millions. It therefore should be a matter of reasonable possibility.</para><para>As we have said before, you cannot hope to close down every form of illegal activity, no matter how insignificant it might be, but if there are mainstream offerings, you will probably find that there are only half a dozen or so really heavy hitters in this business worldwide. If that is the case, it will not take too long to track them down, see whether they are offering services to Australia and do something about it. Given the experience of the wire act, they are the very ones who would least want to get around our legislation or turn a blind eye to it. They would be the ones who were most likely to cooperate, and in those circumstances the 80-20 rule would apply, and you would protect as many people as you could reasonably hope to protect.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>25351</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This discussion goes to the heart of whether, in practice, the amendment will be effective. I have been given a document that was downloaded today. It makes the point that combined revenues from both the US and Europe are predicted to grow from an estimated $US6.7 billion in 2001 to $US21 billion in 2005 and that the number of online gamblers in Europe and the US will increase from 2.9 million this year to 7.5 million in 2005.</para></talk.start><para>My understanding of what the government seeks to achieve with this amendment is that offshore IGSPs who provide Australians with their services will be liable to prosecution if they land in this country. The root source of the government's amendment is the United States federal wire communications act of 1961, which the Americans have attempted to use to regulate and, possibly, to make illegal interactive gambling in that country. On 2 April, the minister put out a press headed `Devastating impact of Internet gambling revealed', and he quoted American studies and made the point that every day about one million Americans use Internet gambling and that up to 4.5 million Americans use it regularly. If one million Americans use Internet gambling in the United States every day and about 4.5 million Americans have from time to time gambled on the Internet, and the wire act applies in the United States, is it not clear that it has patently had no effect on restricting, banning, ceasing or limiting the growth of Internet gambling in that country? That being the case, what utility does it have as a model in this country, when it has patently failed in the United States to have any impact at all on gambling?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>25351</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The short answer is that the wire act applies only to services provided from offshore.

The wire act applies to domestic activity. It was passed in 1961 by the Kennedy administration as one of the tools to restrict the growth of Mafia and criminal activity in illegal gambling in the various states and cities of the United States. It was intended to have a domestic purpose, by making illegal the use of communications facilities—hence the name `wire act'—for the passing of bets between cities and states. It was directed at the heart of organised criminal activity in the United States. Its purpose was to restrict domestic gambling activity. That being the case in the United States, your own press release says that there are 4.5 million regular users and a million users every day. Again: what is the utility of importing that principle in the wire act into this bill?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>25352</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The wire act, as you quite rightly say, is 40 years old. It was not designed to address this problem. It has simply been invoked because of, I think, the inability of legislators in that country to have an approach that results in effective legislation. It applies only across state borders, so one assumes that it would not be all that difficult for a national operator to effectively operate out of each state and cater for the residents of each state. In that very simple way, you circumvent the problem—you are not offering services across state borders.</para></talk.start><para>That being the case, we are not trying to address the problem simply by using the wire act; we have a comprehensive body of measures, one of which is based on a very high profile experience of a prosecution under the wire act which did see a Caribbean service provider go to jail for this type of offence. If it can be used in that way to deal with people providing services from offshore in the US, it can be used here. So don't worry yourself too much about whether the Americans are being derelict in their duty in not having a comprehensive approach to Internet gambling; there is one measure there we can use as part of our armoury which we think can go some way. We accept the technological limitations of trying to have a fortress Australia approach to block everything coming into the country. You cannot do that, but you can up the ante in a way that I think will make it very difficult for a number of people to take those risks.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>25352</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek some clarification from the minister regarding the purpose of the government's amendments being to prosecute any person who enters Australia for having provided a service.

That would really have some effect. I can understand that, if the targeting was just of the directors or the individuals providing the service, it may have a limited effect. But if it is the intention of the government's bill to have that effect actually register on not only the directors of the company but the shareholders—because the shareholders would derive a profit—then the government would have a quite effective way of bringing pressure on that public company not to provide those services.

It is a fundamental tenet of the Corporations Law that those responsible for the running of a company are the directors and management, and they would be the only ones that you could realistically target. To the extent that they incurred a substantial penalty and the company ended up paying that, I suppose that has an adverse effect on the shareholders in the sense that it impacts on their bottom line. But I really think it would be an absolute nightmare to try to impose an obligation on every shareholder for activities that are clearly beyond their control and responsibility and overwhelmingly, I would have thought, probably beyond their knowledge.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>25353</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Some of what I would argue is the nonsensical debate that we have heard thus far reinforces for me what I firmly believe is the nonsense of the bill itself.

In essence, where I am coming from personally, in terms of my philosophical approach to the bill, and from a technological point of view, is that, even if I were to support the notion that online gambling ought to be banned—and I do not support that—then I could not argue in any credible way that it was technologically possible. Senator Harradine has been arguing this afternoon about the possibilities and probabilities of physically arresting somebody who might be coming to Australia if they were involved in providing an online gaming service to Australians here within our shores. But the point is: they need not set foot in the country to do any of this. The Internet challenges, probably for the first time in any real sense, our notion of geography, in that cyberspace does not have a physical location. You cannot pin it down.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the fundamental flaws in the bill for me is the notion that, whereas the government is arguing that we ought to censor—we ought to prohibit—online gambling, that fundamentally misses the first in-principle question which is: can you do it? The most damning indictment of the proposed legislation, as argued by Mr Josh Gliddon, an IT writer with the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine and to whom I referred in my speech in the second reading debate, is that there is evidence that it cannot work. He says:</para><quote><para>The IIA's—</para></quote><para>the Internet Industry of Australia's—</para><quote><para>position is that using internet protocol addresses (the addresses used to identify a computer's physical and virtual location in cyberspace) as the key to blocking access is flawed. Why? Because IP addresses aren't passports, and can't be relied on to locate someone in cyberspace. Some ISPs—</para></quote><para>Internet service providers—</para><quote><para>will issue IP addresses that indicate the computer is located in the US when in fact it's in Australia, while some corporations find it expedient, particularly if they're a multinational, to do the same. There's nothing sinister about it. The internet just works that way.</para></quote><para>Encapsulated there in part is an argument to which I would adhere: the conflict between trying to pin something firmly on cyberspace and trying to pin something firmly on geography is a nonsense. Senator Harradine raised another good point, and there has been some media on this: American indigenous peoples, in a zone colloquially known as Mohawk Nation, provide an enormous range of online services, including online gambling. They are perfectly entitled and empowered to do that. Nothing can prevent those people from providing that service anywhere in cyberspace. Therefore, it can be accessed anywhere from within cyberspace, including here in Australia. So, even if we were to succeed in prohibiting and banning online gaming services being produced from within Australia, we cannot ban them from being produced within Mohawk Nation. Any problem gambler—and the theory is that this bill is targeted at problem gamblers—can get online and find those services readily.</para><para>There has been an unspoken agenda here that somehow online gaming services are being foisted or advocated or promoted to Australians, and there is certainly truth in that. But, even if you were able to completely prevent that, and I do not believe it is technically possible, anyone with a computer—including Senator Allison, sitting next to me with her laptop—could go into Yahoo, Google, Dogpile or any other agents that can be accessed to surf the net and simply type in `online gaming'. A vast range of addresses would appear, and the gambler, simply with the click of a mouse, could access that site and be whisked off to cyberspace to play to their heart's content. You cannot prevent a search engine from listing—much like a library—an online gaming service. That is not advertising.</para><para>It is also a fact that there is an unspoken agenda in part of this debate which suggests that you can readily identify an online casino and that, once you have identified it, you can attempt to prohibit it or to frustrate it. The reality is that online casinos can easily change their banking identity; in fact, many already use third-party online financial settlement services. I would argue, therefore, that online casinos can and will open up seemingly unconnected financial identities to process the financial transactions of gamblers if that idea were to gain momentum in Australia or elsewhere. The process is known as brown paper bagging, where you simply launder your processes through a third party. I am speaking hypothetically, but you may have an online gambling service in Vanuatu. If, in the very unlikely event the Vanuatu government banned online gaming from within its jurisdiction, the online gaming service would simply remain in Vanuatu, calling itself, say, Acme Consulting Services. It could process its administrative and financial arrangements through Acme Consulting Services, and we in Australia would be none the wiser.</para><para>It has been suggested by some people that the catch in that would be that the banks that administer credit cards would be able to acknowledge or in some way monitor credit card transactions to gaming services regardless of what their name might be. I sought clarification on that point from the Australian Banking Association. They confirmed unreservedly that that is not possible, and that it is not done. Everybody with whom I have sought consultation on the technical possibilities of this bill—whether it be the Internet Industry Association, Electronic Frontiers, some colleagues who work in Internet service providing agencies, Reynolds Technology or Harvest Road—have all said to me that the bill is fundamentally flawed on technical grounds, if not other grounds. The minister raised the suggestion earlier in his contribution that the online services bill had been a success but went on to say, in complete contradiction to that claim, that of the millions of pornography sites available on the world wide web, only a tiny percentage—I think he named 10 of many hundreds of thousands, if not millions—have been frustrated by the online services ban.</para><para>Interestingly, the American Express company—the credit card firm—tried recently to ban payments to online pornography sites in America. Again, that was frustrated and completely overridden by the brown paper bag account process, which could be and would be used for online gaming. There is a serious problem gambling issue here in Australia—I acknowledge that; I have been aware of it for some years and I do have a very real concern with it—but, as Senator Bishop has articulated, the problem is overwhelmingly related to poker machines at situ sites and at casinos. How we can address that is unclear, but clearly the government is unwilling to even think about it. At the same time it purports to have a sophisticated way of addressing the issue of online gaming, which I accept at this stage is played by very few people. It is something which may grow exponentially, but I believe strongly that the only way you can address that is through education and regulation, not prohibition.</para><para>Principally and philosophically, I am saying that, while I oppose the notion of prohibiting online gambling per se, I also strongly believe that technically it is impossible. It could only work as suggested by the government and some other senators if it were to operate similarly to extradition treaty proposals. For example, following the recent case of Mr Konrad Kalejs, we now have an extradition treaty with Latvia such that, if Latvia should seek extradition treaty from somebody in Australia for a criminal matter, we can extradite them, and vice versa. We cannot do that with Cambodia. We have no extradition treaty with Cambodia.</para><para>So it is with online gaming. Theoretically, if Australia were to ban online gaming and, theoretically, if Canada were to ban online gaming, then there might be an opportunity to prohibit online gaming between those two places. There would be a spirit of cooperation. Having said that, Canada have made it very clear that they will do no such thing; they have a much more sensible approach to the Internet. But, under that theory, it still means that if it were possible for an Australian gambler to be prevented from gambling online in Canada, they could still do so in Vanuatu, in the Canary Islands, in any number of the states in the USA—name the country. To that end, the bill itself is fundamentally shallow and tokenistic.</para><para>So these two amendments that have popped up early in the debate in this committee stage—one that purports to prohibit online gambling, in essence, and, subsequent to that, one that proposes a method of doing that through credit card facilities and banking arrangements—are both, in my view, fundamentally flawed for technical reasons. That will be my consistent argument throughout this debate as a whole, so I do not propose to repeatedly go over that as each amendment is raised. Having put my position on record, I indicate and state strongly that that is my position on the bill as a whole. Later on I will be supportive of further amendments that do aim to seriously address the issue of poker machines in Australia which, I argue, is the key fundamental issue of problem gaming in the nation.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>25355</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title><page.no>25355</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>25355</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That government business notice of motion No. 3 have precedence over all government business orders of the day from 12.45 p.m. till not later than 2 p.m. today.</para></motion><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—Would the Clerk be so good as to read out that notice of motion, please?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—Senator Brown, I will give you a short explanation.

This motion is to give it precedence so that, if the clock gets to 12.45 p.m. and we have not finished dealing with government business notice of motion No. 3, we will continue to do so until it is resolved.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>25355</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move government business notice of motion No. 3:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That on Thursday, 28 June 2001:</para><para>	(a)	the hours of meeting shall be 9.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. to adjournment;</para><para>	(b)	consideration of general business and consideration of committee reports, government responses and Auditor-General's reports under standing order 62(1) and (2) not be proceeded with;</para><para>	(c)	the routine of business from 7.30 p.m. till the adjournment shall be government business only;</para><para>	(d)	divisions may take place after 7.30 p.m.; and</para><para>	(e)	the question for the adjournment of the Senate shall not be proposed till a motion for the adjournment is moved by a minister.</para></motion><para>I would like to very briefly address this motion and make some undertakings in relation to it. The government has a number of bills that it wants to complete prior to the adjournment of the Senate for the winter recess. They are: the bill that is currently before the Senate in the committee of the whole—that is, the <inline ref="S306">Interactive Gambling Bill 2001</inline>; the new business tax system package of bills, upon which there has been agreement among all senators that it will be dealt with at the 12.45 p.m. timeslot; the migration legislation amendment bill; the <inline ref="R1332">Health Legislation Amendment (Medical Practitioners' Qualifications and Other Measures) Bill 2001</inline>; the <inline ref="R1318">Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2001</inline>; the <inline ref="R1334">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001</inline>; the <inline ref="R1281">Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001</inline>, which I believe is now supported by all senators as a non-controversial piece of legislation to be dealt with at 12.45 p.m; the <inline ref="R1282">Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline>; the <inline ref="R1330">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2001</inline>; the <inline ref="R747">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1999</inline>; and there are some messages from the House of Representatives in relation to child support, dairy produce, the ANZFA Amendment Bill, the environment protection bill, and superannuation contributions. We are also looking for agreement in relation to the <inline ref="R1336">Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Account Bill 2001</inline>.

That sounds like a long list of bills, but a number of them are non-controversial and there has been agreement, particularly in relation to some of the messages, to handle them in an expeditious fashion. For example, I have it from Senator Robert Hill, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, that the environment bill, in particular—which I understand Senator Brown has an interest in—would be brought on only if there were broad agreement that it would be dealt with in a non-controversial style. Senator Brown is indicating that that is highly unlikely which is, of course, a huge surprise.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Therefore, the situation is that the government would like to see these bills completed by no later than midnight tonight. However, government business notice of motion No. 3 standing in my name ensures that the Senate would only come to adjournment on the motion of a minister. Our undertaking to the Senate, and the commitment we have given to all honourable senators in discussions on this issue, is that if we complete the list of bills I have just read out we would adjourn at that time. If that is prior to midnight, it would make everybody in the chamber and everyone else happy, I am sure. But if, for example, we were near to the conclusion of the final piece of business as the clock neared midnight, we would seek discussions with leaders and whips of all the parties and the Independent senators to look at extending the sitting of the Senate to a reasonable hour beyond midnight. If it were clear that the program is such that it simply would not be concluded at a reasonable hour this evening, we indicate that we would suspend the sittings and resume tomorrow afternoon after the Senate has completed its role in the swearing in of Australia's new Governor-General. I indicate and commit to that being the way the government would like to proceed with its program between now and the adjournment of these sittings. I commend this motion to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>25356</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Omit paragraph (e), substitute:</para><para>	(e)	the question for the adjournment of the Senate shall be proposed at 12 midnight.</para></quote><para>The government has just outlined its view as to what the legislative program shall be for the day. From my reading of the government's motion, the government has effectively suggested to us that we need to consider 16 bills today. </para><para>I suppose you could argue that this inevitably happens on the last day of a parliamentary session; that is, that we are asked to consider a very heavy workload in so far as the legislative program—in this case, 16 separate pieces of legislation to be considered in one day. But, on top of that, we have a situation where a considerable amount of the day's business is to be allocated to consideration of the government's legislation on broadcasting and the proposition that was before the Senate chamber with regard to Internet gaming. We have to ask ourselves why it is that we find ourselves in this situation. This is in the context whereby this opposition has agreed to an additional 150 hours of government business time over the course of the parliament. I again draw to your attention that, if we assume that is 15 hours a week, that it is the equivalent of 10 parliamentary sitting weeks to consider government business. That is an extraordinary amount of time in anyone's language. </para><para>This matter comes up every time we come to this period, and it was addressed by the opposition in discussions with the government earlier this week. We actually asked how we were going with the legislative program and, in particular, what was happening to the money bills and other bills that have start-up dates at the beginning of the financial year. The opposition has been mindful of the responsibilities of an opposition and we have been particularly mindful of the responsibilities of the government to ensure that there is reasonable consideration of the legislative program in such a way that money bills with this particular starting date are not held up. I think the opposition has been extraordinarily generous in the way in which it has approached this. It has been very reasonable and very responsible. But now we are asked to agree to a proposition to essentially sit, as the government suggests, to all hours tonight. We are told that the government understands this to mean that, come 12 o`clock tonight, we will have a bit of a discussion about whether or not we extend, and it was then said that, if that does not meet the agreement of the chamber, we will sit again tomorrow and presumably next week. </para><para>One presumes that, at some point, there has to be consideration of when we finish, but the point I am trying to raise is: is it not appropriate that the disciplines of the chamber be applied to all senators? Is it not reasonable that all senators be mindful of their responsibilities with regard to consideration of government business and opportunities being made available to express your views on pieces of legislation? I take the view that it is a principle that applies on both sides of the chamber. That is why I am suggesting that there needs to be a definite cut-off point for consideration of the legislative program, and that 12 o'clock tonight is not an unreasonable point at which to say that enough is enough. We all understand that, within that context, if a majority is available on the floor of this chamber, then of course the hours can be extended. No-one is denying that basic fact of legislative life.</para><para>What I am suggesting is that, if Senator Alston feels it necessary to attack opposition senators and, in the most provocative manner, seeks to ridicule and abuse members of the opposition, those disciplines that apply to me or any other senator should apply to Senator Alston. We have seen a quite extraordinary lack of discipline by this government when it comes to consideration of its own legislation. I think there are double standards here. We have been told that the opposition has to give and give in terms of additional hours, but the government does not seem to be able to discipline its own members as to their responsibilities in being mindful of the limited hours that are available. We in this place know that there is a capacity for the Senate to fill whatever time is available if discipline is not imposed. And year after year we see this government get worse in its capacity to manage the program—that the more time you give the government the more time it takes. </para><para>We put to the Democrats—and I understand that they may well be committed to support the government on this issue—that there has to be consideration at some point about how much time is actually given to the government. My view is that if at 12 o'clock the government still needs more time, then it is reasonable to consider it at that stage. But there has to be a limit. I think you will find that there is a great deal more attention paid to the clock if there is a limit imposed now.

My proposition to the Senate is this: the opposition has bent over backwards to facilitate a reasonable consideration of government business. What we are now saying is that there has to be a measure put on this government to enforce discipline on both sides of the chamber.

We would recommend to him that he becomes helpful. While we will be supporting the government, I think I am right in pointing out that contingent notice of motion No. 3 would actually allow us to consider the adjournment at any point. I would be interested in hearing whether or not that is correct. If Senator Alston takes notice of the advice that he is getting from senators around the chamber and if we start this off after lunch in a very cooperative manner, we ought to get through it an awful lot faster.

The opposition does not oppose the bill, although I would like to make a few comments with respect to various parts of the bill. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee last month. The Labor senators' report to the committee noted one area of deficiency in the bill that we thought required amendment, and so recommended. It is satisfying that the minister has circulated an amendment to that effect and that it has been picked up in the House. There are four different areas that the bill amends in the Broadcasting Services Act: firstly, time shifting, high definition TV broadcasts; secondly, the content of HDTV advertising; thirdly, allocation of additional commercial television licences in underserviced remote or regional markets; and, fourthly, antisiphoning arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>The bill also corrects some anomalies created by amendments made by the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Act 2000 and amends the Radiocommunications Act 1992 in relation to the issue of apparatus licences. The main area of contention that we identified in our minority report to the inquiry is the time shifting arrangements. The proposed amendments are intended to allow the broadcast of suitable demonstration HDTV content during the trading hours of HDTV retail outlets. As discussed in our minority report, these amendments do not meet the needs of their principal intended beneficiaries, the commercial free-to-air television networks.</para><para>The act presently allows the networks to engage in limited time shifted programming in relation to promotional SDTV content, but there is no similar provision for HDTV. All HDTV material is required to be simultaneously broadcast in both the SDTV and analog formats. The commercial television networks sought an amendment from the government to allow the broadcast of a 30- to 60-minute HDTV demonstration loop tape. The bill only allows the broadcast of a HDTV demo loop tape if the commercial free-to-air networks rebroadcast that tape in full in the SDTV and analog formats within seven days. The reason for requiring the rebroadcast is to prevent the commercial free-to-air stations from effectively multichannelling.</para><para>The pay television industry had no objections to the use of demonstration loop tapes in these circumstances, and they have a vested interest in preventing multichannelling. The industry, however, did express concerns about the existing provisions of the bill. In our minority report, Labor senators indicated that the opposition would support amendment of the bill to allow the free-to-air commercial networks to seek an exemption from the HDTV simulcast provisions to allow the broadcast of a 30- to 60-minute demonstration loop tape only. The government has decided to move an amendment to remedy that deficiency, and it went through the House last night with opposition support.</para><para>One final point I would like to raise is the government's failure to take the opportunity of including in this bill an amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act to remedy the datacasting regime. The government's cancellation of the datacasting spectrum auction last month was a humiliating admission that no-one wants to buy spectrum to offer the datacasting services that the government created and defined in last year's Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Act. The government's regime was so restrictive that it was unworkable, and no-one in the industry wanted to offer datacasting.</para><para>I have a couple of questions for Senator Alston on this point, which my colleague Mr Smith foreshadowed in the House. Firstly, does the government still regard datacasting as being part of the 1998 digital TV framework, and is the government still committed to the 1998 parliamentary framework? Secondly, if so, what does the government propose to do in terms of amending the datacasting regime to make datacasting viable? If the government is no longer committed to the parliamentary framework then the opposition seeks the government's assurance that it will immediately undertake a public process to ascertain industry views on the future of digital television and datacasting. The implications of these questions are important. Rumours abound that the government has plans for datacasting to become a subscription based industry. The opposition says that the parliament is entitled to know what the government's plans are for the framework that the parliament agreed to in 1998. I ask the minister to respond to those questions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>25360</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the interests of speed—and while I am sure that if I spoke to the chamber I would immediately sway everybody's opinion—I seek leave to incorporate my second reading remarks.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>As we have heard, the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill is a bill to amend several sections of the Broadcasting Services Act.</para><para>There is no central theme to the bill, and so I will discuss the Democrats position with respect to the various measures within the bill.</para><para>The bill amends the BSA to</para><para>·	firstly, allow the allocation of additional commercial television licences in two-station markets;</para><para>·	secondly, to permit the automatic de-listing of events from the anti-siphoning list;</para><para>·	thirdly, to amend the simulcast provision for high definition television broadcasts, under certain circumstances, and</para><para>·	lastly, to make minor changes to datacasting.</para><para>Commercial Television Licences</para><para>The Australian Broadcasting Authority allocates commercial television broadcasting licences. Each licence is allocated in a given licence area and no more than three licences are allocated for any given area. Licences are also allocated in accordance with the rules relating to cross media and foreign ownership.</para><para>No one licensee is permitted to own more than one licence ion a single licence area. In remote or regional licence areas, the rules may be relaxed in order that people in these areas may receive additional service, in order that they may at least be similar to the services receive in metropolitan areas.</para><para>In solus markets - areas where there is only one commercial television licence, the licensee may apply for an additional licence. In areas where there are two commercial television licences, the existing licensees must submit a joint application in order for the ABA to grant an additional licence.</para><para>While we understand that there has not been a situation where one licensee wants an additional licence and the second does not, it is considered necessary to remove the anomaly to prevent this situation arising in the future. Perhaps licences will be considered more valuable when full digital conversion takes place. The amendment, removing the requirement for a joint application for a second licence, will allow a sole service provide to apply for a licence in their own right.</para><para>In supporting this amendment, the Democrats certainly hope the outcome contributes to additional services being provide to regional, and remote or solus market, and contribute to the diversity of content currently experienced by audiences in these areas.</para><para>Anti-Siphoning Provisions</para><para>The purpose of the anti-siphoning list is to ensure that the rights to broadcast major and significant sporting events, which have traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air television, are not acquired exclusively by the pay television sector.</para><para>At the time the anti-siphoning list came into force, the parliament was of the view that audiences should continue to receive the programming for free that they had always had access to. I am sure the parliament is still unified in this position today. Following the debate which led to the list's construction in 1994, the list ended up being comprised exclusively of sporting events and are those deemed to be the most important and most significant, to audiences.</para><para>Certainly to the free-to-air broadcasters, the rights to broadcast these events also means to ensure a loyal following of audiences (and that means high ratings) and therefore higher advertising revenue.</para><para>The anti-siphoning list is attached as a schedule to the BSA and includes events such as the Melbourne Cup, selected Australian Rules Football, Rugby League, Rugby Union, Cricket, Soccer, Tennis, Netball, Basketball, Golf and Motor Sports.</para><para>A pay television operator wishing to televise an event on the antisiphoning list must wait until a free-to-air network acquires the rights. As there is no dual rights system, the pay television sector cannot broadcast that event live, unless the free-to-air network gives its permission. </para><para>Pay television operators may acquire the rights to an event if the event is removed from the anti-siphoning list.</para><para>However, events are automatically de-listed one week after the event has occurred.</para><para>It should also be noted that there is no obligation on the free-to-air television sector to broadcast events that they acquire the rights to. There are also provisions within the Act which relate to antihoarding.</para><para>The Australian Broadcasting Authority is currently undertaking a review of the anti-siphoning list and is due to report to the Minister on 30 June. The Democrats understand that the ABA's review does not impact on the amendments to this bill, as the ABA's inquiry relates to the composition of the list, rather than the process of acquiring the rights, as these amendments do.</para><para>While the list currently contains only sporting events - and most of these male sporting events - it would be nice to see recommendations to include a greater number of women's sporting events, and even events of national significance - like the opening of parliament, for example. I'm sure that is an event everyone in this chamber would think suitably significant. It would even be encouraging to think that theatrical or cultural events were deemed important enough drawcards by the commercial free-to-air broadcasters to have these included on the list too.</para><para>The Productivity Commission's inquiry into Broadcasting, tabled last year, also discusses the anti-siphoning list and related issues. The Productivity Commission's report - to which we are awaiting the Government's response - states that several submissions to it about the operation of the anti-siphoning regime found it cumbersome and lengthy.</para><para>The Productivity Commission found that the anti-siphoning provisions were anti-competitive and that there were costs across the industry which outweighed the benefits of the list. I'm not sure I necessarily agree with this assessment, so I am pleased to see that at the end of its assessment, the Productivity Commission agreed that at least some form of regulation is required.</para><para>The Democrats certainly agree with this assessment. We do not think this is something the industry can, at this point in time, self regulate. We are strongly of the view that regulation is required.</para><para>I think it is fair to sat in this instance that the amendments to the BSA in this bill are the Government's response to at least this section of the Productivity Commission report.</para><para>We should further note, however, that the amendments presented in this Bill relate to only to the de-listing, or removal, of events from the anti-siphoning list. The amendments do not challenge the existence of the list itself, nor do they propose any change to the composition of the list. Rightfully, these matters are subject to inquiry in 2003.</para><para>The amendments before the Senate will mean that events can be removed from the list 6 weeks before the start of an event, unless the minister declares otherwise. Naturally, at least one of the free-to-air broadcasters will have to have been offered the rights to the events before the process of delisting commences.</para><para>The Democrats believe this provides enough of a safety measure for the free-to-airs networks. As was pointed out during the Senate committee inquiry into the Bill a couple of weeks ago, that commercial realities would dictate that the rights to all these events would be negotiated far in advance of the six week cut off period. From the rights-holders point of view, they too would want the certainty that their event was to be broadcast and that a commercial return would be maximised.</para><para>Certainly from the evidence provided to the committee, I am firmly of the view that no right holders would hold out negotiations, but would want their event scheduled well in advance, and, as I say, to have their commercial returns maximised.</para><para>Finally, I wish to turn my attention to the amendments dealing with high definition television simulcasts. The bill allows the free-to-air broadcasters to broadcast high definition programming, which is on a 30 to 60 minutes loop tape” to be exempt from the simulcast provisions.</para><para>The idea behind this motion is to encourage consumer take-up of digital television by allowing the broadcast of segments of high definition programs compiled into a loop-tape in order that consumers can see and compare high definition television with standard digital or analogue television. Obviously, such material would not be suited to broadcast for ordinary programming and therefore the simulcast exemption is required.</para><para>We have assurances as I will be asking the minister additional questions about this in the committee stage, that these amendments will not permit de-facto multichannelling. The Democrats sought clarification of this issue in our additional comments to the Senate Committee report. The changes the Government has made to the bill in this regard, making the broadcast of the demonstration material more clearly defined, so I'm pretty sure that they will not result in any de-facto multichannelling.</para><para>Perhaps this is something the reviews into digital television will examine when the time comes in three years time.</para><para>Finally, there is a small amendment changing the definition of foreign language news services in the datacasting regime to include foreign news and current affairs programming. This means that datacasting service providers, when they eventually begin services in Australia, will be able to provide news and current affairs bulletins in foreign languages. I think this amendment will most obviously suit the SBS in the immediate term, and possibly other service providers in the longer term, and therefore the Democrats will support this small change.</para><para>In closing, the Democrats view these amendments as being favourable to Australian audiences and will monitor closely, the changes to both the anti-siphoning list and the HDTV amendments to ensure that Australian audiences truly benefit.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>25362</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a very powerful example set by Senator Bourne, and I find it irresistibly attractive.

The clear advantage of these avenues is that they may be employed at any time rather than be determined by a statutory framework that may not be useful or appropriate.</para></talk.start><para>There are two avenues which might be called self-help options for affected parties to bring their concerns regarding the operation of automatic delisting promptly to the attention of the minister. Firstly, provisions within the government's current bill provide for the free-to-air broadcasters to alert the minister to any instance where they have not had a reasonable opportunity to obtain broadcasting rights to a listed event. Proposed subsections 115(1AA) and 115(1AB) of the new provisions allow the minister to override automatic delisting if satisfied that one or more free-to-air broadcasters have been denied this reasonable opportunity. Affected parties can also bring any concerns regarding the operation of the antisiphoning regime to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, which is required to monitor and report to the minister on the operation of the BSA under section 158(n) of the act.</para><para>However, the ABA's functions in relation to the antisiphoning provisions go further. The ABA is charged specifically with monitoring the operation of the antisiphoning provisions under a ministerial direction issued in 1996 under section 162 of the act. This direction requires the ABA to report to the minister in a timely and comprehensive manner if it considers that the minister should be made aware of matters pertaining to the operation of the antisiphoning rules. This can include advising the minister of any problems arising with the new automatic delisting provisions, including matters brought to the attention of the ABA by the affected parties.</para><para>In addition to these self-help avenues, the ABA's reporting functions in respect of the anti-siphoning provisions mean that the ABA itself may initiate a report for the minister where it identifies a problem. It should be noted that the ABA is well placed to monitor the provisions in the course of enforcing compliance with the anti-siphoning regime. Of course, the minister has discretion to order a review of the anti-siphoning provisions at any time if it is considered that there may be problems with their operation. For example, recently I responded to concerns that some events on the anti-siphoning list were not being shown consistently by free-to-air broadcasters by directing the ABA under section 171 of the act to conduct a review of the events on the anti-siphoning list. That report is due by 30 June this year. </para><para>As I have said, the advantages of these approaches is that their timing is flexible so we can respond to any problems as they arise. A statutory review of the automatic delisting provisions within two years would be inflexible and unlikely to prove helpful. The broadcasting rights for many of the popular events on the anti-siphoning list are held by broadcasters on long-term deals over many years. For example, broadcasting rights for the AFL were recently sold on a five-year deal. It is also notable that these rights were negotiated more than a year before they actually became available. The rights to major sporting events are offered for sale infrequently, and it is unlikely that a review within the short span of two years could adequately assess the operation of the provisions or make useful conclusions about their effectiveness.</para><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>25363</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Alston</inline>) read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMMIGRATION DETAINEES) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25363</page.no><id.no>R1283</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>25363</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 27 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Minchin</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>25363</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Whilst the <inline ref="R1283">Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill 2001</inline> is being debated in a so-called non-controversial part of the day, it is anything but non-controversial. I think that point needs to be made. As I think would be fairly obvious, anything to do with immigration detention in this country at the moment would be clearly labelled as controversial. Indeed, the fact that it is being debated at this time should not be seen as an indication that the Democrats are supportive of the bill because we are not supportive of the bill. I think that point needs to be made clearly as well. It is unfortunate in a way that a bill of such significance in terms of the principle behind it is being rushed through in amongst many other bills on the final day of the sitting of this session, but that, of course, unfortunately, is not unusual either in relation to bills significant and not so significant.</para></talk.start><para>The bill as it originally stood sought to introduce a number of provisions with a number of new offences. It seeks to introduce a new criminal offence for detainees who manufacture, possess, use or distribute weapons or who are found to be in possession of anything that may reasonably be suspected of being able to be used or intended to be used for the purposes of being a weapon. So anything that is perceived as being able to be used as a weapon is able to be confiscated, and it is an offence for the detainee to possess it. </para><para>The bill also seeks to increase the maximum penalty for the offence of escaping from detention from two years imprisonment to five years imprisonment, bringing that penalty into line with that outlined for the same offence in the Crimes Act. It also seeks to provide extra powers for screening and searching people who are visiting detention centres. In its original form it also provided powers for delegates of the minister to strip search detainees and people in detention centres. I note that that provision of the bill has now been removed by amendment in the lower house and introduced separately as a new bill. I think it was introduced in the House of Representatives yesterday. So we are not dealing with powers for guards to be able to strip search detainees, and that at least is a welcome thing. It removes probably the most objectionable part of the legislation. </para><para>Nonetheless, the legislation as it stands is still unacceptable to the Democrats for two key reasons. Firstly, as most Australians are now clearly aware, the operation and running of our detention centres and the level of scrutiny and accountability for what happens in our detention centres are clearly inadequate, and to pass any legislation which increases the powers in any way of people running detention centres or increases penalties for detainees is completely inappropriate at a time when our whole system of mandatory detention, in the Democrats' view, is being shown to be clearly not functioning. </para><para>The second reason why the Democrats are opposed to the bill is that it reinforces the fiction, and unfortunately the widespread perception, that people who are in immigration detention are criminals. By bringing in offences and bringing them into line with offences in the criminal code, in the Crimes Act, it reinforces and equates detainees with convicted criminals. They are not only not convicted criminals; they are not even people charged with a crime. Unfortunately, a number of people in the community—indeed, a number of politicians—are now willing to use the false label of `criminals' to apply to asylum seekers who are in detention. </para><para>Some asylum seekers are not in detention and some are. Those who arrive on an authorised visa—perhaps on a student visa, a visitor visa or any other type of visa—and then seek asylum are able to have their claim assessed while they are in the general community, even after the time frame of their original visa has expired. That occurs frequently with many people on a day-to-day basis without any threat to the community and without any general problem. Yet, if people arrive without authorisation, they are detained indefinitely—sometimes for extremely long periods, stretching into years—in part because, supposedly, they are a threat to the community and will abscond and disappear into the general community if they are not locked away. The falsehood of that is shown by the fact that many asylum seekers who are in the community do not disappear and are able to be located, and the system functions well. Clearly, detaining asylum seekers who arrive unauthorised is a punitive approach. It is deliberately punitive and the minister has said many times that it is a punitive measure to detain people indefinitely, despite the fact that they are not convicted of or charged with anything and that many of them are seeking asylum and protection from persecution. Many of them are recognised as such by our legal system and then released.</para><para>The Democrats oppose the practice of compulsory, mandatory, indefinite, ongoing detention of unauthorised arrivals. Therefore, we oppose any measures that seek to extend those offences with which people are charged. Despite the Democrats' opposition to detention centres, they exist and will continue to exist in the foreseeable future because the policy of mandatory, indefinite, compulsory detention is supported not just by the coalition but by the Labor opposition. Unfortunately, we will have detention centres in their current form until sufficient community pressure can be built to change that policy. In that circumstance, people who are in detention should be charged with offences if they break the law, in the same way as everyone else in the community should be charged, but they should not be equivalent to criminals, as the <inline ref="R1283">Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill 2001</inline> seeks to do. We think that is a poor principle which compounds the poor principle of mandatory detention.</para><para>We believe that asylum seekers are not a threat to be held at bay. They are a group of people who should be assessed properly and in many cases should not be in detention, and the criminal code type provisions should not be applied to people who have not been convicted of anything. It is worth reminding the Senate that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission found in reviewing a previous case that a detainee had been held in a remand centre or prison without trial, after attempting an escape. That has occurred in the past and it is on the record and documented by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Again, that is an example of how the overall approach to detainees is already overly harsh and punitive. We should not be extending penalties even further when the adequacy of our system is clearly not up to scratch.</para><para>There have been any number of allegations of inappropriate treatment of detainees by centre staff and guards. Indeed, there are allegations of physical abuse at Villawood Detention Centre in April, which are currently under investigation by the New South Wales police. The government and the opposition say that there is adequate opportunity for complaints to be investigated by the Ombudsman or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Democrats believe that there is not an adequate opportunity, that it is not sufficiently transparent and that they are not sufficiently empowered or resourced to perform that type of role.</para><para>In the specific case of people who have made allegations of assault at Villawood, despite the fact that police investigations are ongoing, there has been application by the government to deport a couple of those people before police investigations are complete and the allegations have been fully tested. The government is saying that, if the police need the people to stay, they can apply for criminal justice visas, but they are not the only ones. My advice is that the Attorney-General can also apply for those visas. The Democrats believe that the Attorney-General should do that to ensure that people are in the country until the investigation is complete. It is not a matter of judging the adequacy of their asylum claims; it is a matter of ensuring that people who allege they have been assaulted have the opportunity to have their allegations properly investigated and not be involved in some sort of lottery where it depends on whether or not they are able to remain in the country while those investigations are under way, particularly where such assaults are alleged to have happened when people are being deprived of their liberty.</para><para>The Democrats do not support the general principle of the bill. I note the amendments moved in the House of Representatives by Mr Theophanous, an Independent. Those amendments were supported by the Democrats. I could have moved similar amendments in this chamber and was of a mind to do so but, as in the House of Representatives, the bill has been put through the Senate reasonably quickly. While we are opposed to the bill, we recognise that both Labor and the coalition support it. We are not seeking to frustrate the will of the parliament by holding up debate on the bill but, on behalf of the Democrats, I indicate our support for amendments such as those moved by Mr Theophanous and that, if there had been longer debate and the bill had laid on the table a bit longer, I probably would have circulated similar amendments.</para><para>The Democrats oppose the bill for the reasons I have outlined. We welcome the fact that the government has taken out the specific provisions to do with empowering delegates to strip search detainees, although, as I said earlier, those provisions are now the subject of a separate bill in the House of Representatives. If it does come to the Senate, the Democrats will oppose that as well at a time when we have people across the political spectrum in Australia from human rights groups, refugee groups and people such as Malcolm Fraser, the Democrats and even the Labor opposition calling for an independent inquiry into what happens in our detention centres. It seems incongruous to the Democrats that on the one hand there is call for an inquiry into detention centres in recognition of the fact that they are not being run adequately and that there is not adequate transparency, yet on the other hand we are passing legislation to increase penalties against detainees. That seems incongruous to me and is not a desirable approach. In the circumstances, I will leave it at that and put on the record again our opposition to the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>25365</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset, I thank all senators who have contributed to the debate on this matter. The <inline ref="R1283">Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill 2001</inline> is an integral part of a range of strategies being introduced by the government to promote safety and security at immigration detention centres. The measures in this bill will introduce new offences and penalties relating to the behaviour of immigration detainees in immigration detention centres. It also will provide for additional security measures for visitors seeking to enter immigration detention centres. The new offence of `manufacturing, possessing, using or distributing a weapon' will address the increasing problem of detainees fashioning weapons from materials obtained within immigration detention centres. These objects represent a serious danger to detainees, staff and other persons in detention centres—and some recent examples of this have given rise to these measures. The increased penalty for escaping from immigration detention seeks to provide a more effective deterrent against escape. Finally, the security measures for visitors entering immigration detention centres will seek to ensure that items that could disrupt the good order, safety and security of those facilities are not brought in.</para></talk.start><para>I would also like to comment briefly on several matters raised by senators during the debate. Firstly, there has been some aspect of mandatory detention of unlawful non-citiz-ens being raised in this debate—and, although this is a tough measure, it is a fair one. It has bipartisan support and was first introduced by the Labor government in 1992. Opposition senators have called for a judicial inquiry into immigration detention and disturbances that have been occurring recently. Australia's immigration detention facilities are already subject to high levels of scrutiny and have been the subject of numerous reports. In fact, these reports and inquiries have included parliamentary committees, the Commonwealth Ombuds-man and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Also, there is the Immigration Detention Advisory Group, which was established in February this year and which has unfettered access to all detention centres in monitoring the adequacy and appropriateness of facilities, services and accommodation. Given this high level of scrutiny, the government believes that there is no need for a judicial inquiry.</para><para>Senator Schacht, during the debate, made some remarks implying that not all persons were treated equally by immigration law and policy. He claimed that the only reason the Kosovars were granted temporary safe haven in Australia was that they were white, Caucasian and from Europe. This is not the case, and the government emphatically rejects this argument. The Migration Act and migration regulations are applied fairly and without discrimination as to race or national origin. The Kosovars were brought to Australia in response to a call by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. Australia also responded in a similar way for persons who were in a similar situation in East Timor in late 1999.</para><para>Senator Schacht also referred to the unanimous report of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. A great deal has been said about this report and I will not repeat it here. But what I will say is that the Senate should remember that there has been criticism of aspects of this report from a wide sector, including members of the opposition. In fact, I think it was Senator McKiernan, who has had a longstanding interest in immigration matters, who expressed concerns about some elements of that report. I believe that what we have in relation to that report is certainly not a unanimous view across the community.</para><para>This is a bill that is needed. It is a fair bill. It deals with people who are held in detention for necessary reasons. As I have said, this has been a longstanding policy and has had bipartisan support. It is not possible to equate this sort of detention with the criminal jurisdiction, and I appreciate the comments that Senator Cooney made during the course of this debate. But here we have a situation where people are alleged to have entered Australia unlawfully and it is necessary for them to be detained until their status can be determined—and that is something, as I say, which has been the policy of the Australian government for some time. I commend this bill to the Senate, and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PASSENGER MOVEMENT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25366</page.no><id.no>R1318</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>25366</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 27 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tambling</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>25367</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will be tabling a number of amendments to the <inline ref="R1318">Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2001</inline> which we believe are in the best interests of the Australian tourism industry. The Australian Democrats have worked closely with the tourism industry, especially the export side of the industry, for a number of years. We appreciate that tourism is our fourth largest export earning industry, contributing 4½ per cent of GDP annually. I think what is often forgotten in this debate is that the tourism industry directly employs about six per cent of the Australian work force. In that sense, it provides many jobs for young people and particularly for people living in regional areas. It delivers nearly $13 billion in foreign exchange earnings each year, and of course that sum is still growing. In fact, the industry's current five million visitors annually is set to increase to 10 million by the year 2010, and 20 million by the year 2020. </para></talk.start><para>This is a phenomenal growth, and it has come about with modest amounts of government investment—which is why I want to talk about this legislation. In fact, the government has been winding back the amount of money it allocates to the international promotional and marketing side of the industry, particularly that which is undertaken by the Australian Tourist Commission. Whilst the ATC's budget was boosted in the lead-up to the Olympics last year in Sydney, the commission saw its funding base decline as a result of funding cutbacks and, of course, the steep decline in the buying power of the Australian dollar overseas.</para><para>Whilst the government has continued to claim that the ATC is currently receiving record funding, in actual fact when you look at inflation and the value of the Australian dollar, the buying power itself is actually $22 million lower than it was five years ago. In effect, it means that the Australian Tourist Commission finds itself in a position of having to look at which overseas markets it will cease to run promotional campaigns in. It has had to determine what its absolute core markets are and where it simply cannot afford to stop advertising Australia as a holiday destination. The handful of countries, mostly in Europe and North America, will essentially be the backbone of the tourism industry market over the next few years. We will all just have to pray that other emerging and fledgling markets will continue to grow of their own accord or as a result of the very hard work of individual operators in the tourism industry who continue to promote themselves overseas.</para><para>I see this as a simply massive opportunity that was missed. In September last year, the eyes of three billion people were on Australia for two weeks during the Sydney Olympic Games; the value of that international attention is virtually incalculable. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on the momentum brought about by good planning leading up to the Olympics and what has happened since that time. Yet only a matter of weeks ago in the 2001-02 budget, the Tourist Commission lost $3 million in supplementary funding and is due to lose a further $10 million per annum in the 2002-03 budget, according to the Tourism Task Force. Perhaps this is something that the minister may consider responding to.</para><para>On top of this, the tourism industry learnt that it would single-handedly generate the pool of funds to prevent the entry of foot-and-mouth disease into Australia and that this would be achieved by the government increasing the cost of the passenger movement charge by nearly 30 per cent to $38 per person. The initiative as proposed by the government fails to reflect the impact that would have on the tourism industry itself. The rise will reduce Australia's price competitiveness, add additional recovery costs for airlines and cruise companies and provide no assistance for the industry to promote Australia's clean and green image on the back of the initiative.</para><para>Whilst the tourism industry is the first to acknowledge that it would suffer enormously if Australia's clean and green image were smeared or indeed destroyed by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, it does not believe it should be the only industry tackling what is essentially an agricultural issue as much as it is a potential tourism issue. Perhaps if the government had softened the blow of this tax hike on the industry and allocated a portion of the funds generated from the foot-and-mouth prevention scheme to the ATC, the Australian Democrats would not be seeking to move any amendment, nor would we have difficulties in supporting what the government proposes.</para><para>However, we know that the Tourist Commission currently receives no direct benefit from the passenger movement charge. In fact, a report from the Australian National Audit Office states on page 13 that the passenger movement charge is now applied partly as a general revenue raising source and is no longer solely linked to cost recovery or Customs, immigration and quarantine services. This has been confirmed by the Attorney-General in his answer to a question on notice, and indeed the Attorney-General stated that he is not considering any proposal to change these arrangements. Furthermore, the Board of Airline Representatives recently went on the public record with the accusation that about $20 million in revenue from the PMC is not being spent on border control services. This is an accusation that does warrant further detailed investigation and is a matter that the Australian Democrats want to see resolved to the satisfaction of the tourism industry itself.</para><para>As I stated earlier, the Australian Democrats have been working closely with the peak organisations of the Australian tourism industry, and it is their advice to us that underpins the amendments that we seek to move today. So we call on the Senate to support our amendment to schedule 1, section 6 of the bill, which in essence proposes an increase in the cost of the PMC from $38 to $40. We are advocating this because it will generate an estimated annual revenue of $16 million which would enable some direct financial returns to flow back to the tourism industry and the ATC.</para><para>I am well aware that this is a matter that has to be dealt with as a request from the Senate to the House of Representatives, but it is an amendment that would ensure there was no watering down of the government's proposed foot-and-mouth program, as the tourism industry appreciates the importance of being able to retain the integrity of the measure. I think it would also, in the opinion of the industry, offset the disadvantages to the industry as a result of an increase in the passenger movement charge. The Australian Democrats appreciate that we are not able to amend a bill imposing a tax, as provided by section 53 of the Constitution, but we are not prevented from seeking to move some of our amendments to this bill as a request of the government. Perhaps it is something that the minister may wish to consider. This is wholly in accordance with precedents of the Senate, and our other amendments are therefore in the form of a second reading amendment.</para><para>The Tourism Task Force and the Australian Tourism Export Council have both called on the Democrats to recommend to the government that $15 million of the passenger movement charge be allocated to the Tourist Commission to fund its promotional and marketing budget. That would allow the estimated $72 million generated by the government's $8 increase in the PMC to be allocated to the Australian Customs Service, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to increase their inspections of passengers and their luggage, mail and cargo at airports as part of the government's foot-and-mouth disease prevention measures.</para><para>The Australian Democrats will move a second reading amendment calling on the Senate to make the collection of the passenger movement charge commissionable to travel agents. The Australian Federation of Travel Agents, the Tourism Task Force and the Tourism Export Council have all advocated this reform measure on the basis that the current regime is overly complex and costly. Some overseas travel agents do not always apply the charge to tickets sold, and we believe that efficiency improvements are possible in other areas. Faced with a similar situation, the Singaporean government recently made the collection of their departure tax commissionable to travel agents. They are already seeing the benefits in a much more efficient and effective system. They have also noted an improvement in compliance figures.</para><para>The measures that are addressed in the amendments that the Australian Democrats will move today should have all been addressed by the government as part of a long-term strategy to ensure that we have the most efficient and competitive tourism industry possible. Instead, the government has made a half-hearted attempt to address one issue—foot-and-mouth disease—in isolation of the needs of the tourism industry itself. Furthermore, the government has sought to address it a matter of weeks out from the budget being handed down, missing the opportunity to deal with what I regard as a range of outstanding matters concerning the Australian tourism industry, let alone the question of jobs and particularly jobs in regional Australia. This kind of policy making on the run is not in the best interests of our tourism industry and therefore not in the best interests of our economy, let alone the country itself.</para><para>In tabling these amendments, I put the government and the opposition on notice that we will be using every opportunity in future to ensure that these outstanding matters are addressed. The levels of government funding to the ATC must be significantly increased in the immediate future to ensure that we take full advantage of the amazing opportunity that our tourism industry has before it. The type of coverage that we got during the Olympic Games is the type of advertising and marketing that you cannot pay for and yet we are missing an opportunity to capitalise on the way that the image of Australia has been projected abroad. </para><para>Similarly, the issue of how the government spends moneys in relation to the passenger movement charge has been raised again today for that very reason. Transparency and accountability as to how these funds are spent must be assured. We believe that the Australian tourism industry, which generates the money, should reap a significant portion of the rewards. These funds should not be disappearing into consolidated revenue. The tourism industry should be given some kind of idea about how long the government intends to collect tax to fund a foot-and-mouth prevention strategy as well as some indication of how these funds will be allocated once the possibility of a foot-and-mouth outbreak passes. The minister may wish also to respond to that. The Australian Democrats will continue to call for a solution that will make the collection of the passenger movement charge commissionable to Australian travel agents and will deal with the current inefficiencies in this area.

This increase was announced by the Treasurer in this year's budget. It will fund increased passenger processing costs as part of Australia's response to the increased threat of the introduction of exotic pests and diseases, particularly foot-and-mouth disease.</para></talk.start><para>The passenger movement charge, which is imposed on the departure of a person from Australia, is collected by airlines and shipping companies at the time of ticket sales and then remitted to the Commonwealth in accordance with arrangements entered into under section 10 of the Passenger Movement Charge Collection Act 1978. It is worth while remembering that this fee is collected by the airlines and shipping companies. Because of the nature of the airline industry, where tickets for travel are sold up to 12 months in advance the increase will only apply to tickets sold on or after 1 July 2001.</para><para>Senators Schacht and McLucas raised questions about whether all of the $8 increase in the passenger movement charge will be spent on increased screening for foot-and-mouth disease and other exotic pests and diseases. The $8 increase is expected to raise $279 million over four years. Over that period, the costs of Customs and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service increasing quarantine inspections for air passengers only will be $283 million. So the money raised from this will fall some $4 million short of matching the cost of quarantine for airline passengers. All of the increased revenue will be used to offset the costs of Customs and AQIS for increased inspections for these airline passengers. It will not be used for mail and cargo inspections—I make that clear.</para><para>Senator Ridgeway on behalf of the Democrats raised a number of issues. He raised the question: what will we do with this when the threat of foot-and-mouth has passed? We have a program in place for four years and I believe that is an appropriate period of time to look at this. We will make a decision as to what to do with this measure. The government, from the information we have from the overseas experience and the great threat that foot-and-mouth poses to Australia, believe that the course of action that has been taken is entirely appropriate. We would reject any assertion that this is a half-hearted attempt at dealing with foot-and-mouth. It is the most comprehensive action taken by any government in relation to quarantine at the border. As a result of that increased inspection and scrutiny there will of course be other effects, including increased rate of detection of illicit drugs and other prohibited substances.</para><para>I now turn to the second reading amendment proposed by Senator Ridgeway on behalf of the Democrats. Paragraph (a) of that amendment calls for the charge to be commissionable, thereby encouraging overseas travel agents to comply with the charge regime. The issue of commission is a matter between the airline and the agent who sells the ticket. There are international agreements through the International Air Transport Association that cover the rules for the sale of airline tickets. Under the IATA rules, charges and taxes are not commissionable. The Australian government does not have the jurisdiction to require a foreign airline to pay commission to a foreign travel agent. We would have to rely on the foreign airline's cooperation to achieve that and, as has been said earlier, that is a matter between the airline and the travel agent. As an example, in a transaction between a travel agent in Italy who is selling a ticket on Lauda Air, a company based in Austria, for travel to and from Australia we would not have the jurisdiction but would have to rely on the cooperation of the travel agent and the airline. That is the reason why there are international agreements covering the sale of tickets. No single jurisdiction would be able to cover the details of these transactions.</para><para>There is a high level of compliance by travel agents under the charge regime. A recent report by the Australian National Audit Office indicated the Australian Customs Service collected 98 per cent of the expected revenue from the passenger movement charge. There is no evidence that any extra encouragement is required to increase compliance. At that level, you would have to agree that there is no reason for this. A commission rate of, say, 10 per cent would cost the Australian community around $30 million a year. That is $30 million that could not be spent on fighting foot-and-mouth disease. Why would the Australian taxpayer want to pay a commission to foreign travel agents when they do no additional work to collect the charge, which is just built into the price of the ticket? We would be forgoing that 10 per cent which could equate to $30 million that could be spent in Australia on fighting foot-and-mouth.</para><para>With respect to point (b) of the second reading amendment, I make the point that foot-and-mouth measures will also benefit the tourism industry. One only has to look at the examples overseas, particularly the United Kingdom. Tourism has suffered greatly as a result of the crisis with foot-and-mouth in that country. The tourism industry in Australia has more than a vested interest in Australia remaining clean and green, and in particular free from foot-and-mouth disease. Foot-and-mouth disease would be absolutely catastrophic for a country like Australia. One can only imagine the nightmare that would develop if foot-and-mouth gained a hold in Australia. In this particular instance, these measures are entirely appropriate.</para><para>In bringing about these measures, the government does not want to make any increase any greater than is needed. What was assessed as needed was what we have put in place. It was worked out that an $8 increase was appropriate. I believe that there is no reason to increase the amount of $8. That increase in the passenger movement charge will be sufficient for us to maintain an appropriate—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—Can't you incorporate this?

It is really the main item dealt with in this legislation, and that is the sunset clause. I can deal more fully with pathology collection centres in the committee stage. </para></talk.start><para>I put the sunset clause into this legislation in 1996 to make sure that we could monitor the impact of the new requirement, which was for general practitioners to train as general practitioners. All other medical specialties have a period of training after basic medical school requirements have been met. In 1996 the government's wish was to bring GP training in line with that, and we supported that. Now I would argue it is time to ensure that general practice stays in line with that requirement. It is time to ensure that general practice will be in the future treated as a specialty in its own right—treated as a specific and important area of medical practice that does need dedicated training. </para><para>From the ALP speech in the second reading debate last night and from their amendments, I understand that the Labor Party want to avoid fully debating this issue at this time. Their proposed amendments would see the sunset clause extended for yet another year. Basically, they would delay all of this and keep everybody happy—keep the AMA happy—until a convenient time after the next election. But I am not quite sure, looking at what they plan to do, whether people will be terribly happy. As I will say in a minute, we have been through the various organisations interested in this legislation, and most of them do want us to make a decision, and make a decision now. </para><para>Let us go back for a moment to 1996 and the doomsday predictions that were about then on the legislative changes. They really did scare many of the young medical students who were at that stage studying. It was a scare campaign run by the AMA, and it very much involved the Labor Party. They talked of hundreds of unemployed student doctors, of student doctors and doctors having to work as taxidrivers and of a shortage of training places. Fortunately, the scare campaign did not work, because the legislation got through, but also very fortunately it was proved to be nothing more than that—a scare campaign. None of that has come to fruition. Those scare campaigns were completely unfounded. </para><para>Even more important now is that many of those who lobbied us and said to us, `Don't pass this legislation' now have come back to us and said, `We don't want to go back to the pre-1996 days. We actually want general practice to be treated as a specialty in its own right.' These organisations include the AMA, although, as I will say later, and certainly at the committee stage, they are not completely happy with removing the sunset clause. The Australian Medical Students Association have lined up with them. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Australian Divisions of General Practice, the Confederation of Postgraduate Medical Education Councils, the GP Registrars Association and the General Practice Partnership Advisory Council basically want us to have it over and done with and make our decision now.</para><para>The Democrats' 1996 amendments ensured that today's debate could actually take place—and take place on the basis of an informed level of decision making, on the basis of real information being provided. What I put in that legislation was a medical training review panel. We are very pleased to say that the government has now changed its original intent in this new bill and is going to fully support the retention of the Medical Training Review Panel. From my years as Democrat health spokesperson, I think this is one of my key achievements. It is essential that we know who is being trained, which colleges they are being trained in, how many women are getting opportunities and how many people are training part time. I am not saying it is all solved, by any means: there are still problems, and I will deal with those in the committee stage. Who is training, or who is getting into the colleges, and who is actually passing are issues we still have to deal with. But I am very pleased to see the way in which the Medical Training Review Panel has worked. </para><para>In stark contrast to Labor's opposition back then, and now their delaying tactics, the Democrats have spent the past three years working with government and industry to encourage proposals which would assist in alleviating problems related to medical work force issues. </para><para>In terms of opportunities for medical trainees and new graduates to experience general practice before they make the decision as to whether or not they are going to train in that area, there are opportunities now. This is the major stumbling block for the AMA. I understand their concerns. We are not walking away from this issue; it stays alive under our amendments. But there is a range of opportunities now for new doctors to experience this. They can go out into the Rural and Remote Area Placement Program. That now has 100 places and provides an avenue through which they can have three months and get GP experience while on rotation from hospitals. This program got $3 million for its implementation and over three years will involve 20 pilot sites across Australia. It is a link to either rural general practice or rural hospitals.</para><para>Secondly, there is the Rural Locum Relief and the Approved Medical Deputising Services programs. These also provide avenues through which experience can be gained by new doctors in a rural environment. While not specifically focusing on providing a substitute for postgraduate training, these programs do allow junior doctors to gain a better understanding of general practice. Concerns have been raised regarding the level of supervision in these programs, and we can address that in the committee stage later.</para><para>General work experience placements are also available, as they are for teachers and for nurses. There are some issues relating to this, and again we can go through this in the committee stage, to look at how voluntary work can be linked in with the clinics and the doctors' practices that are prepared to provide that. Indeed, I am confident that many community health services, small general practices and community general practices will be keen to share their knowledge and experience with young, or indeed older, graduates—any new graduates. There is a need to better coordinate this.</para><para>I am also very pleased to see the government's commitment to the AMWAC longitudinal study of medical graduates' attitudes to training and career choices, and that work has also been undertaken on the shortage of doctors in 24-hour clinics and deputising services. The government has provided $20 million for reforming general practice with a view to encouraging practice amalgamations, and we must see this funding continue.</para><para>Some flexibility has also been provided in the recruitment by deputising services of doctors who are subject to provider number restrictions. These services must already provide close supervision of these doctors; they must offer them support. That is another area we will need to come back to in the committee stage. There has also been significant progress on addressing the staffing pressures experienced by private hospitals' accident and emergency units. In negotiations with the College of Accident and Emergency Medicine and the Australian Private Hospitals Association, the government has developed guidelines for an approved private emergency department program, and that will hopefully be released very shortly.</para><para>All of these initiatives contribute significantly to improving the quality of GP training and reducing doctor shortages. We have tried at all times to work cooperatively with government, while keeping a very close eye on what they are doing and the outcomes. We have had some discussions with the government regarding this particular piece of legislation and we will be moving a batch of amendments. In particular, I am keen to see that the Medical Training Review Panel is formally retained and, with this in mind, that is one of the key amendments we propose.</para><para>We want to continue a two-year independent review of the provider number restrictions and require the holding of a junior doctors summit within three months of the tabling of the independent review in parliament. This is to be hosted by the panel, and I have amendments dealing with that—presumably later this afternoon or tonight we will get to those. The Democrats believe that it is important to retain oversight mechanisms relating to the provider number restrictions so as to ensure that there is continual improvement in the system. We also believe quite strongly that students need to be more actively involved in the actual process of planning their futures as fully qualified doctors. I believe that a junior doctors summit will alleviate some of the pressure and the problems that junior doctors are experiencing, particularly as many of them feel at the moment that they are unheard. That will be an opportunity for them to have their voices heard.</para><para>We have also gained from the government a commitment to actively monitor some of the concerns raised by those in the medical industry during the course of the debate over the provider number legislation. These include better monitoring of the demand for places in the rural and remote area placement program. I think there could well be an opportunity to expand this. I understand that it is already facing some vacancies that are unfilled, but there needs to be better monitoring. As well, we are keen for the government to be actively monitoring the adequacy of the supervision arrangements in the Rural Locum Relief and Approved Medical Deputising Services programs and we will need to discuss in detail the Labor amendments in this area. We believe, in brief, that a strict legislative regime could actually see fewer—indeed, in some cases no—doctors available and we believe an oversight approach would achieve a lot more. We are very keen to facilitate better work experience outcomes for junior doctors, as I said, and this will again be dealt with later.</para><para>The government has agreed to examine with state and territory governments the feasibility of establishing formal structures which would link those general practices offering to support voluntary work experience placements with the junior doctors wanting to undertake them. We also would support further investigation of the possibility of direct grants to supervising GP practices to compensate them for the costs of taking on a junior trainee as part of a hospital rotation. Also I think we need to look at some funding for the hospitals to ensure that they can release junior doctors—in other words, some compensation—but this will need to be negotiated with the states and territories.</para><para>In summary, we will be supporting the full removal of the sunset clause—not delaying this debate again, but making it clear that we do not want to risk at all going back to the pre-1996 days of general practice basically being a situation where you could go and hang up a shingle without any specialist training. Given the timing of a potential election, to see this legislation not dealt with in this sitting was also a considerable risk—a risk that we may never have got to the sunset clause before we actually had it lapsing. As for the pathology sections of this bill, I will deal with all of that in the committee stage of the debate. </para><para>I just finish my comments by saying that we are very pleased to have been vindicated in relation to our initial decision to support this legislation. We are not saying, however, that there are not some problems. We still have some way to go before we have anything like sufficient doctors in rural areas and, indeed, quite a way to go before we have sufficient doctors in many of our outer metropolitan general practices. I think we should be having a debate as to how the minister's figures are arrived at in terms of actually how many doctors we need in this country. I suspect the way in which the government is counting doctors leaves a lot to be desired, and I will continue my remarks as we get into the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>25374</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to incorporate my response to Senator Evans and Senator Lees and I will circulate it to them.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The response read as follows</inline>—</para><para>Qualification requirements and the sunset clause</para><para>This bill has two main parts and I will address the sunset clause to begin with.</para><para>In debating this bill in the House of Representatives the member for Jagajaga said:</para><para>“it is not appropriate for young doctors who are not fully registered to have unrestricted Medicare provider numbers, as they are still going through paid training to acquire the full range of skills that they need as a specialist or general practitioner.</para><para>I take this to mean that the opposition agrees that the provider number restrictions have improved the quality of general practice in Australia.

We would like a guarantee from the Labor Party that those tax cuts will be protected if, by some mischance of history, the Labor Party gets elected at the next election. Of course, we are all aware of the very big assistance that has been given to self-funded retirees, particularly the measures in the last budget, such as the aged persons bonuses. Another area of great importance has been the cutting of the tax rate on companies, which would be particularly welcomed by small business. The cut was from the 36 per cent we inherited from Labor to 30 per cent under this government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We would like, and small business would like, assurances from the Labor Party—again, if by some mischance of history they are elected to government—that those tax cuts would be protected. The abolition of the financial institutions duty is also particularly welcomed. The tax cuts that have been delivered by this government mean more money in the pockets of Australian workers and pensioners. In fact, since 1996 Australia's lowest paid workers have enjoyed an 8.8 per cent increase in real wages. Contrast that with the previous government! This is a great achievement.</para><para>Recently, Mr Chris Murphy, the producer of the famous Murphy model, has produced some very interesting data on this issue. He has shown that, taking the GST into account, the consumer price index has increased by six per cent since July 2000, but people's average take-home pay has increased by 8.2 per cent. So it is 8.2 per cent in contrast to six per cent. Unfortunately for the Australian public, there is a mixed bag of alternative policies that are putting at risk these gains for Australian taxpayers. As the time is running out, I wonder whether I could have a supplementary to deal with some of these issues, Senator Gibson.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25377</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibson, Senator Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name><name.id>BX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, I would be pleased if you would keep elaborating on the taxes that have been reduced or abolished, and the alternative policies which I referred to in my original question.</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25377</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Senator Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to announce to the Senate that there is a new member of the smallest faction, the truth in policy faction, of the Labor Party.

This is the contrast: big budget deficits under Labor meant high interest rates and bigger monthly repayments for Australian families; budget surpluses under the Howard government mean lower interest rates, lower repayments and more money in the pockets of Australian families.

It is true that Centrelink sent out a significant number of questionnaires asking people who were receiving benefits about the control and influence they might have in the distribution of assets from trusts and companies. It is a very sad reflection on the Australian community that some people—not most, but some—will take advice from very good lawyers and accountants and will so arrange their affairs in trusts and companies as to maximise the opportunities for their family to get welfare benefits, money that should be going to people who really need it, not to people who can afford lawyers and accountants to rearrange their assets in such a way as to get welfare benefits. So, yes, we did send out the questionnaires.</para></talk.start><para>I have had numerous points raised with me about the questionnaires, including the complexity of them. But the nature of trusts and companies is that you do not walk into a delicatessen, as you might when you buy a Kit Kat, and say, `I will have a trust or a company that will allow me to hide my assets so that I can get welfare.' Necessarily you need some complex advice, and necessarily to find out whether that is the case there is a series of questions that some people might not find easy. Many of these people were able to find the money to go to a lawyer or an accountant to set up the trust or company in order to maximise their welfare payments. </para><para>There would be some people who are beneficiaries under a trust—perhaps because of a will or something like that—and the advice that I have is that, for people in that position, the forms were relatively simple to fill in. But as in any other area of life, when you find people who are prepared to cheat—and there is no point pretending that there are not some; there are—everyone else who is innocent, somewhere along the line, has to pay a price. That is what compliance is about—making sure that there is not someone who is cheating. If we lived in an ideal world where no-one cheated, it would be a lot nicer place and a lot easier to administer welfare benefits. But we spend billions of dollars of hard-earned taxpayers' money and they want us to make sure that that money is not going to people who should not be entitled to it. </para><para>I do not think there is a senator or member in this place who has not been approached by someone with a story about a family which has some sort of welfare, but they know that family is really well off. I can guarantee you that that will involve the situation of a trust or a company. We are determined to crack down on this. It means that some people will have to fill in forms that they might otherwise not have had to fill in. I will take the rest of the question on notice and get answers with respect to the reply paid envelope, how many replies we have had and the consequences of that. However, if anybody has been cut off from a pension because they had access to funds through a trust or company, then I am not worried about that.

Can the minister also say what the department is doing to protect the privacy rights of those non-Centrelink trustees and private company directors whose full trust or private company asset details will now be held by Centrelink, and with regard to the information on the forms, in respect of those trusts and companies, that relates to other people who are not Centrelink clients?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25381</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I said, Senator, I will take the rest of your question on notice.

I hope you are not raising the spectre of saying that people on welfare should not have to fill out these forms because they will invade the privacy of someone else and thereby they will get welfare to which they would otherwise not be entitled. You surely cannot be saying that the principle of protecting someone's privacy should be used for people to get more welfare.

The irony, which I am sure is not lost on Senator Brandis, is that the Audit Office is the hapless tenant. Undoubtedly, due to random selection, that particular lease escaped the audit. If it had been audited, the following things would have been revealed: firstly, taxpayers are currently paying $693 per square metre, when average market rates in that area of Canberra are less than half that amount—about $320 per square metre. That means that, for this year alone, the taxpayers of Australia are paying $2.2 million more than they should. Over the life of the lease, an extra $36 million will be ripped out of taxpayers' pockets and put straight into the coffers of the Australian Labor Party. Secondly, as honourable senators will know, the Centenary House contract was for 15 years—far longer than the normal contract for a government lease. Thirdly, the worst part of this Labor rort was the nine per cent ratchet clause. A ratchet clause is one which ensures that, irrespective of the market, the rental increases by a fixed rate each year. In the ANAO report, at page 71, the Auditor-General said this about ratchet clauses:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Agencies should seek to avoid ratchet clauses ... to ensure that they are only exposed to normal market rentals.

Yesterday we had the opposition spokesperson on this matter continuing his form, making some inaccurate statements about the design of our family tax benefits system, and of course we had some questions in here on that. As usual, Mr Swan is wrong. The system that we have introduced in relation to welfare is much simpler than the one we inherited from the Labor Party, and we intend to continue to make it simpler. It is a fairer system in relation to families because families get paid exactly what they are entitled to on the basis of their actual income.</para></talk.start><para>When you look at how complex the system was when Labor came to power, you understand why Mr Swan is so upset. When Labor first came to power in 1983, there were 13 different income support payments. After a few years of a Labor government, when they were finally removed in 1996, there were 22 separate income support payments. There had been a 69 per cent increase in the number of payments. That is a 69 per cent increase in the complexity of the system, making it 69 per cent harder for people who need welfare. You shift from 13 different income support payments to 22 separate payments, a 69 per cent increase that is frankly just typical—more complexity for ordinary Australians who need help and more complexity for the public servants who have the difficulty of administering these changes. </para><para>Since we have come to government, we have managed to reduce those 22 down to 19, and we will continue with that. On top of that simplification, as a part of tax reform, as I mentioned yesterday, we reduced 12 separate family payments or tax benefits down to three, and we are committed to still further simplification. Patrick McClure, in his report on welfare reform, emphasised the need for simpler income support, and we have followed that advice. Just to remind you: when Labor came to power in 1983, there were 13 different payments; when they left government, there were 22. So they were all about making things more complex.</para><para>Today I had the opportunity to announce the first change to come out of a task force I set up to cut red tape in the welfare sector for Centrelink customers. This initiative will cut red tape and simplify processes for about 300,000 unemployed customers who go off payment and then come back on. And that happens: there are people out there looking for work, they get offered a three-month job or a six-month job, they go back to Centrelink and, under the old system, they had to complete the same old form again in full, which was a waste of their time, frustrating for them and, frankly, a waste of time from Centrelink's perspective. So by streamlining the process for repeat customers—that is, people who come back on benefits within 12 months—we will be able to cut something like five or 10 minutes from the time taken to fill out each of these forms. That might not sound much but 10 fewer minutes in front of a counter answering questions makes it a lot easier for welfare beneficiaries.</para><para>When you consider there are 300,000 of them, you get to three million minutes, which is actually a 50,000-hour saving in time for the Centrelink bureaucracy. What does that mean? It means they can give better service, be more friendly at the counter—although I have had no complaints about them not being friendly—or they can do other work and give other customers better service. So a simple change—10 minutes per application for 300,000 people—gives you 50,000 hours of simplification. This measure will take place from 1 September. Unemployed people who reclaim payment within 52 weeks will have a simpler opportunity. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25386</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

There are a few extra details that I can provide. This saving will come about because people will not have to fill in the same form. Centrelink will simply go through with them the information it already holds. Customers will not have to provide three forms of identity; this time they will have to provide only one. After all, we have already verified who they are in the past, and all we need to do this time is to confirm that. Because it will take less time, and because it will be easier for Centrelink customers—putting aside the saving to Centrelink of, say, 50,000 hours—this will make it easier for people to take up a job offer and then shift back to benefits. That will be a simpler system. We are putting forward simpler opportunities for people to get a job and to be more inclined to take a job, knowing that it will be easier to go back onto benefit if they lose the job.

One that was mentioned by Minister Kemp in answer to a question earlier today is a $12 billion reduction in the income tax bill for Australian taxpayers—the largest single reduction in income tax in the history of our country. They would also wish to be reminded of the significant reductions in corporate taxation that came about with the tax reform package. They may well wish to be reminded of the range of other taxes, including the FID, which have been abolished as part of the total tax reform package.</para></talk.start><para>This reform package was long overdue, but no previous Australian government had the political courage to enact it. This government has done so, and the benefits should be apparent to all Australians. The economy continues to be in strong economic growth. Interest rates continue to be at record low levels. Inflation remains low, and the prospects of unemployment reducing further are good. These are the benefits that flow from courageous but sound economic policies. I would expect that the Australian people would want to be reminded of the detail of that. It helps them to plan not only their tax affairs but also their business affairs in general.</para><para>In relation to the second part of Senator Crowley's question, I think she is referring to situations where the financial circumstances of particular individuals have changed and their benefits have been affected, in which case they would expect to be corresponded with on a one-on-one basis, because the circumstances of every individual will vary.

Isn't it the case that, if we get the good news only, this is nothing more than a political advertising campaign?

This is over 90 per cent of all Australian families with dependent children. So it is another demonstration of how all Australians benefit from the Howard government's package of taxation reforms. I remind Senator Crowley and others on the other side, who tend to forget it, that we have been advised by the ANAO that access and equity are very important elements in the administration of Commonwealth programs.

The program has now been extended to outer metropolitan areas of our capital cities.

That is how much she knew about it. I was embarrassed to have to say to Senator Mackay, `Senator, it's being targeted there because that's where the floods are.'

I want to make a couple of brief comments on that. Senator Stott Despoja clearly discussed this with the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>, resulting in an article that I regret contains a number of errors. I will not have time to correct them all. Firstly, the personal services determination form is not a GST form; I think Senator Stott Despoja should be aware of that. It has nothing to do with the GST or GST forms. This is a form that is used only by taxpayers who earn 80 per cent or more of their personal services income from one source and who want to be excluded from the new alienation of personal services income rules.</para></talk.start><para>Second, while Senator Stott Despoja has not provided me with a copy of the form she has in her possession, from her description it would appear to be a draft form circulated to a consultative group. It is not a final document, but a working document which may be subject to further change. The consultative group has been formed by the Australian Taxation Office, which is working with the tax profession, relevant industry groups—and this touches on a matter that I raised yesterday—and individual taxpayers on the design of the form. Why? Because this government is a consultative government. I have said that many times. Third, this draft form is not a secret document, so it has not been leaked.</para><para>Fourth, Senator Stott Despoja emphasised a number of questions and sections on the form. She emphasised that there are 10 sections. On the top of page 1, under the heading `Important', it states that applicants do not need to fill in all sections. In fact, they may need to fill in only three sections—that is, the three out of the 10 sections. I am also pleased to advise the Senate that the ATO has advised me that they embarked last year on an extensive education and communication program to inform people affected by the alienation measures. </para><para>Finally, I must confess that I am somewhat surprised at this question coming from the Democrats. In a minority report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on the alienation of personal services income, Senator Andrew Murray apparently claimed that the Ralph report called for a very comprehensive test on this issue, but they felt that the legislation applied only very simple tests. Further, they recommended that instead of one test being required to be satisfied under self-assessment, it should be increased to two. Further, the Democrat report said that the test is loosely drafted and it would be easy for a tax avoider to produce a set of circumstances at very low cost which resulted in them meeting that test. In other words, the Democrats seemed to be arguing at that time that the form would be too easy to fill out. I think it would be a help if the Leader of the Australian Democrats made herself aware of what the Democrats had said previously on this particular issue. I hope that my answer will provide some assistance in that regard.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Taxation Office: Rulings</title><page.no>25393</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>25393</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On Wednesday, Senator Murphy asked me a question about Australian Taxation Office rulings, and I seek leave to incorporate my answer in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The answer read as follows</inline>—</para><quote><para>On Wednesday 27 June 2001, (<inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> page: 24977) Senator Murphy asked me:</para><para>(i)	Can the minister confirm that the ATO'S taxpayers' charter requires the ATO to give a taxpayer who requests a ruling a decision within 28 days or at an agreed time?</para><para>(ii)	Can the minister confirm that figures were provided to the National Tax Liaison Group on 6 June showing that the tax office has been unable to meet this standard in 28 per cent of cases since the introduction of its new provisions in the advice process?</para><para>(iii)	Why doesn't the government ensure that the ATO dedicates sufficient resources to ensuring that taxpayers who seek rulings get them in a timely way, as required by the taxpayers' charter?</para><para>I now seek leave to have this incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>The ATO's Taxpayer Charter provides that the ATO will give a ruling within 28 days of receiving all the necessary information from the applicant.

I invite any senator or member of the public to read my full speech. What I said was that, when state governments got rid of death duties in the late 1970s and early 1980s, led by Bjelke-Petersen, the then Premier, they rotted their own tax base and, as a consequence, when they ran short of money, they became addicted to gambling taxes instead and that the states now rely on gambling taxes to find revenue to provide their services rather than other taxes. I made it clear that, if you wanted to look at the adverse social impact in the community, you would find that the introduction of a range of gambling taxes and the spread of poker machines have done immeasurably more damage to the community than the modest range of death duties that states had until the late 1970s and early 1980s.

It may come as a surprise to many people in this chamber, but Senator Kemp is in actual fact the minister in charge of tax administration. But time and time again we see Senator Kemp pleading the fifth, saying that he does not know the answer and asking to take the question on notice. Today we have seen three more answers taken on notice and three more demonstrations of the minister's incompetence and refusal to do the hard yards to get over his briefs.</para><para>But this is not surprising, because this is the 12-month anniversary, the first birthday, of the GST, and this government has still not managed to issue rulings in a variety of very important areas and this government wants to hide from that fact.

Senator Conroy, economic management is not something that I think any Labor Party politician should dare talk about. The Labor Party during its years in office, if one compares it with the coalition government, fails on almost every criterion. I think interest rates under the Labor government hit a high of 21 per cent around the end of the 1980s. Under the coalition, they sit at around six per cent. Inflation rates under Labor were very high indeed compared with inflation rates around the rest of the world.

Under the Labor government, inflation was high and money was worth nothing. If you waited a week, your savings were eroded by inflation. Under the Howard government, under the coalition's economic management policies, inflation rates have been very low.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When Labor left office, the Commonwealth had a debt of $96 billion. That is something that I think Labor must feel very ashamed of to this very day. Under the coalition government, more than $50 billion of that debt has been paid off, because we have had no less than five consecutive budget surpluses. Under Labor—guess what?—most of the budgets were in great deficit. Senator Conroy said recently in his famous Zimmerman performance that he saw nothing intrinsically wrong with deficit budgeting. In other words, he saw nothing intrinsically wrong in going back to the great deficits which characterised the Hawke and Keating Labor governments and which led Australia down the pathway of record national debts, record interest rates, record inflation, record high unemployment rates and generally very poor economic management. </para><para>Let us look at unemployment rates. The unemployment rate under the last ALP government hit nearly 11 per cent. Senator Campbell, that is something that you in particular must be have been very embarrassed about. There you were, along with your colleagues—leaders of the trade union movement—and your government had unemployment rates at 11 per cent. What are the rates now? They are right down to six and seven per cent—in fact, 6.9 per cent. The coalition government has created something like 800,000 new jobs. Under the Labor administration, jobs were being lost day by day, week by week, year by year, because the economy was failing under your leadership. </para><para>What about real wages? Under Labor, real wages fell. Under the coalition, they have grown by five per cent, which is something I am sure Senator Campbell would applaud, because his trade unionists are better off under the coalition government. Senator Conroy talked about the GST being a failure. Let us face the facts: the GST was supported by Hawke and Keating, but they were just not brave enough to introduce it. Everybody has known and understood for a very long time that this country had to go from a direct to an indirect taxation model, and the Howard government were brave enough to introduce it. They need to be applauded for that great initiative. They were brave enough to go to the people with a proposal to reform the tax system. They were returned on that basis, and they have carried out that reform. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>25396</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One of the questions put to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, in question time related to section 229 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. For those who are not aware of it, this section provides for compensation in the event of suspected theft and fraud and possible legal and financial assistance where this occurs in respect of a superannuation fund. It is a very important provision, because I do not believe any government would want to see people who are heading towards retirement age or are already retired having money stolen without compensation being provided. Under the act, individuals who are hurt in this way can write to the minister and request assistance. It is a very important provision and, I might say, it is a provision that provides for 100 per cent compensation in those eventualities. Contrast that with the attitude of the Liberal government and Senator Kemp, in particular, who have sought to reduce the level of protection from 100 per cent compensation to some 80 per cent compensation. Fortunately, that provision was defeated in the Senate by the Labor Party when it was presented last year.</para></talk.start><para>Commercial Nominees Australia Ltd is a superannuation fund where some hundreds of Australians have clearly lost money as a result of some theft and fraud. The extent of the loss of money is not clear yet, but it is certain that some theft and fraud has occurred and that there are probably losses of over $20 million. Some of the individuals concerned have written to the responsible minister. Under the SI(S) Act, the Treasurer and, as we understand it, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, are responsible for the supervision of superannuation matters in Australia and would be required to respond, hopefully granting the assistance. Some months have passed. The requests were made in March and April—I have seen copies of some of those requests—and still no responses have come from the minister's office. It particularly concerned me that, in his response after question time, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, notified us that Minister Hockey is responsible for superannuation. But, under his duty statement, Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, is responsible for superannuation matters. It is he who should be responding.</para><para>We have a situation where a number of Australian retirees who have put aside money in the lead-up to their retirement cannot access their money. This is a great worry and concern to individual Australians, particularly when they reach retirement age. It is particularly concerning to me. We have to wonder what Senator Kemp does. If he claims he is not responsible in this area when it is clearly a superannuation matter, what is Senator Kemp doing? He rarely, if ever, can answer a question in his own portfolio areas of responsibility. Here is another issue clearly in his own area of portfolio responsibility, superannuation, and he cannot give us a response. What is even worse is that we have now found out that Mr Hockey, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, is supposedly responsible. I might remind the Senate that Minister Hockey was the minister responsible for the day-to-day supervision of Australia's prudential regulatory authorities, and of course we have the issues relating to the HIH collapse. I am very worried that the individuals who have made applications for assistance have to rely on Minister Hockey.</para><para>The provision for assistance is vital to maintain certainty, security and peace of mind for elderly Australians. These provisions should be activated quickly. They should not be sitting on Minister Kemp's desk or on Minister Hockey's desk or travelling between the two. This is not helping retired Australians. It is not providing the assistance which is required under the act. Individuals who have been hurt by this collapse should be given appropriate reassurance and appropriate compensation as soon as possible.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>25397</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Sherry has a peculiar way of taking note of answers.

It is not very often that I will offer a different opinion from that of my good colleague Senator Eggleston of Western Australia, but today I am afraid I have to take very strong exception to what he said earlier. Referring to Labor's economic performance when they were in government five short years ago, he said that Labor must be very ashamed of the $80 billion debt they left behind. I am sorry, Senator Eggleston, but I do not think the Labor Party are at all ashamed of any debt they left behind. In fact, I do not think the Labor Party can understand the difference between a plus sign and a minus sign, and they think $80 billion of debt is something to be proud of.</para><para>I am not saying that without a basis for it. Senator Conroy got up today and read from a survey. We have no idea what sort of quality control applies to that. Senator Conroy said that, in that survey, only 10 per cent of respondents said that they were better off under the GST. Senator Conroy then drew the marvellous conclusion that 90 per cent of people are therefore worse off under the GST. Let me point out to Senator Conroy that, firstly, this is what people think, not what they actually experience. Secondly, just because 10 per cent say that they are better off does not mean that 90 per cent say that they are worse off. The 90 per cent could have had no change, in which case we have a net gain in people's conditions.</para><para>Senator Conroy, in his marvellous logic—which is perhaps typical of a Labor Party frontbencher—can make this jump from 10 per cent saying that they think they are better off to 90 per cent being worse off. Senator Conroy is also extremely loose with his facts, as is also typical of Labor frontbenchers. The facts he mentioned are often talked about in this chamber. Senator Conroy talked about the pension clawback. The simple history of this issue clearly establishes that this government paid GST compensation up front. It is not a case of clawback. Four per cent was paid in July 2000, when the CPI increase was two per cent.

That essentially went to the issue of pensioners and self-funded retirees, in particular. We could be cynical and call those the Stone amendments, the Stone changes or the Stone variations to the budget. There is no doubt that those changes were made to government policy in the budget this year as a direct result of the letter from Shane Stone to the Prime Minister after the Ryan by-election, pointing out how much this government was on the nose with ordinary battlers, with pensioners and with self-funded retirees because of the mean, miserable policies this government has introduced. The most prominent of those policies is the GST and the way in which the government treats compensation for those various groups as a result of the introduction of that tax.</para><para>Taxpayers have been forced to pay for the pulping of the flyers that were printed to go out with this year's <inline font-style="italic">TaxPack</inline> because of the observations—quite accurate observations, I might add—of the President of the Liberal Party, Mr Shane Stone.

The government has recognised that, viewed from a present day perspective, these practices were misguided and caused great suffering, and has established programmes to assist those affected to move forward.</para><para>In responding to the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing Them Home</inline> report, the government noted that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission identified family reunion as “<inline font-style="italic">the most significant and urgent need of separated families</inline>”.  This is central to the government's response announced in December 1997, which included a $63 million package of measures designed to assist families with the provision of counselling and parenting programmes and family tracing and reunion services.  Other elements of the package included an oral history project, improved access to Commonwealth records for those tracing their past, and language and culture maintenance programmes.  Building on this initial package of initiatives, the government will provide ongoing funding of $44 million over a further four years for its parenting programmes, counselling services and support and training for mental health counsellors.

The Committee did not produce a consensus report.  The Majority Report of the non-government members of the Committee contains ten recommendations, of which nine are relevant to the Commonwealth.  The government supports, either in full or in part, five of these nine recommendations.  We agree with the Committee's first majority recommendation that it is timely to evaluate the original response to <inline font-style="italic">Bringing Them Home</inline> by all relevant parties.  We agree that it is vital that programmes and services be monitored and coordinated to ensure that the needs of those still suffering the effects of family separations are being met, and we can point to relevant policies already agreed or in place.  We agree that it is important that the events of the past and their legacy be acknowledged.  In addition, therefore, we are pleased to advise that in the 2001-02 Budget the government allocated funding beyond 30 June 2002 for key family reunion and health services at a further cost of $53.9 million over four years to 30 June 2006.</para><para>The government's response to each of the Senate Committee's individual recommendations follows.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response to Majority (non-government Senators) Report recommendations</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 1</inline><inline font-style="italic"> - The Committee recommends that the federal government, in conjunction with state and territory governments, commission an independent evaluation of the progress of initiatives implemented by governments in response to the Bringing Them Home report.

The government's $63 million package of initiatives (increasing to $117 million after 30 June 2002) to assist those affected by past practices of removal to, among other things, be reunited with their families and receive counselling and support for the pain they have suffered, represents a more practical way to assist in healing the suffering caused by past practices of family separation.

The same complex and costly legal and factual issues would need to be addressed in order to assess individual claims and such decisions would still be open to further judicial review.  The experience of other administrative tribunals, including in the field of immigration and refugees, illustrates that it is not possible to insulate such deliberations from legal challenges and procedures.  The Dissenting Report of the Government Senators on the Committee also highlights the fundamental practical problems associated with the operation of a compensation tribunal in this context.  This includes the basic question of defining what circumstances and which affected individuals would or would not qualify for compensation.</para><para>Additionally, State governments are responsible for the laws which were in place in their jurisdictions during the period that indigenous child removals took place.

However, this response is indicative of a government who believes that these issues will go away. They clearly will not. All Australians need to be able to honestly and openly own our shared history. Our sense of who we are and what we hope to be can never be securely held if it is based on a false and incomplete history. There are things that must be done and said if we are to be able to move on.</para><para>Those who are today still suffering from the direct and indirect consequences of past policies that saw indigenous families torn apart have particular rights and needs that have yet to be met. We must do so for their own good and for the good of all of us. We should never lose sight of the fact that the abuse and mistreatment of indigenous Australians has been the subject of ongoing contemporary debate and informed criticism since European settlement. There is no one true history; there is no one truth in these matters. We can no more say that all policy was motivated by racism and malice than we can say that all the motives were benign. What we can agree on is that the results of policies of governments and agencies over time were shameful and overwhelmingly to the great disadvantage of most indigenous Australians subject to them.</para><para>Every Australian legislator should be aware that every aspect of past policies, for which so many now express sorrow and regret, was framed in the context of contemporary criticism and debate. Legislators of those days were content, relaxed and comfortable in moving from majority public opinion rather than accepting informed and probably less popular advice. But we must move on. We must acknowledge past wrongs, guarantee against their repetition and express genuine sorrow both for these acts and for the consequences of these acts. I have moved in these terms in the parliament every year since the tabling of the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home </inline>report in 1997.</para><para>The government say in their response that they support in principle recommendation 3, which is:</para><quote><para>... `Motion of National Apology and Reconciliation' be settled following wide consultation with individual members of the stolen generation and representatives of stolen generation organisations.</para></quote><para>However, they quite clearly do not. The government say their motion of reconciliation fits this requirement. It quite clearly does not. Ultimately, for an apology to have an effect it must be made in terms acceptable to the parties affected. The government's motion of reconciliation does not do this, therefore it is not effective. This is unfinished business. The government also refuse to consider recommendation 7, to establish a reparations tribunal, on the grounds that it is just as complex and as costly as litigation presently proceeding through the courts. This is untrue. It is possible to address these matters in non-litigious ways, just as many present statutory schemes do. It is possible to come to agreed facts through a non-adversarial process which is designed to heal rather than to blame.</para><para>We cannot write or interpret our history in the courts. No finding of a contemporary court can either vindicate or punish legislators and administrators of the past. Litigation is a poor interpreter of history and an imprecise instrument of public policy. History deals with general patterns, big pictures, causes and consequences. Litigation moves slowly along, case by case, constrained by rules of evidence that restrict admissibility, that focus on the particular facts relevant to the specific action being pleaded and place all onus of proof on the plaintiff. Rules of evidence and other court rules have an honourable intent and an honourable purpose. They seek to protect the weak, usually an individual, from the strong, usually the state. When the roles are reversed, and the state as Goliath enjoys all the protections really intended for David, courts work not nearly as well as they should.</para><para>Governments are aware of this, and commit themselves to a code of practice that compels them to act in an exemplary manner. This code is referred to, in the case of the Commonwealth government, in the document<inline font-style="italic"> The Commonwealth as a model litigant</inline>. It is instructive to look at some of the things that code requires of a government, so I will quote from it in part. It says:</para><quote><para>The Commonwealth must act honestly and fairly in handling claims by: </para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><para>·	paying legitimate claims without litigation, including making partial settlements of claims or interim payments, where it is clear that liability is at least as much as the amount to be paid;</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>·	endeavouring to avoid litigation, wherever possible;</para><para>·	where it is not possible to avoid litigation, keeping the costs of litigation to a minimum, including by:</para><para>·	not requiring the other party to prove a matter which the Commonwealth knows to be true; and</para><para>·	not contesting liability if the Commonwealth knows that the dispute is really about quantum;</para><para>·	not taking advantage of a claimant who lacks the resources to litigate a legitimate claim;</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>·	apologising where the Commonwealth is aware that it or its lawyers have acted wrongfully or improperly.</para><para>These words have a hollow and ironic ring to anyone in any way familiar with the Commonwealth's conduct in the Cubillo-Gunner case, currently under appeal in the Federal Court. This is a case where the Commonwealth has already spent in the order of $11.5 million. One lawyer alone has been paid $1 million. Private investigators have been paid $770,000.</para><para>This is a case where the singular lack of compassion or cultural sensitivity of the Commonwealth has astounded those who have studied it. The court has found that Lorna Cubillo and Peter Gunner suffered systematic abuse and trauma over a long period when removed from their families and placed in institutions. It also found that there is a causative relationship between their experiences in these institutions and their continued mental and physical suffering. Despite this, they have been subjected to humiliation and harrowing treatment in the court.</para><para>There is no doubt that the Commonwealth has set out to make an example of them. Any person making a complaint or any legal service thinking of supporting them is to be left in no doubt as to the consequences: the matter will be fought out in court; these processes will be long and expensive; no secret, no private matter and no youthful indiscretion will go untouched; the Commonwealth will set out to humiliate, discredit and defeat every claimant; and the highest paid legal pit bulls will cross examine each claimant and use all the experience and guile at their disposal to intimidate and confuse the claimant into inconsistent or uncertain testimony.</para><para>Currently, there is a total of 742 writs served on the Commonwealth in relation to claims by 2,104 people seeking damages in connection with forced family separations in the Northern Territory. There are cases under way around Australia against state governments. The Cubillo-Gunner case makes it clear that the greatest likelihood of success in these cases rests with going beyond governments and joining churches, agencies and individuals in these actions—more people and more pain.</para><para>We cannot afford—not in monetary terms nor in terms of the cost to our national reputation and sense of decency—to deal with these cases in the way the Howard government would have us proceed. Although there is acceptance in part of some of the recommendations of the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, it is clearly not enough. This response is indicative of a government that will not acknowledge the full extent of the problem and hopes that it can shut its eyes and make the issue go away. It will not go away.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>25407</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It has taken the government seven months to respond to this report and, given that it has taken that time, I hope that perhaps in another month's time there might also be a response to the final report of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation—after 10 years.</para></talk.start><para>As the Australian Democrats stated in our minority report in <inline font-style="italic">Healing: a legacy of generations</inline>, the recommendations of the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing</inline><inline font-style="italic">them</inline><inline font-style="italic">home</inline> report are not a collection of options for governments to choose from. What we were essentially saying, and what the human rights commission said at the time, during the Senate inquiry, was that the recommendations are a package of complementary measures that need to be implemented as a whole. Collectively, it is about those recommendations constituting the minimum acceptable response required to heal the legacy that is borne by members of the stolen generations, their families and their communities.</para><para>This government has done exactly the opposite. It has picked out the recommendations of the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing</inline><inline font-style="italic">them</inline><inline font-style="italic">home</inline> report relating to family reunions and the need for the provision of Link Up services and then determined, in defiance of all of the recommendations and evidence put forward in both the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing</inline><inline font-style="italic">them</inline><inline font-style="italic">home</inline> report and the recent inquiry, that that alone is going to address the ongoing suffering of the stolen generations, their families and their communities. </para><para>This is pertinent when you consider the debate that has raged—and is raging now—in the media in the past two weeks about how to address the issues of dysfunctionality within indigenous communities. Much of what can be seen there can be attributed to institutional policies that were designed to remove people and that left scars on people's hearts and on their souls. Now the challenge to government is how it can help to restore and repair the damage that has been done.</para><para>The Australian Democrats want to restate at the outset some observations that were made by the human rights commission in its submission to the Senate committee. One of the observations was that the adequacy of the Commonwealth response is best measured by assessing the redress provided against the harm done, rather than trying to highlight the paucity of redress from other sources or by attempting to transfer the responsibility to other groups, such as states and churches. </para><para>The government did hear the message of those members of the stolen generations who appeared before the Senate committee, explained the difficulty in accessing family Link Up services and gave their stories of how overwhelmed and underresourced those services are. It has therefore decided to increase funds to parenting programs, counselling services, mental health counsellors and Link Up services. Whilst that is a welcome step in the right direction, I think that we can, at best, describe it as being good but not necessarily great.</para><para>The Australian Democrats do not want to respond in detail on the financial commitments that the government have made today; rather, we want to revisit that matter in the future after we have had an opportunity to examine the adequacy of the measures, speak to members of the stolen generations and look at the question of whether there is in fact the provision of sufficient resources to address the problems that exist. </para><para>In particular, we would like to look into the matter of whether this really is new funding or, as was the case with most of the funding in the government's initial $63 million response to the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing</inline><inline font-style="italic">them</inline><inline font-style="italic">home</inline> report, whether it is simply old money that has been retagged. I do not think there is any clear indication about whether we are looking at the same process having been gone through again or whether in fact it is new money. But what all of the reports, inquiries, conferences and international laws have advised this government to do is to deliver a comprehensive package of measures. Instead, this government has ignored the best advice and results coming forward in those contexts.</para><para>In its response report, the Australian government decided, against all other advice, that the stolen generations do not need reparation or guarantees against repetition or a formal apology or a reparations tribunal or compensation. In the eyes of the government and from my reading of the response, all the measures that the stolen generations have asked for are seen as unnecessary and unhelpful. Clearly, the government is convinced that it is humane and compassionate because it has not removed the ability of the stolen generations to take their human rights violations to the courts. But it has not acknowledged that the process is prohibitively costly. Each of the handful of cases that has been heard during the last decade has dragged on for years. Each has cost the stolen generations and taxpayers millions of dollars each time one of these high profile cases does not succeed because the claimants cannot deliver the necessary paper trail of evidence that is required by the courts, and the stolen generations, having had their stories put on public display and under scrutiny, have to suffer collectively again. </para><para>If the government were genuine and sincere in its statement in today's response that it wants to acknowledge the events of the past and their legacy, we would expect as a very minimum to be adopting the main recommendation of the Senate committee report, that is, committing to the establishment of a reparations tribunal to provide an alternative to the courts. The stolen generations community is meeting again in a couple of months to flesh out the details of how this tribunal would work in practice as there is already community support for the tribunal model developed by the Public Interest Advocacy Centre in New South Wales.</para><para>Similarly, the government would not be intentionally misunderstanding the intent of the Senate committee's second recommendation and suggesting that we already have sufficient forums to discuss issues of concern to the members of the stolen generations. The Senate committee recommended a national summit to progress recommendations of its own report. Suggesting, as the government has today, that this be done by the Ministerial Council on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, as one such forum, after the stinging criticism that it received in the committee's report, is nothing short of an insult to the stolen generations. </para><para>It is simply unrealistic to expect the annual link-up meetings to deal with all of the business that they already have on their plate while additionally now taking on this additional responsibility of fleshing out a reparations tribunal or making recommendations on appropriate regimes to look at the monitoring and assessment of the adequacy of the government's response. These are enormous demands to place on these groups, which are already underresourced.</para><para>One of the other things that also needs to be mentioned is the somewhat fatigued question of a formal parliamentary apology to the stolen generations. I have to wonder whether the government read the transcripts of the hearings and heard the unanimous voice of the stolen generations that the motion for the national apology and reconciliation back in 1999 did not go far enough. Everyone agreed that, whilst it was a good first step, for the government to suggest in its response today that has delivered on that call is a misrepresentation of the facts. Any fence mending that the government might have achieved through the motion back then was destroyed by the then minister for indigenous affairs in his comments that there never was a stolen generation.</para><para>One of the key issues is about being able to monitor and report on these issues.  With respect to the government's response to the committee's recommendation regarding monitoring and reporting and all of the mechanisms required to look at how to overcome problems of disfunctionality in communities, as I stated earlier, the Senate committee found the ministerial council to be extremely remiss in meeting its own responsibilities and the junior ministerial council with no power or influence. As Sir Ronald Wilson said in his address to the committee, `What does it take? What does it do?' It waits for a year and then assigns the task to the Victorian committee, and the Victorian working party meets the best part of 12 months later and it has an understanding of what these states chose to have done. So I think the obligation to report in any way that would seek a coordinated response has again been disregarded by the government. There is simply no meaningful or inspiring response coming forward. </para><para>Again, the Democrats repeat our recommendation in the minority committee report that the appropriate procedure for implementation is a four-tiered procedure coordinated at the highest level of government, namely, the Council of Australian Governments. The Australian Democrats believe that the enormity of the problems faced by the stolen generations throughout Australia is such that the highest level of government must step in to ensure a coordinated, effective and whole-of-government response. The government's persistence in relegating this to a junior council, quite frankly, does not instil confidence in members of the stolen generations that things will substantially change.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>25409</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I endorse what has been said by Senator McKiernan and Senator Ridgeway, but there are a couple of things I would like to talk about. Firstly, recommendation 7—and Senator Ridgeway and Senator McKiernan both turned their minds to this—dealt with the committee's recommendation for the establishment of a reparations tribunal to address the need to provide an effective process of redress, including the provision of individual monetary compensation. The thinking behind this was that there ought to be some formal instrument set up by the state, which represents the community, to do justice to citizens of this country—in this case those with indigenous ancestry—who have been badly dealt with. The idea of the tribunal is for decision makers to make an assessment of what has gone on in individual cases and to do justice to them by way of compensation or some other relief. That is a normal part of the society we live in, that is, we have people making assessments, judging between two parties, as it were, and coming down with a decision to do justice between those two entities. The reason the government has used to reject that suggestion is as follows—and I quote from the government's reply:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The experience of other administrative tribunals including in the field of immigration and refugees illustrates that it is not possible to insulate such deliberations from legal challenges and procedures.</para></quote><para>What is used in this context to reject a recommendation of the committee is that which has happened in the area of immigration. The area of unauthorised arrivals is used to put this present proposition down. In respect of the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Immigration Review Tribunal, the courts simplydecide whether those tribunals have done their jobs. The courts are not there to decide the facts. The courts are there to see whether the tribunals do their jobs. That is a reasonable process. However, a culture is developing in this society and in the government which, more and more, impugns the courts and the legal system in this country. Indeed, it tends to go beyond the legal system. The most recent example of where the government does that is the allegations made under parliamentary privilege here the other night against an Aboriginal leader, Mr Terry O'Shane. </para><para>The problem with what happened the other night is that there is a legal process which has been set up by the community and which has been with us for centuries—and if we consider England as our predecessor in this regard, that process has been in operation for many centuries—to ensure that people are dealt with fairly when accusations of a most serious nature are made against them. However, in this chamber the other night a senator chose to ignore those legal processes and instruments of the rule of law to try to obtain a result which, if it was going to be obtained, should have been obtained through the legal system. The same sort of thing can be said with regard to matters outside this chamber in respect of the approach the media took to Mr Geoff Clark when it used a process other than the legal system to deny Mr Clark his right to have the allegations made against him processed through the proper institutions of this country. </para><para>It is a matter of concern that we are increasingly trying to deal with issues that should be dealt with through the processes of the institutions I have referred to, to try to nail a person through allegation and repetition of allegation so that the allegation becomes the issue and not the resolution of that allegation so that a fair result is obtained. In the reply to the committee report, there is a furtherance of that attitude and culture which is developing, and a furthering of that climate which says, `Let's see what we can get away with. Let's not have a process of decision making which is done fairly according to law. Let's see if we can so create an atmosphere in which people lose a case, lose their reputation or their standing in the community'—through what, in effect, is a very nasty, vicious and unrestrained process. Given that context, it is a tragedy to see the reply to the committee's recommendation about the setting up of a tribunal.</para><para>It is time that we, as a community, started to think very seriously about how we determine the great issues that arise in the community. We seem to want to abandon those very instruments of democracy that make us safe. Democracy requires taking a risk. As I said last night, some people are going to escape their just desserts because the allegations against them cannot be proven. Even though those allegations might be true, they cannot be proven. However, we are not a society that would do anything to obtain its objectives. We are not a society that goes in for torture. We are not a society which would write out untrue confessions simply to obtain a result. We are not a society that believes in noble corruption. We ought to be a society that says, `There's due process to be gone through.' In many cases, due process means that people escape the consequences of the wrongs that they have done. However, we say that we want to be the sort of society that would prefer that to happen than to become a society where a more fearsome injustice is done because proper process is not undertaken. On this occasion, the government has chosen not to use one of those instruments suggested by the committee, which would accommodate the demands that there ought to be proper process to reach justice. I think that is quite a tragedy. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>LEONIE GREEN AND ASSOCIATES: INVESTIGATIONG &amp; K O'CONNOR MEATWORKS: DEPARTMENTAL FILES</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>25410</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Returns to Order</title><page.no>25410</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>25410</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I have two responses to returns to order to table and two statements to make.

I table those documents.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Further, in relation to the return to order made in relation to the G &amp; K O'Connor Pty Ltd issues, I respond further to an order made by the Senate on 24 May 2001. It follows a motion moved by Senator Carr that the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business table certain documents, and it follows a statement made in the Senate by me on behalf of the minister earlier this month. The documents sought are held by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and they relate to an industrial dispute in the meat processing industry involving G &amp; K O'Connor Pty Ltd, the operator of an abattoir, and the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. On 18 June, the Senate was advised that the minister was unable to respond fully to the Senate's order until the government had received and considered advice on correspondence received on 15 June from the employer party to this dispute.</para><para>I table certain of the documents subject to the order. The remainder of the documents identified in the order are not tabled, as it would be contrary to the public interest to do so. Broadly speaking, the documents that are being tabled are those for which no public interest argument exists for their non-disclosure. Conversely, the documents that are not being tabled are of a kind that have long been recognised by governments, irrespective of political persuasion, as contrary to the public interest to disclose.</para><para>The documents not tabled include confidential advice prepared by departmental officers and provided to ministers on sensitive matters to assist the deliberative processes of government. Disclosure of such documents would discourage the proper provision of advice to ministers. Were the government to disclose such information, it may prejudice the future supply of information from third parties to the Commonwealth. Such a prejudice would clearly be detrimental to effective government and contrary to the public interest. Further, some of the documents sought are drafts prepared for the internal evaluation and assessment processes within the department. Disclosure of such drafts may discourage the future discussion of such issues within departments.</para><para>In making its decision on this matter, the government is aware of the importance of the principles of transparency and accountability, and has balanced those considerations against those other factors—as have previous governments. I note, for instance, the comments made to the Senate on 3 June 1992 by the former Senator Gareth Evans, while a minister in the previous Labor government, when commenting on ministers' responsibilities when responding to orders such as this and why, in similar circumstances, he was precluded from acting upon such an order. Former Senator Evans spoke of `wrestling with the very difficult and sensitive responsibilities' he had, on the one hand, to the Senate and to the public interest to disclose as much material as he reasonably could but, on the other hand, the `responsibility to the country and to other individuals and interests that might be prejudiced by unreasonable disclosure'.</para><para>I should also add that this return to order moved by Senator Carr is not made in a vacuum. Freedom of information requests on the same subject were made of the relevant department back in 1999 by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union and they were responded to according to the principles laid down by legislation passed by this parliament. After an internal review of those decisions, it is noteworthy that the applicant union did not exercise its further statutory rights of appeal to access documents now sought by Senator Carr. I mention this because it is important that the Senate not allow itself to become an appeal forum for documents lawfully withheld through the freedom of information process.</para><para>There has been and continues to be substantial litigation in the courts and industrial tribunals between G &amp; K O'Connor and the union. It is also noteworthy that, for a number of years, departmental officials have responded to questions from Senator Carr and others through the Senate committee process and other forums of this parliament on the role adopted by the department in its advice on and monitoring of this dispute.</para><para>In considering this matter, it is apparent that Senator Carr is on a fishing expedition for political and industrial purposes. For over two years, he and officials of the AMIEU have been speculating and alleging publicly that the government has been improperly or unlawfully involving itself in this dispute. This is despite the responses that have been provided on the record by officials and ministers outlining the government's position in this dispute. Inconveniently for Senator Carr, there is no wrongdoing by the government, and there never has been. Senator Carr will no doubt continue to perceive a conspiracy. The government's reasons for tabling some of the requested documents, but not the remainder, go to matters of good public administration and the public interest, as well as precedent.</para><para>Finally, I inform the Senate that in making this decision to table some but not all of the relevant documents, the government has not provided the assurance sought by G &amp; K O'Connor Pty Ltd in their correspondence of 15 June, nor provided the company with advance notice of this statement.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>25412</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the statement.</para></motion><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>—For how long?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—It is normally 10 minutes or so for these sorts of responses.

Senator Brown did, I believe, but I do not recall that many others did. The issue of time will perhaps be more carefully considered sometime tomorrow.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Quite clearly, the government's response to the return to order is totally inadequate. It is of course a response that one would expect. It said that some of these documents are available. Presumably, the various newspaper clippings that are in the government's file will be provided. Presumably, the copies of the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that are in the government's files will be provided. But I do not anticipate that a great deal more than that will be. What I am concerned about is that the government claims that these matters should not be put on the public record because there is no demonstrable public interest served by doing so. There is no explanation given as to what that grand statement means. It is said that these are matters that should remain private. No serious explanation is provided on that basis, other than it being suggested that people who would come to the government will not necessarily do so if there is a fear that the information provided to government would at a subsequent point be made public.</para><para>We have a number of propositions prepared within the government about the government's response to a quite serious situation. We are told that we are not to be provided with documents concerning the government's evaluation of what has been the longest lockout in Australian history since the 1920s—an action whereby the minister for industrial relations through his solicitors, in common with the company, has clearly acted to coerce a group of 250 of the constituents that I seek to serve into accepting wage cuts of 20 per cent. This same company has engaged a group of industrial thugs who have been involved in Queensland on previous occasions and in the waterfront dispute last year. The notorious scab herder, Townsend, has been employed by this company and, it is my allegation, has been working in concert with this government to destroy the wages and conditions of 250 people at O'Connors in Victoria.</para><para>This is of course a deliberate strategy by the company working in concert with the government in contravention of the law to de-unionise a plant. I would regard that as a serious matter that ought to concern this Senate. That is a matter that clearly raises quite profound issues in public policy terms. So when the government says that it is not in the public interest that we know about these matters, I think what we have been asked to accept is the government's proposition that it is not in our interests to know about actions it has taken which seem to me, on a prima facie basis, to involve breaches of the law.</para><para>In recent times a Channel 9 program, for instance, has demonstrated that this group supplied by Mr Townsend has been engaged in actions which are clearly outside the law. We have seen the employment of spies within the plant to illegally tape-record and coerce other workers into breaches of the law so that they would be sacked. People that have chosen to change their view as to the rights and wrongs of this dispute have been harassed at their homes. Their families have been harassed and violently intimidated. People who have come across from Tasmania to participate in this dispute have been set upon at their houses, and their families have been set upon by these paid thugs.</para><para>It is my contention that this government and this department, through its so-called workplace reform unit, have been directly involved in this dispute from the very beginning. I have been asking questions in Senate estimates for two years and I think we can demonstrate conclusively the government's complicity in these breaches of the law. That is why it is important that these questions are raised here and that is why they will continue to be raised. We will hear more, because further questions have been placed on notice whereby the government will be obliged to respond to inquiries as to the involvement of a number of officials who have been identified directly and their cooperation with a certain law firm, which just so happens to be the same law firm—the same personal solicitor—as that of the former minister, Mr Reith. So there is no doubt in my mind about the connections between the owners and operators of the O'Connors plant and members of the Senior Executive Service and other members of the Australian Public Service.</para><para>My concern is whether or not this Senate has a right to pursue these issues. I will argue that it has and that it has responsibility to do so, because there are fundamental rights in this country which I would have thought each and every one of us ought to be defending. The right to be in a union just happens to be one of those. The right to actually engage in reasonable negotiations about your wages and conditions is another. Given that these workers did not engage in one day of industrial action, one stop-work meeting in company time or one strike—not one of those things occurred—but were locked out for nearly nine months (as I said, the longest lockout since the 1920s) one would have thought we would be entitled to ask what sorts of actions are being pursued by this company. We are also entitled to pursue this when it can be demonstrated that the government has been directly involved in using the resources of government against Australian citizens in this way. For the government to say, `You're not entitled to know about this because there is no demonstrable public interest in you knowing about the detail' is complete nonsense.</para><para>If the government wishes to maintain that it is not guilty of any offence, it should produce the documents. The documents are all quite clearly listed in the FOI application. It cost the union $1,000 to make that application and was told for its trouble that, in document after document, the majority of the folios fell within the provisions of subsections 36(1) and 45(1) of the act. That is the sole explanation given to the union as to why these documents will not be provided. Of course, you are advised that you can appeal against it, but what good would that do?</para><para>There are some documents that are so extraordinarily inoffensive that one has to ask on what possible basis a government would refuse them. Clearly such things as copies of Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansards</inline> fall outside the sections of the Freedom of Information Act that I have just cited. Newspaper clippings fall outside the provisions of subsections 36(1) and 45(1) of the act and are marked `not to be provided'. You pay your $1,000, and you are told that there is a whole series of files within the department but you cannot have them because they fall outside the Freedom of Information Act. Of course, that was not all that the files contained, and it would be nonsense for me to suggest to you that those were the only documents that were being sought. Folios 33 to 36 contain newspaper clippings re the G &amp; K O'Connor dispute and are `outside the scope, under subparagraph 22(a)(ii)'. That is the government's explanation.</para><para>There are others. Extracts from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>—folios 38 to 41—are `outside the scope of the request' and marked `not to be provided'. An independent weekly newsletter on industrial relations—issue 1212, July 1999—is `outside the scope of the request'. Senate questions cannot be provided under FOI. They are `outside the scope of the request'.</para><para>There are other documents that I am more interested in than the questions that were asked in the parliament. They go to the evaluations of this government. They go to the actions of public servants spending public money to prosecute a case of this particular employer, at the behest of Minister Reith, in such a way that it does serious injury to that group of workers at Pakenham. I say that in the context that there were a series of meetings, prior to the actions being taken by the company, with officials from the department. Ms Leslie Riggs, who has been involved in discussions about Leonie Green, said to a Senate estimates committee:</para><quote><para>In advance of taking that action, the proprietor of that company sought to brief the minister's office. A member of my group was present at that briefing. Since that time we have, on one or two occasions, had contact with the proprietor simply for him to confirm that he is maintaining contact with the office or with ourselves and to let us know he is remaining firm at this stage.</para></quote><para>The inference from that statement by the officer to the estimates committee is that the government was seeking to assure itself that the employer was going to remain firm in his assault upon those particular workers. We discovered in further estimates committees that the contact between the firm and the government has been quite extensive. In that context, it is reasonable for us to ask, given the importance of this particular matter, that this parliament be advised as to what actions the government has actually taken—acting on our behalf—to assault the living standards of these particular Australians.</para><para>It seems to me that this is what this government is trying to hide from us. This is deliberate policy by this government to hide the truth. If the claims I have made are wrong, let it be demonstrated that I am wrong by putting the documents forward. As I said the other day, there are many issues here that I wish to pursue, and I expect that I will pursue them at length. I anticipate that, when those answers come back in, other issues will need to be examined as well. There may well be a need for us to put to this chamber a request for a Senate inquiry to demonstrate—once again, if the government is right—that its hands are clean, that it has not been involved in a conspiracy to undermine the wages and conditions of these particular Victorians, that it has not been involved in any illegal activity involving Mr Townshend or his company, that it has not been involved in actions to ensure that witnesses before courts in this country perjure themselves and that actions have not been taken by this government to encourage others to engage in assault against citizens of this country.</para><para>It will no doubt be argued by this government that it knew nothing of these matters. Well, produce the files! The officers told us before the estimates committees that they have had quite extensive involvement with the company and with the company's solicitors, which just so happens to be the same solicitors used by a senior minister in this government. I think these questions do require further inquiry. I trust my colleagues agree with me.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>25414</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise very briefly to explain to the Senate the reason why I asked Senator Carr how long he sought leave to take note of a statement by the government.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Shayne (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Murphy)</inline>—Are you seeking leave to make some comments in that respect?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>—No, I am speaking to the motion.

On 26 May 1978 the then Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the then incoming government. The then Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently, on 16 October 1991 the then government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The current government in June 1996 affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation.</para><para>This list does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the following Senate Standing Committees: Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Privileges, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances, Senator's Interests and Scrutiny of Bills. However, such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered.</para><para>Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA) primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee. However, responses to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an executive minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an executive minute within 6 months of tabling of a report. The committee monitors the provision of such responses.</para><para>The entry on this list for a report of the JCPAA containing only administrative recommendations is annotated to indicate that the response is to be provided in the form of an executive minute. Consequently, any other government response is not required. However, any reports containing policy recommendations are included in this report as requiring a government response.</para><para>Legislation and other committees report on bills and on the provisions of bills. Only those reports in this category that make recommendations which cannot readily be addressed during the consideration of the bill, and therefore require a response, are listed. The list also does not include reports by legislation committees on estimates or scrutiny of annual reports, unless recommendations are made that require a response.</para><para>A guide to the legend

I am proposing these amendments so that the legislation will be effective. Unless these amendments are accepted by the parliament, the government's legislation will be substantially ineffective. The reason for that is that nothing in this legislation, or in any proposed amendments to this legislation of which I am aware, will prevent the non-Australian based interactive gambling sites or services from taking advantage of the government's legislation. In other words, these organisations will in fact be able to conduct gambling services from outside Australia to Australian citizens. Despite what the minister said, this legislation therefore will be next to useless, unfortunately. </para><para>Amendment (4) defines an overseas gambling service. It is described as a non-Australian based interactive service which provides a service in the course of carrying on a business using the Internet, broadcasting or datacasting, and does not have an Australian-provider link. You will note that I have dealt with the issue of agents and intermediaries in this amendment. I think Senator Greig raised this very important matter. I am aware that the National Office for the Information Economy, NOIE, at page 25, used the arguments that `overseas operators could use an intermediary to avoid financial controls'. This amendment counteracts that situation. This amendment spells out that any agent or intermediary is included in the definition of a non-Australian based interactive gambling service—an overseas gambling service—and would include associated companies such as hotels and casinos if they are part of the business. I challenge anyone to deny that that ties up those intermediaries which are chosen to avoid financial controls. </para><para>The key issue in all of these amendments is that if you go to the question of money and ensure, by dint of the legislation, that it would be imprudent financially for overseas gambling services to undertake services to Australian customers then that is the answer. There have been all sorts of arguments put forward that generally it is technically very difficult because of ISPs and cooperation and all the rest of it. This has got nothing to do with that. This is to do with hitting them where it hurts, and that is in the back pocket. Once you start hitting them in the back pocket, they will find somewhere else to go. Later, there will be proposals from me and Senator Brown so that the contracts become unenforceable. The banking industry would be required to come into the picture. It is unfortunately necessary for me to explain that situation, because to deal with these two amendments in isolation makes it very difficult to explain. </para><para>I will foreshadow for the committee what I am going to do later when I define, in amendment No. 3, what a prohibited payment is. All financial transactions are covered. The term `payment' would be defined inclusively to cover a wide range of payment media, including currency, cheques, credit card transactions and electronic transfers of funds such as direct debit and direct credit. So that the minister can understand this, I will quote from page 35 of the NOIE report. It states:</para><quote><para>Other payment types such as cheque ... do not identify merchants by type of service ...</para></quote><para>That may be so, but these amendments introduce such an element of uncertainty into gambling transactions with overseas operators that the amendments will act as a powerful deterrent. Overseas operators will be dissuaded when dealing with Australian customers if their money is at risk by law. That is the way to fix it all up. I do not know what the government is frightened of. The banking industry may be yelling in the background, but it would be very sad if the government were taking notice of the banking industry, because the banking industry itself has admitted certain things.</para><para>I draw the attention of the chamber to what the Australian Bankers Association has said in answer to questions from the South Australian Select Interactive Home Gambling Committee about other means of telecommunications. There were certain questions asked of the Australian Bankers Association, and it made certain things clear. The main force behind the South Australian inquiry was the Hon. Nick Xenophon of the South Australian Legislative Assembly. The answers that were given are very revealing as to what the banking industry itself is able to let us know about Visa cards, for example. This is what the banking industry said to that committee:</para><quote><para>Effective December 2000, Visa Issuers—</para></quote><para>that is, banks—</para><quote><para>must inform their cardholders via the cardholder agreement that a Visa card may not be used for any illegal purchase.</para></quote><para>Is this committee aware of that? The banking industry went on to say:</para><quote><para>This is a reminder of the cardholder's responsibility to ascertain the legality of Internet gambling in his country of domicile.</para><para>Effective December 2000, Visa Issuers may systematically decline online gambling to meet local regulations, or for their own reasons.</para></quote><para>The banks are saying that. What guarantee has the government got from the banks? If the banks are being critical of this approach, what are they now saying to the government? Is the minister aware of what the banks said to the South Australian inquiry? Are they saying one thing to the committee—when they are under the provisions of the South Australian legislature and its standing orders in respect of committees—and another thing to the federal government? The banking industry are saying that they do have a role to play in this. They have also indicated:</para><quote><para>Visa requires Internet gambling merchants to:</para><para>	Identify the transaction as originating from a betting/gambling merchant by using the merchant category code ...</para></quote><para>That is all right for the organisations here in Australia, but under this legislation those organisations are no longer able to conduct gaming operations. That opens it up again to the internationals. </para><para>As I have pointed out—and I will deal with it further—the banking industry says it is quite clear that it is able to respond to situations where transactions have been conducted illegally. Just to reinforce that, I will quote from the transcript of the South Australian inquiry. The Hon. Nick Xenophon said:</para><quote><para>Further to what the Chairman said about 90 million transactions, you do see a clear distinction between a gambler who has lost money taking a proactive role to contact the bank, and the banks themselves having to be policemen of the scheme?</para></quote><para>On behalf of the Australian Bankers Association, Mr Gilbert responded:</para><quote><para>Absolutely. If the community is given a right that is exercisable in those circumstances, of course we would recognise it and are quite happy to do so. That is what the law of the land provides. There is no equivocation on that. We would be very concerned about transferring the cost of detecting, identifying and policing onto the private sector, which is simply providing financial services for a whole range of legitimate consumer activities.</para></quote><para>Why wouldn't the government, in the end, agree to the proposition that a contract between a punter and an operating overseas site is unenforceable? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>25427</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I say to Senator Harradine that he, Senator Brown and many of us want to limit as much as possible the ability of people to gamble with offshore service providers.

I do not accept the throw-in-the-towel, hopeless position of Senator Greig that it is all too hard and you just do not do anything about it. You have to do your best. I do not think it is responsible behaviour on the part of the government to essentially adopt Senator Harradine's approach, which is to make a virtue of uncertainty—make it so uncertain as to who might be hit with what. This is just random fire being sprayed around, and you hope that that will be sufficient to deter.</para></talk.start><para>When I look at Senator Harradine's amendments—and bear in mind that we have had these for only a day or two—I see that the issue does require considerable careful examination of the implications. For example, this amendment talks in terms of customers. I presume a customer is meant to be a gambler or someone who is lodging a bet. But it does not give me any consolation to see a broad term such as `customer' used. You could have a customer obtaining services from someone who happens to be providing interactive gambling services but who also runs subsidiary services, whether it is operating a pizza service on the side as part of the casino operation or whether that person deals in other equipment that you could argue is for the benefit of an interactive gambling service. You may well have a host of unintended consequences.</para><para>When I look at the offence provision, I see that a person is guilty of an offence if a person makes or receives a prohibited payment. Given that we are all aware of the difficulties of taking action against someone on the other side of the world who might be providing a service or receiving a payment, and given their relative ease of dealing with someone who makes a payment in Australia, it seems to me overwhelmingly likely that this would make it a criminal offence for everyone who makes a bet in Australia with an offshore service provider. That cannot be good social policy. As we know, there are 290,000 problem gamblers. Most of these are not people who are acting rationally, or they would stop gambling. If you have people betting offshore beyond their means, to make it a criminal offence does not seem to be a way to help those people.</para><para>I say to Senator Harradine: we have sympathy for the general proposition that we should be doing what we can to limit their ability to gamble offshore, and to limit financial transactions as much as possible may well be a way to go. As I have already indicated to Senator Harradine, we have attempted to formulate some words which would go to the enforceability of illegal gaming transactions. This is the advice that I have received. I have not been sitting down with banks or anyone else, trying to work through precisely how these things would operate. It is a very arcane jurisdiction. I had Nick Xenophon explaining charge-back arrangements to me. I have no idea how clearing house operations work in practice.</para><para>All I know is that there are probably many credit provider agreements that you would have to wade through in great detail because they would probably have access to the world's best lawyers. You would have to very carefully and scientifically analyse the impact of what looks, on the face of it, to be a simple proposition: let us ban credit card transactions. If I get a statement from Visa because I bought a book overseas, it just tells me that Mark Bishop Pty Ltd sold me the book. I say, `I've never had any dealings with Mark Bishop Pty Ltd.' It just happens to be the name that that shop uses for its own purposes. It could just as easily be called Joint Venture No. 4 Pty Ltd.</para><para>In all sorts of ways, it needs a great deal of careful consideration and analysis. I am just not attracted to the idea that we should make a virtue of confusion by going ahead and doing something that looks like a good idea at the time and that throws up a lot of unintended consequences. Everyone throws their hands up in the air and says, `This is chaos,' and Senator Harradine says, `There you go, we have achieved our principal effect: we have scared a lot of people off.' A more responsible approach to take is to have this matter carefully examined, and we certainly have that in mind. Senator Vanstone wrote a letter to Senator Woodley yesterday that gives a commitment to having these matters carefully examined at the Ministerial Council on Gambling.</para><para>Senator Brown's amendment commends itself to the government. It provides a power to make regulations which would allow for an agreement to be unenforceable and to have no effect where it provides for the payment of money for the supply of an illegal interactive gambling service and that civil proceedings do not lie against a person to recover money alleged to have been won from or paid in connection with an illegal interactive gambling service. It puts a requirement on the minister to take all reasonable steps to ensure that regulations are made for the purpose within nine months. It makes it clear what direction the parliament wants to go in. It obliges the minister to take all reasonable steps to provide regulations that will address that issue.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order, because I do not know what the minister is talking about.

My principal point remains that we should not be looking for a quick fix on the run. We should put ourselves in a position where we can take considered action after the matter has been thoroughly examined both at the ministerial council level and at, presumably, various other technical levels. Then you have an obligation on the minister to take all reasonable steps to introduce regulations that will give maximum effect to that statutory intent. It seems to me that that is a much safer way to proceed. You are much more likely to achieve your end objective and you are much more likely to not have a whole host of unintended consequences. For those reasons, whilst I have sympathy for what Senator Harradine is proposing to do, I think it is too complex to put something in in the hope that it will improve the situation when it may well have the opposite effect. We would rather get it right.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This puts us under pressure to take action and to carefully consider the position. There are a number of things that are being considered. As we know, Nick Xenophon was doing the rounds the other day, and he put forward a proposal which in the short time available has been considered. There are a number of other matters. Presumably, if the states are serious about harm minimisation approaches, they may well have gone down this track to some extent. There is a proposal to conduct an independent study into current ATM card technology. There are a number of issues that need to be considered in detail. That is why I am foreshadowing that the government is attracted to Senator Brown's approach, because it both gives us time to get it right and puts us under an obligation to take the matter further as quickly as we can.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>25429</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in support of Senator Harradine's amendments. What Senator Harradine is proposing is actually a reality. All of us know that banks outsource simple functions like the processing of cheques. That is a normal function of banking that is accepted today. In that same process we have companies like E-success—who have a subsidiary called Citadel—and Falcon, who also has a subsidiary company. Their function is to vet a card transaction in the time between it being implemented by the customer and the service being delivered by the provider. Why is this already in existence? It is in existence because we have electronic fraud. We already have a process for the step between the customer paying for the service and the provider supplying that service to check whether that card is legitimate. There is no reason whatsoever that that function could not be extended to check whether it is an Australian based card that is paying for an offshore Internet gambling function. There are two very simple steps that could be put into a process that already exists. That is why I favour Senator Harradine's process, because the ability to do that is already there.

In terms of what other consequences flow, that would be a function of what is provided in the criminal law itself. And you often find, for example, that there is no penalty imposed on a mere purchaser; it is only on the provider. You may well find, for example, that the benefits are all one way.</para></talk.start><para>I seem to recall there were a range of cases on this in terms of void if against public policy and gambling and I think in some respects that operated to mean that a gambler could get his money back but a service provider could not, so there is not an equality of treatment necessarily. It often depended where the loss had fallen as to whether the courts would simply let the loss lie where it fell or intervene and allow action to be taken to recover it to protect the interests of the party with less bargaining power—that being the gambler.</para><para>It simply highlights the fact that we are all wanting to go in the same direction. No-one is for a moment standing here saying, `People want to gamble offshore—away they go,' although I think you can probably distinguish between people who pay cash and people who bet with credit cards, because you can say that the person betting with a credit card may well be betting beyond their means and ability to pay, whereas a person who has cash, presumably, at least has the current wherewithal. But in principle we are all trying to do what we can to limit the ability of Australians to gamble offshore, because if we are making it illegal to gamble here we should therefore be doing our best to limit their ability to do the same thing elsewhere.</para><para>I am simply concerned to ensure that we get it right and I feel profoundly uncomfortable with going ahead with what might look like a simple proposition but which may take you to all sorts of areas that you do not want to end up in. That is why the cautious approach is the right one here. It does mean that we are not just walking away from it saying that we will have a look at it later when we have a review. The amendment of Senator Brown actually does put the onus very much on the government to conduct inquiries, to look into what is feasible and then to take appropriate action.

With this in mind, I am writing to outline the work being done by the Commonwealth and the Ministerial Council on Gambling in relation to problem gambling. I also hope to underscore the Commonwealth's determination in this area, inform you of the work that we are planning to undertake in the future and make a commitment that the Commonwealth will proceed with the development of a National Harm Minimisation Strategy on Problem Gambling.</para><para>As you may be aware, after a period of inaction by the states, the Commonwealth established the Ministerial Council on Gambling. At the Council's meeting in April 2001, as a first step towards a common approach, a National Strategic Framework on Problem Gambling was agreed to. The Framework aims to provide a platform for the sharing of information and good practice between jurisdictions on issues associated with problem gambling. It will also build on work already undertaken collaboratively between jurisdictions and be a vehicle for the development of some national initiatives. The National Strategic Framework has four themes; prevention, early intervention and continuing support, building effective partnerships, and national research and evaluation.</para><para>At the same meeting, the Council also agreed to evaluate the impacts of pre-commitment schemes, the phasing out of note acceptors, breaks in gaming machine operation and linked jackpots. These topics will be added to the work program of the working party on research. The working party will report back to the Ministerial Council on the current research programs and also facilitate new research initiatives.</para><para>Other relevant matters that are under active consideration by the Ministerial Council include setting limits to the further growth in the numbers of poker machines in any area, restricting the hours that poker machines might operate and placing messages on machines about the amounts won and lost, and time spent playing.</para><para>Only recently, I also announced the membership of the National Advisory Body on Gambling.

I have essentially been concerned to try and judge these issues on the merits and to look at what seems to me to make sense and what does not. I simply say again that you say it looks like eminent commonsense on the face of it but I am very nervous about something that makes it an offence—I presume a criminal offence—for a person to make a payment to an offshore gambling provider. That just means an ordinary common garden Australian who has a bet on the Internet commits a criminal offence. It does not seem to me to be what we are on about here. We are trying to make it very difficult for offshore service providers to cater for Australian gamblers.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Harradine's notion of maximum uncertainty, I am sure, is directed entirely to those providers to try and discourage them, whereas the mere fact that they are offshore makes it much less likely that you will be able to do anything tangible about their behaviour—certainly in terms of it being an offence. I would have thought that again it would only be if they came to Australia that you could prosecute them because you do not have an extraterritorial power that is recognised internationally. If these services are being provided from the Caribbean, you really cannot do anything about it in terms of it being an offence. All you are left with is an offence committed by ordinary Australians who have made what might be a very modest bet—it might be someone who can well afford to lose substantial sums of money having a modest bet on an irregular basis and they commit the offence. That is not where I would want to end up in all this. I think what we are trying to do is say that consumers are not the problem here; the only people who are wanting online gambling are the providers because they see a lot of money to be made out of it. We should be making their lives as difficult as possible. I agree with Senator Harradine on that. It is then a matter of how you can best achieve that outcome. Even on the face of it, the amendment that Senator Harradine has put before the committee just needs further work.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>25431</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was not asking that question to take a partisan position as to the utility of the amendment moved by Senator Harradine one way or the other.

You have just informed us there have been a series of negotiations in your office—some of those you have participated in, some you haven't. I have just been handed an amendment to be moved by Senator Brown in due course as to the making of regulations in respect of illegal interactive gambling services.</para></talk.start><para>What I am trying to establish is: what process has the government undertaken to go through now?

Do you think that is going to stand up? I would have loved to have done that because I think that is a great joke. The punter could run up a lot of winnings and then, if he runs up losings, he dobs the overseas site into his bank and says `Don't pay.' Are we being realistic here?

My understanding from first principles of criminal law is that you can make something an offence in any form you would like. I recall, for example, that it was illegal under the Police Offences Act to provide services for prostitution, but it was not illegal for someone to take advantage of those services. Guttercrawling used to be a way of frightening people off. If you were driving too slowly down the street, they would pick you up for guttercrawling even though they really knew what you were on about. You had a situation where the offence was not on the part of the consumer; it was on the part of the service provider. I do not think we ever called them `service providers' in those days, but that is probably what they were doing. </para></talk.start><para>The criminal law can go wherever it wants to. Parliament is the ultimate authority. If it wants to ignore or modify or have a one-sided outcome, it can do all of those things. That is my understanding. Maybe you could get into arguments about whether you are aiding and abetting, and again, I suppose, you could have a specific provision that said, `No conduct on the part of a gambler should be construed as aiding and abetting or colluding with' or whatever else, even though you say you might be happily taking advantage of the service while you are winning and then dobbing them in when you lose. You can spell it out in any form you like, essentially.</para><para>All those issues deserve to be explored. They are social policy judgments. Some people might say that the maximum deterrent effect is to tell all these punters that they are actually at risk of going to jail if they gamble offshore and so there is a social purpose to be achieved. On the other hand, people might say, `Well, they are really quasi-innocent victims and we should be focusing on the real offenders.' It is certainly an area of legitimate public debate that should be carefully considered.

The government has the ability to get the expert advice and to come up with the regulations, and then it is up to us to tackle those regulations in here if we think that they are faulty.</para></talk.start><para>Amendments not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>25434</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (1) to (15) on sheet 2216:</para></talk.start><quote><para> (1)	Clause 3, page 2 (line 20), after “Australia”, insert “or overseas”.</para><para> (2)	Clause 3, page 2 (after line 20), after paragraph (a), insert:</para><para>	(aa)	prohibiting foreign-based interactive gambling service providers from soliciting, or providing interactive gambling services to, persons resident in Australia;

It is not about correcting the current problems that are essentially the responsibility of the states. We have always taken the view that we have clear constitutional power, under the telecommunications power, to deal with interactive activities in all their manifestations but that poker machines and their regulation are a matter for the states. It is true that technology now allows a number of things to occur in terms of linking poker machines—for data and monitoring purposes, for example, which can be quite helpful in assessing the activities. But linked jackpots, which I think is what you have in mind as the vice you seek to remedy, are really part and parcel of the way in which poker machines have evolved. It is very much open to the states to deal with the excesses of the poker machine business. We would certainly encourage them to do that, and we will be doing that through the ministerial council and elsewhere. But we do not believe that this act, which is essentially concerned with interactive gambling activities, should be used as a means of incidentally dealing with the offline old forms of gambling.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>25439</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—But it is not.

I am sure all senators have read the amendments including, at the back, the section headed `Offence of providing an Australian-based interactive gambling service to customers in designated countries'. In brief, this addresses my concern right from the outset that the majority in this place is wanting to move to prevent Internet gambling because of the damage it causes to Australian society, but the legislation ostensibly allows gambling houses in Australia to export Internet gambling facilities all around the world to other countries. It is obvious that what is bad for Australian households is bad for households elsewhere around the world. This provision allows another country which does not want Australian service providers exporting gambling into its domestic situation and which has similar legislation in place to say to the Australian government, `Please put us on the list as a designated country to make it illegal for a gambling house in Australia to export to us.' That is a good neighbour policy. I think it is somewhat of a breakthrough in terms of innovative legislation, and I strongly commend it to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>25441</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too will be supporting these amendments. I think they are important. Initially my colleague Senator Woodley and I were concerned about the prospect of Australia's indicating that there were dangers—as indeed there are—associated with a massive expansion of interactive gambling online. To us it seemed to be untenable to say that this was a danger for our own citizens but we were not prepared to protect other countries that thought likewise. This is a good compromise to that blanket ban. It still allows Australian companies, which in some states at least are well regulated, to provide a service which is welcome in some parts and to some people. So this is a good solution which does allow other countries to opt in to our ban. I hope that it will be an encouragement to many countries around the world, when they examine the potential dangers of interactive gambling, to take a lead from Australia and that it will be easier for them to do so because of our precedent and our willingness to take on board their concerns about operatives in this country working in their country. I will vote for these amendments with some enthusiasm.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>25441</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government also accepts the proposition. It is very much in line with what I have been saying consistently for some weeks and months now. We do not have jurisdiction over other countries and we have no right to presume that they do not want certain types of social activity but, where they make it plain through their parliaments that they do have a similar view, we have an obligation to respond positively.

Mr Kerry Packer has already said that, if his operations in online gambling are frustrated in Australia, he will move to Vanuatu—an obvious outcome. I do not mean to single him out—it could apply to anybody or any organisation—but Australian companies could still locate themselves in a country where there was no prohibition, such as Vanuatu, and continue their services into those countries that would theoretically be banned from receiving those services from within Australia. So the argument to me is a nonsense.

They include the effectiveness and operation of the legislation. They look at the exemptions which have been agreed to—wagering, lotteries and the like. They also look at the technological developments, which I think are likely to develop and arise over the next two years or so. I think it is important that we have this review and that it takes place sooner than was planned. In that period of time there will be an opportunity to see, as I said, how effective the bill has been. I think we will also see in that period of time a development of interactive gambling through datacasting, through digital television and the like. Already, as I mentioned in my second reading contri-bution, there are many organisations which have identified those last two areas I ment-ioned—interactive television—as being opportunities for exploitation and great opportunities for generating wealth, very often at other people's expense. I commend this amendment as being a way in which we can see at a sooner stage how well this ban is being put into effect.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>25445</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will be supporting that amendment. I want to comment on some public response to this legislation as it proceeds. Lasseters say that the legislation and amendments that were passed today have set a dangerous precedent for global Internet censorship and call the amendment, which is the one to do with designated countries, `totally unnecessary', but then go on to threaten the minister with legal action, although the minister has not done anything yet. They also say that they might seek compensation in the High Court. In a very twisted argument, they say, `We have voluntarily adopted the policy'—that is, of stopping players from registering—`if they reside in states or countries prohibiting online gambling on religious or legislative grounds.' They have a policy that they say is the equivalent to what the Senate has passed today; but the Senate cannot do it, the parliament cannot do it—Lasseters can. </para></talk.start><para>We have this extraordinary situation of a big gambling company threatening action against the parliament moving to prohibit online gambling from Australia being exported to a country that says, `Please, do not send it to us because we have similar laws to you, and we do not want it exported to citizens in our country either. You do not allow it in Australia; we do not want it exported to our country.' What an extraordinary thing from Lasseters. Yet, after saying that they are looking at the law and what they might do about challenging the minister abusing the powers and questioning in the High Court the constitutional rights to enact the law—that is, questioning our right in the Senate to amend this legislation as we see fit—they go on to bring out the biggest threat of the lot, the daddy of threats. They say that this legislation may be subject to action through the World Trade Organisation. Aren't Australians going to be glad to hear Lasseters threatening us with the World Trade Organisation because we are trying to regulate gambling in this country and, in so doing, say, `We want to extend the same sorts of opportunities to other countries that may be affected by this'?</para><para>I think Lasseters need to take an orange juice, to settle down a little, to think about their responsibility as a corporate citizen in the same way that we are considering our responsibility as a parliamentary citizen and to come up with something more construc- tive than that. I think they may well do themselves a service if they think much more about how they can make their services unavailable to problem gamblers altogether, whether they be overseas or here. I know Lasseters have a big clientele overseas. If they say that do not operate where it is against religious tenets, then they need to think about whether they should operate in circumstances which are socially repugnant, whether or not they are religious. It is a nice try from Lasseters, but it will not wash.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>25446</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to direct a question to the minister.

Therefore, because of the difficulty of anticipating precisely what might emerge but recognising that there may well be some relatively harmless categories of interactive programming run by the television networks, the government's amendments will exempt such services that are expressly and exclusively associated with a particular broadcast program or solely provided for the purpose of promoting goods or services other than gambling services that are the subject of advertisements that are broadcast—in other words, t-commerce.

Amendment (2) has the ability to insert in subsection (1) the ability for a person to place a bet by telephone as a service to the extension as it relates to a bet on an event, a series of events or a contingency in horseracing, harness racing, greyhound racing or a sporting event.</para><para>One of the primary reasons for moving this amendment is that, in the government's original bill, there was an exclusion that would allow those people with a disability to be able to use the Internet to place a wagering bet—only those with a disability. TABs around Australia now have the ability with voice recognition to recognise the voice of a disabled person. That is why we are asking for this to be inserted in this section of the bill. It would allow the disabled to use a telephone with voice recognition to place a wagering bet with their TAB. That is the purpose of that section of the amendments.</para><para>The purpose of amendment (4) is to bring the Commonwealth legislation closer to the state requirements. Subsection (4) of amendment (4) would have the function of excluding any overseas providers for the purpose of placing a wagering bet in Australia, and I believe that should receive the support of the majority of the senators in the chamber. The intention of the amendment is to mirror the state licensing requirements for wagering and, in doing so, it would exclude a service provider from outside Australia providing a service for wagering within Australia. I commend both of the amendments, particularly the amendments that will allow the disabled in Australia to use voice recognition to place their wagering bets.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>25448</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will just indicate why the government opposes these amendments. Insofar as telephone betting is concerned, I do not quite understand what Senator Harris's desire to extend the ability for disabled people to use the Internet has to do with telephone betting. Telephone betting is a legal activity now and I do not think anyone has proposed to ban it or indeed make it subject for the first time to Australian licensing requirements. Telephone typewriter facilities have been available for quite some time for those who are not able to use the telephone for making a voice call. They can now type in the message that can be then transmitted via a computer and converted into a voice call at the other end. It is perfectly possible for disabled people to use the telephone for betting, and I do not therefore see why we should be imposing restrictions on telephone betting.</para></talk.start><para>As far as the second proposal is concerned, I am not clear whether this is only designed to apply to activities in Australia or whether it is effectively saying that you cannot provide wagering services from offshore unless you are licensed by an Australian authority. If it is the latter, given that we are allowing sports betting to occur, it does not seem to me to make much sense to say that you can bet on Australian events and with Australian providers but you cannot go offshore. You may be a very irregular punter—you may simply want to bet on Ascot once a year. You want to check the best odds, so you go to William Hill or Ladbrokes. They have better odds, but because they are not licensed in Australia to provide that service somehow that becomes illegal. That is illogical.</para><para>If we are providing an exemption for sports betting, we can obviously address some of the excesses of that activity by a variety of means, which the states keep swearing on a stack of bibles they are about to get around to doing. Insofar as the activity itself is concerned, I do not see why we should suddenly be imposing a licensing requirement when the Commonwealth's responsibility is to regulate the activity itself, and the states can impose any additional obligations that they choose.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>25449</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the minister for his response. The clear intention is to exclude a provider of a service from outside of Australia. The majority of punters who are going overseas normally have arrangements with their own Australia based betting services. This amendment is not intended in any way to exclude an Australian citizen who is outside of Australia from placing a bet with a service provider from within Australia. Its clear intent is to ensure that nobody from offshore can provide a service unless they have a licence to provide that service that is authorised by a state or a territory. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, we already have one service provider in Vanuatu who has a turnover of over half a billion dollars annually. That does not bring any benefits to the Australian people, nor does that person pay any turnover tax to the state governments.</para></talk.start><para>This is the purpose of these amendments: to ensure that a wagering facility cannot be put in place unless that person has a licence that is granted by a state or a territory. It is not intended to exclude a person from being overseas and betting on a service that is provided by an Australian licensed provider; it is to ensure that we do not end up with a proliferation of service providers offshore who are actually deriving the benefits from their businesses and not returning anything to Australia. Very briefly, I read into the record in my speech earlier a section about the approximate $600 million which the racing industry pays by way of fees or taxes to the state governments. These amendments are distinctly directed towards ensuring that the industry will continue to be Australian based and not run by a service provider outside of Australia.</para><para>Amendments not agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, George (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator George Campbell)</inline>—That makes your other amendment redundant, Senator Harris.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>25449</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Democrat amendment No. 2 on sheet XX222:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(2)	Amendment (25), after subclause 8B(1), insert:</para><para>	(1A)	Subsection (1) does not apply to a service unless such other conditions (if any) as are specified in the regulations have been satisfied.</para></quote><para>This is a similar amendment to our amendment No. 1.

The opposition want to make five points at the outset and I will develop each briefly.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, the bill still permits Australians access to Internet wagering and we make the obvious point that wagering is hardly immune from causing gambling problems. Wagering is as much of a problem in terms of problem gambling as any other form of gambling and to exclude it seems, to the opposition, to demonstrate the extent of the hypocrisy that the government displays with this bill. If the bill does become law, Australian gamblers will be able to gamble away all they have and more on many offshore sites that they will still be able to access. Problem gamblers are almost 1½ times more likely to prefer gambling on racing to casino gambling. It is difficult to identify any sensible rationale for the government's exclusion of wagering from this bill. The government also has chosen to exclude sports betting from the bill, contradicting its decision to restrict new forms of gambling.</para><para>The series of amendments exclude wagering and the other forms from the scope of the interactive gambling ban, with the exception of ball by ball or microevent wagering, which will continue to be prohibited. It is clear that the amendments proposed by the government and the crossbench and minor parties cater to the demands of the racing industry and associated industries. The government has stated that it remains `concerned about the impact of Internet wagering but recognises that this concern needs to be balanced against the impact of a ban on a bona fide and long-established industry in Australia'.</para><para>I stated in my speech in the second reading debate and again tonight that the bill still permits Australians access to Internet wagering, and wagering is hardly immune from causing gambling problems. This amendment to exclude interactive wagering and the other exemptions, when wagering is as much a problem in terms of problem gambling as any other form of gambling, demonstrates, as I said earlier, the extent of the hypocrisy that runs rampant through this bill.</para><para>The amendments place beyond a doubt everyone's suspicions that the government's primary concern in the passage of this legislation is not the protection of problem gamblers. The government's decision to cave in to the relatively brief but intensive lobbying by the wagering industry is just further proof to the opposition of the government's ad hoc policy approach in this whole area. It demonstrates to us that its selective approach is the reason why it cannot come up with a sensible and effective policy for interactive gambling that minimises interactive gambling to the greatest extent possible.</para><para>During a recent interview, the minister said:</para><quote><para>There's a huge difference between picking up your phone, putting on a few bets at the TAB, and sitting there with a remote control and clicking your head off until you've lost all of what you had, and more ...</para></quote><para>I make the obvious point that if gamblers play on Australian Internet gambling sites they could not gamble all of what they had and more because there are expenditure thresholds imposed by the legitimate operators in this country. If this bill does become law, Australian gamblers will be able to gamble all they have and more on many offshore sites that they will still be able to access.</para><para>My second point in this context is that the Productivity Commission found that problem gamblers are almost 1½ times more likely to prefer gambling on racing to casino gambling. The minister undoubtedly knows this—I tried to bring it to his attention before. We make the obvious point that wagering is not any safer than any other form of gambling. Wagering is not immune to the social effect of problem gambling. It is impossible for us to identify any consistent or sensible policy rationale behind this.</para><para>Furthermore, the government has stated repeatedly that it is concerned to prevent any increase in the accessibility of gambling and that is one of the drivers behind this whole approach. We ask this question in passing: if that is one of the drivers that motivates us in this debate, why has the government chosen to exclude wagering and sporting events from the bill?</para><para>Sports betting is still a relatively new form of gambling and is highly suited to Internet and home based gambling. The Productivity Commission report observed that it is likely that sports betting: </para><quote><para>... will grow rapidly via the internet, largely creating a new market, though there may be some shift away from wagers on racing.</para></quote><para>Essentially, then, the government's own amendments and the amendments of the minor parties, catering to the requests of the horse racing and other existing industries, are encouraging the expansion of an entirely new gambling form in this country. Hypocritical? We say yes.</para><para>Finally, the government fails to mention that this bill will permit one form of gambling on the Internet to continue unabated and essentially unregulated, or at least not regulated to the same extent as the existing Internet gambling industries that the bill will prohibit Australians from accessing.</para><para>Bringing that together, we ask the obvious question that a range of people have been discussing in this debate and in the press over recent times: how is wagering different? How and why are problem gamblers who choose to bet in the various forms of the racing industry around the country tolerated? Why is that encouraged? Why does this government allow these new products and these new forms of betting to take place in the marketplace when Minister Alston, the Prime Minister and the government have said that the ostensible reason for their intention to ban Internet gambling in various forms is that they want to prevent the further spread of gambling in this country?</para><para>To prevent the further spread of gambling is their whole rationale. But this bill, and the amendments we are currently discussing, send out the clear message that they exclude new forms of gambling—Internet wagering and Internet sports betting—which are developing and which technology will allow to spread. So the conclusion we draw is that this bill and the comments of the government are about accommodating new forms of betting. They are about accommodating racing industry and sports betting interests in new mediums of communication.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name></talker><para>—But you are against it, are you?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>—You say this bill is about preventing further forms of gambling and further access to gambling and about attending to existing social problems, yet in this debate and these amendments you expressly provide and allow—and, by implication, encourage—new forms of gambling in new forms of communication.

In brief, if somebody bets on their card overseas, the overseas gambling house cannot enforce the payment of the debt that has accrued through that bet. This is the best way of ensuring that overseas gambling houses do not take Australian bets. Instead of saying, `We can't prohibit you from setting up in Vanuatu,' we say, `If Australians bet on your service in Vanuatu, you can't enforce the agreement. It is illegal to enforce the agreement whereby the debtor—the person who has placed the bet—has to pay you through the credit card.' </para><para>Senator Harradine, Senator Harris and I have all tried to have this measure instituted tonight as part of the legislation, but the government and the opposition opposed it. However, it is breakthrough legislation. The government wanted nine months to consider it. We have come to an agreement that it will be within six months. The government then has the opportunity to ensure that there are no hidden pitfalls or glitches. It is a very central amendment to this legislation. It provides for the all important restriction that we, at this end of the house, want to see, that is, overseas gambling houses cannot provide for, or attract, Australians to bet because they will not want to because there will be quite widespread default on debts.</para><para>Gambling is a business of gaining a debt for the client and a profit for the provider. That is what it is about. A person who provides gambling facilities cannot survive if the punter can default. This is a method of allowing the punter to default. The outcome would be a prohibition on Australians when they try to sign up to gambling houses overseas. It is not the best outcome, but it is the careful outcome. However, the government has come a long way towards accepting that unenforceability of agreements is a necessary requirement if we are going to stop people gambling overseas. The Prime Minister and ministers have all said that they wanted to achieve that aim. It is a pivotal amendment. It is going to take good faith and it has taken my good faith, I can tell you! It is going to take good faith from the government. The amendment speaks for itself, but it is very important and I commend it to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>25463</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support Senator Brown's amendment. As Senator Brown has said, we have tried this evening to ensure clarity in the bill. I believe that Senator Harradine's amendments that required penalties for services provided by offshore entities, because of the ability of the banking industry with today's technology, can achieve what Senator Harradine set out. When a single mainframe computer in one of three locations in the world can do the entire banking transactions for the world in a day, how difficult would it be to find out where a transaction came from? What Senator Brown is proposing would have to be the de facto of all de facto amendments, but I implore the committee to support it. I possibly have reservations about supporting it, because in actuality it will enact the ability for somebody to enter into a legal contract to receive a service or the supply of a product—and the product in this case is Internet gambling—and then allow that person to rescind that legal contract. That has implications that we may regret in future. Unfortunately, in light of the way the bill has been developing, this is our last chance. I commend the amendment to the committee.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>25463</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I suspect that the Russian Mafia and West Indian gangsters may not necessarily rely on the legal system to enforce the payment of debts. As Australians are driven by this legislation from safe, regulated Australian casinos onto unregulated, unsafe casinos, the possibility of international criminals bashing and killing defaulting Australians could become a reality. To be serious, this proposal from Senator Brown could work as a policy only after we have taken the time to consult with other governments. If one country anywhere allows the processing of casino credits, all that the Australian government would be doing by accepting this amendment would be creating a market for money laundering.</para></talk.start><para>No matter how much we dislike gambling, it is an international industry that is accessible from any computer, with unlimited options for sneaking financial transactions around regulators. Australia does not have the policy option that Australians can be prevented from online gambling—we have only the option as to whether the casinos most visited online by Australians are run by Australians, foreigners or crooks. Frankly, if the government is short-sighted enough to ban Australian online gambling businesses, I would much rather see Australians gambling at Ladbrokes.co.uk than at dodgy Russian sites.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>25463</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have got to the stage where, with the exemptions that are now in the legislation for certain types of Internet gambling from overseas, the utility of this is questionable.

Therefore, I wonder what the purpose of the amendment is. Is it or is it not a fact that an agreement between two parties to engage in illegal activity has no effect to the extent to which it provides for the payment of money for the supply of an illegal service, for example, and that civil proceedings do not lie against persons who have engaged in illegal activities, whether or not they be illegal interactive gambling?</para><para>So I really raise that point again. Is it or is it not a fact that (3) says:</para><quote><para> For the purposes of this section, an interactive gambling service is an <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">illegal interactive gambling service</inline> if, and only if, the provision of the service contravenes a provision of this Act that creates an offence.</para></quote><para>Could the minister point precisely now to the parts of the proposed act to which this amendment is referring? There are two things: firstly, whether or not at the moment civil proceedings do not lie against a person or persons who are engaged in an illegal activity if there is an agreement to engage in that illegal activity; and, secondly, could the minister point now to the areas in the legislation referred to in paragraph (3)?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>25464</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In relation to the first point, I think the situation is generally that the common law does not allow you to recover moneys paid pursuant to an illegal activity, that being void as against public policy. However, the Commonwealth position is always capable of being modified by statute or indeed overturned and in this instance, of course, you have every state and territory with a capacity to make their own rules of the game. So I think the purpose of this is really to put beyond doubt the fact that it is competent to protect an individual from having to pay money which he has paid pursuant to a gambling transaction that is illegal. It does in a sense clarify what Senator Harradine was raising earlier, where I took him to be saying that he did not think you could have a different regime for the customer on the one hand and the service provider on the other. I think that clearly this makes it clear that is the intention here.</para></talk.start><para>Although my memory of all of this from contract law days is pretty hazy, certainly I think we are trying to give effect to that original principle that you should protect the party with the weaker bargaining power from having to make the payment where the transaction itself is illegal. I do not suppose you have a situation where money is likely to go the other way, but if it did you could still preclude the service provider from recovery so that you could in fact have in these terms a win-win outcome for the customer and a lose-lose outcome for the service provider.</para><para>Insofar as (3) is concerned, clauses 15 and 15A, I am advised, contain the substantive offence provisions. This seems to be simply bringing together a regulation making power which makes it clearer, at the same time as indicating the general areas of power, that if it is an illegal activity then as a result of the commission of an offence it is an illegal activity for these purposes. Some might say that is surperfluous but I suppose draftsmen want to be absolutely sure that the position is clear.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>25464</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If I can just help Senator Harradine too, under proposed section 6 a service is prohibited if it is provided to customers using an Internet carriage service or if the service is provided in the course of carrying on a business and has an Australian customer link.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>25464</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I suspect it is there because otherwise it might be possible to argue that an interactive gambling service is illegal for other reasons and therefore you should not be able to recover a debt from a customer.

The essence of the amendment is that the government could, if they wished, structure the regulations in such a way to exclude an external lottery or wagering service. It does not in any way exclude it, but this amendment gives the government, when we have gone away from this bill, six months to reassess the situation. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The amendment inserts a clause 8E on page 9, line 14, at the end of clause 8. It clearly gives the government the ability in the regulations to exclude wagering services in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as are prescribed. It would then include a clause 8F to follow 8E, which would mirror exactly 8E but speak to copies for lotteries. That is the intention of the amendment. It is not to bind the government into having to do anything, but it would allow the government, if they so wished, to make regulations that would provide for the variation of 8A(2) in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as are prescribed in the regulation. It is not binding the government; it is merely providing a facility to the government that is identical to an amendment moved by Senator Brown that the government has accepted.

This is one minute past midnight, I would have thought, rather than five minutes to. In any event, we have essentially taken a decision not so long ago to say that, if activities are legal, you ought to be able to engage in them onshore and offshore. We rejected a proposal from Senator Harris to require offshore providers to obtain an Australian licence before they could provide services to Australian customers. This is really a slightly watered-down version of the same. To the extent it gives the government power to do it, sure, we will not have to do it now, but someone else might later. It really just attempts to do by the back door what you were not able to do by the front door. I simply cannot see the logic of it. You can say, `It's only giving powers to do things,' but that is the very point: why would you give power to exclude external wagering services unless they are licensed when we have already determined that that is not a sensible policy approach?</para></talk.start><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—I wish to record my support for that amendment.</para></talk.start><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported with amendments; report adopted.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>25466</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Alston</inline>) put:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><division><division.header><time.stamp>20:47:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.[ </para></division.header><para>(The Acting Deputy President—Senator H.G.P.

Above all, we should be looking at the provisions in the legislation for a taxpayers' top-up of 69 per cent for our superannuation, whereas in the community the average from employers for people in average workplaces is eight per cent. It is that single factor that gets the voters' ire up. It is not fair that parliamentarians are getting a big lump out of the taxpayers' purse to top up superannuation in a way that no other worker in the country can. I am one parliamentarian who wants to see it be fair.</para><para>I congratulate Mr Peter Andren, the member for Calare, in the House of Representatives, who moved extensive amendments to this legislation to make it fair but could not even get a seconder—and that was just yesterday.

So the public interest is high, and the public ability to comment on this is very clear. And what do we have here? The government and the opposition together trying to bypass that public interest, to cut it out—but to get through a piece of legislation so that the government at least can say, `Well, we've changed it so that parliamentarians won't be able to get access to their superannuation until they are 55. But guess what? That doesn't apply to us; that applies to the next lot of parliamentarians.' So even that provision will not be levied on current parliamentarians—even though most of them are safe because the people who are making these decisions are, in the main, over 55.

I agree with Senator Brown that this bill should not be granted an exemption from the cut-off. There should be a period in which the people of Australia can comment on this bill. That is what we are here for. We are here to reflect the wishes of the constituents that we represent. I believe that it is wrong in this case for this bill to be dealt with tonight. I believe that it should be referred to a committee and that it should be exposed to the rigour of comments from the Australian people. Not only should the superannuation issue be looked at; we should also most certainly look at the benefits paid to past prime ministers in the same light.

In this case we are disappointed that it has taken so long for the government to put forward any sort of reforms on parliamentary superannuation, so we are disinclined to not deal with them when they are presented. That is one of the reasons why we will support the exemption. One of the other main reasons is that it is a relatively simple bill and something that we have been calling for for some time. In fact, it reflects an amendment that I had already prepared for a bill which was due to come up a week and half or so ago. So I think we are ready to debate this bill. We had an inquiry into parliamentary superannuation in 1997, and this was a subject that was very much canvassed at that time. I would argue that this will be regarded as long overdue by people who made submissions to that inquiry and those who have made submissions to the more recent one on Mr Andren's bill. There are no surprises here. It does fall short of the ideal, and we will be pointing out in the debate where it falls short. I will have some amendments to deal with those shortcomings. At this stage we see no reason not to proceed with consideration of the bill.</para></talk.start><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.[ </para></division.header><para>(The Acting Deputy President—Senator H.G.P.

It is long overdue and it does not go far enough, but we think it is a small step in the right direction. I notice that the second reading speech of the minister talks about this being brought more into line with community standards. That is what so many people have been calling for for such a long time. Back in 1997, the Democrats initiated an inquiry into just this question. At that time, there was already—and, no doubt, there was for some decades until that point—dissatisfaction with the fact that a separate set of rules applied for parliamentarians, and a very generous set of rules at that, in terms of their superannuation retirement benefits.</para></talk.start></continue><para>For this reason, we do welcome it. I note, however, that the bill proposes to put these changes into effect before the next election. No doubt this has been done so the government not only can respond to the many thousands of complaints that I have received and that the superannuation committee has received but, more importantly, can have said by the time the election comes along, `We've done something about this.' We can give moderate support to this move. You could not call it reform, by any measure, but it does take away one of the most serious problems with the bill, and that is that parliamentarians are entitled to pensions provided they are in this place for eight years or three elections, as the case may be. It could mean that for a very long period there is an entitlement to a very substantial pension—much higher than most people can expect in their retirement.</para><para>It is important that we have at least reached this milestone. I hope that the Senate will consider the amendments the Democrats will put up. Essentially, they will go to a number of important areas. They will allow parliamentarians to opt out of the pension scheme that we currently have and into an accumulations scheme. We have picked up on Mr Andren's private member's bill, which allows parliamentarians to do just that—to opt out into something which is truly a community standards level of retirement benefits. We will also reduce the entitlements. This is what sticks in the craw of so many people in the community: the fact that, while their employer is contributing eight per cent of SG contributions to their superannuation, the notional contribution in this place is more like 69 per cent. So there is a massive difference in the amount of taxpayers' money which is going into entitlements. That is something that we cannot ignore in this debate.</para><para>We cannot in this legislation or in any other legislation force, or through amendment re-create, the parliamentary superannuation scheme into an accumulation scheme, and so the Democrats have opted to bring the parliamentary scheme into line with public service standards. So there will be a considerable reduction in contributions, at least in line with a group in society, the Public Service, where there is some rationale and fairness. Our amendments will deal with that question. They will also apply to the current membership. It is unconscionable that we would in this place make laws for members of parliament who are yet to arrive here and not make laws reducing entitlements for ourselves. It seems to lack any moral strength. It is certainly not fair to the next group of parliamentarians that comes along, when people in this place will continue, as long as they are here, to have a very generous entitlement indeed.</para><para>You could argue that we cannot do this—and no doubt we will hear this argument from the government when I come to put my amendments—and that this is acquiring property which is not on just terms. I would argue that it is a cancellation of a benefit. Of course there is only one way to put that to the test, and that is through the courts. We support the preservation to age 55, and I have drawn up amendments for the Democrats on a bill which was to have been dealt with last week—a minor bill regarding the surcharge—which would have done exactly that. Importantly, our final set of amendments will deal with an ongoing problem which the government refuses to face, and that is one of same sex entitlements. Anyone who does not have a spouse or a de facto spouse relationship in this place cannot pass on their entitlements by way of pension to their partner, and that is an ongoing problem which has not been dealt with by the government. We will continue to push amendments wherever there is an opportunity to do so.</para><para>I thought I would quickly mention a couple of the recommendations made in the Democrats dissenting report <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme and the Judges' Pension Scheme </inline>of September 1997. The first of those recommendations was:</para><motion><para>That the level of public subsidy to the PCSS is excessive and needs to be substantially reduced. </para></motion><para>We will do that in our amendments. The second recommendation was:</para><motion><para>That the Remuneration Tribunal should be asked to determine an appropriate, reduced level of superannuation benefits for parliamentarians, taking into account standards prevailing in the community at large and the unusual nature of parliamentary life.</para></motion><para>Recommendation 6 is one that we have not acted on because it is difficult from this position—I think one needs to be in government. It really was saying that we need to: </para><quote><para>a. Restructure the scheme as a fully vested accumulation scheme with the level of public subsidy being substantially reduced, and with the Government contribution becoming an appropriate multiple of the parliamentarians' 11.5 per cent contribution.</para></quote><para>It also said:</para><quote><para>b. That the redundancy function be separated from the retirement function.</para></quote><para>There are some steps, I note, being put in place in this bill to look at that question of redundancy. The Democrats have always said that there may well be an argument in cases of hardship for that to take place. I do not think it should be across the board and I do not think it should be generous. Nonetheless, members who have lost their seats or who are otherwise not in this place should not be starving, but we do expect that there should be a reasonable measure of scrutiny over those benefits.</para><para>Recommendation 6(d) was:</para><quote><para>d. That membership of the scheme remain compulsory, but where a member can satisfy the trustees that they have adequate retirement savings already, they may opt out of the scheme, thereby forfeiting the benefit of the Government contribution.</para></quote><para>When you get to the end of this scheme, if you have served in this place for a lengthy period of time, again the inequities start to apply, just as they do up to the eight-year point. The contributions over that cut-off time suddenly become very generous, whereas up until that point they are not. So there are inequities in this scheme right throughout, and that is why it needs more than simply a bandaid measure which says we will simply preserve until age 55. Other recommendations are:</para><quote><para>e. That the rules for survivor and invalidity benefits be reviewed; </para><para>f. That parliamentarians be able to make additional contributions if they so opt and be paid interest on those contributions; </para><para>g. That benefits under the scheme be paid as a pension, actuarially determined based on the value of the accumulated benefit when the parliamentarian retires or turns 55 (which ever is later), with the parliamentarian able to commute up to 50 per cent of their pension to a lump sum as at present. </para></quote><para>The Democrats will support this bill. We do not think it goes far enough, and we do hope that the Senate will look carefully at the amendments that we put up and be of a mind to support them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>25471</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is not the bill in itself that is at fault here—although it is way short of the mark and should have incorporated into it the provisions along the lines that Senator Allison just outlined—but it is the process which is so abhorrent. As I said earlier, it is a prime ministerial ambush of the Senate. This bill was not even on the list this morning. It was not even on the list of eight that the government flagged for debate tonight. Through that procedure we saw a little earlier with the precipitant application of the rules to get around the cut-off provisions—which would have, through normal processes, seen this bill debated when we return in August—we are now debating it here tonight, and it will be done, through and out.</para></talk.start><para>I think there is some expectation in this place that I am going to filibuster on this bill tonight, but I can tell all those who are looking at the clocks that I am not in the business of self-flagellation for somebody else's wrong. In this case, it is the wrong of the government, supported by the opposition, that we are witnessing. I will put the case, and I know that we are not going to have the numbers—so be it.</para><para>Let us not mince words about this: the process tonight is to get around public anger about the parliamentary superannuation scheme. Do it in the dead of night; make the improvement so that you can go to the electorate in an election year saying, `We've put in this age 55 provision,' to shake off at least some of the public angst there is about it; but leave substantially unchanged the core problem with the superannuation provisions for parliamentarians, which is they are too generous. They are not at arms length. They are something that we and our predecessors have voted for and the big parties are hanging on to like grim death because the current members look forward to the day when they retire with a golden handshake way out of kilter with what people in the Australian work force could expect.</para><para>Nice as that feeling might be—that there is a huge bag of money awaiting on retirement for members of parliament compared to what they would be getting if they were in a similarly renumerated job in the general community or that there may even be a multimillion dollar payout through pensions, if they are young enough, for the rest of their lives, as we have seen with former Senator O'Chee's payout—the fact is that it is not right that that is there. We as parliamentarians cannot think of ourselves as different from the rest of the community. Everybody is in the business of taking the main chance, but those of us elected to parliament can be expected to set community standards when it comes to pay and remuneration. Sadly—and we are not the only parliament in this—politicians as a group do not live up to that.</para><para>In my experience, whenever it comes to superannuation, to pay and conditions or to provisions protecting the advantage big parties have through the Electoral Act to get themselves re-elected, the two big parties—the coalition and the opposition—come together very rapidly. Senator Sherry might be interested to know that, back in 1986, I think it was, in the Tasmanian parliament, both my colleague Gerry Bates and I—the two Greens then—were diverted by other matters for half an hour and in that time a big salary rise was put through the parliament by the Labor and Liberal parties. The time taken from the suspension of standing orders to the completion of the third reading was six minutes. I have often thought of writing to the <inline font-style="italic">Guinness</inline><inline font-style="italic">Book</inline><inline font-style="italic">of</inline><inline font-style="italic">Records</inline> about that. Like the tallest trees in the Southern Hemisphere, we might just have a good case for a Tasmanian record there.</para><para>But let us not underestimate the seriousness of the matter. Politics is not in great odour in the wider community. People are cynical and critical of politics, and I guess never more than now—although it has always been there. One of the worst things we can do, as far as allowing that cynicism to fester goes, is to keep on with a superannuation scheme as manifestly selfish, greedy and unfair to the taxpayers as the one that is enjoyed by the current members of this parliament. What we should be doing here tonight is reformulating that so that we get the same sort of superannuation benefits under the same conditions that workers would in the Australian work force in similarly renumerated jobs, and that is not going to happen.</para><para>I laud the Australian Democrats amendments. The Greens have got amendments here too. I support them all, I declare a vested interest in every one of them and I will be voting for them. But we are not going to get them through. The reality is that the big parties yet again, late at night, on the last night of sitting before the winter break, are going to push this through and there is not much we can do about it. However, we must try because there are some of us here who very genuinely feel aggrieved at being caught up in this situation and want to change it.</para><para>I do adopt the provision—and I will be moving it; let me call it the Andren amendment—put forward by the honourable member for Calare in the House of Representatives for an opt-out clause. That clause would allow at least those parliamentarians who want to opt out of this superannuation provision and go for an ordinary superannuation provision through another scheme out in the marketplace to do that. If that is good enough for Peter Andren in the House of Representatives, it is good enough for me. I will do the same. But I do not think we are going to even be able to do that. I do not think that that freedom of choice is going to be allowed us. I think that will be denied by this need of the big parties to stick together in a situation like this where self-interest becomes the glue that shows up a solidarity in the parliament rarely seen on any other topic, except perhaps in a national emergency.</para><para>I will leave the amendments to the committee stage, but I want to move an amendment to the second reading motion. I move:</para><quote><para>Omit all words after “That”, substitute:</para><para>		“the bill be referred to the Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services for inquiry and report by 9 August 2001”.</para></quote><para>It is a very brief time but, as members will know, we have referred the bill proposed by Mr Andren to the same committee. There have been thousands of submissions to that committee. It would be appropriate to put this piece of legislation to the same committee—after all, it has only got a provision in it that Mr Andren has catered for. We would then give the community an opportunity to, in a constructive way, express both its feelings and its ideas about how the parliamentary superannuation scheme should be altered. This is an effort to say, `Let's let the people have a say here.' I will be interested to see how the big parties respond to that option.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>25473</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support Senator Brown's comments and record my support for an ability to opt out of a superannuation scheme that is the same as that for other Australians.

Not only did he not participate in the superannuation scheme in Queensland for parliamentarians but, when he left his public office, he left it with no superannuation whatsoever. I take my hat off to Sir Joh with great admiration, and record that Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party supports the ability to opt out.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>25473</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me commence my remarks by indicating the way in which the Labor Party strongly believe that parliamentary superannuation—and, indeed, all MPs' entitlements—should be dealt with. We believe that entitlement matters, including superannuation, should be dealt with by an independent body. That is our preference. We regard the Remuneration Tribunal as the appropriate organisation to deal with these issues. Politicians should not determine the entitlements of politicians. I make this point because the Labor Party has a view that it is inevitable that, no matter what we say about entitlements in this context, the public not unreasonably will believe that we may be acting to some degree out of self-interest. That is why we strongly believe the matters should go to a body like the Remuneration Tribunal.</para></talk.start><para>Let me comment now on Senator Brown's second reading amendment, which is to refer the bill to the Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services for inquiry and report by 9 August 2001. The date that Senator Brown has selected coincides with the date for the report back on the referral from Senator Brown of the so-called Andren bill dealing with so-called choice. I want to draw a distinction between choice and levels of superannuation contribution in a short while. On my understanding, that particular piece of legislation was referred by Senator Brown to the select committee. I am deputy chair of the select committee and my fellow Tasmanian senator, Senator Watson, is chair. Obviously, we sit on opposite sides of the chamber. However, I would acknowledge his level of expertise in these areas and the significant contribution he has made on these matters. That piece of legislation has been referred to the Senate committee. Hearings will take place in approximately a week and a half in Sydney, following some advertisements that were placed. There will be a full day of hearings on that particular piece of legislation.</para><para>We will not be supporting Senator Brown's second reading amendment because to refer this legislation conflicts with the earlier principle—and Labor's primary principle—that I outlined, which is that politicians should not determine the entitlements of politicians. If this bill is referred to a Senate committee—and in this case, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services—you will be expecting a group of politicians to make recommendations in respect of politicians. We do not believe that is appropriate.</para><para>I comment about the use of the term `choice'. The issue of membership choice—the right to choose to be a member of a particular fund—is a very different issue from the level of contributions that Australians may receive from their employer or choose to contribute themselves. In this country the situation is that membership choice of a particular fund is a very different principle from the level of effective contribution, whether it be to an accumulation fund or to a defined benefit fund such that we enjoy. I might say that politicians are not the only people in the community who are members of a defined benefit fund.</para><para>The legislation that we are considering has a number of changes to the existing scheme. My understanding of the bill—and I first read it yesterday afternoon—is that it will impact on new senators and members who joined the parliament following the last election, including MPs and senators who returned to the parliament after previous service was completed before these arrangements take effect and who leave parliament voluntarily or involuntarily, become entitled to a parliamentary pension before age 55 and would have payment of that pension deferred, including the option to commute part of that pension to a lump sum until age 55. There are some exceptions set out in the legislation in respect of invalidity and early access in case of financial hardship. I note that the financial hardship provisions are required to mirror the current publicly available provision that is generally provided for in the community. There is also a reversionary death benefit whereby eligible spouses and children would receive a reversionary pension on the death of a former member whose pension is deferred before age 55. </para><para>On my reading earlier today of the regulations for early access to superannuation, there is not a full list of criteria. However, I understand that payments of superannuation prior to age 55 are available on application in respect of what is defined as financial hardship. A person is required to be on certain defined social security payments for a period of 26 weeks and a figure of up to $10,000 a year is available in those circumstances. There is also an early access provision that provides for payment of superannuation where the foreclosure of a person's mortgage in respect of their own home is threatened. There are provisions in respect to the death of a relative and the payment of a funeral benefit. There are also some other provisions which, depending on the circumstances, may not be considered as major, but which apply, for example, to health costs. Health costs not covered by Medicare are also covered by the hardship provisions. Several limitations and criteria apply to that, but that is a brief summary of those early access provisions.</para><para>I want to say a little about the process. As my colleague Senator Ray correctly outlined earlier to the chamber, the bill required the waiving of the cut-off. We have often agreed to the waiving of the cut-off. The cut-off was imposed on us when we were in government by the present government and the Australian Democrats. It is not unusual for the cut-off to be waived. I make the point that this matter is on the agenda tonight for the Senate at the government's request. The government has listed its program and has chosen the time for this debate to take place. Similarly, with regard to this legislation, the government went through its own very quick internal processes which led to the legislation being presented in the House of Representatives and passing that house late yesterday afternoon or early evening. It was a government backbench committee—I am not aware of the individuals who comprised that committee—which considered the matter and the government then put this particular legislation together.</para><para>Because of the very tight time frame—as I have said, the legislation was dealt with in the House of Representatives late yesterday afternoon or early evening—there has not been an opportunity for the legislation to be presented through the normal Labor Party caucus processes. Nevertheless, my colleague Mr Kelvin Thomson, who is the Labor Party's opposition spokesperson on superannuation matters, indicated in the House of Representatives that we would not be opposing the legislation that the government had presented. It is a change and, ultimately, a reduction in cost in respect of the current parliamentary superannuation fund.</para><para>With regard to that issue—and I ask the minister to deal with this point in his speech—the explanatory memorandum states several figures for the cost savings. It is indicated that there is a small positive effect on the fiscal balance estimated to be $0.22 million in 2001-02; $0.24 million in 2002-03; $0.25 million in 2003-04; and $0.50 million in 2004-05. As those figures indicate, there is a positive effect on the budget starting in 2001-02. I ask the minister to explain that because a member's or senator's entitlement, this being a defined benefit fund, does not become a legal entitlement until they have met the minimum required standard within the superannuation fund of three parliaments or eight years. Given that this legislation will apply to new senators and members who are elected at the next election, and given the other criteria I outlined earlier, I cannot see how there can be a saving in the first eight years or three elections. I cannot see how a saving can result until that period of time has elapsed. I would appreciate an indication of how those figures are derived. It may be because of the accrual budget process rather than the cash budget process, but it would be useful to know the reason for that.</para><para>The Australian Democrats and Senator Brown for the Australian Greens have circulated a number of amendments. Again, I make the point that these amendments were circulated just prior to the commencement of this debate. There are three pages of amendments from Senator Brown, plus his second reading amendment, and from the Australian Democrats we have six pages of amendments. We are doing our best to scrutinise them in the time available. We will obviously indicate our position as we go through those amendments. However, on my cursory glance, there are some quite technical, complex amendments. We will nevertheless make a call as we go through them one by one. I remind the Australian Democrats and the Greens that they criticised the government for bringing on this matter in the way that it has—to some extent, that concerns me as well—but it cuts all ways. The Australian Democrats and the Greens have presented us with detailed amendments in a very limited time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—No, it goes to a matter of courtesy, Senator Brown.

It also puzzles me, given the extensively drafted amendments, whether it was such a surprise that the bill was coming on so quickly. Anyway, those are the issues that I want to deal with at this stage of the debate. I referred earlier to the government process.

We believe that politicians dealing with politicians' entitlements is not an appropriate way to deal with the matters. The Remuneration Tribunal would have been a far better process.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>25476</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government has put forward by way of the <inline ref="R1363">Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Bill 2001</inline> a proposal that will bring the parliamentary superannuation scheme more into line with community standards by deferring the payment of parliamentary pensions for new MPs who join the parliament after the next general election until they reach age 55. The Prime Minister promised changes to the parliamentary superannuation scheme to bring it more into line with community standards, and this bill delivers on that promise. In doing that, the bill imposes a higher standard of preservation on MPs than applies to other Australians who receive pensions. However, it will closely align superannuation for MPs with a majority of Australians who receive lump sum benefits that must be preserved until at least age 55 in most circumstances.</para></talk.start><para>A number of senators have contributed to this debate, and I thank them for that. I thank Senator Allison for her contribution. Senator Brown made a few contributions, some matters of which I believe I have some understanding of—for example, the pay rise that was referred to that went through the state parliament. I note that consolidated revenue never got moneys paid into it from those Green MPs who objected to the pay rise. Whilst they complained about the morality of it, they were more than willing to take the consequences of it. In fact, it reminds me of one Labor candidate in Tasmania who campaigned against that pay increase. Of course, as soon as he won the seat, he very kindly took the increased salary and nothing was ever done about it.</para><para>Senator Brown has also told us about superannuation entitlements. You, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, and other senators from Tasmania may well recall that it was well known that one of Senator Brown's mates, Mr Gerry Bates, wanted to leave the parliament. If he had resigned voluntarily, he would not have been entitled to certain superannuation benefits. What he did was resign to contest the Legislative Council seat of Queenborough without any intention of winning it, and, as a result, lost his seat and therefore became entitled, and shortly thereafter moved out of the state of Tasmania.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

Senator Harris might have one Bjelke-Petersen on his side, but there may well be a Bjelke-Petersen on the other side of the debate. I am not sure that that example necessarily takes us much further.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to Senator Sherry's contribution, I understand where he and the Labor Party are coming from in relation to politicians' entitlements. In fairness, this is a diminution of parliamentarians' entitlements, so I would not necessarily put it into the same category as voting for benefits or to increase benefits to parliamentarians. I make that distinction for Senator Sherry. He also asked me how the expected savings could be justified. I must say that I spooked myself when I found out that I understood the reasoning—that is, that we have now changed the budgeting system from cash to accruals, and it is on the basis of accruals that the anticipated savings are made.</para><para>Another issue has been raised which I want to put on the record during the conclusion of the second reading debate, that is, why we are in effect grandfathering entitlements that currently exist. I do not know why it has not been mentioned, and there is somebody sitting pretty close to me here in this chamber whom I thank for this information. The High Court, in November 2000, brought down a decision in Smith and ANL Ltd. A very strong High Court—five to two—determined that section 54 of the rehabilitation act was, for the purposes of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, a property right and, therefore, if you changed the legislation but the person had some benefit beforehand, that benefit could not be taken away from them without just compensation. So it is not possible to try to change people's entitlements now if they are already in a particular scheme. That is a constitutional argument that has not been considered and, whilst I accept I am only a humble Hobart lawyer, I think that argument has some merit.</para><para>I will also respond to the suggestion by Senator Sherry that we are in an election environment. I am not sure that we are, but there is no doubt that constitutionally there needs to be an election within the next six or seven months. As a result, a lot of good men and women in Australia are considering running for the parliament—be they Democrats, Greens, Independents, Labor or Liberal—and I believe it is appropriate for them to have some idea of some of the benefits that may or may not accrue to them. I have expressed from time to time a view—and I am not sure that it is necessarily the government view—that the superannuation benefits parliamentarians get are generous. When I came into this place I in fact took a substantial pay cut; I still consider it a great honour to be able to serve in this place and I did not take it begrudgingly. But I think those that have families and have certain financial commitments have an entitlement to know what sort of financial benefits may come their way should they decide to run for the parliament, and that applies across the board. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate.</para><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para><para>Original question resolved in the affirmative. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, could I have my no vote recorded please?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Shayne (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Murphy)</inline>—It will be recorded.

I would argue that both of these amendments are in line with recommendations that were made by the government back in 1997, when we inquired into this question. The government acknowledged that this scheme was a generous one and said that a change to it was desirable. They also said—and I had forgotten this recommendation—that choice and opting out to an accumulation scheme was something which the committee recommended, and that seems to have been forgotten. Another important recommendation was, of course, that future members should not receive any pension before 55. It has taken a long time for the legislation to come up, but it finally has.</para><para>As I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, the opting out provisions are those which should be familiar to you, Senator Sherry, because they were both amendments which I circulated and were due to be debated while attached to the bill on commutations, so you would have seen them before. But we have all seen them circulated as part of Mr Peter Andren's bill, which is the subject of the inquiry that is under way, so they should not be entirely surprising. In fact, the reason that Senator Brown and I were able to produce them so quickly is that, as I say, they have been kicking around.</para><para>I will mention in more precise terms what that opting out means. Members and senators have an option to stop making contributions to the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust and from that point forward those members and senators will be entitled to a benefit equal to the superannuation guarantee safety net amount—eight per cent this year and nine per cent next. They will be able to choose the fund into which contributions are made, provided of course that it is a complying superannuation fund or an RSA. The decision to become a non-trust contributor would thereby become irrevocable. I would argue that this is in line with what the government has recommended anyway in the past. It certainly would enable those parliamentarians who feel embarrassed and concerned about the fact that our entitlements are so generous to opt for an accumulation scheme, which is one common to most other people.</para><para>Bringing the benefits under the Public Service scheme is the other part of our amendment. I draw senators' attention to page 3 of our amendments on which there is a scale. That scale relates to the percentage of parliamentary allowance to be paid as a retiring allowance given the number of years of service. Whilst, as I said earlier, we would prefer that we fold the parliamentary superannuation scheme and simply go to an accumulation scheme like most people have, that was a very difficult thing for us to do by way of amendment to this bill or any other that is put before us. It has been something we have been trying to grapple with for some time. So we thought we would opt for the next best thing—that is, the Public Service superannuation scheme—and link the rates in the same way.</para><para>The highest level of a Public Service pension under the Superannuation Act 1976 is 52.5 per cent of final salary, and that is only payable after 40 years of service. The highest level of parliamentary superannuation is 75 per cent of final salary, so we are looking here at a significant reduction from 75 per cent to 52.5 per cent of final salary. We think that is reasonable. All of the other rates would vary proportionately, as is shown by that table. Using this scale, they would all be about 70 per cent of what they are currently. I should note that, whilst you would need to be in employment in the Public Service for 40 years to reach the top end of the pension salary scale, we are talking in this amendment of MPs being able to obtain that amount after just 18 years of service.</para><para>It is quite interesting to look at some of the entitlements. Our dissenting report has a schedule which estimates the employer contributions to the parliamentary superannuation scheme. On page 2 of that report, we set out a table which shows that, after eight years of service at retirement, the ratio of employer to member contributions is 8.16 times. That decreases as a ratio over time: at 12 years of service, it is 5.99 times; at 18 years, it is 4.8 times; and at 24 years, it is 3.17 times. So clearly this arrangement would give a different weighting, if you like, to entitlements based on the contributions. We think it is a useful, if not ideal, way of demonstrating that parliamentary superannuation can at least be linked with some standard which is based on rational arguments about years of service and reasonableness. It gets away from some of the quirkier, if you like, but certainly more generous aspects of the parliamentary superannuation scheme.</para><para>I hope that the ALP has had time to look at those amendments by now. We are essentially putting three groups of amendments, and that is the first one. Going over that again, it is the opting out into an accumulation scheme or an RSA, and linking parliamentary pensions much more to the sort of scale that we see in the Public Service. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>25480</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is just a minor contribution, but I would like to ask the mover of the amendment whether she intends to opt out if this is passed.

One of the amendments I will put up is that it affects people like me who are in this place now rather than those who come later. With regard to my other entitlements, I do have some from a short career in teaching. My career before that did not attract superannuation contributions because, like so many women, they were offered mostly to male employees and not to women. So my superannuation entitlements are not enormous.

Whatever we think about retiring allowances, a schedule or a level of retirement allowances, if they are to exist—and I am not advocating them—should be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, not by us sitting here with one hour's notice of the details of the amendment.

We have crammed, if you like, 18 years into 40, which is the difference. Perhaps it is more arbitrary than crude. It is just a way of using at least some sort of rationale, some sort of basis, on which to calculate a retirement benefit based on years of service.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>25481</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am advised that it is the CSS scheme that is being drawn upon here.

In case anybody is concerned that I am going to be jumping up on each and every one of these amendments, let me allay that concern.

I cannot see how any member of this chamber could vote against these amendments. I note that the government says it is single-minded and it will not listen to what anybody else has to say. But that is not the nature of parliament. So I appeal to the opposition to support this amendment—and so they should.</para><para>Let me give a commitment at the outset: if these amendments get up—and I will be opting out of the superannuation scheme—I will never raise a finger at another member of parliament who does not opt out. But it is very important that this option be there for those of us who want to take it. Why should we be captive to the majority in having a superannuation scheme which is unpopular, unwanted by the majority of Australians, unfair and which makes us feel bad about it as well? I know the arguments that will be used by the other side. But the fact is that this is a freedom of choice matter, and the only reason I can see for not adopting this freedom of choice is that other members are concerned that it will erode even further their position. Obviously that is a risk. I think what would happen under this freedom of choice is that a handful of members would take it now, quite a number of members would take it in the new parliament—that is, new members—and we would rapidly find this current superdooper superannuation scheme for politicans falling away. But how dare any other member of parliament dictate to those of us who want to get out of this current scheme that we must stay in it.</para><para>I note that there was almost no debate on this bill in the House of Representatives, but we have an opportunity now at least to have the government or the opposition say why the opt-out should not be available. The Senate knows that we wanted to refer this to a committee. That has been denied. But let us hear from speakers on both sides why there should not be freedom of choice in this matter. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>25483</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise briefly to support Senator Brown and to record that the position of Pauline Hanson's One Nation is that as parliamentarians our superannuation should be equal to that of the people of Australia, and one way to achieve that would be to have the ability to opt out and join a scheme that they are participating in.

As I say, there is no glue like self-interest to stick the big parties together. If there is an argument against this, get up and put it. Of course, the reason this bill is here with the 55-year age provision—which does not apply to us; it applies to some people unspecified in the future who will win seats—is that it is intended to divert attention away from the real matters that are making the public angry about this superannuation scheme, that is, the extraordinary top-up that is coming from our employers, the public, without their permission; it is eight or 10 times as much.

Here we have an opt-out freedom of choice provision for members of parliament, and the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Labor Party say, `We won't give our fellow members that choice.' What do you think of that? It is an extraordinary situation. We did get some stick for the honourable member for Calare, Peter Andren, earlier in the night, but he has had the gumption to put this forward. I had to think twice about it, but I am with him on this. He has done a decent thing. It is quite unbelievable, and it is not defensible, that other members of parliament would say, `But we're not going to allow you that choice.' I am obviously going to get nil response from either side. The best defence, they think, is: baton down the hatches, shut up, wait until this goes through tonight, and put it behind, and hopefully the electorate will forget about it.

It removes the discrimination against gay and lesbian couples in access to superannuation entitlements. Central to this amendment is the concept of a partnership relationship, which replaces the existing concept of a marital relationship. A partnership relationship is a genuine and continuing relationship between two people who are adults over 18, who are not related, who live together and who have a mutual commitment to a shared life to the exclusion of any other partnership relationship.</para><para>A mutual commitment to a shared life can be established in two ways. Firstly, it can be established by cohabitation as partners to the exclusion of any other partnership relationship for a period of three years or more. Alternatively, a mutual commitment to a shared life may exist in the case of partners living together to the exclusion of any other partnership relationship for a period of less than three years if there is relevant evidence of a mutual commitment. The amendment states:</para><quote><para>... relevant evidence includes, but is not limited to:</para><para>	(a)	any joint ownership of real estate or other major assets; and</para><para>	(b)	any joint liabilities; and</para><para>	(c)	the extent of any pooling of financial resources, particularly in relation to major financial commitments; and</para><para>	(d)	whether one person owes any legal obligation to the other person; and</para><para>	(e)	any joint responsibility for the care and support of children, if any; and</para><para>	(f)	the persons' living arrangements; and</para><para>	(g)	whether the persons represent themselves to other persons as being in a partnership relationship.</para></quote><para>This is a long overdue amendment. The Democrats have been campaigning on this subject for a very long time and will continue to do so. We think that in this day and age it is a reasonable position to take. I note that many jurisdictions at the state and territory level have provisions within their laws to remove that discrimination. Quite frankly, it is really time that the Senate did likewise with its own parliamentarians. I think this is important, as I said earlier, and I think its time has come. Perhaps its time had come some years ago, but we think this is a good opportunity for the government to set right a wrong which has been in place for much too long.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>25486</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to get some clarification from Senator Allison on this matter.

The property of superannuation belongs to the individual and therefore they are allowed to leave that property to whomever they wish, whether in a same sex couple or otherwise. It is a very important principle, and it should apply to everyone, not just politicians. For that reason, we will not be supporting an exclusivity same sex couple provision for politicians.

The fact is that, until such time as we have comprehensive and uniform national antidiscrimination laws on the grounds of sexuality and same sex partnership recognition at a Commonwealth level, this issue can never be addressed. There are only two ways in which you can do that: by amending legislation before the parliament and by supporting a comprehensive bill.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We Democrats introduced the very bill that is necessary to do all of that, and it was introduced in 1995 by former Democrat Senator Sid Spindler. It has been on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> since then and gone nowhere, because it does not attract the support of either the coalition or Labor. It really gets my goat when members of the Labor Party trumpet with great clarity and fanfare the possibility of Mr Albanese's bill passing through the parliament but fail to point out two fundamental things. Firstly, that bill is simply one part of one section of the Democrats sexuality discrimination bill. That bill precedes the Albanese bill by some years and goes much further, covering those other areas, including immigration, social security, taxation and so on. It is not just one boutique piece of antidiscrimination legislation, which the Labor Party seem to think is the panacea to all discrimination against gay and lesbian people. It is not.</para><para>Secondly, if the answer to resolving this discrimination is the passage of such a bill, where is it? Yes, it has been introduced. It was fundamentally flawed when it was introduced, because it did not actually cover Commonwealth public servants. I know that, when Mr Albanese framed that legislation in the House of Representatives, he was not in a constitutional position to include Commonwealth public servants. He could not do that from the House of Representatives. But not one of his Labor Senate colleagues thought to amend it before introducing it.</para><para>I also make the point that Mr Albanese is not the Labor spokesperson on superannuation. Mr Albanese is not even a frontbencher. So I pose the question: why is it that this bill, which Labor claim to believe in strongly, is being advocated not by a frontbencher, not by someone with a portfolio, but by a backbencher with a pink electorate in inner city Sydney? Where is Mr Beazley on this bill? There has been deafening silence from him on this issue. Labor claim to be serious—we hear this constant rhetoric: `We support same sex couples'—yet, of the five or six amendments to deal with same sex couples that have been through this chamber since I have been here, Labor have opposed each and every one of them.</para><para>Labor often point to the states and say, `Oh, yes, but we've done it at a state level.' There is truth in that. Same sex couple recognition now exists in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria—with the support of the Liberal Party, I note—and Tasmania, to some degree. It covers super; it does not cover other areas. In our own shared home state of Western Australia, Temporary Chairman Knowles, the new government is committed to that reform. It is true that state Labor governments have largely been responsible for that, with the exception of Western Australia, where the precedent for same sex recognition was set by the Democrats with the successful passage at a state level of the Democrats sexuality bill in that state's upper house by my now retired colleague Helen Hodgson MLC. If Labor can do this at a state level, why can't they—or won't they—do it at a federal level?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—The fact that we're not in government might have something to do with it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>86X</name.id><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name></talker><para>—Senator Sherry interjects and says that he is not in government. That is a cop-out. That is not fair. You are in a position to do it from opposition. Just as the mandatory sentencing bill passed this house, so too could same sex couple recognition. If you held the ground on it and kept in form with the Democrats and some other minor parties, including Senator Brown, it would succeed. I do not believe for a second that the government would hold out on this forever. The same is true for the same amendment that was passed on this with the Governor-General bill.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Labor constantly says, `This is not the right bill,' whenever amendment after amendment comes up, and yet it will not progress its own bill. Yes, it will introduce it as a piece of theatre. It will drum it up in the gay press as something that it claims it is doing, while constantly avoiding the topics of immigration, social security, taxation, the defence forces and all those other areas of discrimination that gay and lesbian couples experience discrimination in. So if we do not support this recognition from piece by piece legislation, it can be done only with wholesale legislation. But Labor will not support the sexuality discrimination bill. That will resolve that.</para><para>This is the litmus test for Labor. If you are serious about recognising same sex couples, as you say you are, then support it. It is all too convenient to say suddenly, at the last minute: `This is a boutique piece of legislation. It is a discrete piece of legislation. It relates only to politicians. It would be unfair to allow same sex couple recognition just for that area.' How convenient. The truth is, if you were to set that precedent and if you were to meet that benchmark, the electorate would have faith in you in doing this comprehensively in government.

You just said in your contribution that you did not believe the government would hold out. They are holding out on same sex couples in respect of the so-called superannuation choice provision, and they have been holding out for months. So you are wrong. Consult with Senator Allison, who is sitting next to you, and you will find out what has been happening in respect of that particular provision. This government will not support that.

Should the government agree to the principle of same sex couples on superannuation choice, that will apply to everyone in the community, except for us. On that point I will conclude.

That Act repealed and replaced the 1955 Trade Marks Act and came into operation on 1 January 1996.  This Bill also makes some minor technical amendments to correct erroneous references in the Patents Amendment (Innovation Patents) Act 2000.</para><para>The new Trade Marks Act modernised and streamlined the Australian trade marks registration system and brought it into line with certain requirements of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights — better known as the TRIPS Agreement.  In September last year, the Act was also amended to enable Australia to accede to the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks.  Accession would provide a reciprocal, streamlined application procedure for Australian and overseas trade marks owners should they wish to register their trade marks overseas or in Australia.</para><para>The new Trade Marks Act has been very successful in meeting its objectives.  It has resulted in significant lessening of red tape for businesses, enabling them to get their trade marks registered in a more streamlined manner.  It has had major benefits for the operation of the Trade Marks Office and the positive benefits of this, for users of the system, are illustrated by the fact that there have been two fee reductions and no increases in Trade Marks Office fees since the new Act came into force.  These excellent results have been achieved without eroding the benefits of registration available to trade marks owners.  </para><para>This Bill improves the legislation by further streamlining procedures, enabling the Trade Marks Office to provide improved services to the public, removing anomalies and clarifying ambiguities that have come to light since the Act came into operation.  </para><para>In September 1996, approximately nine months after its commencement, the Registrar of Trade Marks invited submissions from interested groups, and the public, on the operation of the new Trade Marks Act.  Some eighteen submissions were received.  Respondents included the Institute of Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys, the Trade Marks Sub-Committee of the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Manufacturers' Patents, Industrial Designs, Copyright and Trade Marks Association, members of the legal profession and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation.  I thank them all for their interest and guidance on this matter.</para><para>Other comments were received from a number of sources including focus groups set up within the Trade Marks Office to look at administrative issues, and from the Trade Marks Office help desk which was set up to assist users of the system with the transition to the new legislation.</para><para>The post-implementation review has allowed interest groups and the public to work with the Trade Marks Office to come up with suggestions to further improve and streamline the legislation. </para><para>A review team including members of the main interest groups met in February 1998.  The review team recommended that a number of changes were necessary for the efficient and effective operation of the Act.  This Bill gives effect to the necessary changes.</para><para>In the interests of delivering better service to Trade Marks Office customers, section 158 of the Trade Marks Act will be repealed.  The provision makes it a strict liability criminal offence for an employee of the Trade Marks Office to prepare, or help prepare, a document to be filed under the Act or to search the Trade Marks Office records, unless specifically authorised to do so.  This may, in some circumstances for example, cause doubt as to whether a Trade Marks Office employee may help a person fill in their trade mark application or assist them with a search of the trade marks database.  </para><para>The provision is outdated.  Its carry over from the previous legislation is now considered inappropriate.  The modern Public Service encourages its employees to give members of the public, within the proper boundaries, every assistance they are able to.  The Trade Marks Office is continually striving to improve the service it provides its customers and this provision unnecessarily constrains what it can do.  Its repeal will enable the Trade Marks Office to consider new and innovative ways to improve its customer service.  Any impropriety by an employee of the Trade Marks Office is able to be dealt under the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct set out in section 13 of the Public Service Act 1999.</para><para>This Bill will also repeal paragraph 88(2)(d) of the Trade Marks Act.  This provision currently enables a person, in certain circumstances, to apply to a court to cancel or amend a trade mark registration.  In considering the matter, the court would be obliged to apply stricter criteria than would have been applied by the Registrar of Trade Marks when accepting the trade mark for registration.  Having different sets of criteria apply is clearly unsatisfactory—indeed there is the possibility that a person whose trade mark was removed from the Register by the court under this provision could immediately successfully re-apply for registration of the trade mark.  The repeal of this provision will therefore remove the uncertainty inherent in this provision.</para><para>The Bill also contains a series of amendments of a minor nature intended to streamline procedures and remove anomalies and ambiguities identified since the Act came into operation.  This Bill also amends the Patents Amendment (Innovation Patents) Act 2000 to correct several erroneous references in that Act.</para><para>I commend this Bill to the Senate.</para></quote><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the 2001 spring sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>25493</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Government Business</title><page.no>25493</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion by (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell) </inline>agreed to.</para><motion><para>That intervening business be postponed till after consideration of government business order of the day No. 4 (Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill 2001).</para></motion></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMMIGRATION DETAINEES) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25493</page.no><id.no>R1283</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>25493</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 27 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Minchin</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title></title><page.no>25493</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>25493</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Government Business</title><page.no>25493</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to.</para><motion><para>That intervening business be postponed till after consideration of government business order of the day No. 3, Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2001.</para></motion></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PASSENGER MOVEMENT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25493</page.no><id.no>R1318</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>25493</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 27 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tambling</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ridgeway</inline> had moved by way of an amendment:</para><quote><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>“but the Senate calls on the Government:</para><para>	(a)	to make the charge commissionable and thereby encourage overseas travel agents to comply with the charge regime; and</para><para>	(b)	to introduce legislation allocating a further M$15 per year to the Australian Tourist Commission over the life of the foot and mouth disease prevention program for the purpose of marketing measures designed to boost Australia's image as a “clean and green destination”.</para></quote><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>25494</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would request from the government a list of the order of the legislation that is now coming up.

In the second reading debate, the opposition pointed out—and I pointed out on behalf of my colleague Mr Fitzgibbon—that the passenger movement charge already is raising in excess of $80 million more than is being spent on the cost recovery for the process. Therefore, it is not necessary to increase it further, because the government will only put it into consolidated revenue, and there is no guarantee that they will spend it on anything as good as you are suggesting, Senator Ridgeway. After the last 5½ years of this government, I would not trust them with an extra 2c, let alone an extra $2, which will run into several million dollars. Your good intentions are clear, but there is no way that the government will be compelled to spend the extra $2 on what you rightly want it to be spent on. We found out during the estimates that the government are raising an extra $80 million a year above the running costs of the passenger movement charge without the additional $8 to cover the cost of foot-and-mouth disease. As a result, because we cannot trust the government to take up your idea, we will vote against this increase, because they will just put it straight into consolidated revenue.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Request not agreed to.</para><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported without request; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>25495</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>) read a third time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—I wish to record retrospectively my opposition to the third reading of the migration bill.

I believe it would be very important for the minister to outline to the committee what steps are to be taken to ensure that the public funds that are spent on pathology services cannot become a prime revenue raising target for the for-profit companies. Presumably, within the department of health, there will be some monitoring of this, and I would like to hear either now or if you could take it on notice the government's response on that matter.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>25496</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Harradine for his particular interest in this area.

The problem of ensuring there are sufficient collection centres in rural areas has been acknowledged in the past and is reflected in the three-for-one provision that entitles large providers to open more rural centres. The fact is this bonus allocation has not been utilised to the necessary extent and the general pattern of recent mergers in the industry has seen a dramatic reduction in the number of centres. In the cities, this has had beneficial effects as the industry has stabilised, but in rural Australia the pendulum has swung too far and the public system which has provided the backbone of services is now under real pressure. We may not just see collection centres close; we may in fact also see the closure of vital small laboratories in local and regional hospitals that provide timely and effective services.</para><para>As a first step therefore to get this problem into the light of day, the opposition is moving this amendment to require annual public reporting of the number of collection centres in each local statistical zone. The minister will be required to report on the trends in closures of centres in non-metropolitan areas and the action taken to ensure that access is not reduced. The report should include advice on the action taken by the minister to ensure that access to pathology services in non-metropolitan areas has not been reduced. The object of this amendment is to ensure some transparency and enable monitoring of the impact of the new rules and whether there is a reduction in access to services. This amendment is an important measure to enable the public to judge the impact of this legislation and the effectiveness of the government's rural health policies. The government voted for this amendment last time it was presented, and I would hope that commonsense prevails and they will again support it. Indeed, I hope other senators will also support the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>25497</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We simply do not believe this amendment is necessary.

Both organisations are concerned about any further delays to this legislation. In particular, I have some notes from David Kindon from the AAPP. He said that the delays already to get this legislation through have meant that private pathology practices and practices generally that have been geared up ready for it are now suffering losses, and the public sector providers which are brought into the collection centre arrangements are unable to operate legally in the community until the new scheme actually becomes operable.</para></talk.start><para>Obviously, if the government want to support the amendments, they are welcome to.

The proximity of pathology provided to the patient is not integral to ensure quality, accessible service provision.</para></talk.start><para>This legislation relates to provisions for approval of community based collection centres under the Medicare benefits arrangement. Medicare data provides a limited view of pathology activity. Funding for pathology services occurs through many streams, including Medicare, the Australian health care agreements, health program grants in rural and remote areas, Department of Veterans' Affairs funding, et cetera. The analysis of pathology servicing under the Medicare Benefits Scheme will provide information on only one part of service provision and would not provide an accurate indication of the levels of access to services in various electoral districts. Specimens for testing are collected in multiple settings, including in doctors' surgeries, nursing homes, laboratories and hospitals and by patients. Collection centres are only one of many facilities within which specimens are collect. Businesses independently make decisions to open or close collection centres or utilise other methods of collecting specimens—that is, collection from doctors' surgeries, nursing homes, et cetera. Routine data on the pathology is already provided by the Health Insurance Commission in its pathology notes publication. This provides an indication of the number of providers and the service outlets.</para><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>25498</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move opposition amendments (2) and (3):</para></talk.start><quote><para>(2)	Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 9), after item 2, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">2A  After subsection 3GA(2)</inline></para><para>Insert:</para><para>	(2A)	An Approved Placement for general practice training may be approved only in relation to a location which has been designated as an area of specific workforce shortage because it is underprovided with general practitioners.</para><para> (3)	Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 19), after item 2A, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">2B  At the end of paragraph 3GA(5)(a)</inline></para><para>Add:</para><para>	and (iii)		that satisfactory supervision arrangements, which are appropriate to the skills and experience of the applicant, are in place;</para></quote><para>This amendment to item (2) clarifies the scope of the approved placements program under section 3GA of the Health Insurance Act to make it clear that in the case of placements with general practitioners an approved placement should only be made in an area of specific work force shortage. This is actually a much wider definition than that currently applied by the government. The schemes for general practitioners that currently exist provide for unsupervised training in rural areas or late night locum services. Neither are suitable types of program, and the Phillips report recommended both should be scrapped.</para><para>Labor wants to negotiate a community term for postgraduate doctors wanting to try a 13-week stint of general practice before deciding which registrar program to enter. The current maldistribution of doctors does not allow such a program to be entirely open slather, as some would like. Young doctors have a legitimate desire to undertake a community term at a location reasonably close to where they live. They are very unhappy with schemes that require them to relocate to a remote area, to leave their families behind and to work in an unsupervised setting. Labor will solve this problem by allowing community terms in regional cities with a shortage of terms and in areas of the capital cities such as the outer suburbs and low income area where there is a serious shortage of doctors and GPs serving those areas are forced to work excessive overtime. This amendment makes clear that there will be some limits on community terms and that they will not detract from the number of rural placements.</para><para>The second amendment in this group, No. 3, inserts the second part of Labor's reforms to approved placement schemes by specifically requiring the body authorising such placements to certify that satisfactory supervision arrangements are in place which are appropriate to the skills and experience of the applicant. This provides a wide degree of flexibility and allows the designated training body coordinating the placements to ensure suitable standards are maintained. Labor will work with doctor organisations to develop the detailed design of these schemes. Its proposals have been warmly welcomed. This is not surprising, as the medical review training panel and the Phillips report have been making the same points to the government for over two years now. I hope that this amendment is supported by the government and other senators, and that the government starts the process of ensuring all approved placement schemes are subject to proper supervision in time for the start of the training year in 2002.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>25499</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government does not agree to these amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>25499</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I acknowledge that there has been some concern expressed over the supervision of those providing locum services.

Do we let this continue with a junior doctor, or if we have any questions at night or on a weekend do we have to go down to the local hospital? It certainly is not ideal. I do not think this scheme will work, unless the Labor Party—when, or if, they ever get into government—are planning to increase the number of GPs in some way and look at some other schemes.

But I do not believe that we can tackle some of these remaining problems by extending it by yet another year. At the end of that time, presumably the question will be asked: is it going to be extended for another year? It is time to bite the bullet now and to do it now.

The requirement for another review so soon after the previous mid-term review would not enhance understanding of the qualification requirements, given that there has been no significant change in training numbers and availability of places since 1999 other than an increase in the availability of both vocational and pre-vocational places for junior doctors.

Our concern is that the government has given too much incentive to existing private providers. It risks creating an anticompetitive situation where a few large operators are protected from new entrants by virtue of the new system for calculating the entitlements to licence numbers for collection centres. If licences are only issued on the basis of turnover, it will be impossible for niche operators to grow where they have proven themselves to be efficient service providers.</para><para>This bill will effectively close the door on new competition in the private sector and it will stifle growth in the public sector. There is already a large degree of concentration in the industry, and it is time to allow more competition to ensure that there is no scope for the major companies to slide away from the most cost effective patterns of operating. Under the proposed rules, a new entrant will be limited to, at most, two licences and they will then have to fight for additional licences solely on the grounds of turnover. This puts them in an impossible position as they have no network to build volume and they are competing against much larger groups for whom an extra licence can be gained by the equivalent of an extra day or two's turnover. This problem should be overcome by rewriting the ministerial guidelines to ensure that new entrants are encouraged rather than frozen out. The overall caps can be maintained in the situation that the major players will have to work hard to maintain their market share by being cost effective and offering customer service that matches the best that new providers can come up with.</para><para>I am somewhat surprised that the government have not embraced this amendment, as one would expect them to support fair competition. I therefore hope at this point that the government are willing to be flexible or, in the event that the government are not, that the Democrats will come to the aid of smaller operators to avoid the dominance of a few large providers of pathology services creating an imbalance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>25504</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I found in my time as Democrats health spokesperson that the pathologists were probably the most open and outspoken as far as containing costs is concerned. It is not something the medical profession is well known for, but the pathologists have to be congratulated for the efforts that they have made to work with the government putting in place caps on expenditure and looking at actual reductions in fees to meet the agreements that they have got to contain costs. I think we should listen to the various organisations that represent them in their concern about these amendments. I have had no-one coming to lobby me about this. Indeed, the public sector and the private sector both seem to be not just happy with this legislation but quite desperate to get it through. As I said earlier, there are some real problems in the public sector. They are actually concerned about operating illegally unless we get this legislation through and get it through quickly. I will read again what was said by the AAPP: public sector providers which are brought into the collection centre arrangements are unable to operate legally in the community until the new scheme becomes a reality. So I am not quite sure where Senator Forshaw has got some of his information from, but I really cannot support these amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>25504</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Forshaw is quite right; the government does not embrace these amendments and does not agree to them.

The amendment goes to the issue of the Regional Forest Agreements Private Forest Reserve Program. It will allow that a private owner of land who registers a perpetual conservation covenant will be exempt from a range of tax provisions, including capital gains tax proceedings and income tax for the purposes of that conservation covenant. It is not my intention to debate this at length because, as I mentioned, it has been debated on at least two previous occasions in the Senate. </para><para>In respect of the Regional Forest Agreements Private Forest Reserve Program—and I will use my home state of Tasmania as an example because it will have an impact in that state—there is provision for farmers in the main, and perhaps other land holders who are not part of the farming community, to put aside some areas or all areas of forest in perpetuity for conservation purposes. We believe this is a sound approach and it will encourage those particular farmers to place those areas in reserve.</para><para>It has been raised, certainly to my knowledge by the Tasmanian state government—the current government in Tasmania is a Labor government, and I am aware that the previous Liberal government holds the same view—that, where a person does set aside land, they should not be disadvantaged in terms of the current tax provisions. The current Labor state government in Tasmania, through our Premier, Mr Bacon, and the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Llewellyn, have written to the federal Labor opposition. As I have indicated on previous occasions, we support this as being very sound in principle. We have spent some time drafting this amendment. We have to be careful that tax concessions are tightly worded to deliver the intended outcome and not to provide a mechanism for what could be termed as tax minimisation or evasion. That is clearly outside the stated principles of the Private Forest Reserve Program.</para><para>While I have made reference to my home state of Tasmania, this is not a measure that is confined to Tasmania; it will obviously apply throughout Australia. However, Tasmania is a state where there are significant forestry operations and where there is significant interest in this particular proposal. Obviously, being a senator from Tasmania, I take a keen interest in these matters. So I will move Labor's amendment and ask for the support of the Senate. I would just indicate that Senator Brown has circulated a handwritten amendment. I am sure that it changes the dates. I am not absolutely sure why Senator Brown has done that, but I would ask him to indicate why the dates have been changed in his proposed amendment to our amendment, as I understand it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>25506</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Greens amendment to opposition amendment (1):</para></talk.start><quote><para>Omit “2000-2001 income year”, substitute “1999-2000 and 2000-2001 income years”</para></quote><para>The change is because your amendment does not cover the people who were given grants under this system in the month of June 1999. So, if you do not put this amendment in there, there will be a small group of landowners in Tasmania who will be taxed and who will not get that rebate under this system. This is a Greens amendment that has been taken over by the Labor Party and applied to the current tax bill before us, six months after I moved it. The Labor Party, which has been in a total muddle about this, should have done it last December and is catching up now. I am indebted to Senator Sherry for taking over my amendment. Copying is the greatest form of flattery, and I am flattered. But it has not helped the landowners in Tasmania. </para><para>What we do need to understand here is that there is a pretty nasty streak in the Tasmanian Labor Party, particularly in the Bacon government. When I bought this amendment on last year, the Labor Party here rang Premier Bacon and said, `There's a Green moving this amendment which is going to help landowners in Tasmania.' They said, `Oh, oppose it.' So the landowners got cut out. That is how small-minded the Labor Party gets when it comes to any forestry issue in Tasmania.</para><para>I am going to be a bit big minded about this. I agree with Senator Murray: it is not so much who puts it forward but that it will be carried into effect. Land owners will get the relief from the capital gains tax threat over them that they deserve. That is good for the environment and it is good for the people of Tasmania as a whole. I suggest that Senator Sherry take up the amendment to the amendment. It will make it fair right across the board. The Regional Forest Agreement moneys to land owners who were protecting their blocks began in June 1999. If we do not make that amendment, a small group of people—including one person who got a fairly large sum of money because they were making a pretty grandiose commitment to conservation—would miss out, and that would be quite unfair.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>25506</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Brown has commented that copying is the sincerest form of flattery.

This bill as a whole, which I did not speak to in the second reading debate because of the hour and time constraints, deals with a number of essentially unrelated income tax and fringe benefits tax measures. One of the major proposals is providing an exemption from fringe benefits tax for free public transport provided to police officers between their home and their place of employment. That is a measure we support, as we do the bill as a whole. We are moving an amendment to the bill to extend the FBT concession to any public transport benefit provided by an employer. The idea behind this is obviously to encourage the use of public transport and permit employers to pay for transport for employees to and from work and not be taxed on providing that benefit.</para><para>It is a measure that would cost some money, although when you look at the savings as well that are often not factored in, such as reductions in cars on the road, road expenditure, savings in the health budget, savings in pollution and assisting us in meeting our Kyoto commitments, it comes out well balanced. FBT applying to motor cars as part of salary packages is approximately 10 per cent of the vehicle purchase price, whereas the FBT applying to public transport tickets is approximately 95 per cent of the ticket price. This policy creates significant disincentives for companies to include public transport fares in salary packages and encourages greater use of company cars for community use, which the Democrats certainly think we need to move away from. I commend the amendment as beneficial. It is again trying to use the tax system to facilitate, encourage and provide incentives for more environmentally responsible activities in the area of transport.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>25508</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government understands why the Democrats are moving this amendment. As the Senate is no doubt aware, the government itself has a number of programs to address the issue of greenhouse gases and transport, such as the alternative fuels program. However, the government does not consider that an extension to the fringe benefits tax system is really the way to take this forward. It is a basic principle of the income tax and fringe benefits tax that expenses of a private nature, such as travel between home and work, are not allowable as deductions from income tax and, where provided to employees as fringe benefits, are subject to a fringe benefits tax. The fringe benefits tax exemption for free travel by police on public transport specifically recognises that police officers travelling to and from work on public transport provide a public safety benefit by acting as a deterrent to criminal and antisocial behaviour.</para></talk.start><para>It also recognises that state governments effectively subsidise this public safety benefit by forgoing fair revenue from police officers travelling to and from duty. This is very different from providing a fringe benefit tax exemption to every employee travelling to and from work on public transport. Frankly, one wonders whether this would give value for money. If there were a five to 10 per cent increase in the use of public transport, I am advised that the amendment would cost the revenue between $900 million and $1.2 billion per annum. This is money which would have to be diverted from other programs. Accordingly, the government will not be accepting the Democrats amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>25509</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Labor opposition will not be supporting the amendment for the reasons that Senator Kemp outlined, and there are a couple of additional points that I will be making. This is a major change to the tax system and FBT. The minister—and I am indebted to him—has indicated the figure. We thought it would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Thank you, Minister, for the information that it would be $900 million to $1.2 billion.</para></talk.start><para>There are two other points. The Australian Democrats—and I do criticise Senator Bartlett—gave us a couple of hours notice of this matter. It certainly did not enable us to consider this as deeply as we wanted. For example, we were not able to find an accurate figure, although we had a reasonable idea. There is one other important issue, and here I do not make a criticism of Senator Bartlett or of Senator Stott Despoja but of the other Australian Democrats. Senator Bartlett has claimed that this would be an important measure to encourage the use of public transport. It would do that at significant cost to revenue. If that is the Democrats stated principle, why did they support a GST on public transport?</para><para>One of the principal culprits over there is Senator Murray. The Democrats put a GST on public transport which has raised $300 million or $400 million. They should have thought about this as a party when they considered the GST deal that Senator Murray and Senator Lees signed up the Democrats to. Senator Bartlett's claim that they want to encourage public transport does ring rather hollow with the Labor opposition. As I say, it is not a criticism of you, Senator Bartlett, but a criticism of your other colleagues, except Senator Stott Despoja, who is now your leader. The other issues that have been outlined are further reasons why we cannot support the amendment.</para><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>25509</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate that we are withdrawing the other amendment.</para></talk.start><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported with amendment; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>25509</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kemp</inline>) read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25509</page.no><id.no>R747</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>25509</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Andrew (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Bartlett)</inline>—The committee is considering the amendment moved by Senator Brown on sheet 2166.</para></talk.start></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>25510</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to withdraw that amendment, because it was taken up by Labor and passed in the last bill.

If ever there was an admission by this government that its supplementary assistance package that we are now debating was flawed and needed improvement, then it was made and demonstrated by the amendment that was moved by the government in the House of Representatives and carried yesterday.</para></talk.start><para>What the government has done here is another mean and tricky exercise, and that is appropriate for this government. As I have said all along, the thing that underpins this scheme is an 11c a litre tax on retail sales of milk. When it comes to tax matters—as indeed all other matters, but particularly tax matters—this government is mean and tricky. They are not my words; they are the words of Shane Stone, federal president of the Liberal Party.</para><para>Senators will recall that a couple of days ago this Senate carried an amendment, moved by the opposition and supported by the Democrats and other minor party senators, to improve the supplementary assistance scheme for dairy farmers to ensure that more dairy farmers in serious financial difficulties would be able to access the package. We lowered the threshold of 35 per cent of income earned from market milk—that is the qualifying factor for access to this scheme—to 25 per cent. Further, we put into this scheme a floor of $15,000 as a guaranteed minimum, so that any farmer who earned 25 per cent of their income or more from market milk would be able to access this scheme and would be guaranteed at least $15,000. Just as there is a cap of $60,000 on this supplementary assistance package, we put in a floor of $15,000.</para><para>When it got to the House of Representatives after that amendment had been opposed by the government in this chamber, what happened? The government put up what it calls its compromise position. Its so-called compromise position was to say that $15,000 was what the opposition moved and the Senate agreed with as a minimum, so this government reduced it to $10,000. There was no real reason given as to why there should be a reduction from $15,000 to $10,000. In fact, the minister's speech identified the cost that the department had worked out for the additional assistance as some $19 million. It is clear that what the government has done here is not saving all that much on the total cost of what was involved in our amendment.</para><para>The minister, in my view, misled the House of Representatives. He repeated the assertion that was made by Senator Macdonald in this chamber that the opposition's amendment was going to cost $60 million. We clarified that in this chamber during the debate. That was an honest misunderstanding in respect of the government's interpretation of the intention of our amendment. We addressed that issue during the debate. The amendment was revised to make it very clear that people could access the scheme and get the minimum of $15,000 or a higher entitlement under the formula, but not both.</para><para>Having had that clarified and acknowledged by Senator Macdonald on the record, the minister, Mr Truss, gets up in the House of Representatives and continues this fallacious argument that the opposition's amendment would cost $60 million. Then he says that we have to amend this amendment, and he does it by reducing the minimum from $15,000 to $10,000 and comes up with this figure of $19 million. I would not have thought that the difference between $10,000 and $15,000 for that group of farmers who might be eligible to be paid the minimum because their formula does not give them that amount would cost a total of $41 million. But, according to this minister, it did.</para><para>The minister knew he was misleading the chamber, because it is on the record that we clarified that. But that is not the only thing that this minister misled the House of Representatives about. He asserted, once again, that this package was coming out of the goodness of the heart of the government and that it had been developed by the government, that it had been funded by the government, that this was terrific and that the opposition were really about trying to undermine the scheme. But by accepting our amendment, even though the government has qualified it, the government has acknowledged that our amendment was necessary to ensure that farmers who desperately needed this assistance would actually get an entitlement to it, and that will now happen.</para><para>The unfortunate thing, however, is that this government, in its trickiness, has played with the figures and has said, `Oh well, if the opposition, the Democrats and the other parties in the Senate say that you should get a minimum of $15,000, this government says that you are going to get a minimum of $10,000.' Frankly, you have to start asking what really drives the policy decisions of this government when it makes that sort of a change to what was a very appropriate amendment moved by this Senate.</para><para>I particularly want to point out that this minister once again has put this parliament in a position where it is now a quarter to one on Friday morning and if this legislation is not passed then the money will not be able to be paid to the dairy farmers. It is an affront to this parliament for such an important item for such an important industry that this parliament is put in this position. What did the minister say in his concluding remarks yesterday in the debate in the House of Representatives? He said:</para><quote><para>Frankly, if it is not passed by the Senate in this form tomorrow, the money simply will not be paid to dairy farmers.</para></quote><para>Once again, the minister is threatening the parliament and threatening the Senate by saying that, unless we agree to the meanness and the trickiness of this government and agree to reduce the amount that we guaranteed in our amendment from $15,000 to $10,000, dairy farmers are not going to get a cent out of this government. That is just disgraceful. I have to say that the opposition are going to reluctantly support this amendment because we are not going to stand by and watch dairy farmers hung out to dry again by this government and allow them to become the innocent victims of the games being played by the minister for agriculture and of his mismanagement of this scheme. </para><para>I want to clarify a couple of other issues. During question time yesterday, the minister sought to attack me. He had a bit of a shot at me by saying that I had made an incorrect statement when I referred to a meatworks that had received Dairy RAP funding as being in his electorate when it was actually in the electorate of Mr Somlyay. Honourable senators will recall that I corrected that on the record as soon as I became aware of it. I felt that that was the necessary thing to do. What is the government and the minister on about when the subject of a question in question time is to try to run some line on the basis that I might have made that slight error? </para><para>What I can say, which is true and which I will put on the record, is that this minister has had huge amounts of money paid to enterprises and other ventures in his electorate under a number of schemes, including Dairy RAP and Regional Solutions. Under round 1 of Dairy RAP, according to the figures that I have been supplied with by the department—and it was not easy to get these details originally, as Senator Woodley will recall, at estimates—65 per cent of the money in Queensland paid under Dairy RAP went to the minister's own electorate. I understand that he has an electorate that has a high dairy community. We have supported Dairy RAP, contrary to what the minister tried to assert—in fact, Dairy RAP came about because of our urgings—but it has become the plaything of this minister, as we saw with money being given to polocrosse centres and wine appreciation courses. Yet, as my colleague the member for McMillan, Mr Zahra, pointed out in the House yesterday, when his electorate put forward an excellent proposal for funding under Dairy RAP, what did they get? They got nothing—not a cent—out of this government, but Mr Truss has made sure that his electorate has done well.</para><para>We know that almost a third of the funds in the Regional Solutions scheme—$4 million out of $12.6 million—has gone to Mr Truss's electorate. You start to wonder why this has happened. Well, obviously he is concerned about his political future. My colleague Senator Hogg referred to the motto in Monto. Monto is a dairy community in Mr Truss's electorate. I recall when I visited there, and Senator Hogg referred to this, that I saw the motto of the shire council in Monto is: `In abundance prepare for scarcity.' It is a good motto for that area because, in the past in Monto, they have had abundance but, unfortunately because of this minister's neglect of his electorate, they are now suffering scarcity. We certainly support the Dairy RAP scheme, which of course is also a part of this legislation, but we will continue to point out areas where we believe there has been pork-barrelling or milk-barrelling, or whatever people want to call it, which is simply to try to prop up the political future of Mr Truss and other members of the government. </para><para>I do not want to hold up the Senate any longer, but I believe it is important to put on the record our absolute disgust at the government's approach to this issue. It has delayed bringing this legislation in, it dropped it in the Senate only in the last couple of weeks and the committee was forced, once again, to hold in a hurry public hearings to allow people in the industry to make their representations. We have cooperated at every step of the way to get this legislation through the parliament, and we passed an amendment that the government itself recognised needed to be passed. But what did it do? It got back to the House, tinkered with the figures and reduced the minimum payment from $15,000 to $10,000.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator Troeth</name></talker><para>—You could have passed this on Tuesday.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—The parliamentary secretary at the table says that we could have passed this.

That was never put. In fact, the minister, Senator Ian Macdonald, stood up at the end of the debate and said that the government did not accept the amendment in any event.

Really, the government accepted the rationale for the amendment moved here. I think senators will remember that, in fact, there were three amendments: one from the Labor Party, one from the Democrats and one from Senator Harris for One Nation. There was a compromise. We worked together to get a compromise amendment up. It is a shame that the government did not enter into that debate at that point and actually put its compromise. We could probably have expedited the whole debate if that had been so.</para></talk.start><para>I point out that, in the minister's second reading speech, the government indicated that this new payment would provide benefits to about 892 additional farm enterprises. The parliamentary secretary might comment on whether that is 892 on top of the 300 to 400 we were told about the last time we had this supplementary assistance bill before us, or whether that includes the original 300 to 400. In any case, whichever way you look at the figures, this is at least a doubling of the number who will be assisted, and I am pleased about that. I am pleased that the government has taken on board what the Senate told it. </para><para>The government amendment does not quite mirror the amendment that was passed here but it mirrors it fairly closely, apart from the money. So the Democrats accept that the government has at least come some of the way towards acknowledging that we were right. The only regret I have, of course, is that the other amendments that Senator Harris and I moved, which would have helped other farmers who are in desperate need, were not accepted by the Senate. I believe they were also totally valid. They were based on the evidence we heard at the Senate committee hearings and, in fact, were acknowledged in the Senate committee's report. But the Senate did not accept those other amendments. That is a terrible shame, because I expect there is going to be some fairly disappointed people out there. Nevertheless, we have come part of the way to solving the problem.</para><para>The minister really needs to be careful about what he says—and not only what he says about Senator Forshaw. He was reported in the media as having said that if we do not accept his amendment, there will be a blow-out in the budget. That is just not accurate. The budget is not involved in this issue at all. The revenue is raised through the 11c a litre levy on retail sales of milk. We could argue about who actually pays it. Farmers have had a drop in their income of more than 11c a litre, particularly on market milk, so in a sense they are paying. This bill, as did the previous bill, simply refunds the money that has been taken from farmers. There was no threat of a blow-out in the budget because of what the Senate did. The minister really needs to be careful about what he says in the House of Representatives and in the media.</para><para>As I have said, the Democrats will support the amendment. I checked with the QDO and the South Australian dairy farmers who gave evidence to our Senate committee, as well as with some farmers in Queensland. They are so desperate they said, `We will accept the drop that this government compromise amendment represents, because we desperately need the money.' In a sense, they were held over the blowtorch and were prepared to accept it as long as the money began to flow. Certainly, I am not about to be blamed for depriving desperate struggling farmers from receiving some more assistance. With those few words, I indicate again that the Democrats will support this compromise amendment moved by the government in the House of Representatives and now here in the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>25514</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Pauline Hanson's One Nation will support the government's bill, but the amendments that the government have agreed to do not address the lessors' situation. The government have indicated that their proposal is costed at approximately $19 million and that it will take two months of levy to cover it. If we use that equation and the government's assessment of up to $60 million for Labor's original proposal, all that was required was to extend the period for six months. No Australian would object to paying 11c a litre extra for their milk to assist those dairy farmers by way of what was Labor's original amendment. There does not appear to be any elaboration on any of the difficulties that may continue to arise with sharefarmers, lessors and lessees. Is 21 May 2001 set down as a criterion? In other words, does a person have to be operating their dairy on that date to be eligible for this supplementary assistance package?</para></talk.start><para>If that is the case, how does the government propose to assist those lessors, where the lessee has walked off the property—taken the package and the stock—and they do not have a dairy to be eligible for this additional supplement? I would really appreciate a response from the minister on that. The figures that I have to hand indicate that there will be approximately 892 farmers who will gain a benefit from this additional package. As Senator Woodley has clearly indicated, the figures we have show that more than 1,000 farmers missed out in the first assessment, so there are still a substantial number of farmers who will not be assisted. Although the government's proposed additional funding is appreciated by those in the industry, it does not solve the problem; it is merely a stopgap measure. Sadly, the price that is being paid to producers is still going down.</para><para>Senator Forshaw raised an interesting situation in Minister Truss's own electorate, which had previously supplied a substantial amount of dairy products into Brisbane. We now have the ridiculous situation where, because of the shortages in the south-east corner, they are now trucking milk on a weekly basis from Mareeba to Brisbane. That is more than 1,800 kilometres. The government did not anticipate that some of the largest producers would take the package and opt out, and that is what has caused the shortages of dairy products in these areas. For the industry to survive, and to enable the farmers to have some negotiating leverage back into their industry, there is only one way to resolve this issue: to re-regulate the industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>25515</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators for their comments. Earlier this week, the Senate requested the House to consider an amendment to the <inline ref="R1294">Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001</inline> to provide for a flat minimum payment of $15,000 to farmers whose market milk deliveries are more than 25 per cent under the DSAP scheme. The proponents in the Senate, the ALP, estimated the cost of the minimum payment under this amendment to be within the range of $10 million to $15 million. Due to what the government understands was an unintended drafting error, the cost of the implementation of that change was likely to be closer to $60 million. The change was therefore rejected by the government. I understand from the advisers that we were told not to put our present compromise amendment because you, Senator Forshaw, would not accept it. If you were too proud at that stage to change your amendment, that is why we are here at 1.05 a.m. debating this particular amendment. We could have passed this on Tuesday, but the delay in the legislation has been caused by what happened during the debate in the Senate earlier this week.</para></talk.start><para>The government has indicated that it is prepared to consider a compromise amendment which reflects the intent of the opposition amendment. It also increases the coverage of the additional market milk payments but it does so in a much more targeted way and retains a sharp and measured focus on providing assistance to the most vulnerable dairy farmers. The government's amendment would lower the eligibility threshold by 10 percentage points from 35.1 to 25.1 per cent market milk dependency and would provide a stepped minimum payment of $10,000 or $15,000, depending on the level of market milk deliveries.</para><para>In effect, the government's new basic market milk payment right sets a floor in the market milk payment for those enterprises which have a market milk dependency of more than 25 per cent. Enterprises with a market milk dependency of more than 25 per cent and less than 30.1 per cent would be eligible for a minimum enterprise entitlement of $10,000, and from 30.1 per cent upwards the entitlement would increase to $15,000. Once market milk dependency reaches more than 35 per cent, the enterprise would then be entitled to the additional market milk payment currently provided for in the bill.</para><para>As senators are aware, the bill already provides for additional payments to be made based on a sliding scale from 0.12c a litre, for market milk deliveries of 35.1 per cent or more, up to 12c a litre at 45 per cent and above. It is important to note that an entity will be eligible for the larger of the basic payment or the additional market milk payment. This means that, if an enterprise meets the eligibility criteria for both the minimum basic market milk entitlement of $15,000 and an additional market milk entitlement of $20,000, the enterprise would be entitled to the larger of the two sums, which is in fact $20,000. This entitlement would be shared amongst the entities in accordance with their sharing of the entitlements under the original package, provided they were still involved in a dairy farm enterprise on 21 May 2001.</para><para>Senator Harris, for your benefit I would just like to say that the point you raised about the lessors will still be up to the Dairy Adjustment Authority to decide and would depend on such questions as whether they were actively seeking a lessee, et cetera. But the date of 21 May 2001, which you asked about, still applies.</para><para>As with the additional market milk payment, farmers will have the choice of taking the basic market milk payment as a lump sum or as a quarterly payment over eight years. This new payment is expected to provide benefit to about 892 additional farm enterprises, with some 569 being in South Australia, 129 in New South Wales, 134 in Queensland and 60 in Western Australia. The proposal is estimated to cost an extra $19 million and will require an extension of the 11c levy for about two months.</para><para>Senator Woodley, with regard to your question about the additional numbers, we are not aware of the 300-plus figure that you mentioned. The minister actually referred in his remarks to the increase in the number of enterprises picked up by the additional—either $10,000 or $15,000—minimum payments over the original Commonwealth proposal.</para><para>I believe that the government has moved promptly to address the concerns of vulnerable dairy farmers and their communities in light of the request it has received from the industry and as revealed by the ABARE report. If there is any disgrace in these whole proceedings, it is the fact that Labor state governments, by and large, have failed to help farmers; it is the federal government which has stepped in to help. Indeed, the alternative dairy plan which was being canvassed by Queensland Labor earlier this year wanted to remove part of the Dairy Regional Assistance Program, and indeed dairy farmers would be a great deal worse off under any of the ALP policies than under this proposal by the government.</para><para>Payments under the Supplementary Dairy Assistance Scheme, including the basic market milk payment, will be largely based on DSAP entitlements and information already available to the Dairy Adjustment Authority. Notification of the additional market milk and basic market milk entitlements will be made shortly after passage of this bill, and payments can be made promptly on completion of acceptance processes. As this is the last day of the current winter sittings, the government wishes to stress the importance of the passage of the legislation before parliament rises. Farmers are in genuine need, and it is imperative that they receive this additional assistance as soon as possible rather than face a delay of two months or more, should the government's compromise proposal not be accepted today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>25516</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not delay the debate very long. I just have to rise to speak again.

Referring to his compromise amendment, which has now been passed in the House of Representatives, Minister Truss said yesterday:</para></talk.start><quote><para>This alternative was offered in the Senate but rejected by the Labor Party at the time. The issue could have been resolved in the Senate last night but that was not what happened.</para></quote><para>That is not true. What happened is this: the Labor Party's amendment was moved and carried very early in the debate. I am sure Senator Harris and Senator Woodley will recall that it was one of the first amendments carried. Subsequently, approaches were made by the government advisers to the opposition advisers with respect to the wording of the amendment. I would have thought that what goes on in negotiations between the government advisers and the advisers of the opposition or any other party stays there. At no stage in the course of the debate did Minister Macdonald ever indicate that the government had an alternative proposition. Bear in mind that the amendment had already been carried, and it was some time later that approaches were made through the advisers. I understand no approaches were ever made to Senator Woodley or to Senator Harris about any compromise amendment. People from the government's side were still trying to do calculations as to the cost. I am saying again—and I want it recorded—that the parliamentary secretary has misled the Senate with her statements, just as the minister misled the House of Representatives yesterday as to what occurred.

So it was amendments Nos 1 to 4. Thank you. I have a copy of the running sheet now. Now that I have been provided with the running sheet, let me try and encapsulate in one concise but thorough contribution the view of the opposition in relation to the <inline ref="R1136">Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline>. In this instance, on behalf of Senator Evans, I would like to put on the record again Labor's position on this important issue.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Labor of course believes in the need for a child support scheme. Labor introduced this scheme in 1988 and it has been an important policy. There are few non-resident parents who today question their obligation to provide material support for their children. Unfortunately, that was not always the case. The child support scheme has reinforced to parents that they have obligations to their children. The scheme is also an important hedge against child poverty. Research by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling concludes that the scheme lifts around 60,000 children out of poverty each year. However, there is clearly a case for reform of the child support scheme, and Labor supports reform.</para><para>The scheme is now more than 12 years old and, during that time, a great deal of change has occurred that has impacted on the scheme's efficiency. There are also considerable concerns from both resident and non-resident parents that the scheme is not as fair as it could be. Nevertheless, it is difficult for political representatives because we are told by each side that the scheme is skewed against them. This may be the case in some areas. Changes to taxation laws, to employment patterns and to social security legislation, not to mention shifting community expectations, have all had an impact on people's experience of the child support scheme. However, we cannot respond properly to these pressures on the scheme with ad hoc changes that simply tilt the scales marginally one way or the other or, worse still, simply take money from one side to address perceived unfairness on the other. This kind of cheeseparing always leaves the same number of problems.</para><para>The legislation contains a number of positive measures. In fact, we have, without question, supported some seven out of the original 10 measures proposed. Tonight, we will support an additional two measures. However, in the view of the opposition, this legislation has attempted to fudge the reform task that confronts us. I will give an example that relates to the proposal to limit the income cap for payers on high incomes. Labor's opposition to this measure is about fairness and concern for lower income earners. </para><para>There are a number of ways to tackle this issue. One way, which would deliver benefits to those on lower incomes as well as high income earners, is to lift the amount of disregarded income that is not currently considered an amount of more than $10,000. This might be fairer because it takes into account those at the bottom. But you cannot do this without looking across at the financial impact on resident parents. That is the real problem with some of the measures in this bill. There is a failure to look thoroughly at the overall effect of some of the changes. No-one would expect resident parents looking for a break on child support obligation that they believe is unfair to focus only on the big picture. They just want some relief. We understand that. But for every person that will gain a dollar, there is one losing a dollar. There are plenty of resident parents with these concerns that will not get one cent from the government's measures. It is time we took everyone's views and circumstances into account.</para><para>In the interests of trying to move this particular committee stage debate along, I would like now to move to the measures in this bill that will benefit second families. Labor has supported these measures from the beginning. We are hopeful that they will be passed and come into force soon. These measures have been well thought out and, unlike other parts of this bill, do not simply take from one side to give to the other. There is a recognition that government has to do more to assist separated families and in particular second families. We are proposing a request to amend the bill to alter the impact of the measure relating to shared care. Our request is to make further changes to family tax benefits to ensure that the introduction of shared care to the child support scheme creates no losers. </para><para>In trying to do shared care on the cheap, the government is playing God with other people's money. The only rational way to proceed, if you want to make it fair, is to recognise that government has a role to play. The opposition's view is that unless our request is passed we cannot support the shared care measure to be discussed after that. This request makes shared care workable. The opposition would like to restate its support for the principle of shared care. There is nothing wrong with it. However, the government's attempt to enshrine this principle in legislation in both the social security rules and now in the child support rules has created a crude financial incentive to shared care rather than addressed the costs to parents who want to share care.</para><para>Recent research conducted by Paul Henman and Kyle Mitchell has thrown more light on this issue. Their research shows that non-resident parents do incur costs as a result of having contact with their children. What is important about the research is that they show that the costs to both separated parents sharing care are higher than the costs of share for intact families. This means that reform of child support which seeks only to shift the balance of resources between resident and non-resident families does not address the real economic pressure both sides may be under. In other words, if the combined costs of caring for children in separated families are 120 per cent of the costs they incurred when they were together, it is no good just trying to divide the original pool of resources differently. The research conducted by Henman and Mitchell should force senators to look more closely at what the opposition has proposed: the change to social security payment tapers that would have ensured that we do not have a situation of robbing Peter to pay Paul.</para><para>Whichever way the debate goes tonight, Labor is prepared to sit down with the government and other parties in the near future to settle the outstanding issues. The opposition is moving a number of requests for amendments to this bill, and I urge the Senate to support them. In the interests of time, I have tried to canvass the issues that will come before the committee in this debate. I hope it might assist the committee to make this one substantive contribution and to propose at a later stage in a more formal way—if that would please the minister, and I am sure it would—the requests for amendments that stand in the name of Senator Evans on behalf of the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>25522</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to incorporate a general speech on this matter.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows—</inline></para><quote><para>With the marked increase in marriage dissolution and family separation in Australia over the past 25 years, the welfare of the children of that dissolution is paramount.</para><para>We recognise that for the most part children have two parents.

It is probably better than access, or contact, but it does not reflect the reality that both parents have responsibilities and rights with regard to the parenting of their children, and the Democrats will not lose sight of the importance to children of having both separated parents involved in their upbringing.

Some have little or no contact with their children, most have some contact and many provide significant amounts of direct care for their children. Nor will we allow any notion of assignation of guilt relating to the reasons behind the separation of parents to impact on the rights of children to be parented, supported and nurtured. We will not support moves to make them pawns in the difficult relationships between their parents.</para><para>But in the end, the majority of the Child Support Bill is about the cost and payment of raising children in families where for whatever reason parents do not live together. It is not surprising that research by Henman/Mitchell reports that payer parents do incur additional costs as a result of having contact with their children. Indeed that research seems to be the basis for the Government wanting to move the measures before us which take from one parent and give to the other. But Henman/Mitchell, reports that the cost of caring for children by separated families is considerably greater than a pro-rata proportion of the cost of caring for children by an intact couple. Shifting the cost from one parent to the other does not address this.</para><para>It is disappointing that, despite having indicated from the start, our support for 7 of the 10 elements of the Bill, and which would have provided financial advantage for payers, this Bill has been delayed by 7 months. It is particularly unfortunate that the Government could not have seen the wisdom of earlier separating out and passing those elements, particularly as they do not negatively impact on the payee. However this did not happen and we are here today to again consider all 10 measures of the original Bill and indeed a further two amendments.</para><para>I will now address the two amendments proposed by the Government and which deal with Family Tax Benefit. With the wisdom of hindsight, the shared care provisions of Family Tax Benefit are certainly problematic. We are about to witness the raising of hundreds of thousands of FTB debts by Centrelink simply because the change in FTB legislation with relation to shared care was not made clear to parents in that situation. Time and time again constituents contact my office to say they have been hit by a debt of FTB. Their puzzlement is clear—their caring circumstances have not changed. They were not clearly told that the goalposts of eligibility for FTB for shared care had moved significantly. It was only in a Centrelink families publication received by parents in January of this year, and after questions raised by the Democrats that the reality that shared care would mean that Centrelink would be seeking repayment of FTB since July 2000. Their degree outrage at the debt is mirrored by the difficulty and hardship they will encounter in repaying it, over many years. I am interested to hear this morning of at least one successful appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal where the notion of changed circumstances was thrown out, and the debt nullified.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">New Amendments</inline></para><para>So the Australian Democrats welcome with caution the opportunity for the payee parent to receive the full entitlement to FTB. We are concerned at the leverage this could provide to some payee parents who face difficulties in negotiating their parental role with the resident parent. The notion of “<inline font-style="italic">guess what I can do to you</inline>” is inappropriate empowerment over parties where in reality, animosity and bad behaviours may already exist between separated parents. However the capacity for one party to waive their entitlement to Family Tax Benefit in favour of the other, provided it is done so in a non-extortionlike manner, allows parties to agree that the percentage of shared care does not equate to shared costs, as was found by the Henman report. Henman points out that for example, a child's dental costs are almost exclusively met by the resident parent, notwithstanding that the child may spend between 10 and 30% of time with the non-resident parent. In supporting this amendment, I would like to think however that it will advantage those parents who elect to use it to maintain harmonious parenting.</para><para>The Australian Democrats also support the second amendment, which enables a child support debt to be recovered from a person's entitlement to Family Tax Benefit. Child Support assessment is based on the premise that parents pay a share of their income to support their children. The legislation allows for ongoing factors which result in changes to that income, and therefore it can be generally stated that where a person has a child support debt, that they have failed to meet their obligation.</para><para>Our support of this amendment does not mean we are not concerned at its impact on payee parents. The measure before us is not punitive to the payee parent, rather it is based on the need of the child to access the assessed level of support determined. It is undesirable that a person who has failed to provide for the support of their child should benefit from Family Tax Benefit legislation while the child goes without. In an ideal world, the child would benefit from the full payment of child support, however this does not happen and in this circumstance this amendment is appropriate.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">INSIST ON 3 PREVIOUS AMENDMENTS</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Reduction in child support liability for shared care where the non-resident parent has contact with the child for between 10 and 30% of the time-oppose</inline></para><para>We do not dispute that non-resident parents have costs—indeed the 1988 report of the Child Support Formula for Australia (a report from the Child Support Consultative Group) at Chapter 11 included in the development of the formula, the access costs incurred by non-custodial parents.

We have said before, we will enter into discussions with the Government on how to address this—perhaps a contact allowance is the answer—but we categorically oppose the inequity proposed by this amendment which will directly disadvantage those parents who have between 70 and 90% care of their children, and whose costs have not proportionately reduced.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Reduction of the cap from $101,153 to $78,838—oppose.</inline></para><para>There is no evidence that the present cap constitutes a disincentive to payers to work.

They pretty well mirror the amendments of the Labor Party, so I presume that means we can come together fairly quickly. The Australian Democrats insist on our earlier Senate amendments (1), (3), (4) and (5), which oppose three measures in the original bill. At the same time, we support the two new amendments proposed by the government. The first of the previous amendments upon which we insist is reduction in child support liability for shared care where the non-resident parent has contact with the child for between 10 and 30 per cent of the time. In other words, we will be insisting on our original opposition to that issue. We do not dispute that non-resident parents have costs.

It is pleasing to see that this bill does take into account the impact and the difficulties felt by second families. This is the first of what I hope will be many steps to right a lot of the wrongs in relation to the child support process.</para></talk.start><para>It has been suggested that one section of the bill that recognises the costs of the custodial parent who has the children from 10 per cent up to 30 per cent of the time is merely taking from the other parent. I strongly disagree with that. I believe that if the non custodial, or payer, parent has the custody of the children for between 10 per cent and 30 per cent of the year then that should be recognised. It is a difference of between 30 nights per year and 100 nights per year. At present, if the bill is not amended, there is no consideration for a parent who has the children in his or her custody for 70 nights per year, and I believe there should be. I would like to see the child support process improved to the point where the payer, or non custodial, parent had some form of input into how the payments were used. That could be by agreement, preferably, and I believe that it would remove from the process a lot of the dissatisfaction if the payer parent had some form of input. </para><para>To emphasise the point, I will give as an example the situation with one paying parent that I know whose children's ages range between 18 and 20 years. That parent would like to make those payments directly to the children. However, the custodial, or the receiving, parent will not in any way consent to that and maintains that the payment for these adults—because at this stage they are not children—must go through the custodial parent. If those issues were addressed within the child support process, it would move a long way towards removing some of the problems with the act in its present form. I commend the government for moving in the right direction and indicate that Pauline Hanson's One Nation will support the government in these requests.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY

The Democrats will accept the amendments passed in the House of Representatives. Senators will be aware that the Democrats had a number of significant concerns with the original bill, which is why we moved a number of amendments and supported a number of opposition amendments to substantially strengthen the legislation. We acknowledge the support of the opposition for our changes to the board and the government's agreement to this representative structure. In the committee stage, we indicated that we were happy for an additional representative from New Zealand, pending discussion with the relevant New Zealand authorities. The government's amendment to our board structure to allow the additional member from the non-mandated positions is acceptable to the Democrats.</para></talk.start><para>Senators will recall that the Democrats were particularly unimpressed with the structure of the ministerial council. We were of the view that the intergovernmental agreement needed to be revisited to ensure that the health ministers were the lead ministers from each jurisdiction. We did not and do not consider appropriate that the agriculture and trade ministers should have undue influence on food standards which fundamentally go to ensuring health and public safety. That is why we supported the opposition's amendment to make ministerial guidelines a disallowable instrument.</para><para>The Democrats are pleased that the Prime Minister has taken note of opposition and Democrat concerns and has indicated to the health minister that he would write to the heads of government in the near future to convey the Commonwealth government's wish to make health ministers the lead minister from each jurisdiction. We welcome the government's movement on this. It needs to be noted that the change to the IGA is not certain. However, we are aware that the majority of states support the refocusing of the ministerial council to reflect the core objective of FSANZ, the body that supersedes ANZFA. Accordingly, the Democrats will not press for the retention of the disallowable instrument. Given the significance of this change for public confidence in Australia's food standards, I think it is only reasonable that the Prime Minister's intention be publicly recorded. So I would ask two things of the parliamentary secretary: firstly, what precisely has the Prime Minister stated in respect of his intention to write to the other heads of government; and, secondly, what precisely is the Prime Minister's request to other heads of government?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>25530</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will support the bill as amended by the House of Representatives.

On the basis of that commitment, and similar to the Democrats, we have agreed not to pursue our amendments in relation to the disallowable instruments. We believe the states will embrace this change. We hope that the commitment will be honoured as soon as possible and that the issue will be resolved as soon as possible.

As Senator Brown has indicated, and I concur, the bill as it now stands amended by the House is not as good as it could have been. It is certainly not as strong as it was with the 90-odd Democrat amendments that were agreed to in this place earlier in the week. I put on the record that the process with the bill has been less than ideal, but I recognise that it is preferable to have it pass now. The additional amendment the government has added in the House of Representatives is problematic. The process involved with that is of concern to the Democrats as well, but the package of legislation as it now stands is clearly an improvement on the law in relation to wildlife trade. Some of the Senate amendments that have been retained do mean significant enhancements, in particularly making it an offence for the release of live plants held under permit.</para></talk.start><para>Allowing the release of live plants is significant, particularly given the weed problem in many areas of Australia. Ensuring the precautionary principle is an important measure. The duration of permits has been shortened as a result of Senate amendments. A range of matters are required to be considered by the minister. Assessment is required of environmental impact of the activities covered by any plan to approve a wildlife trade operation. Exceptional circumstance permits must comply with CITES requirements. These are some of the Senate amendments that have been agreed to by the government, and they certainly strengthen the bill. It is a shame that some other amendments—particularly some of the consultation measures and some of the animal welfare measures—were not accepted by the House of Representatives. There is still plenty of room for improvement in the environmental legislation governing this country. The Democrats, as I am sure will others in this place, will continue to look for opportunities to further strengthen our federal environment laws, but this legislation goes some steps in that direction. For that reason, the Democrats support this motion.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Resolution reported; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25537</page.no><id.no>R1330</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>25537</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 21 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>25537</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My intention is to seek to incorporate some remarks on the <inline ref="R1330">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2001</inline>, but there are some other issues I need to articulate. Given that we are now at 2 o'clock and we have another education bill to follow, I am sure all senators would welcome us proceeding at speed. Unfortunately, though, I need to get some advice from some officials.</para></talk.start><para>This particular proposition is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act to: provide base funding for universities for 2003; provide funding for 2002-03 for extra places as part of the budget measures, and that is to include some 670 extra places for regional universities; provide funding for 2002-03 for extra support for people with disabilities; vary maximum funding levels to reflect higher HECS receipts; reflect supplementation in regard to Commonwealth superannuation liabilities; transfer funds from the Australian Research Council Act to enable the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University to access ARC competitive grant programs; clarify the treatment of HECS debts in the event of bankruptcy of the debtor; and broaden the ministerial guidelines making power in relation to HECS and work experience in industry. Further, the bill will amend the Australian Research Council Act to provide base funding for 2003, to supplement for price increases and to transfer funds from HEFA, as already indicated. The opposition's view is that we should support this legislation, depending upon clarification of a number of issues. </para><para>I move this second reading amendment:</para><quote><para>At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate condemns the Government for:</para><para>	(a)	reducing government expenditure on universities by $3 billion and shifting the burden onto students and graduates;</para><para>	(b)	cutting 3,500 research training places, including 800 at regional universities; and</para><para>	(c)	continuing to work towards total university fee deregulation”.</para></quote><para>I trust the Senate will support that second reading amendment.</para><para>Is the minister able to advise me whether or not the government is prepared to take some questions on notice and provide answers within a reasonable period, such as that set down for the return of answers to questions from estimates? If so, it may in fact facilitate the passage of this legislation. Is that possible? At the end of the second reading debate, I will seek the answers to those questions.</para><para>In particular, I would like to have answers to the following questions. Does this bill seek to establish clearly that accumulated HECS cannot be extinguished by bankruptcy? Have there been instances where this has happened already? Is it the case that, under the changes proposed in the bill, the Commonwealth would have the power to claim a proportion of bankrupt HECS debtor's assets, even if in the year of bankruptcy the debtor's income was below the normal HECS repayment threshold? What are the equity measures in this for the debtors, given that others of the same income would not need to repay HECS? What are the equity arrangements for other creditors who might receive less because of the HECS repayments being made to the Commonwealth? To what extent do the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act not apply to HECS as currently administered? If it is possible, I would like to have those questions answered. I expect there will be a need to have detailed responses to those questions.</para><para>The opposition is concerned about the inconsistencies in this legislation. It is normal that after three years a bankrupt is discharged, and other debtors are automatically freed from most kinds of debts. The bill establishes that the provision for the automatic discharge of debts will not apply to HECS debts and that HECS debts have a particular character. Unlike other debts, they do not automatically have to be repaid but are repaid only under certain circumstances—that is, when the debtor's income reaches a certain level—and they are extinguished by death. For other debts, repayments are made out of the deceased debtor's estate but for HECS there is no repayment made from the estate of the deceased debtor. Why are HECS debts not treated equally with other debts by making them provable—that is, payable—in the event of bankruptcy?</para><para>It would be simpler, more effective and consistent to exclude all HECS debts from the operation of the Bankruptcy Act. That does not appear to be the case under this arrangement, and, if I have understood that correctly, why not? It would seem that there is not an extinguishment of debt. Rather, such a debt would not be considered or repaid by the trustee appointed under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, but would still be repaid when the debtor's income reached the required level. Can the Commonwealth initiate bankruptcy proceedings against the result of unpaid HECS debts? As you can see, a number of issues still require further explanation. Is it possible to have detailed answers to those questions in the same time frame as Senate estimates questions on notice are answered? I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my remarks.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>Apart from providing base funding for universities and ARC for 2003, the major measures in this Bill implement Budget measures to provide funding for extra places at regional universities and campuses, and extra support for people with disabilities.</para><para>The regional universities initiative—$35.2 million over four years doesn't go anywhere near making up for the $171 million taken from regional universities in the 1996 Budget cuts.</para><para>As well, the Government's reduction of 3,500 research training places, as part of its White Paper changes, included 800 places lost from regional institutions.</para><para>This shows that the Howard Government has not suddenly realised the importance of education, training and research to Australia's future, but is simply in pre-election spending mode, in a desperate attempt to stay in office.</para><para>If they succeed, then the infamous Cabinet Submission will be given new life.

If public funding had been maintained at 1996 levels, there could have been an extra 21,000 places in 1997, and an extra 54,000 places this year.</para><para>Compared with these cuts, the extra places in this Bill look hopelessly inadequate.</para><para>Despite the Government's attempts to deny the findings of the Monash University Report on Australia's performance as a Knowledge Nation, it cannot deny that Australia ranks 21 out of 29 in the OECD in terms of public expenditure on education.</para><para>Australia's public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP—at 4.34—is still below the OECD average of five per cent, and well below that of the five leading OECD countries. which all spend more than six per cent.</para><para>Australia's average investment per tertiary student of $US29,194 compares with an OECD average of $35,087.</para><para>DETYA's own figures show the number of students per teaching staff member in our universities has risen from 15.3 to 18.84 since the Howard Government took office.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>25539</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to incorporate the remarks of Senator Stott Despoja.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>The Democrats will support the various measures in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2001.</para><para>I notice the Minister's second reading speech proudly points out that enrolments are projected to grow by 27% between 1995 and 2003. What the Minister didn't point out was most of that growth is international students domestic student numbers dipped in 2000 and preliminary estimates suggest it has declined again in 200 1. What the Minister also failed to mention is revenue is only expected to increase by 21.5% in the same period.</para><para>This simply means less resources per student. While the projections for further effective cuts per student may suit the ideological agenda of the Minister, nobody who knows anything about education or cares about the quality of education will consider this good news.</para><para>Universities cannot sustain their current rate of expenditure relative to income growth. Analysis of the state of universities' finances undertaken by DETYA and published in the Higher Education Reports for the 2000 to 2002/ 2001 to 2003 Trienniums show a declining trend since 1996. For example, the sector-wide safety margin (which measures the ability of universities to contain expenditure within the constraints of available revenue) has fallen from 6.5% in 1997 to 3.3% in 1999, with two institutions recording negative safety margins in 1998 and 1999. Since 1996, borrowings have increased by $83m, or 31 %. Total revenue growth has slowed over each of the past two years.</para><para>We are all aware of the 6% cuts to operating grants announced in 1996 but this doesn't give a true picture because the increases in higher education cost structures over the past five years have been dramatic.</para><para>The First Assistant Secretary of the Higher Education Division of DETYA, Michael Gallagher, estimates that the gap between operating grant indexation and actual salary outcomes has risen to around 15% over the last 5 years. When the effects of a declining Australian dollar are factored into the cost structure of universities—which spend heavily on foreign-sourced items such as books, journals and laboratory equipment—the unfunded shift in the cost structure of universities is at least 20%.</para><para>The Minister also boasts in his second reading speech that university revenues have grown to a record level—estimated to be $9.5 billion in 2001—despite Commonwealth cutbacks.</para><para>What the Minister also neglects to mention is `diversification' of income sources and increase revenues from commercial and other private sources are not going back to universities' core activities to ensure a sufficient increase in dollars per student to meet rising expenditure costs. As a consequence, academic staff have dropped to 3 8% of the total staff of universities. Libraries are slashing their purchases of books and serials. Staff-student ratios have ballooned from 1:14.8 in 1996 to 1:18.8 in 2000.</para><para>The new private income from international education and elsewhere, has been applied to different functions to those supported by the old public income. Thus, the new private income has failed to substitute for the public investment that this Government has cut. The new private income has been applied to new or additional functions.</para><para>How much are our notionally public universities spending on marketing?</para><para>·	On international campuses?</para><para>·	On recruiting international and other fee paying students?</para><para>·	On corporate boxes at sporting events?</para><para>·	On fund-raising and alumni relations?</para><para>·	How much are they spending to make a commercial buck—90 cents in the dollar, 95 cents in the dollar?</para><para>These important questions go to the governance, resourcing and quality of the teaching and learning experience in our universities. The Democrats and indeed the sector remain frustrated that the Minister's persistent misinformation glosses the undeniable crisis in our universities. A crisis bought about by this government's own doing.</para><para>One of the measures in this Bill is to amend the Australian University Act 1991 to modify the advisory structure of the ANU Council. I am aware that there has been an effective consultation process within, the university on these governance changes and that they are supported by staff and students.</para><para>This Bill also provides for a modest increase of 670 funded places targeted at regional universities and campuses. This will help ameliorate the damage done by this government to regional universities.</para><para>One of the more devastating critiques of this Governments' approach to universities was recorded by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania who recently told the Senate Inquiry into The Capacity Of Public Universities To Meet Australia's Higher Education needs that the University of Tasmania could no longer meet the needs of Tasmania because of the lack of funded places.</para><para>The Lilydale Campus of Swinburne University of Technology has been forced into an unsustainable policy of massive over-enrolments at the marginal rate because this Government withdrew the Commonwealth Industry Placement Scheme (CIPS) and have never given Swinburne funded places for Lilydale.</para><para>The Government approved of Swinburne investing in this campus to ensure access for students in Melbourne's outer east—and have provided capital grants for the campus—they just refuse to provide funded student places. And the Government's response to such circumstances? Provider Beware, yes provider beware.</para><para>A fundamental responsibility of the Commonwealth is to ensure equitable access to education thus the Democrats welcome the appropriation in this Bill of $1.8 million in 2001 and $2.9 million in 2003 for disability support.</para><para>However, we need to consider the Government's performance in broader terms and the performance is poor. Indigenous students, rural and isolated students, people from low socio-economic backgrounds all remain seriously underrepresented in higher education. The difficulties these students, and indeed all students face is compounded by overly restrictive and totally inadequate income support measures.</para><para>A major barrier to participation is cost and it is important to understand that Australian students pay significantly higher tuition fees than most.</para><para>Let us set aside the miniscule percentage of students in expensive American ivy league private universities—in 1999-2000, the average fee paid by a student at a 4 year public university in the US—the largest sector in the US—was $US3,356. How does this stack up against fees in Australian Universities?</para><para>The only meaningful method in measuring relative cost is a conversion based on the respective purchasing power of the currencies involved. When converted to Australian dollars using the OECD purchasing power parities (PPPs) the average US fee is $A4,396.</para><para>However, in Australia in 2000, the average HECS fee was $A4,454. Thus, fees at Australian public universities are actually 1.3% higher than at comparable institutions in the US. Indeed Australia is now the third most privatised higher education sector in the world—a feat achieved at the direct expense of students.</para><para>As a final comment on this Bill, I note it is one of two omnibus education Bills we are considering today. Given the absolute mess the Government has made of the other Bill—this may well be one of the last two of these we see from this Government in this portfolio area.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>25540</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank senators for their contributions to the debate.

In addition to those remarks, I will say that this bill contains amendments to three separate bills. Some we considered only a few months ago—the ARC Bill and the HEFA Bill; and we have just considered another, separate amendment to the HEFA Bill. The third issue is amendments to the state grants bill, which we considered in December. I am particularly concerned that this government has felt it necessary to bring forward an omnibus bill covering those three areas. It is the first time this has occurred, to my knowledge. I cannot find another instance where an omnibus bill has been brought forward to contain matters that relate to the different sectors of education within one bill.</para></talk.start><para>It is particularly unfortunate and annoying that the government has sought to combine a range of measures which are, in reality, non-controversial—they are reasonable in the context of this government's policies—and which the Labor Party has no objection to with a range of other measure which appear to me to be unfair and unreasonable in the way in which they are being administered and which pose serious questions about basic equities. Therefore, as the shadow minister has indicated, we will be seeking to move a number of amendments in the committee stage that balance out the proposals and move for support for public education, which has so sadly been neglected by this government.</para><para>The substantive matter that we will need to discuss, which we will discuss by a contingent notice of motion that I will move in the committee stage, goes to splitting this bill into three. I will have to raise the matter in some detail at that point, because I believe it is quite a serious issue. If it is necessary, I will then bring forward other arguments about what I regard to be the administrative failure of the department insofar as they have paid certain moneys to certain schools which, on my reading, appear to be outside the guidelines. Frankly, the arguments put forward by the department in response to questions which they gave me only this morning are incredibly thin and not persuasive at all. When the opportunity arises, I may well have to explain the detail of that.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill</para><para>This Bill implements some of the measures from the Innovation Statement - a good thing, you might say, except that the Innovation Statement only slightly addressed the problems created by the previous five years of short-sighted and damaging cuts by the Howard Government.</para><para>Under John Howard, Commonwealth funding for universities has fallen every year - from $4.875 billion in 1996 to $4.223 billion by 2002.</para><para>This adds up to more than $3 billion taken from the public funding of universities.</para><para>In 2000, the number of Australian students at our universities fell by more than 3,000.</para><para>The extra university places announced in Innovation Statement - 2000 extra places a year - mean that it will take years even to repair last year's damage.</para><para>And the extra funding for research doesn't change the reduction in research training places at most Australian universities. This year, there are almost 3,500 fewer research training places at Australia's universities, thanks to the Government's White Paper on research. So much for its new-found, election-year interest in innovation.</para><para>Removal of these places research training places punishes newer universities which have tried to extend their research effort.</para><para>The Government tries to say this is about concentrating Australia's research effort but it is really about reducing investment. Despite the rhetoric, John Howard has not changed - while he might be giving with one hand, he's still taking away from our future with the other.</para><para>This Bill also establishes the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme (PELS), described by Dr Kemp in his second reading speech as being “designed to encourage lifelong learning and to help Australians upgrade and acquire new skills.</para><para>All very fine, except that, if this government was so concerned about helping Australians with lifelong learning, they would not have reduced HECS places for postgraduate coursework by 60 per cent.</para><para>Labor believes that a loan scheme has the potential to help students who otherwise would miss out on postgraduate study because of their inability to pay upfront fees, and we are prepared to support it in principle. Nevertheless, we recognise this framework - deregulated fees, with capped loans from the Commonwealth - as the scenario Dr Kemp would like to impose on the entire university sector. He outlined his plan in the infamous leaked Cabinet Submission. If the Coalition is returned at the next election. we can expect the full implementation of that Cabinet submission: total deregulation, vouchers, and real interest rates on student loans.</para><para>I should take this opportunity to state again, categorically, that a Labor Government will not deregulate undergraduate university fees and we will not allow real-interest loans.</para><para>We will, in fact, as we have said all along, phase out the capacity of universities to charge upfront fees to Australian undergraduates.</para><para>The introduction of PELS also opens up the possibility of universities putting up fees unreasonably, and we have some concerns about the mechanism the Government envisages to deal with this: a limit on the amount students may borrow.</para><para>The Opposition understands that what the Government has in mind is a single amount.</para><para>This could work unfairly in the case of people who incurred large HECS debts (because of course choices) before beginning postgraduate study.</para><para>In 1996, this Government increased HECS charges by up to 125%.</para><para>Courses in band three now cost $5,870 a year.</para><para>A four-year course at that rate would leave a student with a debt of $23,480.</para><para>Now, the same Government is seeking to limit that student's ability to access postgraduate education, because of their debt level.</para><para>But the students who would be most affected by the loan limit would be those whose only path to postgraduate study is a loan -those who can pay upfront will still be able to enrol.</para><para>The loan limit on the combined HECS / PELS debt could also disadvantage those students who are unable to pay their HECS up front in other words, those for whom financial considerations make access to university more difficult. And those are the students PELS is supposedly designed to help.</para><para>For this reason, Labor will be moving an amendment in to limit the Minister's power to set a maximum loan amount to consideration of PELS debts only - that is, not to include HECS.</para><para>I listened to the objections to this proposal as put by Departmental officers in the enquiry into this Bill on 25 June. My response to that is, Labor does not accept that the difficulties that were described ought to outweigh considerations of equity and fairness. For that reason, we will be proceeding with our amendment.</para><para>I note that the Minister's office is reported (The Age, 16 June) to have been “unable to supply examples of excessively high HECS debts” but advised that there were 2266 graduates with debts exceeding $20,000. So they have presented no evidence that HECS debts alone are a problem, but seem to have decided that debt levels exceeding $20,000 cross some sort of difficulty threshold.</para><para>Labor will also be moving an amendment requiring a review of the operation of PELS after 12 months. This will include looking at movements in fees, and I would like to reiterate the point made by the Shadow Minister when this Bill was debated in the House: Labor in government will review the PELS arrangements if universities seek to treat it as a major new source of revenue.</para><para>Before moving to the schools part of this Bill, I would like to make a further comment about evidence given to the committee on 25 June enquiring into this legislation. It was put to members of that Committee that there was a great deal of urgency about this Bill, because it implemented some important measures due to commence next year.</para><para>Those measures were announced in the Innovation Statement on 29 January. The Bill implementing them was not debated in the House until 19 June. If it is all so urgent, why wasn't it treated as urgent by the Government? Taking five months before beginning a second reading debate doesn't sound to me like a Bill that's being given priority by the Government.</para><para>Secondly, much was made in Departmental evidence before the committee about the so-called doubling of funding for the Australian Research Council. The fact is that the extra funding for the ARC, as announced in the Innovation Statement, is heavily back-loaded, with the vast bulk of funds - more than 65 per cent - not allocated until 2004 or Funding in this Bill for the ARC represents just 2.5 per cent of the promised extra funding.</para><para>The Government is so keen to develop innovation and research in Australia that it will be 2004 before any significant increase in funds is seen. It is clear that there is no urgency there. So let's have no more of this sham concern.</para><para>Nevertheless. Labor wants to make it absolutely clear that we do not want to stand in the way of any increase in funding for higher education research or university places, particularly given the way in which these key areas have been neglected by the Howard Government.</para><para>Therefore, in line with the notice I have already given, Labor will be moving to split this legislation into three parts,, one of which will deal only with the additional funding for the ARC and for higher education places. This will allow swift passage of the non-controversial parts of this legislation, while providing appropriate time for debate of the other elements.</para><para>It should be noted that. at the hearings of the Senate committee enquiry into this Bill on 25 June, the chairman, Senator Tierney, described this Bill as “complex”. His words were, “it is a complex bill”.</para><para>So it is very reasonable for Labor to seek to split it into schools and higher education parts, and, given the message of urgency the Government has sent, despite its own laxity, to seek to separate the non-controversial parts from the rest, in order to ensure quick passage for the sections delivering additional funding for the hard-pressed higher education sector.</para><para>I will now move on to the second part of this strangely-constructed Bill. There appears to be no precedent for funding for both universities and schools to be bundled into the one piece of legislation - another reason supporting splitting the Bill as I have described.</para><para>Last year's States Grants legislation provided $859,000 in 2001 for establishment grants, and $1,289m per annum in each of the following years.</para><para>This Bill seeks to increase those amounts by a total of $9.5 million, with the increase in 2001 being 330%, 262% in 2002, and 128% in both 2003 and 2004.</para><para>We now know that last October, the Government knew that the funds in the States Grants legislation then before Parliament were insufficient to provide for the number of new schools, and their large enrolments.</para><para>So what did this Government do?</para><para>Did it introduce an amendment to the legislation to try to ensure that, before any funds were actually paid out in establishment grants, the Parliament had appropriated the right amount of money?</para><para>No. It allowed a Bill which it knew was wrong to continue its passage through Parliament. And now the Government is trying to tell us that, because it has run out of money, because it failed to correct its own error last year, the Parliament must jump to attention, and deal with this Bill this week. Eight months after the Government knew of its mistake, it has the gall to tell the Senate that this Bill must be passed five days after it was introduced.</para><para>Labor's message to the Government is this: the Opposition has no intention of approving one extra cent of expenditure for non-government schools without a proportionate increase in funding for public education.</para><para>Secondly, the Senate Inquiry into this Bill suggests that a significant cause of the blowout in the cost of the establishment grant program is poor administration of the scheme. There are important questions to be answered before the Senate can give proper consideration to this legislation.</para><para>A significant element in this blowout is due to the Government and the Department neglecting their own guidelines and in the process artificially inflating the number of students at new non-government schools. We question whether any of the three schools (Christian College Institute of Secondary Education in Geelong, the Australian Islamic College in Kewdale, Perth and All Souls St Gabriels at Charters Towers, Queensland with a total of 1350 `new' students) cited by the Government as the principal reason for the massive increase in establishment grant funding do fall within the government's own guidelines.</para><para>The Government denies this concern. Their response is that “on the balance of evidence available at the time” they were accepted as new schools, that none of the schools are considered to have been formed from the separation, or the closure and re-opening, of an existing school. It is only possible to maintain their position if other evidence, that they either ignored or didn't bother to seek out, continues to be ignored.</para><para>Let me consider two examples, those of the Christian College Institute of Secondary Education, at Highton in Geelong and the Australian Islamic College at Kewdale in Perth, Western Australia.</para><para>The Government's opinion is based on the limited nature of the records that DETYA keeps. On the basis of that evidence they conclude that CCISE has a different ownership structure as the Christian College Highton, an adjunct school. They conveniently ignore three points: </para><para>·	That the boards of the two schools are almost exactly identical, with evidence of co-ordination and collaboration. Only the limited nature of the information that DETYA cares to keep allows them to maintain the legal fiction that the two are separate,</para><para>·	CCISE is registered as an RTO for purposes of VET in schools. If they are so separate, how does one explain the fact that the postal address for CCISE as an RTO is C/- Christian College Highton!</para><para>·	In the preamble of the report of the Victorian Registered Schools Board on its visit to CCISE there is a specific mention of the intention of Christian College Highton establishing CCISE as a new senior campus. DETYA notes this fact, but prefers not to pursue it, noting instead that it does not appear to be a new school.</para><para>This reminds me of the saying - if it looks like a duck, waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck!</para><para>But the wilful blindness and evasion of the Government is equally in evidence in the case of the Australian Islamic College. I refer them to the 2000 edition of the National Register of Independent Schools of Australia, page 46. Here the AIC is described, with its Head Office at Marmion Street, Booragoon with, AND I USE THEIR WORDS, campuses at Thornlie, Dianella and Kewdale. A campus at Kewdale! The school's own publicity makes this clear-</para><para>“The AIC has re-established the former Kewdale Senior High School site as co-educational operation with classes from years 1-12. The college has two other campuses...”</para><para>Campuses again! As I have said previously, the Government is either wilfully blind or intent on misleading us all. A new campus operation, by the government's own criteria, is ineligible for funding yet it persists with misrepresenting the facts.</para><para>Our concern does not lie with any of these schools or their registration, but with the sleight of hand in which this government is engaged. Although the Department couldn't be bothered to follow this up, even basic research reveals that these schools are either campuses of existing schools or is a pre-existing school re-established under a slightly altered name.</para><para>Two issues require greater scrutiny. To what extent has the Government ignored its own guidelines in this matter? Secondly, to what degree has DETYA engaged in expenditure beyond its appropriation as the result of sloppy administration?</para><para>Needless to say, there is not a cent extra in this Bill for government schools. Labor will not agree to it on those terms. We will be moving an amendment which calls for additional spending on government schools proportionate to the extra $12.9 million this Bill provides for non-government schools.</para><para>It is time for fairer treatment for public education from the Federal Government.</para><para>The Minister told us in a media release at the time of the Budget that the Government had a “commitment” to government schools. This is their chance to prove it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>25544</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to incorporate both my speech and that of my colleague Senator Stott Despoja on the <inline ref="R1282">Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speeches read as follows</inline>—</para><para>Speech by Senator Allison</para><para>I rise to speak tonight about the Innovation and Education Amendment Bill 2001.</para><para>This omnibus bill seeks to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1998, the Australian Research Council Act 2001 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000.</para><para>I will confine my comments to the provisions in this bill, which relate to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary) Assistance Act 2000. My colleague, Senator Natasha Stott-Despoja, will speak about those parts of the bill relating to higher education.</para><para>Amendments to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000, contained in this bill provide for:</para><para>·	an additional $9.5 million for establishment assistance for new non-government schools;</para><para>·	an additional $2.5 million for students with disabilities; and</para><para>·	an additional $760,000 for strategic assistance for educationally disadvantaged students in non-government schools</para><para>over the 2001-2004 quadrennium.</para><para>The Democrats welcome the provision of additional funding for students with disabilities and educationally  disadvantaged students in non-government schools.</para><para>We are, however, very concerned about is the massive increase in funding for establishment grants for non-government schools. Up by a staggering 330% for 2001, 200% for 2002 and by more than 100% for 2003 and 2004.</para><para>The Government is getting very used to significantly increasing the funding to non-government schools at the expense of government schools and the Democrats are getting very used to fighting them on this.</para><para>And we are clearly have the support of the Australian public.</para><para>The Government and Opposition may well be interested in Australian Education Union polling in marginal seats, which found that 94% of voters thought that the Government should spend more money on public education.</para><para> The Democrats were the only party to  oppose the iniquitous States Grants (Primary and Secondary Assistance) Bill 2000, when it was debated late last year. This Act awards an additional $700 million to the private schools over the next four years.</para><para>The Democrats opposed this bill because we are strongly committed to ensuring adequate resourcing of the public education system. We remain strongly opposed to the inequitable grants to non-government schools, particularly wealthy non-government schools, while public schools remain chronically under-funded.</para><para>There is simply no justification for providing already wealthy schools with even more public money, when government schools are starved of funds. I regularly visit government schools whose portables have been portables for so long that they are now considered permanent classrooms. You can't really say that they are portables when they have been in the same position for over 20 years.</para><para>And it needs to be understood (and the Opposition needs to be reminded) that it is not just the former Category 1 schools which are very well off. Penleigh and Essendon Grammar, a former Category 3 school in Victoria, which has a gymnasium, a swimming pool, an astro-turf hockey field, ovals, soccer grounds and squash courts was awarded an extra $3.39 million annually.</para><para>The annual fees of this school are approximately $8,900.</para><para>The Government claims that by providing more funding to such schools, they will lower their fees as a result. But there is no evidence to back this up. In fact evidence to the contrary was provided to the Committee.</para><para>One submission made reference to the survey of category 1 schools conducted by the Weekend Australian in June this year. The Australian spoke to all schools in this Category and found that only 8 out of the 59 said that any of that money would go to reducing fees.</para><para>It seems clear to me that Dr Kemp is on a mission. His mission is to get as many Australian students as possible into the private education sector.</para><para>The Australian Democrats, however, believe in public education. We believe in the benefits of being educated in the public realm. And we believe that the vast majority of public funds should be spent on the 70% of Australian students that belong to the public education system.</para><para>So, when the States Grants bill was debated last year, we put up amendments to remove provisions related to establishment grants for non-government schools but the Government and the Opposition voted against them.</para><para>We moved these amendments because the Democrats are opposed to the provision of establishment grants for non-government schools.</para><para>We believe that scarce public resources should not be spent on new non-government schools which have not been considered within the context of viability or need and which would be better spent on the severely underesourced public schools.</para><para>The Democrats argue that this extra money should be spent on government schools so that they are also able to attract more students to them.</para><para>But we note that $9.5 million is a drop in the ocean compared with what is really needed.</para><para>At this point I'd like to quote from the Association of Primary School Principal's report into the views of primary principals on the state of public education. This report examined the views of nearly 2,500 government primary school principals, who represent nearly 50%  of government principals in Australia. Collectively, these principals educate nearly a third of all Australian primary school children and hence what they have to say should be afforded great weight.</para><para>In relation to the condition of school facilities, the report stated that:</para><para>“Twenty -six per cent of principals indicated that their school facilities are badly in need of an upgrade. The largest group of principals, 57 per cent, indicated that their school facilities are adequate. The high rate at which problems with facilities were identified in handwritten statements, however, suggests that `adequate' may be a term that is applied fairly loosely.</para><para>The resource needs identified by respondents suggest that many school facilities, particularly old schools and those with high proportions of demountable buildings, have major design problems. Principals raised concerns about not being able to protect students from the sun, wind, rain or snow during Physical Education, school assemblies and when moving between buildings. The design problems associated with introducing computers into old classrooms are significant. More spacious and flexible learning areas are required in order to implement new outcomes-based curriculum frameworks and attain higher standards. And many schools lack an area where they can meet as a whole school, constraining the development of a sense of community.”</para><para>The Democrats are fully aware that the lack of appropriate facilities is just one of the myriad of problems facing public educators at the current time.</para><para>We say that at least another billion dollars should be allocated to our schools, so that public education is funded at a level which matches community expectations, whether parents can afford to pay fees or not.</para><para>In addition to the increasingly lop-sided balance of support between government and non-government schools, the Democrats are most concerned that automatic establishment payments to new non-government schools have far from adequate accountability requirements.</para><para>The Committee heard that there are:</para><para>No requirements along the lines of minimum enrolment size. There is no explicit or special accountability or reporting requirements attached to that; in fact, the funds do not even have to be accounted for separately. It is, in fact, a rather profligate use and an unaccountable use of the public's money - not the federal government's money.</para><para>The Democrats note that the establishment grants can be spent on marketing, advertising or even corporate ventures.</para><para>A new private school, may choose to do what Mentone Boys Grammar in Melbourne has done and advertise for new students at prime time on Melbourne radio.</para><para>The Democrats are also concerned that the inadequacy of the criteria could lead to the proliferation of poorly planned schools which are not economically viable. This would be poor allocation of scarce resources, and something which is unparalleled in any other sector. For example, if a group of people decide that they want to start up a new community health centre, they don't just simply receive public money as soon as they open their doors.</para><para>Our concerns extend to the lack of any cap on the per capita grants of $500 in the first year and $250 in the second, which together with the lack of stringent accountability mechanisms means that the grants could be easily manipulated to maximise the benefit.</para><para>In response to questioning about these accountability requirements, the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs advised the Committee that there is nothing to stop a school from selling off the school buildings and the site and moving to another site with a new registration number and the same students.</para><para>Clearly, this is not a desirable situation and in no way could be considered an appropriate use of public money.</para><para>The evidence presented to the Committee about the circumstances surrounding the provision of establishment grants to Christian College, Highton in particular, deserve further investigation. This school received an establishment grant when it was operating at the same address and with the same board of directors as an existing school. When a situation like this arises, you have to question the degree of analysis brought to bear on evaluating the legitimacy of claims for automatic payment of establishment grants.</para><para>As I stand here today, I note that we are clearly not alone in our concerns.</para><para> In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Independent Education Union (IEU) recommended that:</para><para>The Commonwealth request that MCEETYA, together with non government schooling authorities, broker a common set of guidelines or a co-operative national framework for a nationally consistent approach to the planning, renewal, funding and operation of new and existing government and non government schools.</para><para>The IEU further recommended that in the absence of a planning and regulatory regime for the establishment of new non-government schools, that the proposed legislation should be amended to provide for clear guidelines as to the purpose of the grants and rigorous accountability and reporting requirements.</para><para>In the view of the Democrats, this is the very least the Government should do.</para><para>Before I finish today, I want to make a few brief remarks about the inclusion of these schools provisions in this omnibus bill.</para><para>It is more than curious to me that these amendments were included in this bill, when a bill amending the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Assistance) Act 2000, was introduced on June 7, particularly given the </para><para>government's great reluctance to split the bill. We will support the oppositions amendment on schools however we will not be supporting the bill.</para><para>—————</para><para>Speech by Senator Stott Despoja</para><para>The Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 is an omnibus bill which implements a number of changes announced in the Government's Innovation Statement - Backing Australia's Ability:</para><para>·	additional funding to the ARC,</para><para>·	additional research infrastructure funding,</para><para>·	2000 new undergraduate places for IT, science and mathematics, and</para><para>·	the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme (PELS).</para><para>In addition, the Bill adjusts increases funding to non-government school students with disabilities and appropriates an additional $10 million to reflect a significant increase in the average size of new non-government schools in 2000.</para><para>The Democrats believe the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 Bill should not be passed in its current form. While most of the measures in the Bill are not opposed by the Democrats - the postgraduate loans scheme and the increased appropriation for new schools - are not supported by the Democrats.</para><para>This contributes to our reason for supporting the Oppositions desire to split the Bill three ways.</para><para>My colleague, Senator Allison will speak to the changes in the States Grants so I will be confining my comments to the changes to the ARC Act and the Higher Education Funding Act.</para><para>ARC &amp; Research Infrastructure In Backing Australia's Ability, the Government announced a funding package of $2.9 billion for R&amp;D and Innovation over 5 years. While the Government's backflip to increase investment was welcome it needs to be emphasised that this simply slows down Australia's decline in R&amp;D investment relative to other OECD countries.</para><para>Moreover, only $159 million of this package - 5.5% - will actually be made available in 2002. The massive `back-ending' of the increase is a major disappointment and does not sit well with the Government's rhetoric on investing in Australia's future prosperity.</para><para>One initiative of Backing Australia's Ability that was widely welcomed was the decision to double the funding of the ARC over five years. This Bill introduces the first stage of the increase - $18.6 million in 2002.</para><para>While better than nothing - a Government that took international realities and the urgent needs of Australia's researchers and our research capability seriously - would not be so timid. While the Democrats support this increase we urge the Government to reconsider its priorities and `front-load' its intention to double the budget of the ARC.</para><para>The Chief Scientist made it very clear that infrastructure spending represents about 40 cents in the competitive research dollar invested in the USA and other OECD countries. However, despite the modest increase to infrastructure funding in this Bill, our investment in research infrastructure remains at a very uncompetitive 20 cents in the dollar. So much for this Government's commitment to our future.</para><para>PELS</para><para>The Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme (PELS) is the Government's response to market failure in domestic postgraduate coursework.</para><para>At is important to understand that this failure comes about because of poor policy by successive Governments and in particular the current Government who have removed 25,000 funded places from postgraduate education. That is - it is a failure largely of this Government's own making.</para><para>The key characteristics of the market failure in domestic postgraduate coursework are; evidence that the high cost of fees and removal of HECS places are major barriers to participation in postgraduate coursework from equity groups, declining enrolments from domestic postgraduate students (down more than 12% between 1997 - 2000), and alarming drops in enrolments in particular disciplinary fields, notably science 21.5%, education 21% and agriculture 27%. Indeed, between 1997 and 2000 only Maths and Computing had any growth because of the increase in IT enrolments - all the other disciplinary fields declined. Even Business, Administration and Management fell significantly last year.</para><para>It is precisely this scenario that PELS is supposed to address.</para><para>In its own terms, PELS it is quite a clever proposal that will enable some students who are currently unable to access postgraduate courses the opportunity to do so.</para><para>However, the Democrats are obliged to look at the broader policy context and while superficially PELS is `better than nothing', we cannot support its implementation in the seriously defective policy and funding regime this Government has imposed on education.</para><para>The Democrats are opposed to the marketisation of education and believe the sorry state of postgraduate coursework is a salutary reminder of the limitations and distortions of marketisation.</para><para>Our primary concerns with PELS are;</para><para>·	It is premised on postgraduate education being solely a private benefit for the student,</para><para>·	it avoids the real problem of insufficient funded places, and</para><para>·	it cannot overcome the substantial cost differentials between disciplines.</para><para>PELS is conceptually quite different from HECS. While both are income contingent loans, HECS is a private contribution to a publicly funded place. This explicitly recognises that there is a considerable public benefit from higher education. PELS, on the other hand, simply advances the full cost of tuition and thus either assumes a private benefit only or refuses to make a public contribution to the public benefit.</para><para>Full fees, in conjunction with a substantial drop of HECS places, has led to declining numbers of students in disciplines with little or no private benefit such as education, social welfare, nursing, sustainable agriculture and science. Yet there is considerable public benefit in having graduates with postgraduate skills and knowledge in terms of better teachers, nurses and agriculturists. We are not at all convinced that students in such disciplines are likely to enrol just because they can get a loan to cover up-front fees.</para><para>In 2000, there were 409,560 full-time equivalent, fully funded places. Of these 365,920 was the minimum undergraduate target load and 21,498 were HECS-exempt postgraduate research places. This left a notional 22,142 places for postgraduate coursework students.</para><para>Universities, allocated 3,000 places to postgraduate research students - the so-called gap places - and 14,663 to postgraduate coursework students. This means nearly 5,000 notional postgraduate coursework student places were not used for postgraduates but rather were used by universities to help ameliorate the unmet demand in undergraduate places.</para><para>Universities are fully entitled to use these places how they see fit, but it does highlight one of the real issues affecting universities and postgraduates in particular insufficient places due to poor policy. Indeed HECS places for postgraduate coursework students have dropped precipitously from 30,400 in 1996 to 14,600 in 2000. In the same period fee-paying increased from 13,300 to 24,500 - it is this massive cost-shifting to students that has caused the decline in student load.</para><para>Universities are still required to offer a HECS place for initial vocational entry qualifications in education and nursing -although not in specialist courses such as midwifery or TESOL - Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages.</para><para>However, there is a serious anomaly whereby an increasing number of vocations including psychology, social welfare, museum studies and librarianship are requiring a postgraduate qualification for initial vocational entry. `Credentialism' combined with inadequate HECS places raises major access concerns with or without a loan.</para><para>The Democrats are particularly concerned by a particularly serious distortion in reliance on markets for education.</para><para>In the early 1990s, the then ALP government introduced the Relative Funding Model (RFM). This weighted the funding that went to different disciplines precisely because it was recognised that disciplines have different delivery costs. So science, engineering, medicine are weighted much higher than education, law and humanities.</para><para>Whether the cost relativities in the RFM are, or indeed were, ever a good indicator is of course, another matter.</para><para>Differential HECS works on a similar basis although the inclusion of law in the top band is predicated on potential private benefit.</para><para>The Democrats are concerned that as PELS does not and cannot take cost of delivery into account as it simply relies on markets.</para><para>This will create enormous problems in high cost areas with significant industry and/or public benefit but comparatively low private benefit, for example, engineering and science.</para><para>The Government has made it very clear it expects universities to offer fee-paying courses on a full-cost recovery basis. The Democrats acknowledge there may be good reasons for wanting to prevent public funds substantially subsidising an MBA or IT student who is likely to receive considerable private benefit.</para><para>However, there must be public investment into high cost areas where there are substantial public and industry benefits such as science and engineering by either, or preferably a mixture of;</para><para>·	permitting cross-subsidies,</para><para>·	increased provision of funded places,</para><para>·	and supplementation to universities for PELS places in high cost and/or high public good areas.</para><para>The Democrats are aware of an opposition amendment to establish a review process of PELS. I would like to see that review also focus on the consequence of fee-paying and the operation of PELS on strategic areas including science and education are an explicit term of reference of any reviews.</para><para>Without a more sophisticated policy mix, which takes account of significant cost differentials for course delivery -students in key strategic areas will necessarily be discriminated against.</para><para>The Democrats find it utterly bizarre that within the same Bill the Government proposes to introduce 2000 new funded places to address the skills shortage in science, maths and IT. But in the very same Bill it proposes a measure that will ensure that science remains unattractive for postgraduates.</para><para>It is truly indicative of the poverty of this Government's policy commitments to education and innovation.</para><para>If the Government comes back with a better approach to postgraduate education, which includes additional funded places and other mechanisms to overcome the distortions from simple-minded commitments to markets in education -then the Democrats would be more than happy to revisit our principled rejection of PELS.</para><para>As Senators will be aware, this Bill was subject to a brief - and far from satisfactory inquiry process. Before commenting on the Government's poor process I do want to touch on a number of issues raised in the inquiry process.</para><para>The committee heard evidence that the proposal to allow a Minister the capacity to cap student debt represented an important change to HECS policy that had not been discussed or justified. I think it is important to note that there was widespread consensus in the sector on the need to separate debt incurred from PELS and debt incurred from HECS such that a cap could not be applied to HECS. Indeed, we had recommendations to that effect coming from student groups, the National Tertiary Education Union and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee - a broad church by any definition.</para><para>In addition, there is considerable concern that PELS represents the `thin edge of the wedge' for dismantling HECS and moving to a PELS environment in undergraduate education. There is already a precedent for expanding student loan arrangements into other areas as one of this years' budget measures was to effectively introduced PELS for overseas trained professionals enrolled in previously funded bridging programs to meet Australia's recognition requirements.</para><para>While there is a substantial difference between administrative arrangements for handling HECS and PELS debt and legislation to dismantle HECS, the Democrats do believe that on balance there is a very good case for quarantining HECS. Accordingly, the Democrats take a principled position on this issue and support the splitting of HECS and PELS.</para><para>The AV-CC recommended that Bond University be made eligible for PELS. As PELS represents a significant public subsidy to students - though not institutions - through an interest free loan, the Democrats do not support expanding PELS to private universities. As the AV-CC pointed out, this does leave an anomalous situation whereby students at other institutions including Australia's other private university, Notre Dame, are able to access PELS but students of Bond are not.</para><para>The Democrats believe it was an inappropriate decision to place Notre Dame on List A of the Higher Education Funding Act in 1998 - and it is disappointing that the opposition did not appreciate the significance of the Minister's sleight of hand at that time.</para><para>The Democrats accept there may be good contingent reasons to allow public funds going to private universities if there is an absence of public provision - as was the case with Notre Dame's teacher training programs in the Kimberley.</para><para>However, this should only justify inclusion on List B.</para><para>The Democrats take the AVCC's point about Notre Dame and Bond - however it is not good policy to use a poor decision as precedent for another poor decision. Accordingly, we do not support students at Bond University accessing PELS. Moreover, I want to put on the record that the Democrats believe it is time to revisit the status of private universities on the HEFA lists.</para><para>To conclude, I want to place on the record our view on some of the process issues that Senator Carr has lightly touched upon.</para><para>The Democrats note with much concern that the Government chose not to defend their legislation by putting a submission before the Senate inquiry. We also' note that the Department did not provide requested information in a timely fashion to the committee.</para><para>This is very poor practice and must be considered a contempt of this House.</para><para>The Democrats take our responsibilities as legislators very seriously and believe that we, and more generally, this Chamber would be abrogating community expectations if we do not consider legislation that has very important implications for the policy and funding of education closely.</para><para>Not only has the sorry example of what has occurred with this Bill undermine our legislative responsibility it totally undermines the various assertions about the urgency of this Bill.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name></talker><para>—I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the ALP amendments but we will be voting against this bill in whatever form it ends up.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>25550</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> my remarks on the <inline ref="R1282">Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>I rise to speak on the Innovation and Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, which put into effect many of the provisions announced in the Prime Minister's Innovation Statement earlier this year.</para><para>The Innovation Statement, and those parts of it that will be legislated through this Bill, does not provide a proper, forthright answer to the challenge being made to Australia in terms of our international competitiveness.</para><para>Rather, it is a slow and belated response.</para><para>Those parts of this Bill relating to the Innovation Statement merely put back what's already been taken out. Like most of the things this Government does, the government's new innovation program lacks vision and direction.</para><para>But what this Bill lacks in vision and direction, it makes up in trickiness. Once again we've seen the government engage in all sorts of shenanigans to ensure that they trick, or even blackmail, members of the Senate into quietly supporting some of the mean legislation that they put before us.</para><para>It is unprecedented in the history of this parliament that a Bill containing provisions for the funding of universities has been tied in with provisions for schools funding.</para><para>And the only reason it's never been done before is because we've never had a government so willing to pull swifties like this and so willing to misuse the processes of this parliament to get their legislative agenda through.</para><para>Last year the Minister for Education rammed through his unconscionable schools funding bill by tying the changes that saw the nation's 58 most wealthiest schools get millions extra to funding for every school in Australia.</para><para>And now we're told there's a need for an extra $10 million for non-government schools that wasn't accounted for in the original Bill from last year. And once again, the Minister for Education has sought to avoid any scrutiny over the lack of funding he provides for public schools by ramming it through and holding the Senate to ransom - pass my Bill to give more money to non-Government schools, or else universities and R &amp; D won't get any money, he says.</para><para>Labor will, as my colleagues have already indicated, support any increase for much needed funding for universities and research, and will support any extra funding made available for schools.</para><para>What we will insist on, however, is that any extra funding made available for private schools be matched by an increase in funds for public schools. That is the fair way to do it, and our amendments will be insisting on that.</para><para>Innovation</para><para>But first let me turn to those parts of the Bill that implement the Prime Minister's Innovation Statement made earlier this year.</para><para>The importance of proper investment in education and investment is relatively undisputed. Few would argue with the fact that significant investment in education and innovation is fundamental to not only expanding Australia's export base, but also to attracting foreign investment, and thus for creating quality, skilled employment for Australians and high living standards.</para><para>Productivity, our ability to entice the world's best companies to invest in Australia, and our ability to sell our products to the world are the key elements to our future prosperity.</para><para>That is why the current Government's dramatic failure to pursue policies that facilitate innovation and create a skilled workforce is so alarming.</para><para>Australia under the Howard Government is one of the few OECD nations whose investment in research and development has actually declined as a percentage of GDP in recent years.</para><para>In 1996, Australia spent around 1.65% of its national income on research and development. Under this Government, we've fallen to about 1.4%. Had it not been for the innovation statement and the provisions contained within this Bill, our level of investment was predicted to decline to about 1.2%.</para><para>What this basically means is that this Bill and the Prime Minister's Innovation Statement only go some of the way to putting back what the Government has already taken out.</para><para>Even after the Innovation Statement, Australia is still short changed when it comes to education and R &amp; D investment.</para><para>The Government has cut a total $3 billion from the Commonwealth's investment in universities and $2 billion from Research and Development, and the Innovation Statement will, over several years, only put back around $3 billion into education and research.</para><para>My concerns with the Innovation Statement and this whole package, however, go much deeper than the mere figures.</para><para>It is the fundamental nature and character of the sort of investment that's being planned that concerns me. I think the essential problem is that a lot of this package is about, as I have said earlier, merely restoring funding.</para><para>It's a package that fills in gaps and puts in what should've been there in the first place. It's a backwards-looking program that isn't concerned with the need to broaden our export base nor the need to attract foreign investment.</para><para>In fact, it doesn't really seem to have any aims other than to restore funding.</para><para>Numerous commentators outside of this parliament have thus been very critical of the package. Paul Kelly, whom we all know as not only a well renowned journalist, but as a respected and knowledgeable public affairs writer, has said that “The paradox of the innovation statement was its old-fashioned character - government handouts for special interests and tax breaks for business.”</para><para>Even writers in publications like the Business Review Weekly, which is not known for its support of the non-conservative cause, have remarked, and I'm quoting from an article by T Stotnicki written in BRW in February this year, “that it was largely the Howard Government's 1996 cut-back in the R &amp; D concession, and the subsequent drop in private sector R &amp; D, that created the need for this innovation package.”</para><para>A large criticism that has come from many quarters, for example from John Schubert, the President of the Business Council of Australia is that the package does not do enough to encourage private sector investment in research.</para><para>Australia's current level of private sector investment in research and development is only at 0.67% of GDP, which is the seventh lowest in the OECD. Business is not seeing the benefits of investing in innovation, and is receiving very little assistance or incentive from the government to do so.</para><para>The Government's answer in this package is merely to restore the R &amp; D tax concession. There is no extension or development of this policy, which was established years ago under the Hawke Government. The Innovation Statement thus only goes some of the way to increasing Australia's private sector investment in innovation.</para><para>The package is, broadly speaking, directionless. It has no targets or aims for building export industry, no targets or aims for creating jobs, no targets or aims for attracting foreign investment, and no targets or aims for encouraging business to put more into R &amp; D, and more importantly, no targets or aims for helping business to make capital returns on innovation and R &amp; D.</para><para>The Government has identified a political problem in terms of the public's well-founded perception of it being anti-education and anti-innovation. It has responded to this by throwing money in areas in familiar territory - grants and tax breaks, coupled with little to no strategic direction.</para><para>The package is funding for funding's sake. The Innovation Statement was a purely politically motivated reaction from the Prime Minister to the huge electoral defeats he suffered earlier this year.</para><para>It is not a serious package for investing in Australia's future.</para><para>Schools Component</para><para>The other missing element from this Bill is any effort from this Government to ensure equal access to opportunities in a globally competitive Australia.</para><para>Proper investment in education is not only an underlying tenet of achieving the goals of expanding our export base, attracting foreign investment and creating quality, skills-based jobs.</para><para>It also trains people and gives them the skills and hence opportunity to have access to highly skilled and well-paid employment.</para><para>Investment in education and research and development will arm Australia in the international battlefield of global competitiveness.</para><para>For individuals, the arms required to take part in the battle for skilled and well paid employment is a good and decent education.</para><para>It is the responsibility of Government, if it aims to facilitate equality of opportunity, to ensure that all its citizens have proper access these arms.</para><para>Everyone should equally have the right to access decent education to enable access to highly skilled and well-paid jobs.</para><para>That is why those of us in the Labor Party were so thoroughly outraged by the Government's schools funding Bill that came before us at the end of last year.</para><para>It was deeply wrong and drastically unfair to give millions of dollars to the nation's richest schools, schools like the King's School at Parramatta that have rifle ranges and swimming pools and the rest of it, and then give virtually no increase to poorer non-government and government schools.</para><para>And now tied into this Innovation Bill is another $ 10 million for private schools that the Minister for Education tells us he simply failed to include in the Schools Funding Bill we were forced to pass last year.</para><para>As my colleagues and I have already stated, Labor's position is that we will move amendments to make sure that this extra funding being made available to private schools is to be matched by extra funding for the public system.</para><para>This is the first time in the history of this parliament that a Bill has simultaneously dealt with funding for universities and schools, as I have indicated earlier.</para><para>Once again, the Minister knows how inequitable his proposals for schools funding are, but is nevertheless determined to ram through his agenda, and will go to any lengths to force the Senate to pass his inequitable funding proposals.</para><para>Senators will remember the way many of us here were given an ultimatum by the Minister late last year - pass my Bill or else every school in Australia gets no funding.</para><para>And now it appears we are being given a similar ultimatum here tonight - pass my Bill or else Australia's investment in education and research will continue to decline. Pass my bill or else we won't increase Australia's global competitiveness. Pass my Bill or else we won't create jobs for the future.</para><para>Labor will be supporting this Bill to the extent that it returns some of the funding the Government has cut from education and research and development funding.</para><para>It is my belief though that if this Government, or even a future Labor Government is serious about strengthening Australia's global competitiveness or creating quality, well-paid, highly-skilled jobs for the future, then we need to change the way we look at innovation strategy.</para><para>It is also my belief that the opportunities to fully participate in a globally competitive Australia should be available to all. High quality education should therefore be made available equally to all Australians, not just the very rich.</para><para>I commend the Bill with amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>25552</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Given the hour, I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> my remarks on the <inline ref="R1282">Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows—</inline></para><para>The Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</para><para>·	amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to provide additional funding and introduce a loan scheme for postgraduate coursework students, as announced in the Innovation Action Plan and</para><para>·	amends the States grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 to provide additional funding for establishment assistance for non-government school ($9.5 million) and an extra $2.7 million for students with disabilities in non-government schools and</para><para>·	allows universities more flexibility regarding electronic communications</para><para>This legislation supports the words of Shane Stone and is a clear sign that this is a mean and tricky government. The Government has sought through this Bill to bring together in one package, for the first time in many many years, omnibus legislation relating to higher education and research, on the one hand, and on the other a series of amendments to school funding provisions, contained in the States grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000.</para><para>The bill before the Senate implements some of the measures from the innovation statement. While the government might be seeking to brag about the announcements that were made in the innovation statement, then this needs to be done in the context of the government's performance since it was elected in 1996.</para><para>Under this Government, Commonwealth funding for universities has fallen every year, from $4.8 billion in 1996 to $4.2 billion by 2002, projected in the forward estimates. This adds up to a reduction of $3 billion being taken from the Commonwealth's investment in universities. When you add to this a $2 billion reduction in government support for research and development, we have had a total of $5 billion cut by this government from investment in university education and from government support for research and development.</para><para>A close examination of the table released by the Prime Minister when he launched the innovation statement, it is quite clear that the government has backloaded the funding in the innovation statement.</para><para>In the year 2001-02 the Prime Minister's announcements involve a commitment of extra funding of $159 million; in 2002-03 it is a commitment of $414 million; in 2003-04 it is $619 million; in 2004-05 it is $758 million; and in the last year, 2005-06, it is $947 million. So basically almost 60 per cent of the funding announced by the Prime Minister in January is backloaded into the last two years of the five-year innovation statement.</para><para>In other words, almost half of the extra funding announced by the Prime Minister in January this year is not going to be spent until two elections away.</para><para>The reality is that last year the number of Australian undergraduate students at our universities fell by more than 3,000. While the extra funding for research is welcome, it does not change the fact that we have had a reduction of almost 3,500 in the number of research training places at Australia's universities.</para><para>One of the announcements made in the innovation statement was the commitment to introduce the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme, or PELS, and it comes after a major reduction in HECS places for postgraduate course work.</para><para>The number of Commonwealth funded postgraduate course work places is estimated to have fallen by around 60 per cent since 1996. To the extent that the new PELS system helps this situation, in giving more Australians access to postgraduate study, Labor will support it. However, we do recognise that it does have the potential to act as a pilot for the full deregulation of undergraduate university fees as outlined in the leaked cabinet submission from October 1999 of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp.</para><para>The Labor Party categorically opposes the deregulation of undergraduate university fees at some or all universities and also opposes the replacement of HECS with a real interest rate loan system. We are also committed to phasing out full cost up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students.</para><para>With the introduction of PELS, the new Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme, we also recognise the possibility of some universities seeking to put up their fees unreasonably. We have some concerns about the mechanism that the government envisages to deal with this-that is, giving the minister the power to set a limit on how much students can borrow under the combined HECS and PELS.</para><para>We have two concerns about this. The first is that it is common knowledge that the children of wealthy parents are more likely to have their university fees paid for by their parents each year. If you make an up-front payment for the university fees, you get a 25 per cent discount on that HECS fee. The parents of students from struggling families cannot afford to make that university fee payment on their behalf. That means that, at the end of an undergraduate degree, the students that have zero HECS debt are more likely to be the students that come from wealthy families. That is one reason why we are concerned about putting a ceiling on the combined HECS and PELS debts.</para><para>The second reason is that, because of the changes that this government made to HECS in 1996, students end up with very different HECS debts depending on which course they have enrolled in. Not only did the government increase HECS charges in 1996 by up to 125 per cent but also we now have three different bands.</para><para>The second part of this Bill deals with a number of school funding issues. Last year's states grants legislation allocated $859,000 in the calendar year 2001 for establishment grants and $1.2 million per annum in each of the following years. This bill seeks to increase those amounts by very significant quantities. For example, in 2001 the increase is 330 per cent-that is, a total of $3.7 million. In 2002 it is up 262 per cent-an increase of $4.7 million. In 2003 it is up 128 per cent to $1.65 million. In 2004 it is up 128 per cent again to $1.65 million. The total increase is almost $10 million.</para><para>The Labor Party has been accused of holding up education in the Senate during the last few days. This is misleading, mischievous and is simple a question of this Government being inefficient when it comes to dealing with its legislation program.</para><para>What needs to be ask is when did the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs know that he needed to provide an extra $10 million for these establishment grants for non-government schools?</para><para>This is an issue that came up in the Senate committee that dealt with this issue last week and which reported in the Senate later this week.</para><para>We now know from the evidence last week that the department knew last October that an extra $10 million was needed to fund the schools that David Kemp claims that he is so concerned about.</para><para>But the department claims that they did not let the minister know about this or make this decision because they did not want David Kemp to actually exercise the responsibilities of being the Commonwealth Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. We now have a position where the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs decides whether they will tell their minister that there is a $10 million hole in the funding for new non-government schools.</para><para>When a bill is required to fix up the problem the minister for education puts out a press release saying that it is the Labor Party's fault that he did not take action last October because his department did not tell him about a $10 million hole.</para><para>So the delay in the passage of the innovation rests entirely with David Kemp.</para><para>If the passage of this Bill is so important then:</para><para>·	why was it first debated in the House of Representatives on only the 7th June,</para><para>·	Why is it inappropriately link universities and schools measures but this Government refuses to split the Bill,</para><para>·	Why are not sufficient increases for public schools to match the latest round of schools funding increases for private schools and</para><para>·	why wasn't the $10 million for private schools not included in last year's schools' bill when he was told about the error last October?</para><para>Why are the people of this country subject to a Minister that cannot administer his department and is not aware of what is happening with the funding situation of our schools sector.</para><para>So if anything could be described as mean and tricky-using the Shane Stone language again-it is this minister's attempts to claim that the Labor Party in some way is responsible for any potential delay in funding for these schools.</para><para>The Labor Party has stated our position many times, which is, we are not against extra funding for non-government schools. Last year we supported the extra funding that was provided to needy non-government schools.</para><para>But what we support is fair funding for all of our schools. That means that, having provided massive increases to the non-government schools sector what is missing is the balancing increase in funding for government schools.</para><para>There are amendments before the Senate that will increase funding for government schools by an extra $30 million to balance the $10 million that the Government is proposing in this legislation for non-government schools. Our amendments seek to provide an extra $30 million in capital works funding for government schools across the country.</para><para>Certain sectors of education in this country under this Government have been severely disadvantaged.</para><para>We have a situation where King's and Geelong Grammar have had their $1 million a year increases by 2004.1 but the local Catholic schools have got only about $60,000 per school and the local public school has got only $4,000 per year out of this government.</para><para>The Government has sought to bestow massive increases in establishment grants for new private schools, only months after striking the levels of the allocations in the 2000 State Grants Act. While these grants amount to a very small part of the total recurrent allocations for schools provided by the Commonwealth, this consideration of itself does not justify allowing the funds to be increased, nor does it provide a rationale for the lack of rigorous accountability and eligibility requirements applying to the program.</para><para>So this Government and in particular this Minister has got to answer two questions. Why did he get it wrong by a factor of three? Why did he get it wrong when he sat down and tried to calculate how much extra money was needed for the non-government schools? Was it incompetence? Was it a deliberate attempt by this minister to cover up the fact that he is providing very significant increases in establishment grants for non-government schools? If he did find out about it before the legislation passed through both houses last year, why did he not fix it last year? Why did he not fix it when he or his office were first informed that there was a $10 million hole in funding for these new non-government schools?</para><para>There is no link between the university and school elements of these Bills and the Parliamentary Library can find no precedent for a Bill, which includes new funding for both schools and universities.</para><para>The Labor believes that this Bill should be redrafted to provide for an additional $30 million in capital works grants to be provided to government schools, to match the extra funding being provided for establishment grants to non-government schools; improved accountability arrangements to apply to the use of establishment grants; and the Minister's power to determine a maximum permitted student debt to be limited to only those amounts borrowed under the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme.</para><para>There are no reasons why this Government cannot excise the section of the Bill containing school establishment grants. They won't do it because they want to sneak through the extra money for private schools. Despite what Mr Gallagher, the head of the Department's higher education division says about the impact on research and development, this Bill could be passed in August with no adverse affects on Universities or students.</para><para>This is the best example of a mean and tricky government. It highlights a government that is not concerned about the state of public education in this country, but is willing to blame anyone else for this mess in the funding arrangements but itself. This Bill should be split and dealt with accordingly and at the same time the public and private sectors of our education industry should be funded fairly and equitably.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>25555</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank senators for their contributions on the <inline ref="R1282">Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline>.

I think it is perhaps best if, in addressing this motion, I cover aspects which could be dealt with in the committee stage as well, because I do not want to repeat the government's position on this. Suffice to say that, as Senator Carr as outlined, this is a bill which the opposition is seeking to split into three; and this is an unusual practice, to say the least. We have in this bill an initiative by the government which deals with extra funding for higher education—a postgraduate education loans scheme which will provide some 245,000 students per year with an ability to take up loans to advance themselves in further education, and the extent of those loans would be to the tune of $995-odd million.</para></talk.start><para>The third part deals with funding amounts listed in the states grants acts—that deals with primary and secondary education assistance—and also deals with small increases in Commonwealth assistance for non-government students with disabilities. The bill increases amounts appropriated for establishment grants for new non-government schools in 2001-04. It deals with an increase from $4.7 million to $14.2 million. So we have here very worthwhile initiatives in the form of one bill.</para><para>Omnibus bills are not unusual. In fact, in 1995, the previous Labor government brought forward six omnibus bills. There is nothing untoward or unusual in such a bill having these three aspects to it. The opposition is taking premeditated action designed to kill off this legislation if the bill is split. Those listening to this debate should be aware that, on the two occasions that the Senate acted to divide bills which had originated in the House of Representatives, the practical effect was to kill off the legislation, and I refer to health legislation under the previous Labor government in 1995 and a health bill under this government last year.</para><para>Like previous governments, we are not willing to establish a precedent whereby a hostile Senate can cherry pick the government's legislative program; that is, the government puts up a program, a package of initiatives, and it is then picked off one by one by splitting the bill. The established rules and practices of the Senate provide ample opportunity for consideration and amendment of bills which are brought before the Senate. Opposition senators should be using the normal procedures in amending the bill instead of using this device of splitting the bill to seek to avoid the consequences of their actions in defeating this legislation. In taking this action, opposition senators are rejecting this bill and rejecting every item in it, and no sophistry on their part will change that fact.</para><para>Although there is a provision in the Senate for a bill to be split, it is not an exercise that has been embarked upon freely. Indeed, the record shows that this would be only the third time that a bill originating in the House of Representatives has been split. In his letter dated 28 June this year to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the Clerk of the House of Representatives advises:</para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline> indicates that the action is highly undesirable, as `the established rules and practices of the Houses provide ample opportunity for the consideration and amendment of bills by each House'. In short, this motion will have the effect of killing the bill and the government will have to reintroduce it in the spring sittings.</para></quote><para>I have to place that on record because of the highly unusual approach that the opposition has embarked upon in this matter. We have an omnibus bill. There is nothing untoward about it. But we have an opposition which, rather than reject the legislation and take the consequences for that action, seeks to split the bill, which it knows will kill the legislation. The implications that will be suffered as a result of this splitting of the bill are that, in relation to the amendments to the states grants act which I referred to earlier, there will be delays in some schools being paid the 50 per cent advance establishment grant entitlement. It is estimated that the establishment grant entitlement for the five applications that have been approved for general recurrent funding total just over $240,000, or $131,000 in excess of the remaining allocation of $109,000. We have a delay in funding for five applications from schools, and this involves some 967 students.</para><para>But there would also be implications of further delay if this bill were not passed in time for the October payment. That would result in delays in making the payment of the remaining 50 per cent entitlement. On current numbers, that would mean delaying payments for some 54 schools, involving nearly 4,000 students. So a further delay would have a wider impact. Furthermore, if the number of new school applications remained consistent with that of previous years, there could be around 20 new school applications still to be submitted which will not receive any entitlement for 2001. Depending on the number of new schools and their enrolments at the 2001 school census day, schools could be denied funding of between $1 million and $2 million.</para><para>If the bill were not passed at all, the implications would be more severe, as these schools would receive no payments this year. Failure to pass the bill would also lead to difficulties with payments in future years. This could affect the funding of new non-government schools across Australia, including Catholic schools, an indigenous school in the Kimberley in my home state, Lutheran schools, Montessori and Steiner schools, Jewish day schools and Islamic schools. The opposition should be ashamed of holding up payment to these schools. The Democrats should also be ashamed if they join in the opposition ruse to thwart this legislation.</para><para>If the bill is split and not passed by 30 June 2001, there will also be significant resource implications in relation to non-government schools educating students with disabilities. In particular, Catholic and independent schools who have students with disabilities will not be able to receive payment for their full strategic assistance entitlement of $561 for each student with a disability. There will be a shortfall of $34 per student until the bill is passed.</para><para>There will also be implications for the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme. I point in particular to those adjustments which need to be made in order to accommodate this scheme. Universities have software provided by outside companies, and most of these companies will not make changes to these computer systems until the legislation is passed. The consequence of a delay is that institutions may not have the required forms which are designed to collect data relevant to universities', DETYA's and the ATO's requirements. If the system is not operational in time, institutions may have to use supplementary forms and input the data into their information systems at a later date, which may lead to errors. Legislative certainty means that institutions will be able to get this work under way.</para><para>There are also problems in relation to course planning. During discussions, institutional staff indicated they needed lead time to plan which courses will be subject to the Post Education Loans Scheme, and to consider potential student numbers and consequently appropriate staffing levels resulting from increases in enrolment. There are also communication products which are essential to administering the Post Education Loans Scheme. Institutions require information booklets and forms provided by the department to assist students with applying for the loan service facility. This delay will cause a good many students to be disadvantaged in relation to this Post Education Loans Scheme. I mentioned some 240,000 students that have the prospect of enjoying this initiative, which runs to the tune of in excess of $900 million worth of loans.</para><para>The opposition cannot hide behind the fact that by splitting this bill they are casting the onus back onto government to take action to have the legislation passed, because they are really using this ruse in effect to kill the legislation. That is what it will do. The opposition has spoken about amendments which we are yet to have details on. There has been a good deal of contact between the office of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the opposition. We are yet to have details of any amendments that might be forthcoming. Suffice it to say that the splitting of this bill is a thoroughly undesirable practice. It is designed to kill the legislation and it will delay, if not—even worse—avoid funding for those essential purposes that I have indicated. There can be no other description of it than that the opposition are intent upon thwarting these good initiatives by the government. We will oppose vehemently the splitting of this bill, but if when we get to the committee stage the bill is split, the minister has indicated that he will introduce legislation in the spring sittings in an attempt to make the best of a bad situation brought about by the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>25557</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was seeking the call before.

I turn, in responding to the minister's statement, to the rights of the Senate and the appropriateness of the action being proposed here tonight by the Labor Party in regard to splitting this bill. The minister has said tonight that this is a position that the government basically disagrees with. He does not say it is not in the standing orders, because quite clearly the Senate standing orders have always included provisions for bills to be divided on the instructions of the committee of the whole.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is the established practice in this chamber. That has been the established practice because over a very long time governments have attempted to incorporate within a particular piece of legislation different measures, some of which are good, some of which are bad, some of which affect the operations of departments and some of which go to other policy issues that are not quite as likely to attract the support of the public at large. We have seen through the history of this government attempts to tag unpopular measures onto various popular measures. In the Senate—and in legislative councils around this country—the opportunity has been taken to divide bills, and that remains the case. Every time this occurs, the government of the day claims that the world as we know it will end and that these actions are reprehensible.</para><para>The minister indicated that this action has been undertaken in this place on at least three occasions. The first occasion on which the Senate divided a bill was on 9 June 1995, when the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 was divided into two bills, pursuant to the instruction to the committee of the whole, and was moved on notice. That was the action of a Liberal opposition, the detail of which is contained in <inline font-style="italic">Odgers </inline>on page 260. I suggest that whoever is writing the minister's speeches draw attention to that. They will also find that the government of the day chose to introduce new legislation—two new bills—reflecting the decisions of the Senate on that matter, which contained provisions that effectively divided the bills.</para><para>What we have heard from the minister tonight is that, when this matter is carried by the Senate, the government intends to withdraw the bills. That is a decision the government is taking. The government chooses to do that. The minister also went on to say that Minister Kemp will introduce new legislation in the spring session. It seems to me that what we are being told is that this bill has to be accepted in this particular form or not at all and that that has been the tradition of governments—what has always been referred to as Hobson's choice. I note a point that Senator Harradine made on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill in 1995, when he drew attention by way of a paper prepared by the Senate clerks which argued that the purpose of dividing a bill is to facilitate the Senate's consideration of a matter; to give the Senate an opportunity to vote separately and effectively on all the issues involved; and, should it be necessary, to prevent any possible tacking provisions in a bill, the effect of which may be to infringe the various constitutional powers on amendments.</para><para>What was argued on that occasion was that, since the 1600s, when the phrase first entered the language, it has been an elementary political tactic to leave an opponent with what is called Hobson's choice—that is, one thing or the other; my choice or none. I understand that that provision arose from an old story whereby, at a Cambridge inn, Thomas Hobson enjoyed a monopoly over which customer would have access to his horses. He said that the horse nearest the stable door would be the horse that is taken—`It's that horse or none.' That is where this whole principle of Hobson's choice arose—that those enjoying a monopolistic capacity demand that a certain action be taken or that no action at all be taken. That is what the government is putting to us here tonight. Essentially it is Hobson's choice.</para><para>Labor say that there are measures in this bill that are worthy of support. The government has options to make sure that those particular provisions are implemented in law but it will not do so, by responding in the way that it has tonight. Labor say that we cannot find any precedents in education to make an omnibus bill, where essentially popular measures or reasonable measures are being put together with unpopular measures that essentially are designed to cover up the mistakes of the department and the government. We cannot find an example where that has occurred in recent times.</para><para>I think we are entitled to speculate on the motives of the government in packaging the legislation in the way that it has. Essentially, the department has made a complete mess of this issue of payment of establishment grants to new non-government schools. Last October, when we were in the middle of the consideration of the state grants bill—remember that great controversy over the government's measures to provide a million dollars extra a year for the wealthier schools in this country—departmental officials discovered that they had made a mistake in the forward estimates in regard to the payment of establishment grants to new non-government schools. </para><para>I have found in politics that, if you make a mistake, it is wise not to repeat it, to do something about it and to address it square on. You would expect that public officials would certainly do that. We discovered through an inquiry process of the Senate that the government was not told initially that there had been an error in the forward estimates. It was put to us by senior officials that it was felt within the department that, because the bill was controversial and they were worried about getting the bills through, they were not going to say anything about the matter and that they were not going to seek amendments in this place, which is the normal practice when governments find that they have made errors, but that the government would seek to move amendments to the bill at a more convenient date. We discovered at a subsequent hearing that the minister was involved in this process and that the minister, presumably, was complicit in this parliament passing legislation which the department knew was wrong. The government did not correct that error, and now they expect us to correct it in this legislation.</para><para>We discovered that there were other errors last year in regard to not just the establishment grants but also the strategic assistance payments—for funding students with disabilities—where the government had calculated incorrectly certain moneys. We discovered a third error, which is not particularly relevant to this bill, in the innovations statement. In February this year, I asked why the $130 million in the fiscal balance table which had been released as part of the innovation statement was not included. The department told us that the exclusion of the measure to change the operation of the EBA from the fiscal balance table was an oversight. The innovation measures, including the measures that were reported in the 2001-02 portfolio budget statement, were measures affecting the 2001-02 budget. </para><para>There are quite a few oversights in regard to the education spending and the administration of programs in this portfolio. Essentially, the administration of the establishment grants program has been abysmal. I think we can show categorically that, in the case of a number of the schools which the government has paid moneys to, there are serious questions as to the actions taken by the government in the payment to those schools which, under the government's own guidelines, are not to be paid where the school establishes separate campuses of the one school which are not new schools at all but which are just campuses of the existing school. We found from the web sites of those schools that, in terms of their registration or their registered training organisation status, their company structures, their personnel and the actual statements of the state registration boards—which, we are told, is just another error in the preamble of the state registration boards in Victoria—these schools are in fact separate campuses of the one school but are being registered as new schools. Of course, the government has paid money to those schools. That has occurred in Western Australia, in Victoria and, it would seem, in Queensland. </para><para>It seems to me that there is a series of questions that relate to the actual payment of the establishment grants to date. What is really quite disturbing is that, having discovered that the expenditure, the appropriation, was in error, the government continued to spend the money and, of course, are at a point where they are now saying that, if this bill is not passed, the October payments will not be made. The reality is that this bill does not prevent moneys being paid in October, because there is an opportunity for the government to reconsider these issues in August. It is disingenuous of the government to argue other than that, because they know the reality of it. That is why they said tonight that they are prepared to consider legislation in the next session.</para><para>We are saying that there are other amendments to provide extra money for government schools. There is a need to review the PELS scheme, and there are questions that need to be addressed in relation to the ministerial discretion on the cap, the amount of money that is being set at the maximum loan limit, on the PELS scheme itself. These are issues that we believe can be addressed by way of amendment. That is why we are saying that the splitting of the bill provides an opportunity for the government to allow those measures on which there is broad agreement—such as the extra funding for the universities and the ARC—to be dealt with and processed, but the question of providing additional moneys for government schools should be dealt with separately. So, in that way, I think we are being more than reasonable. It is now appropriate for this government to acknowledge they have made a few blues about this and settle down and talk to people about getting those blues fixed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>25560</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just want to indicate that the Democrats will support this motion to split the bill. I think the minister is being disingenuous by indicating that this is some ruse. He knows very well that this bill was put together for the express purpose of pushing it through. I think we had a states grants bill that should have had the amendments associated with primary and secondary education attached to it rather than to this bill. But, in any case, we all know that the need for this amendment, leaving aside its importance of otherwise, was known when we dealt with the states grants bill in December. It is extraordinary that the minister would have the cheek to suggest that the Senate was somehow being unreasonable or irresponsible in wanting to split this bill. Senator Carr is right: it is entirely up to the government as to whether it accepts a split bill or not.</para></talk.start><para>It seems to me that, if you put these measures together in one omnibus bill, you take that risk. The Senate wants to properly consider each of them and have the opportunity to reject them if that seems necessary. I have to say that it does seem necessary to us in a number of instances. There are some good measures in this bill, but we would like to be able to vote for those measures separately. It would be interesting to get the minister to respond as to why it was necessary to pull these three together, why it is that we have two quite separate higher education bills, essentially, coupled with the primary and secondary schools set of amendments to the legislation.

The main vehicles for this minimisation of tax relate to offshore superannuation funds and certain categories of onshore superannuation funds into which, over a period of three years from 1996 through to 1999, approximately $1.5 billion have been placed. Approximately 2,000 high wealth individuals have placed $1.5 billion in these superannuation funds and, in doing so, they have sought to avoid—and so far have avoided—income tax, superannuation taxes including the superannuation surcharge and fringe benefits taxes. The tax office estimates that the level of revenue at risk is approximately half a billion dollars.</para></talk.start><para>When this matter was last considered, the Labor Party moved an amendment to retrospectively implement this legislation. However, we did not secure agreement with the Australian Democrats and that consequently meant that we were effectively forced to support the Australian Democrat amendment which did not go to the same period of retrospectivity. The Australian Labor Party maintains that it was never the intention, when superannuation funds were enacted in Australia, for superannuation funds to be used to avoid income tax, the various superannuation contributions taxes, the so-called superannuation surcharge and fringe benefits tax.</para><para>Other than the 2,000-odd individuals who have been identified by the tax office, everyone else in Australia pays the appropriate level of tax in respect of superannuation. For those reasons, the Labor Party believes that it is compelling that this legislation be retrospective. It is not unreasonable, if everyone else in Australia is paying their respective level of tax on superannuation funds, for these 2,000 individuals to do the same. Accordingly, the Labor Party will continue to support the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats to ensure that this legislation has at least some measure of retrospectivity.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kemp's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>03:03:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.[ </para></division.header><para>(The Temporary Chairman—Senator A.B.

A number of constituents have also asked that I raise these concerns over Government policies in Parliament in the hope that this Government may attempt to address these issues.</para><para>The overwhelming majority of responses came from senior citizens, including both self-funded retirees and pensioners. These people have seen first-hand the `tricky' manner in which the Coalition has handled the provision of government assistance to the elderly. The $300 one-off payment was a prime example of an attempt to buy back the elderly's vote and provide a basis for massive taxpayer-funded self promotion. The $300 was an insult for those that were promised $1000 at the last election, and older Australians know that it doesn't even come close to compensating for the slug of the GST.</para><para>What is most concerning about the entire manner in which the Government has chosen to provide this assistance is the $4.5 million wasted on advertising to promote the Government in this election year. The Government could have informed pensioners and retirees of changes through normal channels, however they decided to target the broader community to gain wider electoral support for the upcoming election.</para><para>Rather than targeting potential recipients in a cost-effective manner, the advertising campaign gratuitously covers radio, television as well as print.</para><para>This is just another example of the Government's extraordinary wastage of taxpayers money on self promotion. The $4 million campaign would easily have payed for the extension of the $300 payment to all carer pensioners aged over 55. Carers save the Government millions of dollars every year yet the Coalition seem to believe that they do not deserve this additional assistance. This Government clearly has its priorities muddled when it chooses to spend millions of dollars on taxpayer-funded advertising rather than extending a benefit to those most in need. The value of the campaign is highly questionable given the $300 one-off doesn't even require pensioners to apply—it's paid automatically. The detail of this payment could have easily been incorporated into the regular seniors newsletter that is mailed directly to all age pensioners and most retirees.</para><para>Another example of this Government's muddled priorities is the $15 million being spent on private health insurance advertising. Rather than spending taxpayers money on health services in the public health system, the Government is further subsidising private health funds. As noted by Labor's Shadow Minister for Health, the money used for these advertisements could have funded an extra 1250 hip replacement operations or 1000 heath by-pass operations.</para><para>It is clear that the Coalition's attempt to advertise its way back into government will continue throughout the rest of the year, with Senate Estimates indicating that other expenditure proposed for the year include $6.9 million on the Telstra Besley response, a $5 million campaign on the abolition of the Financial Institutions Tax and a $4.2 million campaign to promote Work for the Dole. This Government will spend approximately $20 million per month leading up to October this year on advertising. This is a disgraceful waste of taxpayers money which should be spent in areas of genuine need.</para><para>Rather than spending money on genuine public information, this Government has chosen to waste money on opportunistic, cynical advertising.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Telstra</inline></para><para>I have mentioned the issue of Telstra's regional services a number of times in this chamber, primarily because it is an issue which continually arises as being of concern to those outside of the major centres. There is clearly a continued need to be vigilant, as indicated by the recently leaked memo from Telstra. The memo confirms that the providers plan to cut further jobs from the organisation, with the majority being from regional centres. The memo indicated that of the job cuts Telstra is considering for its National Network Solutions arm, 70% will come from rural centres. This equates to more than 600 jobs lost in regional Australia. National Network Solutions is a unit within Telstra responsible for installing and fixing telephones and contains the field workers who actually do the work on individual phones in homes. Unfortunately for those living in regional towns such as Charleville, Longreach, Dalby and Boonah, it looks as though the already inadequate telephone services will only get worse.</para><para>In the March 2001 Performance Monitoring Bulletin, the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) found that Telstra has failed to meet even the Government's low standards for performance on fifty out of seventy-nine criteria. The ACA's Customer Satisfaction Survey has also found unprecedented levels of dissatisfaction by Australians with the service they are receiving from telecommunications carriers. As Labor has maintained consistently, the Government needs to retain its position as the majority shareholder in order to ensure that services improve. Telstra's recent price changes were only achieved via the Government's position as a majority shareholder in the organisation. The Government would no longer have this influence if it were to fully privatise Telstra, ending any chance of improving services to regional consumers. Privatisation will only ensure that Telstra focuses solely on profits rather than providing services to people living in the regions.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Unemployment</inline></para><para>Responses I have received from the electorate of Forde show concern at the growing level of unemployment in the area. The unemployment figures in the area of Forde show the Howard Government has broken its promise that the GST would create jobs. From December 2000 to March 2001, the unemployment level has increased by 3% in Beenleigh; 3.7% in Eagleby; 4.6% in Loganlea; and 4% in Waterford West. This Government's policies on taxation and small business have placed unprecedented pressure on the economy causing small business to suffer and unemployment to rise.</para><para>The unemployment problem is certainly not going to be addressed by this Government's refusal to deal with the situation of Job Network providers using labour hire firms to place their unemployed clients into `phantom jobs'. The recent Senate Estimates hearings exposed the practice of Job Network providers setting up their own labour hire company and then employing job seekers in this company only to sack them after completing 15 hours of work. The Government then pays the provider up to $400 for each unemployed person who they place into a job which lasts for a minimum of 15 hours. These so-called jobs often only require the unemployed person to only fill out a survey and often do not even require the unemployed person to leave home at all. The Government should be acting immediately to investigate the Job Network providers to ensure that this practice is stamped out. It must also investigate the apparent sanction given to this practice given by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. Not only is it a blatant misuse of taxpayers money—it is taking advantage of those in the community who are most in need of assistance. Unemployed people who are attempting to find work should be given as much assistance as possible, not exploited by the bodies who are funded by the government to provide genuine employment opportunities.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Small Business and Taxation</inline></para><para>On my recent visits to Toowoomba I have again been confronted with the extent to which small businesses are struggling under the current Government's business and taxation policies. This was confirmed by a substantial number of responses from the Gold Coast area which indicated that small businesses are still hurting from the taxation system implemented by this Government. It is difficult to reconcile this situation with Mr Howard's boast before the last election that “the tax plan is good for Australia ... It will boost the growth and the strength of the Australian economy”. (<inline font-style="italic">Parliament House, 13 August 1998</inline>). It is now clear that the GST has not boosted growth or strengthened the economy. In fact, the new taxation system has had a devastating effect on small business, with many simply preferring to close their doors rather than deal with the compliance nightmare and becoming part-time tax collectors for the Government.</para><para>An extraordinary number of businesses within the tourism industry on the Gold Coast have been adversely affected by the economic climate created by this Government. The Government needs to provide much more assistance to those small businesses involved in the tourism industry, particularly after slugging them with the most oppressive tax system this country has ever seen. Australian tourists now have the option of going overseas for their holidays and avoiding paying the GST or holidaying in their own country and being slugged with this tax. Prior to the introduction of the GST, the tourism industry briefed this Government extensively about the effect this tax would have on small businesses in this area. The Government ignored the warnings and now the small business operators in the tourism industry are paying the price.</para><para>Unfortunately, small business owners now have the end-of-financial-year GST nightmare to look forward to. According to the President of the National Tax Accountants' Association, Rob Regan, the tax system has been complicated to such an extent that tax agents' fees would increase by 50 to 100 per cent this year. With regard to the 350-page Tax Guide which arrives in the mail this week. Mr Regan made the point in the Courier-Mail (p.3. 26/06/01) that “Prior to the Howard Government coming into power, it was 200 pages - now it's almost doubled in size”.</para><para>Mr Regan went on to say that even experts were confused about the new tax regime, concluding that “Tax reform has failed under the Howard Government because it's too cumbersome”.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Dairy Deregulation</inline></para><para>The Government's handling of dairy deregulation was identified as an issue of major concern by many survey respondents in the Forde and Groom areas. Many dairy farmers have seen their income plummet as a result of dairy deregulation, with precious little assistance offered by this Government. The Government has set the cut off point for access to additional assistance at only those who had over 35% of their operation devoted to producing market milk. This effectively cuts out at least 20% of dairy farmers in Queensland. Any farmers which took advice prior to deregulation to expand and diversify their businesses have now been penalised for doing so. Many of these farmers now have very low incomes, considerable debt, and yet still cannot access this additional assistance. The Government has failed to develop a cohesive plan to secure the futures of dairy farming families and others in the industry. Labor's Shadow Agriculture Minister recently highlighted the Government's vast number of failings in their handling of this issue including: failing to allow dairy farmers to directly access Dairy Regional Assistance Program (DRAP) grants where a project can be shown to result in long-term employment in a dairying area; failing to support farmers seeking to bargain collectively with processors and manufacturers; failing to ensure that neither suppliers nor consumers are being exploited in the wake of deregulation and producing an exit scheme which very few farmers have been able to access. Labor's amendment to the Government's legislation was passed through the Senate yesterday. Unfortunately, the government watered down this measure this morning. This amendment was to reduce the cut-off point for access to additional assistance to 25%, as well as introducing a minimum payment of $15000 for eligible farmers. This amendment would have meant that most of the farmers in the `quota' states, including my state of Queensland, who would have missed out under the Governments plan will now qualify for assistance. The ball is now in the Government's court as the legislation returns to the House of Representatives - they can support the legislation with Labor's amendments to insure a fairer compensation deal for our dairy farmers or they can abandon them yet again. The government took the low road and pared back our amendment.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Environment and Heritage</inline></para><para>Environment and heritage issues seem to consistently rate as issues of major concern in public forums, with similar results emanating from responses from constituents. People seem to be very concerned about the preservation of their local environment as well as the conservation of local man-made structures of historical and natural value. Residents who visit areas such as Mt Tamborine or the Lamington National Park in Forde or the Burleigh Heads National Park in McPherson greatly appreciate the opportunity to regularly visit such beautiful local environments and are rightfully determined to ensure that these areas are protected. To ensure the protection of these and other areas of national importance, Labor is campaigning to save the Register of National Estate. This Register has been developed over the last twenty-five years and consists of some thirteen thousand places that have been recognised for their heritage values. It appears that the Howard Government is proposing to scrap the Register through legislation and replace if with two far more limited lists. The Government's legislation will immediately remove all of these listings from the Register and will replace the Australian Heritage Commission with an advisory council with significantly reduced powers and independence. Labor supports retaining the Register of National Estate as a comprehensive statutory register to be updated and maintained at a national level. Labor will also supporting stronger protection provisions in the existing framework for protection of heritage places with national significance. However, we believe that this should be achieved through amending the current legislation. Many of the places listed on the Register have received greater recognition and protection as a result of their listing. Many places in my local area are listed on this Register including: the Beaudesert War Memorial, the Bethania Lutheran Church, the Boonah War Memorial, Catswold Cottage in Rathdowney, Bishops Peak Shelter, Hillview Art Site, Cedar Creek National Park, Joalah National Park and Tamborine Mountain National Park. It is of great concern to me that these places will lose the recognition and protection offered by their listing in the Register. Local constituents who also wish to voice their concern over this issue can sign a petition at my office which calls on the Government to maintain the Register of the National Estate.</para><para>Whilst it has been clear for some time that the policies embraced by this Government are failing, responses to my survey have confirmed that people do not believe that this Government is up to the job. More importantly, Australians have a right to expect that the Government will attempt to address these issues in a responsible manner - not indulge in a panic-fuelled advertising blitz to buy their way back into government.</para></quote></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Whistleblowers: Heiner Case</title><page.no>25566</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>03:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>25566</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek an indication from the chamber whether all senators' adjournment speeches will be incorporated.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—It would be a matter of the speeches being shown in advance to the whips, and it may have been agreed or not have been agreed.

Greenwood QC, in respect of a charge that the Senate was gravely misled by the Queensland government and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission when it took evidence in the Heiner affair in 1995 before the Senate Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases chaired by Senator Shayne Murphy. The grievance is addressed to Senator Margaret Reid, President of the Senate. Honourable senators should know that, after considering the matter, the President declined to table it but she invited the interested parties, Messrs Lindeberg and Greenwood, to see if any senator would. After an approach and careful consideration, I have agreed to do so. Under normal circumstances I would respect the President's discretion but on this occasion, regretfully, I cannot.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The grievance does bring serious new evidence and critical insights into the notorious Heiner affair which I believe must be appropriately considered by this chamber. Disturbingly, it reveals for the first time that allegations of child abuse brought about the Heiner inquiry, and that the shredding unacceptably aided in covering up the abuse. This chamber knows that I, along with all other senators, have a longstanding interest in eradicating child abuse, no matter where it exists, who has engaged in it and who has covered it up.</para><para>To reiterate, the new evidence reveals what can be reasonably assumed to have been shredded, namely, evidence of abuse of children in that state run institution, and it throws a new and disturbing light on the thousands of dollars of public money paid by the Queensland government to a public servant to buy his silence about the child abuse and related matters. The critical evidence appears to have been deliberately withheld from the Senate at the time when it was considering the Heiner affair. Contempt may therefore have been committed. Given the time constraints, I seek leave to table the grievance and its attachments so this chamber may consider the content during the winter recess.</para><para>Leave not granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8HC</name.id><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name></talker><para>—It is my intention to speak more comprehensively, when the Senate resumes, on the grievance and how I believe its serious issues should be addressed by the Senate.

According to the Chief Minister, Mr Burke, the Public Order and Anti-Social Conduct Bill 2001 is about the maintenance of law and order—“a set of comprehensive reforms and programs that will safeguard our security”.</para><para>But on further reading of the legislation, one has to ask the question: “Whose security?”</para><para>The Chief Minister goes on to say that the bill will “punish where necessary”, but also “assist the rehabilitation of offenders.” This is what Mr Burke calls “managed punishment”.</para><para>And those who are to be “managed” under this bill are a group known as “itinerants or long-grassers”. Senators may not be all that familiar with the term long-grassers—but to most in the Northern Territory, it is a slang term for homeless Aboriginal people.</para><para>A lot of Aboriginal people come into Darwin during the dry season, which happens to coincide with the tourist season. This is when the climate is at its best, when people can actually leave remote communities and know they will be able to get home, and when people can travel up to Darwin, visit friends and family or access specialist medical treatment and hospitals.</para><para>Of course when they arrive in Darwin. there isn't sufficient accommodation, so many people turn to charitable organisations for food and shelter, or they simply sleep under the stars.</para><para>This is an annual routine for many Aboriginal people. It has been happening for generations.</para><para>But to the Chief Minister, these `long-grassers' are a blight on Darwin and the harbingers of crime and unsightly behaviour.</para><para>So let us be clear on what this bill is about, and whose behaviour is being labelled as `anti-social' and contrary to `public order'.</para><para>In his second reading speech, the Chief Minister made the comment that:</para><para>“Many ways have been tried and many more words have been expended on seeking a solution to the anti-social behaviour of this particular—perhaps even peculiar—group within Territory society. The Government in introducing the Public Order and Anti-Social Conduct Bill is trying yet another way to deal with some of the intrusive activities we see in our streets and parks.</para><para>... we are not being racist when we suggest that many of our urban problems might not be there if some of these people went home.”</para><para>Clearly this is a bill that is in the league of the NT's mandatory sentencing legislation.</para><para>It doesn't directly name Aboriginal people as the target group, but it is clear after reading the bill and the Chief Minister's speech, what its true motivations and intentions are.</para><para>It is also clear that it will disproportionately impact on Aboriginal people, bring them into greater contact with police, and increase the likelihood of Aboriginal incarceration.</para><para>But the trade-off, in the Minister's eyes at least, is the perceived electoral benefits of a tough law and order platform as the Territory approaches an election.</para><para>So what is `anti-social conduct'?</para><para>It includes any behaviour that:</para><para>·	Causes apprehension, harassment, alarm or distress to a reasonable person entering or leaving a place;</para><para>·	Obstructs the movement of pedestrians or traffic;</para><para>·	Obstructs or hinders another person entering or leaving a business;</para><para>·	Disrupts the peaceful and orderly conduct of an event, entertainment or gathering;</para><para>·	Interferes with people's reasonable enjoyment of a place; or</para><para>·	Disrupts peace or good order in or around a place.</para><para>In effect, anti-social behaviour will include things like:</para><para>·	public loitering,</para><para>·	jay walking,</para><para>·	sleeping in parks, and</para><para>·	people who look different to the `model citizen'.</para><para>And it is police who will determine what is and is not anti-social, and what is not conducive to `public order'.</para><para>The bill empowers police officers (of any rank) to issue a person with a `direction' to leave a place or stop acting in an `anti-social' manner in a given place. Directions have a lifespan of up to 72 hours, and can be issued for anti-social behaviour that occurs in any public place, any private. lace where the conduct affects people who are in a public place,  P</para><para>or somewhere that has been deemed a `prescribed' place by police.</para><para>In the process of issuing a `direction', police can confiscate anything that is contributing to the anti-social conduct. This may mean. a stereo, a skateboard and so on. Police are required to return `detained goods' in a `reasonable' time frame—but no time limits are referred to in the bill.</para><para>Police are also empowered to judge what is `reasonable' when it comes to deciding whether or not to issue someone with a direction. Police will determine what is `reasonably necessary' in the interest of public safety, public order, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. to end the anti-social conduct.</para><para>Surely, if the legal principle of `reasonableness' is to be exercised, this should be done by a magistrate or a judge.</para><para>It is important to note that the bill does not make anti-social conduct a crime.</para><para>The crime is committed when someone fails to fully comply with a direction by showing further anti-social conduct before the declaration has expired. A breach of a direction incurs a penalty of up to $2,000 or 6 month's gaol.</para><para>When issuing a direction, police may ask for the offender's name and address. If they fail to divulge the information, this is an offence under the bill, and again incurs a fine of up to $2,000 or 6 month's gaol.</para><para>I return to my earlier point, if `reasonableness' is the legal principle the NT Government wants to exercise through this legislation—surely the punishment should fit the crime. How could anyone argue that refusing to state your name and address warrants six month's in gaol—or that sleeping in a park could cost you $2,000?</para><para>The bill also applies to private property such as people's homes, if the police declare the home or the block of flats a `prescribed. place'. Police suddenly have extremely `broad powers, such as the right to give directions to residents of the flats in relation. to their conduct within the flats and the surrounding area. Similarly, the Minister could notify an Aboriginal community, and all the dwellings within that community, that they constitute a `prescribed place'.</para><para>Furthermore, the bill proposes to abolish certain private property rights of peaceful enjoyment and exclusive possession through the creation of a mechanism called a `Place of Anti-Social Conduct Declaration'.</para><para>In other words. it defies the age-old notion of a man or a woman's house being their castle, which underpins our common law relating to property.</para><para>Any police officer can apply to a court for this declaration, provided that the court is satisfied (on the balance of probabilities rather than any proof) that the place has been associated with `a continuing or repeated course of anti-social conduct'. Courts have the power to revoke and extend declarations beyond the 12 month limit.</para><para>If the house that you rent comes under such a declaration, police can enter (forcibly if necessary) your house at any time without your consent, or a warrant—day or night—if they reasonably suspect that anti-social conduct is occurring in the house.</para><para>The only check and balance relating to a declaration is that the officer is required to get the approval of a Superintendent.</para><para>While in the house or the surrounding area, police can. issue directions to anyone who acts in an anti-social manner, confiscate property and ask for names and addresses.</para><para>If police suspect that any person has `a thing connected with or relating to an offence', police can search the entire property, including vehicles, and people. They are also empowered to use `reasonable force' to conduct any of these searches. If anyone does not co-operate, the penalty is also a fine of up to $2,000 or 6 months gaol.</para><para>If you are not the owner of the building, but a tenant, you have no right of appeal against the declaration. A tenant would have to convince their landlord to appeal the declaration on their behalf.</para><para>The ability of the police to enforce directions that they issue raises a number of questions about police intelligence collection and record keeping.</para><para>Records about what directions have been issued and are in force will need to be kept. Consequently, recipients of a direction, who are otherwise law-abiding citizens, are likely to have personal details about their lives collated and held by police.</para><para>These are serious privacy questions when you consider that those under this type of surveillance have not broken any law, until such time as they breach a direction.</para><para>The North Australian Aboriginal Legal Service has provided a list of the legislation that already exists in the NT to give police and government agencies powers to deal with disorderly conduct. These include the liquor laws to prevent public drinking, protective custody laws that allow police to detain anyone who is drunk in public, council by-laws to stop sleeping in public places or to move people on from public places if they are disorderly, and so on.</para><para>In other words, I fail to see an actual need for the Public Order and Anti-Social Conduct Bill in the NT's legal system. All of the reasons that the Chief Minister listed as to why the bill is necessary, are sufficiently addressed by current legislation.</para><para>So what does this bill achieve that is new? All I can see is that it creates an entirely new class of criminal conduct—namely disobeying a police officer.</para><para>And in light of the thinly-veiled racially-discriminatory nature of the bill, I think most Australians would be offended by its intrusive and punitive nature and what its impact on Aboriginal people will be.</para><para>Its likely impact will be more Aboriginal being imprisoned for minor offences.</para><para>This new law runs totally counter to the mandatory sentencing deal between the Federal and NT governments. And I hope that the Howard Government will take note of this!</para><para>Most of the Aboriginal people being gaoled will be the same people currently affected by mandatory sentencing—that is Aboriginal people, particularly if they are young, homeless or itinerant.</para><para>This new law will increase the interactions between Aboriginal people and police, inevitably resulting in an increase in offences such as:</para><para>·	resist police,</para><para>·	assault police,</para><para>·	offensive language and so on.</para><para>Assaults are now “mandatory sentencing offences” in the NT, meaning that the penalty must be gaol—and we are not necessarily talking about short sentences, because no time period is specified.</para><para>There is also the potential that minor property damage will result from the increased interactions between police and Aboriginal people as a result of this bill—property damage attracts mandatory minimum gaol terms.</para><para>Therefore, what the mandatory sentencing deal may represent in terms of positives for Aboriginal people, the anti-social conduct bill will take away. At the same time as the Federal Government is trying to make the mandatory sentencing deal work to reduce Aboriginal incarceration, the Territory Government is seeking to introduce new laws that will achieve the exact opposite.</para><para>The NT's intent in tabling this bill would appear to be to win the `law and order' vote in the lead up to the next election.</para><para>But the long-term outcomes for Aboriginal people are extremely regressive and demoralising. I think all Senators can imagine the impact this bill is going to have on communities that are already struggling with a range of dire social issues and lack of economic opportunities. And let us remember, we are not talking about a small minority of people in the Territory.</para><para>We are talking about 25% of the population.</para><para>Does Australia really want to revisit the national and international backlash and criticism that came with the mandatory sentencing laws?</para><para>Do we want to ignore the main recommendation of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and relegate another generation of young Aboriginal people to be permanently destined for our gaols?</para><para>I hope the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, and other members of his government will reconsider their advocacy of this bill and ensure it never becomes law in this country.</para><para>Thank you.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Knowledge Nation</title><page.no>25569</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>03:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>25569</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak about a concept known as Knowledge Nation. This has been bandied around quite a lot over the last year or so. If we look at the history of this, it actually goes back to Bill Clinton in America. He was the first one who came up with Knowledge Nation. Tony Blair in the UK then borrowed the term and then Kim Beazley out here in Australia borrowed the term Knowledge Nation. With the old videotapes, when you make a copy of a copy of a copy what you end up with at the end is not particularly good and not particularly clear. That is particularly the case with this so-called Knowledge Nation policy of the ALP. Kim Beazley launched this earlier this year and his first bright idea was an online university, which has been thoroughly rubbished and discredited right around the country. I have made many speeches relating to that and I do not want to dwell on it tonight.</para></talk.start><para>But I do want to dwell on the fact that the Labor Party, who see themselves as an alternative government, have tonight trashed any idea of their Knowledge Nation. Right at the cusp of where they wanted to lead off with Knowledge Nation, they have refused to pass the <inline ref="R1282">Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline>, which was going to be the start of the allocation of over $100 million into Knowledge Nation type activities in the schools and universities of this country. I do not know what the shadow minister for education and the Leader of the Opposition are actually doing at the moment. The fact is that they have allowed Senator Kim Carr to come in here and prevent the foundations of their Knowledge Nation starting. Who is running the show in the Labor Party? We have had this rogue senator trashing Labor policy. The Leader of the Opposition should bring the senator into line. I do not think he realises the implication of what has happened. Let me give a little bit of history of how it has developed in the Senate over the last few weeks.</para><para>The bill, quite properly, was sent to inquiry with a reporting date. The inquiry was to be held last Monday week, and it was. Then, before we got back to the reporting date, the Democrats combined with Labor to move in the Senate an extension for another hearing. That hearing was held last Monday. That was engineered by Senator Lyn Allison, who has a blind, ideological hatred of private schools. Because this bill quite rightly contains a small amount of money for an increase in funding to private schools because there are more students in those schools, Labor and the Democrats have combined to stop the whole thing. They have deliberately engineered this, and I want to put this very clearly on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record. They could have had the inquiry, reported back and given us 1½ weeks to debate the bill. But they set a reporting date of today for the <inline ref="R1282">Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline>. And, with our very busy program of 14 bills to get through today, when did we get to it? We got to it at 2 o'clock this morning. How on earth could it be debated sensibly then anyway?</para><para>Let us work out who the guilty parties here are. The guilty parties are Labor and the Democrats. They have stopped this legislation with these manoeuvring tactics. Let us see what the effect of it will be. I do not know if Kim Beazley is actually focusing on what the effects of this bill will be. There are a number of aspects. I mentioned the school one, and I will just treat that very briefly. The Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs made an estimate of how many new schools were going to start and how many students were going to be in those schools. It happened that there were more schools than they had estimated, and the schools were a little bit bigger. We fund these schools on a pro rata basis. It is not that there are extra dollars per student; there just happen to be more students and more schools. That is why there is an extra appropriation. That is quite reasonable, yet Senator Lyn Allison's blind, ideological hatred of parental choice is stopping that provision.</para><para>Let us have a look at what this also holds up and stops. One of the initiatives is for 2,000 extra places in the universities of this country. There will be students out there who will now miss out. If we consider this in August and there is evidence from the hearing and from the department to say that the effect will be quite patchy, some universities will take a punt and start to plan for their places for next year. Others, perhaps the smaller ones in the regional areas, will be a lot more cautious about it and will not start planning for the places. Therefore, students will miss out in rural and regional Australia. Students who may have gone to university will now not go to university next year because of the irresponsible reaction of the Democrats and Labor senators.</para><para>Let us have a look at another measure in the bill. We have established a postgraduate loans scheme in this bill: up to 250,000 postgraduate students will be able to apply for loans and, without an interest component, repay them through a HECS type system. This is a major new push for postgraduate education in this country, the very foundation needed for their Knowledge Nation—and what is happening to it? It is being completely trashed by the stopping of this bill. Will the universities have the time to advertise those places and get them in place for next year? If we consider this legislation in August, which is now certain, maybe it will happen, maybe it will not; it is a near-run thing.</para><para>Another major provision in the bill relates to the infrastructure that goes with research. Under 13 years of Labor, when research went in, infrastructure often did not—and the universities have been starved of proper infrastructure funding. This bill is the start of correcting that long-term error. If you are to buy and order this sort of equipment, you must have a long lead time to do it. But in the Senate, due to the Labor Party and the Democrats, we have now delayed that by three months. Will it be in place for next year?</para><para>This government, through Backing Australia's Ability, has doubled the number of ARC grants, the research grants, which is something Labor never did—we have doubled them. Excellent research projects will go ahead which are the very foundations of something called the Knowledge Nation. Yet tonight the combined parties here have stopped that going ahead on time. Lead time for getting this research under way with projects being approved has now been completely delayed. So, putting all of those things together, with Backing Australia's Ability, we are attempting to implement a major new initiative in this country for getting research and training and student numbers post-secondary up and running in a major way, but that has now been hobbled by the actions here tonight.</para><para>What is happening in the Labor Party policy area? They claim that, if they come into government this year, they will develop this Knowledge Nation. What we have seen here tonight are the very foundations of that being cut out from under the Labor Party policy.

The prawns were imported from Thailand where the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is present. Action was taken in November 1999 to stop future importation. The matter was again raised by the Australian Prawn Farmers Association in January 2001 and was re-investigated by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS).

This has been confirmed with relevant current and former officers in Biosecurity Australia and members of the risk analysis panel (RAP) conducting the import risk analysis (IRA).</para><para>	(d)	No.</para><para>(3)	(a)	I have not `consistently argued' that there is little risk in the importation of uncooked green prawns. I have, however, reported the views of the RAP, made up of eminent experts in crustacean diseases and quarantine risk analysis. The panel assessed the risk of the establishment of white spot disease through the use of imported green prawns for bait as low but nonetheless recommended measures for the further reduction of risk. The RAP recognises that WSSV has had a serious effect on prawn farming in many countries but found no evidence of a significant deleterious effect on the natural marine environment.</para><para>	(b)	The risk management measures proposed by the RAP, and other significant measures, were introduced in December 2000 and February 2001 to manage the risks until completion of the IRA. Biosecurity Australia considers these measures are adequate and in these circumstances a moratorium is difficult to justify scientifically. </para><para>	(c)	The conditions in place until 1996 for imported green prawns were inadequate.  However, the measures now in place satisfactorily address that threat, in accordance with Australia's conservative approach to quarantine risk and Australia's internationalobligations.</para><para>(4)	(a)	The States and Territories have responsibility for implementing controls on the end use of green prawns within their own borders, that is, after prawns have left quarantine.  The Commonwealth has demanded that commensurate with the stricter import conditions outlined previously, the States and Territories should enforce their licensing and other regulatory powers to address any illicit trade in bait prawns. </para><para>With regard to the `significant' threat to Australian prawn farms and other crustaceans, the RAP assessed the risk of disease introduction as low but recommended measures for the further reduction of risk. Measures introduced in December 2000 and February 2001 will help ensure that imported prawns are not diverted to the bait trade. Testing requirements will target prawns infected with WSSV.</para><para>(b)	Yes.</para><para>(c)	See the answer to (3) (a) and (b).</para><para>(5)	(a)	Biosecurity Australia confirms that the Australian prawn farming industry raised concerns about an exotic virus in fresh chilled prawns in February 1994.</para><para>	(b) Biosecurity Australia confirms that the Australian prawn farming industry requested action on uncooked prawn imports, particularly bait prawns, in September 1996.</para><para>	(c)	The Senator appears to be unaware that the issue was taken up by the National Task Force on Imported Fish and Fish Products in 1995 and 1996. The Australian Prawn Farmers Association was a member of the Task Force. Its report issued in December 1996 recommended that action be taken to address the issue of the importation of prawns not intended for human consumption. Pre-empting the recommendation, AQIS introduced a ban in November 1996. These prawns were prohibited with the intention of limiting the use of imported prawns as bait. The ban meant that fewer poor quality and emergency harvested prawns were imported. Also an IRA of prawns and prawn products was commenced. More recent evidence indicates that the diversion of prawns imported for human consumption into the bait trade, despite the import ban, was greater than expected and further action was taken in December 2000 and February 2001.</para><para>(6)	(a)	Green prawns imported from Indonesia in 1999 were inadvertently (in the belief they were of Australian origin) fed to mudcrabs and prawns in an aquaculture pond at the Darwin Aquaculture Centre and to prawns at the Aquaculture School of the Northern Territory University.</para><para>	(b)	Samples of the imported prawns, the mudcrabs and prawns to which they were fed, and shore crabs and prawns in Darwin harbour at the outfall from the pond were tested for white spot. Samples from each group were positive. The test used recognises segments of viral DNA, ie it is not a definitive test for viable virus. The test results do however indicate that there was transmission of WSSV and that crustaceans in Darwin harbour became infected. Subsequent tests do not indicate that infection became established.</para><para>	(c)	I am advised that susceptible animals at the Aquaculture Centre and Aquaculture School were destroyed and the facilities disinfected to ensure disease was not present in those facilities. Subsequent testing of crustaceans in Darwin harbour indicates that WSSV has not become established there.</para><para>	(d)	The RAP acknowledged that the feeding of raw prawns in aquaculture is dangerous. Another lower risk exposure pathway for the introduction of disease is through the use of imported prawns as bait by recreational fishermen. The measures that have been put in place are designed to prevent the establishment of WSSV in Australia.</para><para>	(e)	See  the answer to 3 (b).</para><para>(7)	The sampling in Darwin Harbour is being conducted by the Northern Territory Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries. Further enquiries should be directed to that department.</para><para>(8)	(a)	The measures are targeted at whole and unpeeled, headless green prawns which are the product most likely to be used for bait.</para><para>	(b)	Those products, which are clearly for human consumption and/or have been processed such that they are not likely to be used as bait, for example prawn cutlets and garlic prawns, are excluded from the measures. The measures also do not apply to product from countries or zones free of diseases of quarantine concern.</para><para>	(c)	The current import conditions are consistent with this Government's conservative approach to quarantine.  Target imports of green prawns will be tested against a strict standard and any consignment detected as carrying WSSV will be rejected.</para><para>(9)	(a)	Selected State diagnostic laboratories will conduct the testing of prawns for WSSV.</para><para>	(b)	All batches of whole green and unpeeled headless prawns are tested for WSSV using a sampling and test protocol designed to detect WSSV infection present at 5% prevalence with at least 95% confidence.</para><para>	(c)	A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based test for WSSV DNA similar to that used in the testing so far.</para><para>	(d)	The cost per test is approximately $55.  This does not include the costs associated with the inspection and collection of suitable samples or the transport of these samples to the laboratories conducting the WSSV testing.</para><para>	(e)	Importers.</para><para>	(f)	WSSV is the major disease of quarantine concern.  Biosecurity Australia and the RAP consider the other risk management measures already in place adequately address risk from other diseases. Further information on the risk assessment and risk management for relevant diseases is in the draft IRA report.</para><para>	(g)	The testing regime will be subject to usual auditing and reporting procedures. As part of these procedures, the results can be made available on request.</para><para>(10)	(a)	I am aware that since the announcement of testing and other measures in policy memorandum 2001/06 and prior to the introduction of the testing regime, uncooked whole prawns were imported and released without testing. This is not in contravention of that policy as the memorandum made it clear that the measures would be phased in. During this intervening period AQIS assessed all consignments of green prawns, particularly to ensure they were intended for human consumption. </para><para>	(b)	See answer to (a).</para><para>	(c)	The interim measures currently in place plus the closer scrutiny by AQIS of all consignments of green prawns minimise the risk of imported product introducing WSSV.</para><para>(11)	(a)	Yes, I am aware that some State governments made such statements.  However, all States and Territories have now signed onto the WSSV testing protocol for imported prawns. </para><para>	(b)	I am aware of some recreational fishing and conservation groups calling for a ban on uncooked prawn imports.</para><para>	(c)	As mentioned in earlier responses, a moratorium on imports is not considered necessary and is difficult to justify on current scientific evidence. The RAP, made up of eminent experts in their field, considered the interim measures are appropriate pending the gathering of further information and finalisation of the IRA. These conditions are consistent with the Federal Government's conservative approach to quarantine and our international SPS obligations.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ansons Bay, Tasmania</title><page.no>25581</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3574)</subtitle><id.no>3574</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25581</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 4 May 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the planned conversion to freehold title of Crown land on the Ansons Bay foreshore in north-eastern Tasmania:</para><para>(1)	Is any Natural Heritage Trust or other federal money being used for the development of a sewerage system, or any other purpose, as part of this development.</para><para>(2)	What threats does the development pose to local flora and fauna, in particular threatened species listed on the Commonwealth schedule of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (the Act), such as the Australian Grayling, Dwarf Galaxias, Spotted Tailed Quoll, Leatherback Turtle and Eastern Barred Bandicoot, all of which are known to have habitat in Ansons Bay.</para><para>(3)	Given the potential threats posed to these species by the proposed development, will the Minister use his powers under the Act to order a comprehensive assessment and approval process of the development.</para><para>(4)	Has the Minister or any of his staff visited Ansons Bay to see the site of the proposed development. </para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25581</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	No Natural Heritage Trust or other Federal funding is being used for the development of a sewerage system on or adjacent to Ansons Bay foreshore. </para><para>While not directly related to the issue of the possible conversion of Crown land to freehold land, I have approved a grant of $5,025 to the Ansons Bay Coastcare Group to help protect the wetlands of Ansons Bay by improving the management of car parking and access adjacent to the wetlands.</para><para>(2)	I understand in general that some Crown land on the Ansons Bay foreshore may be considered for conversion to freehold title.

These efforts have been supplemented by a team of hunters from Victoria with experience of fox hunting in East Gippsland.</para><para>(3)	In 1999, the “Threat Abatement Plan for Predation by the European Red Fox” was adopted in consultation with States and Territories.  The plan has six objectives and 27 actions.  Each state is responsible for implementing the plan within its own jurisdiction.  Where a threat occurs across more than one state, the Commonwealth and states work cooperatively to implement the plan.</para><para>The following projects were funded by the Commonwealth specifically targeting foxes and/or feral cats:</para></quote><para>·	Development of immunocontraceptive vaccine for the control of fox populations in Australia.</para><para>·	Field assessment of target and non-target effects of predator baiting.</para><para>·	Development of a Humane Felid Specific Toxin and bait delivery system for feral cat control.</para><para>·	Fertility control of foxes with Cabergoline including its registration for use on Philip Island;</para><para>·	The potential for habitat manipulation to limit fox density and reduce the need for intensive baiting.</para><para>·	Development of a cheap and effective fox bait;</para><para>·	Fox population assessment and control.</para><para>·	Katarapko Island habitat and species restoration program;</para><para>·	Assessment of the impact of foxes on brush-tailed rock wallabies and evaluation of the effectiveness of community involvement in fox control;</para><para>·	Assessment of the impact of fox baiting on tiger quoll populations;</para><para>·	Preliminary Assessment of analgesic/1080 bait combination for humane predator control. </para><para>·	Integrated vertebrate pest management on Macquarie Island.</para><para>·	Bounceback 2000 (an integrated pest management - foxes, cats goats and rabbits - and recovery of threatened species project).</para><para>·	Operation Wanjarri - Optimising Feral Cat Baiting Strategy in the arid zone.</para><para>·	Effects on non-target species of 1080 baiting for foxes and dogs.</para><quote><para>(4)	See the Answer to Question 2.  I am advised that Victorian and Tasmanian officials have discussed the issue of fox incursions into Tasmania from Victoria following an incident in 1999 when a fox was accidentally transported to Tasmania from Melbourne.  I am seeking further advice from both States on measures being taken to prevent foxes moving to Tasmania, especially in the light of recent reported sightings.</para><para>(5)	Through the National Feral Animal Control Program under the Natural Heritage Trust, approximately $2.9 million has been provided to fund projects that address the impact of foxes.  In addition, funding is also provided through the Endangered Species Program to all States and Territories to address the impact of foxes and other pest species to threatened species and communities.  No Commonwealth funding has been sought by Tasmania and none has been provided to deal with these particular sightings.</para><para>(6)	Fox incursions into Tasmania are treated seriously.  As noted above, I am conveying my concern to my counterparts in Victoria and Tasmania and seeking their advice on preventative measures being undertaken.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Human Rights: Falun Gong</title><page.no>25586</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3595)</subtitle><id.no>3595</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25586</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 June 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Were the human rights violations of Falun Gong raised during the trade talks between Australia and China in April 2001; if not, why not.</para><para>(2)	Is the human rights issue of Falun Gong always considered during trade talks with China.</para><para>(3)	Will the Australian Government continue to raise the issue of human rights violations in the bilateral human rights dialogue with China.</para><para>(4)	Hong Kong Security Secretary, Regina Ip, has confirmed there is a Falun Gong blacklist in response to the 95 foreign Falun Gong practitioners that were denied entry into Hong Kong in May 2001.

The principle purpose of his visit was to pursue Australia's interest in the supply of liquefied natural gas to China.  He also focused on opportunities for cooperation in the transport, agricultural, services and resource sectors.  Human rights issues were not raised as this was not the purpose of the visit.</para><para>(2)	No. </para><para>(3)	Yes.  This is a key element of the Human Rights Dialogue.</para><para>(4)	In a letter to the Editor of the Asian Wall Street Journal on 8 June, Hong Kong's Secretary for Security, Ms Regina Ip, denied that Hong Kong immigration authorities were working from an alleged “blacklist” to refuse entry to 95 foreign Falun Gong practitioners (including 20 Australians) in early May.  In a meeting with Australia's Consul-General for Hong Kong, Mr Bill Tweddell on 16 May, Ms Ip advised that denial of entry to foreign Falun Gong practitioners was decided on “security grounds” because of the need to protect VIPs attending the Fortune Global Conference in Hong Kong (on 8 May).  She said this did not mean the same people would automatically be denied entry in future.</para><para>(5)	My Department has confirmed that 10 Australian Falun Gong practitioners were detained briefly by Macau authorities while undertaking a peaceful demonstration outside a hotel there on 19 December.  I am aware of only one case of alleged harassment involving an Australian citizen.  Ms Kelly Kong Xu claims that she was refused entry and physically assaulted by Macau immigration officers at the border on 20 December.  Ms Kong was visited by an officer of the Australian Consulate-General in Hong Kong while she was receiving treatment in hospital later that day, who subsequently accompanied her whilst she provided a statement to Hong Kong police.  The Consulate-General forwarded a note to the Macau authorities on 20 December requesting that the matter be investigated.  The Macau government provided a response on 17 January, a copy of which was forwarded to Ms Kong.</para><para>(6)	My Department is aware of reports that a media tour to Masanjia Labor Reeducation Camp took place in late May 2001.</para><para>(7)	My Department has information that many Falun Gong practitioners have been sentenced to terms in `Re-education Through Labor' camps.  It has no concrete information that camps have been established exclusively for Falun Gong practitioners, although this is certainly possible.</para><para>(8)	Estimates of the number of Falun Gong practitioners that have been detained, sentenced and died in custody vary.  In its 2001 Annual Report, Amnesty International reported that at least 93 Falun Gong practitioners were believed to have died in police custody since July 1999.  Falun Gong sources estimate at least 222  practitioners have died in detention or while being taken into custody during the same period.  Several tens of thousands Falun Gong practitioners are thought to be in detention.</para><para>(9)	The agenda for the Prime Minister's talks at the APEC meeting has not yet been settled.</para><para>(10)	The Australian Government has strong concerns about the human rights situation in China, including alleged human rights violations against Falun Gong practitioners.  It is unlikely to support an international delegation to investigate alleged human rights violations against Falun Gong practitioners.  As is commonly the case with international human rights investigations, the delegation would require the consent of the Chinese Government in order to enter China legally and undertake its work.  My Department assesses that the Chinese Government is unlikely to agree to a visit by any such delegation.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of Veterans' Affairs: One-off Payments to Senior Australians</title><page.no>25587</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3612)</subtitle><id.no>3612</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25587</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 13 June 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	How many clients of the department will be receiving a personalised letter from the Minister regarding the one-off payment to senior Australians announced in the 2001-02 Budget.</para><para>(2)	What will be the cost of production of the letter.</para><para>(3)	What will be the cost of postage for the letter.</para><para>(4)	What will be the total cost of the mail out.</para><para>(5)	What is the timeframe for the dispatch of the letter.</para><para>(6)	What is the timeframe for the dispatch of letters to the following postcodes: 3131, 3133, 3134, 3135, 3152, 3153, 3155, 3156, 3178, 3179, 3180 and 3802.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25588</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Minchin</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	347,415</para><para>(2)	$0.39*</para><para>(3)	$0.41*</para><para>(4)	$285,932*</para><para>*Only an estimate as a final invoice has not yet been received from the mailing house.</para><para>(5)	Letters were progressively lodged with Australia Post from Thursday, 7 June 2001 with the final letters being lodged on Tuesday, 12 June 2001.</para><para>(6)	The Department does not have exact lodgement details for these postcodes.
