The bill increases funding to the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, and the increased funding will become effective from 1 July 2001. Currently, the funding arrangements are that the Commonwealth contributes $1 for every $2 raised from industry by way of levy payments. This bill will increase the government's contribution by matching $1 for every $1 contributed by industry levies. At first one might think that this is some sort of generous increase from $1 for every $2 to $1 for every $1. However, in reality, the additional funding amounts to only $1.6 million per annum. Further, when this initiative—the sole initiative of Minister Tuckey in the almost three years that he has had this ministry—is compared with the funding established by the previous Labor government under the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy and the RFA process, this increase is not only paltry and minuscule but also an insult to the industry. </para></talk.start><para>It is an insult to industry because Minister Tuckey has been for the last 2½ years running around the country ranting and raving about the wonderful things that he was going to do for the forest industry and for the wood and paper products industry. He announced in 1998 that he would establish an action agenda. Mr Tuckey indicated that that action agenda would be developed in consultation with industry and that the details would be announced in June 1999. Anyone who cares to take the time to read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of estimates proceedings, the House of Representatives and the Senate will note that the famous action agenda was noted for its lack of action. Indeed, it was not until the end of 2000, some 18 months after the deadline of June 1999, that we finally saw any details regarding Minister Tuckey's action agenda. The only matter of substance in that action agenda was this funding increase of $1.6 million. </para><para>Minister Tuckey was asked a question on notice earlier this year by the shadow minister for forestry, Mr Ferguson, as to what other funding initiatives would be contained within this action agenda. After all, this was Minister Tuckey's grand vision for the industry. Minister Tuckey's response to that question on notice, which was delivered on 5 March 2001, stated:</para><quote><para>The government is in the process of developing the 2001-2002 budget. Details of funding for Action Agenda items are as yet unknown. </para></quote><para>That was a telling admission by Minister Tuckey because, as we all know, he is one who is never short for words. He usually has a lot to say. He has a hell of a lot to say. There is not much substance, but he has a lot to say. But on this occasion, when he was asked the specific question of what other funding initiatives are in this action agenda that the minister has spent two years or more developing, his response was that the government is in the process of developing this year's budget and the details of funding are as yet unknown. For Minister Tuckey that was a short, succinct response that for once said nothing without him making a lot of noise in doing so, which is his usual approach.</para><para>It was a short time from March through to May, so we waited for the budget. What was in the budget in terms of funding for this industry? Absolutely nothing. There was not one cent of additional funding for new initiatives for this industry in this year's budget. There was not one cent for any initiative under the famous Tuckey action agenda. So the action agenda, as I said, is characterised by its total lack of action. This minister and this government stand condemned for their failure to match their words with deeds, to match their promises with real dollars to support this industry.</para><para>As I said, the opposition is prepared to support this legislation, notwithstanding this government's and this minister's total failure to develop policies to give real support to the industry, because at least the industry will benefit to the tune of $1.6 million by virtue of this legislation. That has only come about because of the intense lobbying by the industry of this government to change that formula with respect to Commonwealth funding. The funds that were originally allocated under those initiatives of the previous Labor government, such as the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy and other plans, are coming to an end or have ceased. This government has not established anything to replace that assistance. This $1.6 million is the only measure that has been announced so far, and it is clear that there is nothing more to come.</para><para>As I said, this minister and this government stand condemned for their failure to support the timber industry, the wood and forest products industry. It was the previous Labor government, through the National Forest Policy Statement, that established the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy, the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation and the RFA process and brought some harmony back to what was a very divisive industry and a very divisive issue. But since Minister Tuckey has come to this portfolio, through his actions and many of his statements, he has turned all that on its head. The only thing that Minister Tuckey can claim credit for, and I do not think he would want to claim credit for it, is that he has led to the establishment of a new political group—which you, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, are well aware of—the Liberals for Forests group. That is Mr Tuckey's legacy to this industry, and he should be condemned, as I am sure many of his colleagues privately agree.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>—That was a small `l' liberal, I think, Senator Forshaw.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—Because of Mr Tuckey's failures in this industry, his remaining time is short.

On the face of it, it is meant to help real research and development of that industry. When it was established, the fund, which is the basis of the legislation we are dealing with, was to have as its primary focus the rural side of that industry. The explanation given during the debates on the bill which introduced this provision in 1993 stated:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Commonwealth funding is intended to match the rural half of the industry contribution, consistent with arrangements for research and development in other rural industries.</para></quote><para>Now that is being matched by a component which is for the manufacturing oriented component of the forest products industry. That in itself might not have been so bad if in fact it were being specifically tailored to go to innovative plantation based aspects of the industry with downstream processing, but it is not. This is simply a means of moving more funds into the arena of native forest logging in Australia and also propping up what looks to be a plantation industry with real problems. I will be asking the government about that industry in the committee stage of the bill.</para><para>However, looking at the use of the existing fund, I have real concerns. Some of the current projects that are being funded could hardly be described as research and development. For example, one from Melbourne University was called `promoting the science of sustainable management of native forests', and the objectives included `to form an association of scientists who understand and have contributed to sustainable management of Australia's native forests'. That effectively, if you ask me, means to fund a lobby group who are involved in the destruction of native forests, and I will be asking the government representative in the committee stage what has been the outcome there in terms of research and development—exactly where the research and development of that industry organisation has been developed and to what end.</para><para>Another example is a quest to be involved in `dyeing eucalypt veneer to increase its value and marketability'. The objectives here include `to investigate the profitability of establishing a veneer dyeing plant in Tasmania'. That request came from Cassino Timbers, but it appears on the face of it to be a direct request for a subsidy for a commercial venture. One has to ask the government exactly what is the intent here, who is leading whom, to what degree is fashion—in terms of veneer colouring and dyeing—being addressed in that particular quest for a subsidy and what has been the outcome.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, because this does affect the logging industry right across the board, it is a very important opportunity to question the government about protecting people from a potential collapse of their investment in the plantation sector. You and I and everybody else here are aware that there has been prodigious advertising to get people to invest—sometimes with a primary motive being tax breaks—in the plantation industry in recent years. However, a recent Ausnewz study showed that `there is bound to be ongoing downward pressure on price' for hardwood pulpwood. Studies by Judy Clark at the ANU and others have indicated that the much vaunted shortfall in wood supply in the near future around the globe and in the region is simply not going to eventuate. I am very concerned about that. In fact, Christine Milne, consulting from my office, wrote to ASIC in Melbourne earlier this month, on 8 June. That letter states:</para><quote><para>Dear Sir,</para><para>I write with regard to Australia's listed plantation sector and what appears to be a grave situation for investors. Earlier this year the Timber Investment Managers Association hired a public relations firm and launched a major advertising campaign to try to portray the industry as a sound, long term investment delivering benefits to regional economies. This public campaign was in response to the collapse in investor confidence in their stocks.</para><para>At the same time industry analyst Ausnewz released a study suggesting that prices for hardwood pulpwood are likely only to go down in the future as increased plantation supplies in Australia, Chile, China, Vietnam and South Africa outpace the lift in demand after 2010. Its conclusion was that “there is bound to be ongoing downward pressure on price.”</para></quote><para>The letter from Christine Milne goes on:</para><quote><para>In spite of the public relations effort and the taxation benefits of investment in plantations, it has been clear from media reports that the sales and profits forecasts for several tree companies will not be met.</para><para>In view of the collapse of HIH and One Tel in recent weeks, I write to draw your attention to developments within the plantation sector and to request that you:</para><para>a) investigate whether there have been any breaches of the law, especially with respect to share trading by directors and trading whilst insolvent,</para><para>b) consider taking action as a matter of urgency to warn potential investors of the risks, especially given the approaching end of the financial year and the 100% tax deductibility of the investment, and the implicit support given to the sector through the government's endorsement of the “2020 Vision” to treble Australia's plantation estate.</para></quote><para>These are very serious matters. </para><para>Let us look at some specifics in the industry with which this bill deals. Firstly, with Great Southern Plantations Ltd, we find that Helen Sewell cashed in most of her holding of 25 million shares, or about 18 per cent of the company, in March-April this year. Company founding director John Young said that the fact that the stock had been picked up by institutions, including the Commonwealth Bank, reflected the stock's strong investment case, which included another forecast big lift in bluegum woodlot sales this financial year from $76 million to $90 million. He basically said, `Things have never looked as good.' Although he said that he had sold none of his shares, a more recent report indicates that both he and Ms Sewell sold down their personal stakes to institutions, including Colonial First State. On 1 June, John Young issued a profit warning, admitting that the 2001 result would be below forecast and that the company was unlikely to meet its full year's sales target of $90 million. The share price thereupon tumbled 29.7 per cent.</para><para>The question arises: on what basis were investors persuaded to invest when the founder or founders were selling out? Ms Sewell claimed that her retirement as an executive at Great Southern coincided with a `full circle', signing a heads of agreement with two major Japanese companies, Daio Paper Company and Nichimen Company, to buy and process all the woodchips it could produce. This implies contractual and attractive pricing arrangements—presumably, the big lift in bluegum woodlot sales to which John Young was referring in April. However, it is now apparent from the end of year forecasts that this just is not the case. The question is: was it ever the case that the heads of agreement included the pricing and contractual arrangements that would have guaranteed markets and financial returns and, as such, influenced investment decisions?</para><para>A second case is Forest Enterprises Australia, which has been very active in my home state of Tasmania. Not only is the managing director currently charged with being knowingly concerned in an unregistered managed investment scheme and offering for subscription securities without a registered prospectus, but the company has so far failed to secure the $17½ million lifeline that it said it needed to end its cash crisis. In fact, the American potential assurers there have withdrawn. Already the company has stalled in finalising contracts with farmers who in some cases had begun to remove infrastructure in preparation for sale to the company. Forest Enterprises Australia is seeking to raise $20 million through its 2001 woodlot project, and it has an extension until the end of this month in a bid to gain more investors.</para><para>Timbercorp, a third company, applied for tax office permission to extend product rulings over its eucalypt, olive and almond projects until the end of June. Fourthly, Australian Plantation Timber extended its 2001 eucalypt project until 16 June and was forced to issue a supplementary prospectus clarifying assumptions about future timber prices. In the case of Forestry Tasmania, Forestry Tasmania Trees Trust is a matter about which ASIC had been advised previously. The minister or ASIC has advised that this trust is immune from Corporations Law because it is operated by the Crown in Tasmania.</para><para>In view of the general concerns that I have just enumerated in respect of the plantation sector, in my opinion it is an obvious job for ASIC to take action to warn prospective investors of the risk. Forestry Tasmania is forecasting real returns after 10 years equivalent to 10½ to 12.9 per cent per year, which appears to be very much contrary to experience of the sector as a whole. I am very worried about investors in this once prodigious plantation industry. I refer you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to the government's own consultants, Jaakko Poyry, who earlier this year reported:</para><quote><para>With [a] background of oversupply and under-utilisation in many regions (eg. Bombala, North Queensland, Oberon, Tumut, Latrobe, Green Triangle), the concept of trebling Australia's plantation area under Vision 2020—</para></quote><para>that is Minister Tuckey's program—</para><quote><para>is confounding particularly for small private growers trying to access the market.</para></quote><para>Many private growers can correctly ask: why is the government supporting expansion when they cannot sell what they now have? That is a very serious situation. Yet the prospectuses are still going out inveigling people to invest in this plantation industry to get the tax breaks on the basis that there is a looming wood shortage somewhere around the world or the region, when it is patently obvious from the facts that that is not the case. That promotion requires a very rapid answer from the government, indeed from the Prime Minister, as well as from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.</para><para>In this legislation to promote research and development in this area, the funds that are involved should be confined to research and development in the plantation sector—not in the native forest industries, where the majority of Australians want the chainsaws withdrawn. If we are going to do research and development in that area, then we should follow the exemplary example of the new Western Australian government: it should be into the job reach and investment reach industries of hospitality, accommodation, tourism and recreation which, along with other ancillary industries, give a much better return when we keep our forests standing instead of putting them on a truck and sending them off to a woodchip mill where the jobs are created overseas. </para><para>To that end, I want to flag to the Senate an amendment which would effectively mean that the research and development funds which are being put aside or extended through this piece of legislation would go to plantations established before 1990—that is, the mature plantation sector that was put there without the loss of forest coverage which has gone on at a great rate since 1990—and exclude the awesome amount of plantations which have replaced native forests since 1990, which has been a phenomenal injustice to the Australian environment, a plundering of Australia's heritage and of course a stupid policy if you look at global warming. Replacing the biggest carbon banks in the Southern Hemisphere, our natural forests, with plantations is a detrimental thing to do if you are looking at trying to keep carbon out of the atmosphere. It will increase the impost on future generations as they try to handle the great economic, environmental and social dislocation and damage that is to come out of global warming. These are important questions. I know that the government will want to answer the questions that I have put up. I will be pursuing them in the committee stage. I also ask senators to look very carefully at the amendment I have framed, which makes some sense out of extending another $1.6 million into research and development in the forest industries.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>24425</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to thank the Labor Party for their support of this legislation and to make some summing up remarks. As has been pointed out, the purpose of this bill is to remove an anomaly that has existed in the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 since 1994. That anomaly meant that the Commonwealth matched industry contributions for forest research and development at half the rate at which it matches levy contributions from all other primary industries. The bill repeals two clauses in the act that specify a special funding arrangement for forest research and development from the Commonwealth at one dollar from the Commonwealth for every two dollars from industry up to a maximum of 0.25 per cent of gross value of production. </para></talk.start><para>The effect of this bill is to provide, from July 2001, government funding to the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation at the same rate as is provided to other research and development corporations under the act—that is, dollar for dollar matching of industry levy contributions up to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of gross value for production. The Commonwealth is effectively doubling its contribution to the forest industry. The forest and wood products industry contributes about one per cent to Australia's gross domestic product. It employs some 80,000 people directly and a further 194,000 people indirectly. Its activities are focused in regional Australia. The forest and wood products sector plays a crucial role in the economic and social health of rural and regional Australia.</para><para>In 1999-2000, Australia imported $3.8 billion worth of forest and wood products, mainly paper and high value products, and we exported $1.6 billion worth of products, mainly woodchips and round wood. With our extensive forest resources there is tremendous potential to export a range of high value products and progressively reverse the current imbalance of trade in forest and wood products. World demand for forest and wood products continues to grow, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.</para><para>By increasing the Commonwealth government's contribution to forest research and development, the bill provides a much more secure footing for continuing investment in national and strategic research and development into resource management, production, processing, transport, marketing and usage of forest and wood products. This R&amp;D is vital if the industry is to take full advantage of emerging opportunities to add value to our native timber resources and develop new opportunities for our expanding plantation base. The bill is one of a series of actions undertaken by this government to support a sustainable, competitive and innovative forest and wood products industry in Australia. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>24426</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>24426</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—During my speech in the second reading debate, I raised a number of matters.

I also asked about a veneer dyeing proposal by a company in Tasmania and for the specific details as to why that was necessary and what the outcome was, why the government should be funding what is essentially a commercial operation there, who was going to do that piece of research, and what the outcome was expected to be.</para><para>I also asked the minister about investment in plantations, and I read out quite a detailed letter to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. I would be very pleased to have a response from the minister as to whether the government is alert to changing fortunes in the plantations industry; whether it is concerned about prospectuses that continue to indicate a looming shortfall in world wood demand, when that is not the case at all; and whether the minister is aware that, at least in one company, the founding directors have sold out to other entities, even though they are in the business of asking investors to buy into that company. </para><para>I asked the minister whether she was aware that Forest Enterprises—which has been very contentious and has bought up prime farmlands in Tasmania that were otherwise used for beef, potato seed or other agricultural pursuits—is in financial trouble. Also, I asked if it is true that a potential extension of finance of nearly $20 million from the USA has now not come about; if it is true that 30 workers were shed or sacked from Forest Enterprises just last week; and if the government is aware of what is going on there but is not concerned for investors who are putting their money into that company or similar companies, including those promoted by Forestry Tasmania, Gunns and other corporations that are in the same business, which it seems is falling on harder times.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>24426</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—With regard to Senator Brown's comments on the direction of research and development and the nature of his amendment, I must point out that with the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, as with every other research and development corporation, the nature of research and development and the direction that it takes are determined by the board in terms of the projects that are put up to the board and the way in which the board looks at them. The board ultimately decides on the direction of the research and development. There would certainly be no direction to a research and development corporation as to the nature of the research and development. That is a matter for them to decide.</para></talk.start><para>Further, in relation to the commercial examples that have been quoted by Senator Brown, the government does not have detailed knowledge of those investment plans or those commercial operations. Senator Brown knows very well that, provided a company operates within corporate governance rules and that it is seen to be operating as a fit and proper company, those interests are to be taken into account by investors when they decide whether or not to invest in that company. Until they have a complaint lodged against them or flagrantly flout the rules of corporate governance in a way that the government would not approve of, all commercial entities are left to run their businesses in the way they see fit.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>24427</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I draw the minister's attention to the recent collapse of HIH and One.Tel. Is it not a matter of regret that there was no intervention at an earlier stage in both those cases? In view of those very damaging corporate failures, is it not the government's business to make sure, in the shareholders' interests, that ASIC and other business watchdog entities are on alert, that the minister is aware and that the Prime Minister is noting that there are some worrying signs in the plantation industry which is currently advertising prodigiously for investors, as it has done in recent years, particularly because of the tax breaks? We have to understand that this is not something that is completely divorced from government. The government is offering, and supports, those tax breaks. The 2020 vision propounded by the minister, Mr Tuckey, is aimed at tripling the area of plantations by the year 2020. This is a government driven proposal and that fact is being quoted in many of the prospectuses.</para></talk.start><para>The government needs to look at this again. It is not an arms-length case at all; the government is very much involved. It has been driving the promotion of plantations across farmlands and the replacement of woodlands on private and crown lands in Australia. I am saying: take stock here; there are warning signs. I do not say that lightly, and it is not just me saying it. The financial press, which I quoted from in my presentation, has also noted this. I say to the government and to the Prime Minister: do not leave Minister Tuckey in complete command here, because there are other things to look at. The government should take stock because a lot of investors are putting their money into the plantation alternative because it has been presented so attractively. There are warning signs and the Prime Minister needs to note them. I ask the minister to draw my comments to the Prime Minister's attention; it is as important as that.</para><para>Of course, I will be following this up, but I expect the government to heed what I am saying. This is a very serious matter indeed. However, on the particular matters at hand, I do not believe that the government can simply say to a board, `Well, it's totally up to you.' The legislation has limitations on where the money can go. In the case of Cassino Timbers and Mr David Geason in Tasmania, and the funding of a project for the dyeing of eucalypt veneer to increase its value and marketability, I wonder if the minister can say whether that is not a direct commercial venture? Questions immediately arise, like: who has the rights over that process; how much has been invested in it, and what sort of watch over that is the board taking; what is the aim of that particular process; and is it because the veneer is being sold into Italy where they like a paler sort of veneer, or is it because it is going to North America where they like it a little more heavily coloured? On the face of it, it looks like this is purely a commercial operation to meet a passing style or fashion. It is very reasonable for me to ask the minister about that investment of taxpayers' funds. Before I allow the minister to respond, I would like to move my amendment which has now been circulated:</para><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 4), before item 1, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">1A  At the end of Division 3</inline></para><para>Add:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">27A  Restriction on certain R&amp;D plans and annual operational plans</inline></para><quote><para>		An R&amp;D plan under section 19 and an annual operational plan under section 25 made or varied on or after 1 July 2001 by an R&amp;D Corporation established in respect of forest industries must relate only to industries using wood from plantations established on land cleared before 1990.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>24428</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Brown knows full well that the corporate collapses to which he referred do not have any bearing on this particular legislation. In terms of the discussion today in the Senate, any discussion of them would be quite irrelevant. However, I wish to tell Senator Brown that I have the oversight of 12 of the research and development boards in the agriculture portfolio, including this board. Just as commercial companies are bound by rules of corporate governance, so too is every one of the government's research and development corporations. The boards are fully aware of the types of projects which they may look at under their charter rules and, indeed, I frequently remind them of that in my many meetings with them. So I have every confidence that the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation would be bearing those rules of corporate governance in mind when they look at projects. I am unaware of the detail of the project in Tasmania to which Senator Brown referred. However, certainly the board, in its wisdom, will make a decision which research and development projects it supports and which it does not support. With that in mind, the government will not be supporting Senator Brown's amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>24428</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to ask the government a question about what is proposed in the <inline ref="R1240">Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 2001</inline>. I do support the bill's proposition to increase the amount of government money going into research and development in the forest industry. But what has R&amp;D expenditure achieved so far? This is an important aspect of this debate. I would be interested to know the government's assessment of the success achieved thus far and the government's assessment of the type of work that has been done thus far.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown raised the issue of an application for the dyeing of veneer. To the best of my knowledge, a reasonable amount of money was spent some years ago on researching this. Indeed, timber was sent to Italy to conduct this research. I do recall the results of that research into dyeing veneer. The idea was not necessarily to get a paler veneer; it was to impregnate a colour. The traditional method of dyeing involves rubbing a stain on the wood that is only very thin. Dyeing the wood by impregnating it goes much deeper and means you can rub the furniture or whatever back time and again and it still has the same colour. If this is a funding application for new money, I, like Senator Brown, would be very interested in ascertaining why funding for such a project would be sought, because much of that work has been done.</para><para>This brings to bear a question about the corporate ownership of R&amp;D work. Who does this work belong to? In my state, over the years, a lot of research work has been done and tens of millions of dollars have been spent on research and development work in the timber industry for very little return. I turn to the minister's speech, which says:</para><quote><para>R&amp;D on forest and wood products are vital if Australia is to reverse the current trade imbalance in trade in these products.</para></quote><para>I agree totally with the minister. The speech continues:</para><quote><para>Forest R&amp;D have the potential to create sustainable long-term competitive advantage for the industry, particularly for higher value products.</para></quote><para>I ask the government: in the last 10 years, have there been great leaps forward in providing a sustainable long-term competitive advantage to industry in this country as a result of R&amp;D work funded by both government and industry? I think the R&amp;D work has been done but not much has come of it. The industry's argument used to be, `We're not going to invest, because we don't have resource security.' Resource security was brought to this industry through the RFA process, yet there has been no trend of developments in higher value products.</para><para>In my state, there has been one development, and not as a result of any R&amp;D done in this country. I am talking about an MDF plant, which is struggling. Outside that, there was research into kiln drying, sawing techniques, dyeing of veneer, veneer slicing, peeling and laminated veneer lumber—you could go on ad infinitum. But very little has been done in terms of the industry putting its money where its mouth is, and that is what has to change. The government of the day must be prepared to ensure that, where both publicly and privately funded research and development work is done, we get outcomes as a result of that research work. It is all well and good for the government to commit funding to these sorts of programs, but it must ensure that. I quote the minister again:</para><quote><para>This Government is actively encouraging rural industries to move towards a `whole-of-chain' approach—</para></quote><para>this is a new phrase, and I thought I knew all the phrases in the forest industry—</para><quote><para>to industry planning and development. Whole-of-chain planning encompasses sustainable resource use,—</para></quote><para>that is a joke—</para><quote><para>production, processing, storage, transport, marketing and usage ...</para></quote><para>I do not mind supporting a whole-of-chain approach, but I want to make sure that it is right. It is not right at the moment for sustainable resource use—not by a long way.</para><para>I challenge AFFA, the department for which the minister is responsible, to have a look at the information, video footage and photographs that I have that clearly demonstrate that this industry is not operating on a sustainable basis. Then, perhaps, we will begin to see changes at a government level that will drive this industry to where it ought to be, and that is on a sustainable footing. This industry should be generating new developments, and it can, with the research that has already been done. The research that has already been done is sufficient for us to get into industries to produce products that we can send into the marketplace. There is the potential for us to develop things.</para><para>Senator Brown was talking about the plantation industry. Today, there is a company in Queensland that can produce laminated veneer lumber in a continuous length form from 19-year-old plantation timber. The great bulk of plantations put in the ground today and the great bulk of those put in the ground in the last five years, at least, are genetically modified to the extent that they will not be suitable for solid timber products.</para><para>I notice one of the advisers shaking his head at that. I suggest that that adviser get a bit of advice on this, because that happens to be the reality: most of the plantations being put in the ground today are for paper production. They are fibre length, and the lignin and cellulose factors of those particular types of trees are going to make them less suitable—not totally unsuitable, but far less suitable—for solid wood timber production for the types of areas that we could get into for higher value products and for more jobs. That is the reality, yet the government, through the taxation system, is allowing those plantations to be planted in significant areas. There is nothing wrong with that; that should be the case. But we should be able to ensure that we are putting those trees in the ground for the right purposes. Of course, we absolutely do need some for pulp and paper production.</para><para>There is no strategy out there at the moment, and if we are going to have this whole-of-chain approach then we ought to get on and have it. If this bill is about ensuring that we have greater R&amp;D capacity and about getting a whole-of-chain approach, I challenge the government to get on and do the job, and drive the industry in the right direction. You have companies out there right now that put plantations in the ground that have never been involved in the timber industry in their lives before. They thought up an idea about how they could get their hands on a significant area of land as an asset for themselves. That is a major problem, because that does not lend itself to the betterment of the Australian timber industry.</para><para>The quicker the government realises that that is the case, the better off we will all be—the better off the timber industry will be and the more jobs that will be created in it. It is not just going to be a simple process of standing here and making some announcement about additional R&amp;D money. This industry has a history of not being able to manage itself and head itself in the right direction. It was the case when we were last in government, and it is the case now. Until somebody in government is prepared to take the direction and head this industry the way it should be going—and stop copping the pathetic excuses it keeps coming up with year in, year out—it will go nowhere. All the government of the day will be doing is throwing good money after bad. It will be a wasted effort.</para><para>I think I saw the parliamentary secretary nod in acceptance of the fact when I said that in my state alone there have been tens of millions of dollars put into research and development. Yet when I was secretary of the Timber Workers Union we had more jobs in the timber industry than we have today. We had 35 crown sawmills in Tasmania at that time. We now have one principal owner of the only remaining crown sawmills. There are probably only about five separate crown sawmill owners in Tasmania. There were over 200 registered small sawmills in my state, and I would bet London to a brick—I have not done a count in recent times—that now you would be lucky to find 30. That has to tell any government something.</para><para>It has to tell you something when the Prime Minister of today, before he became Prime Minister, called the former Prime Minister the king of woodchip exports. It was a trend that he was going to reverse. It is a trend that he has not reversed—he has only increased the record. I say to the government that there is a challenge here to get in and do something with this industry. In fact, it is a challenge not only for the federal government but also for state governments. I hope that they will do something, because I have a great deal of faith in this industry being able to do a great deal for this country but it will not until it is given proper guidance. That does mean some form of intervention in terms of steering it in the right direction. Whilst I support this bill because it does increase the contribution to R&amp;D, it is not going to go anywhere near bringing in the minister's whole-of-chain approach to industry planning and development—no way.</para><para>The minister also said he has an action agenda to engender a more innovative and outward looking industry on a whole-of-chain basis. I say to Minister Tuckey: give me some evidence that that is happening; let me see that that is the case—because it simply is not. I would ask again of the parliamentary secretary: give me some evidence of where all of the money that has been spent in the last 10 years on R&amp;D—and there has been a not inconsiderable amount—has actually delivered some real outcomes. I do not want outcomes like, as I said, an MDF plant in Tasmania, because that R&amp;D was done a long time ago, more than 10 years ago. MDF is not a new process. I would appreciate some response from the parliamentary secretary.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>24430</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will just respond to Senator Murphy. If you consider that the board and the corporation have been in existence for some six to seven years, before that time research and development were not contributed to by government—it was industry application money. Perhaps, Senator Murphy, you should go back and ask the timber industry, which you know so well, what some of the outcomes were from that pre-government type contribution. I should also point out that the Forest and Wood Products Board will be putting out a press release tomorrow, I believe, to talk about the new project which it has approved for its R&amp;D programs. Senator Murphy, much of the work of the board is detailed in its annual report, which I recommend to you.</para></talk.start><para>Some of the corporation's programs are in market development, which would seem to indicate a use for timber products; new products and processes, and this may well encompass some other things that you were talking about; resource improvement and development; and human resource development. There is also an industry forum in November 2001 to discuss industry development issues—including research that might be necessary to support new investment in the industry—and also a new direction from the National Timber Development Council. That is what industry is doing.</para><para>In relation to what the government is doing, I would point out to you that in the innovation package, which was announced by the Prime Minister in January 2001, amongst that $2.9 billion over five years there were two cooperative research centres for the timber industry for functional communication services in high value paper products and innovative wood manufacturing worth $30 million over seven years. There was also of course the increased funding to the Research and Development Corporation through this bill.</para><para>I also point out to Senator Murphy that, with regard to his comments on 2020 Vision and with regard to the development of plantations—and this goes for Senator Brown as well—he rightly observed one of the advisers in the box nodding because there are actually increasing markets for that sort of product, not declining markets. Perhaps you should produce some of the evidence for your comments.</para><para>I believe that the research and development by the Forest and Wood Products RDC is well documented through its annual reports—which it must be because that is its way of reporting to parliament. Considering the relatively new nature of the Research and Development Corporation for the forest and wood products industry, it has already made great strides in the research and development it does, and it will continue to do so.</para><para>If you are talking about investor confidence and the way in which people are prepared to invest in the industry, I can only say that the failure of the parliament to pass the <inline ref="R555">Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998</inline> last year—which, you remember, we debated in this chamber for a fortnight and the bill emerged in a form that was totally unacceptable to the government—certainly shook some of the certainty with which investors would look at the timber industry. It is up to your party just as much as the government to underpin the sort of investment in the timber industry that will lead to further downstream processing.</para><para>With regard to the matter of intellectual property that is being developed by all research and development corporations in the research and development projects that they do, there is a certain amount of intellectual property generated by that. My department, as a result of discussions with the research and development corporations, is actively looking at that as an issue and at the way in which we may manage it in the future. I assure you that that is under consideration.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>24431</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That is not good enough. Actively looking at who has this property when it is the taxpayers' money that is being invested into it is very much short of the mark. We should have an answer to that. The government should have a prescription, to say the least. That indicates that, at least thus far, the intellectual property is lost as far as the taxpayers are concerned. If it is not, the secretary might like to outline to the committee how it is not.</para></talk.start><para>I want to come back to the matter of promoting the 2020 Vision, which will triple the plantation stock in Australia by the year 2020, and the way in which that is being used to get investors to put their money into this industry. Does the parliamentary secretary really mean it when she says that the continued use of the 2020 Vision, which was released by Deputy Prime Minister Anderson in 1997 and which is now being promoted around the country by Minister Tuckey, has no influence on investors when they are looking at the alternatives as to where to put their money? Does she really believe that the ministerial imprimatur and the high-level publicity attendant on that being used by the companies which are getting investors to put their money into plantations does not give the investors a sense of security? The question before the committee right now is: has the government not had reason to review that? If the market is on the upward trend, would the secretary please give the committee the evidence for that here and now?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>24431</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We did cover this subject earlier and I have nothing to add to my comments then.

The parliamentary secretary is not listening. The point here is that the government is putting its imprimatur on to this industry at a time when investors are being inveigled into investing—by tax breaks, amongst other things—through prodigious advertising of that imprimatur by the minister. It is not just a matter for the market; it is a market being promoted directly by the Howard government and Minister Tuckey. Investors are being inveigled by Minister Tuckey through the 2020 Vision statement. This is in prospectuses still widely circulating. I ask the secretary how she can possibly believe that has nothing to do with the government? The government is involved in it: very much so. There has been no review of this involvement. In fact, this involvement has been wound up since Prime Minister Howard appointed Minister Tuckey to the Forestry and Conservation portfolio.</para></talk.start><para>What I am asking is this: will she draw this matter of warning signs in this industry, and the letter that Christine Milne has sent to ASIC, to the Prime Minister's attention? It is a very important matter. It is investors' money that is involved here. It is government imprimatur that is being seen by those investors when they look at those prospectuses. It is also the attractiveness, through government decision, of tax breaks in the plantation industry that is bringing many investors in. Under those circumstances, there is a very heightened government responsibility to have an eye out for warning signs when they occur. They are occurring, and I ask the parliamentary secretary to draw that to the Prime Minister's attention pronto.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>24432</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Brown is probably very well aware that the 2020 Vision was developed as a result of consultation and agreement between Commonwealth, state and industry representatives.

I will, in breach of standing orders, read the first of the second reading speeches. I say by way of introduction that, in this year when we celebrate the 100th anniversary of our island continent's states coming together to form the Commonwealth of Australia, our states have come together again to deliver a single, national governance scheme for our nation's companies. The <inline ref="R1247">Corporations Bill 2001</inline> and the <inline ref="R1248">Australian Securities and Investments Commission Bill 2001</inline> form a historical package of legislation that will finally deliver with certainty a single national regulatory regime governing the affairs of more than one million companies. The bills address legal uncertainties created by recent decisions of the High Court of Australia, by obtaining from the states a full referral of power.</para></talk.start><para>The High Court decisions represented a serious threat to the national corporate regulation framework and to business confidence. Indeed, pending cases before the court threaten the very existence of companies established under the Corporations Law. These problems come at a time when, more than ever, Australian business must compete internationally and when they rely on global markets for capital. At the same time, Australia is positioning itself as a global financial centre and it is impossible to sell a message of global regulatory leadership when our own regulation exists with such and much uncertainty. This uncertainty surrounding corporate regulation also affects Australia's ability to generate wealth and create jobs. The Commonwealth is confident that the agreement reached with the states will enable the uncertainty to be overcome by permitting the establishment of a scheme that is constitutionally secure and responsive to domestic and international policy pressures. To understand the context of the bills, it is necessary to consider the history of corporate regulation in Australia over the last 20 years.</para><para>From 1982, corporate regulation in Australia was based on a system of state, Northern Territory and Commonwealth legislation known as the `cooperative scheme'. It represented a significant advance on the legislative and regulatory regimes that have grown in a somewhat haphazard fashion from the uniform company laws of the 1960s. However, it had a number of deficiencies. It was a regime in which no parliament, no government and no minister had responsibility and accountability for the operation of the scheme. It failed to meet the need for a truly national approach, which was required particularly in the securities and futures industries. It did not cope with rapid changes in the corporate world, and it proved unable to address with the necessary vigour the corporate wrongdoing of the 1980s.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Nick (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Sherry)</inline>—Senator Ian Campbell, do you wish to seek leave to incorporate the remainder of your speech and the other speeches for the related bills?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—Yes.

However, a number of States successfully challenged the validity of aspects of the legislation in the High Court.</para><para>Fortunately, it was recognised by all parties that a replacement scheme needed to be established that would address the serious administrative difficulties with that scheme.  Less than five months later, in June 1990 at Alice Springs, the outline of a new scheme was settled.  Under the scheme, the Corporations Law is contained in an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament (the Corporations Act 1989), which was enacted as a law for the Australian Capital Territory.  Separate laws of each State and the Northern Territory applied the Corporations Law of the Australian Capital Territory as a law of that State or the Northern Territory.  As a result, changes made from time to time to the Corporations Law automatically apply throughout Australia.</para><para>Until various successful High Court challenges to the scheme, which I shall refer to shortly, it operated in a seamless fashion as a single national scheme, even though it is actually a system of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws that applies in each State and the Northern Territory as a law of that State or Territory.</para><para>The Corporations Law is administered generally by a Commonwealth body, ASIC, established under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989.  Each State and the Northern Territory has passed legislation applying relevant provisions of that Act, and also conferring functions relating to the administration and enforcement of the Corporations Law on, among others, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Federal Police.</para><para>The Corporations Agreement provided for the ongoing participation of the States and Northern Territory in corporate regulation, in recognition of the split of legislative responsibility for company law between State and federal governments.  Specifically, consultation and approval mechanisms in relation to amendments to the Corporations Law were included in the Agreement.</para><para>To enhance the national character and seamless nature of the scheme, the legislation contained `cross-vesting' provisions.  These provisions established an efficient system of adjudication by, among other things, allowing federal courts to exercise relevant State jurisdiction and vice versa.  Courts and litigants were freed from arid jurisdictional disputes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">High Court decisions</inline></para><para>It is widely accepted that the current scheme has worked well.  For a decade, Australian business has greatly benefited from the stability and uniformity that the Corporations Law provided.  However, regardless of the efficiency and efficacy of the Corporations Law, recent legal challenges and decisions of the High Court of Australia have cast doubt on the constitutional framework which support it.  These doubts have been identified by the High Court in two significant cases.</para><para>The first case was decided in June 1999.  The High Court decision in Re Wakim: Ex parte McNally invalidated the cross-vesting legislation involving the conferral of State jurisdiction on Federal Courts established by the Commonwealth Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987.  The High Court held by a majority that Chapter III of the Commonwealth Constitution does not permit State jurisdiction to be conferred on federal courts.  For the most part, this decision removed the ability of the Federal Court to resolve matters arising under the Corporations Laws of the States. This largely removed access to a forum for dispute resolution that was working very well.</para><para>In the second case, The Queen v Hughes, the High Court held that the conferral of a power coupled with a duty on a Commonwealth officer or authority by a State law, must be referable to a head of power under the Commonwealth Constitution.  This means that if a Commonwealth authority, such as the Director of Public Prosecutions or ASIC, has a duty under the Corporations Law, then that duty must be supported by a head of power in the Constitution.  This decision cast doubt on the ability of Commonwealth agencies to exercise some functions under the Corporations Law.</para><para>The decision in Hughes has significant implications for the Corporations Law scheme, and is likely to have an adverse impact upon its orderly administration and enforcement.  Hughes has cast doubt on the validity of some of the regulatory and enforcement functions performed by ASIC and the Commonwealth DPP in some significant circumstances.  A number of aspects of the Corporations Law may not be within Commonwealth legislative power.  These include the registration and incorporation of companies, and the regulation of bodies corporate other than trading and financial corporations (for example, non-operat-ing holding companies) and their officers.</para><para>The Hughes decision has been relied on to bring about  substantial delays in regulatory and enforcement processes, and to provide a basis for challenging ASIC's or the DPP's power to continue existing proceedings.  Plainly, there can be no national corporations scheme without effective enforcement.  Without remedial action, further and ongoing challenges to regulatory and enforcement actions taken by Commonwealth officers or authorities under the Corporations Law are inevitable.</para><para>The result is a serious threat to the national corporate regulation framework, and to business confidence.  In addition, further cases have threatened the existence of companies incorporated under the Corporations Law.  The Commonwealth is determined to prevent this from happening.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">New agreement with the States—reference</inline></para><para>At a joint meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Ministerial Council for Corporations in August 2000, it was agreed in principle that States would refer to the Commonwealth sufficient legislative power to enact the text of the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act.  In addition, the States would refer a power to amend that text in relation to the formation of companies, corporate regulation and the regulation of financial services and products.  It was also agreed that the reference should terminate after 5 years, unless extended by proclamation.</para><para>To the disappointment of the Commonwealth and the wider business community, consensus on the details of that agreement could not be reached.</para><para>A modified package of measures including the reference was developed and agreed between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria at a meeting between Heads of Government on 21 December 2000.  The reference ensures that the constitutional flaws in the existing scheme could be rectified, and dispels the damaging uncertainty which currently surrounds the Corporations Law.</para><para>At a meeting of Commonwealth and State ministers on 23 March 2001, Queensland and Western Australia agreed in principle to follow suit.  Negotiations are continuing to further consider South Australia's and Tasmania's outstanding concerns.  All States have agreed to work towards the 1 July target for commencement of the new Corporations Act.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Amendment power</inline></para><para>Both the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act are amended on a regular basis.  The Corporations Law scheme showed that a system that included approval of and consultation with the States on amendments to legislation was workable.  The Corporations Agreement provided that two jurisdictions were required to support an amendment proposed by the Commonwealth.</para><para>The States continue to have consultation and voting rights under the proposed new Corporations Agreement.  Further, the Commonwealth has accepted that these rights be enhanced in relation to voting on proposed amendments to corporate law.  As a result, the required number of States favourable to a proposed amendment will increase from two to three jurisdictions in areas where approval of the Ministerial Council is required.</para><para>In accepting this, the Commonwealth is mindful that Australia's position in the global marketplace depends on an effective, responsive and flexible regulatory framework.  The capacity to amend the new law quickly is crucial to the maintenance of a viable national law.  It would be extremely undesirable to create new concerns about an unresponsive amendment mechanism which would be an impediment to reform in a modern economy.  One of the major difficulties under the cooperative scheme applying prior to the Corporations Law was a diffusion of ministerial and parliamentary accountability for the legislative framework.  It would be highly undesirable to risk creating similar difficulties in the future as a result of alterations to the voting requirements in the Corporations Agreement.  These considerations were integral to the agreement of 21 December 2000.</para><para>Some States have proposed that the State reference legislation should include a mechanism allowing the amendment power to be `turned off', presumably with the result that any amendments made by the Commonwealth Parliament to the national law would not operate in that State.  Such a provision would be highly undesirable, particularly in view of the frequency with which the Corporations Law is amended.  The prospect of one jurisdiction withdrawing the power to amend, and different versions of the law operating in different jurisdictions, would be fatal to business confidence.  Uniformity of regulation was the keystone of the success of the Corporations Law.</para><para>Accordingly, the Corporations Agreement provides that a State may not terminate the reference by itself.  Instead, if four States vote to terminate the reference of the amendment power, the amendment reference will be terminated by all States at the same time.  Further, the Corporations Bill provides in effect that any State that otherwise terminates any aspect of its reference to the Commonwealth ceases to be a `referring State' for the purposes of the Bill.  This prevents the development of diverging regimes across Australia.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Other aspects of the reference agreement</inline></para><para>The agreement also incorporates a number of safeguards to meet State concerns about referring power to the Commonwealth.  An objects clause in the State reference legislation will include a provision to the effect that the referred powers are not to be used for the purpose of the Commonwealth regulating industrial relations.</para><para>The Corporations Agreement will specifically prohibit the use of the referred powers for the purposes of regulating industrial relations, the environment or any other matter unanimously agreed on by the parties to the Agreement.  Further, four States are able to reject an amendment that they agree is for a purpose outside the scope of the reference.</para><para>The Commonwealth is required to use best endeavours to ensure consultation and voting on parliamentary amendments and would be required to oppose, and refrain from moving, any such amendment that was outside the scope of the reference.  For their part, the States are required to put to a vote of the Ministerial Council any amendment to State/Territory law significantly overriding the new Act.</para><para>The Commonwealth's aim has always been to retain a national scheme of corporate regulation by ensuring that the new scheme operates in all the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.  These Bills I am introducing today represent the bulk of the Commonwealth legislation required for the new system.  With the introduction of this legislation, the Commonwealth has done all it can towards putting corporate regulation back on a firm constitutional footing, with a view to commencement of the new system not later than 1 July 2001.</para><para>New South Wales has already introduced and passed its reference legislation, enabling the introduction of these Bills here today.  I am firmly of the view that all governments should now proceed to enact their own reference legislation, in accordance with the framework I have outlined above.  That being said, these Bills are capable of operating in only those jurisdictions that have referred the necessary power to the Commonwealth.  It is to the clear benefit of all governments and Australian business that the new system operate nationally.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>Whilst my gratitude to the individuals involved in this development will be saved for the summary speech in this debate I do wish to take this opportunity to thank the Attorney General the Hon. Daryl Williams AM QC MP who deserves great credit for his work during this demanding period of negotiation.  I can think of no one more deserving of the title of Australia's First Law Officer.</para><para>The Commonwealth is confident that the agreement of 21 December 2000 will permit the establishment of a new system that will overcome the constitutional uncertainty in relation to the current Corporations Law scheme.  It will be capable of uniform and efficient administration and enforcement.</para><para>It is intended that the new scheme will have effect from 1 July 2001.</para><para>The Corporations Bill and Australian Securities and Investments Commission Bill, and the enactment of related State reference legislation, will ensure that our national system of corporate regulation is placed on a sound constitutional foundation.

The Corporations Bill and Australian Securities and Investments Commission Bill, and the enactment of related State reference legislation, will ensure that our national system of corporate regulation is placed on a sound constitutional foundation.</para><para>On 5 April 2001 the Senate referred the provisions of the new corporations legislation to the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities for inquiry and report.

This package of bills was made necessary by the decision of the High Court in Re Wakim and by questions raised by the High Court in Queen v. Hughes as to the constitutional underpinning of the Corporations Law. The 1999 decision in Re Wakim invalidated cross-vesting legislation conferring state jurisdiction on federal courts. This decision removed the capacity of the Federal Court to determine matters arising under the corporations laws of the states. It also removed the capacity of the Federal Court to determine matters arising under cooperative schemes. In Queen v. Hughes, decided in May last year, the High Court cast doubt on the ability of the Commonwealth agencies to perform some functions under the Corporations Law. It was thought this could possibly affect the powers of ASIC and the Commonwealth DPP to administer and enforce certain provisions of the Corporations Law. This will be a serious threat to the effective operation of the Corporations Law scheme and it is proper that remedial action be taken.</para></talk.start><para>By way of background, the current corporations scheme commenced on 1 January 1991. Under that scheme the Corporations Law is contained in an act of the Commonwealth parliament, the Corporations Act 1989, and is enacted for the Australian Capital Territory. The laws of each state and the Northern Territory then apply the Corporations Law of the Australian Capital Territory as a law of that state or of the Northern Territory—that is, the scheme was designed to operate as a single, national scheme but actually applies in each state and the Northern Territory as a law of each state or territory. The current scheme is also supported by the Corporations Agreement, an intergovernmental agreement to which the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory are parties. The agreement requires consultation and, in some cases, voting on amendments to the Corporations Law and related schemes legislation, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, by the ministerial council.</para><para>Following the decision in Queen v. Hughes, the government has now negotiated a new arrangement with the states whereby they will refer certain powers to the Commonwealth under section 51 of the Commonwealth Constitution. It is my expectation that the states will refer to the Commonwealth matters to which the <inline ref="R1247">Corporations Bill </inline>and the <inline ref="R1248">Australian Securities and Investments Commission Bill </inline>relate as well as an amendment reference. The amendment reference will enable the Commonwealth to amend the Corporations Bill and the ASIC Bill, once enacted, in relation to the formation of companies, corporation regulation and the regulation of financial services and products. The referral is for a period of five years unless it is extended by proclamation. I understand that every state has now either passed or introduced the necessary referring legislation, but perhaps the parliamentary secretary will be able to confirm this for us.</para><para>The Commonwealth and referring states will also enter a new corporations agreement. The agreement will differ from the existing agreement in the following ways: it will provide that, where the approval of the ministerial council is required for an amendment to the Corporations Act, the required number of jurisdictions favourable to the proposed amendment will increase from two approvals from six states to three approvals from six states and the Northern Territory. It will also provide that, before states vote to terminate the amendment reference, all referring states will terminate that reference. The bill itself provides that, if any state individually terminates the amendment reference, that state will cease to be a part of the new scheme. It will also have prohibitions on the use of the referred powers for the purposes of regulating industrial relations, the environment or any other matter unanimously agreed on by the parties to the agreement.</para><para>Further, four states are able to reject an amendment that they agree is for a purpose outside the scope of the reference. That is designed to make sure that the Commonwealth is not able to misuse a national corporations power to achieve objectives that most of us would see as being of a non-Corporations Law kind. It is certainly a concern that Minister Reith, when he was Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, fanned with suggestions that a national Corporations Law could be used to pursue the government's industrial relations agenda. </para><para>Two of the bills we are debating today—the <inline ref="R1247">Corporations Bill 2001</inline> and the <inline ref="R1248">Australian Securities and Investments Commission Bill 2001</inline>—have been considered by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities. Those bills are two fundamentally important pieces of legislation, and it was regarded as essential that there be some public scrutiny of those bills. It was responsible for parliament to assure itself that this legislation properly addressed the constitutional issues that have been raised by the High Court and provided the Commonwealth with the necessary powers to legislate in this area.</para><para>It is usual practice for important legislation to be examined by a parliamentary committee. The committee heard evidence from the Coalition for Corporate Certainty, which represented the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Business Council of Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, the Investment and Financial Services Association, the Law Council of Australia and the Securities Institute of Australia, that business had benefited greatly since the introduction in 1990 of a national uniform system of corporate regulation. Ms Kathleen Farrell, representing the Law Council, said:</para><quote><para>When, in 1990 and 1991, the scheme for corporate law was put in place, the Commonwealth and the states created an incredibly valuable asset. The degree to which business is facilitated by having this law in place cannot possibly be overrated. If you are a country as small as Australia is in the capital markets that it seeks to operate in, the law that you are dealing with that facilities business has to be as user friendly and simple and certain as it possibly can be.</para></quote><para>Ms Farrell also informed the committee that, although the legislation was not `particularly pretty in some respects ... it was constitutionally sound to effect the textual referral of the Corporations Law to the Commonwealth and to confer ... the power on the Commonwealth to amend that legislation'. That was reassuring. </para><para>There were, however, some critical comments on the new arrangements the government has negotiated. The Coalition for Corporate Certainty informed the committee that the proposed arrangements reflected compromises between the states and the Commonwealth. In particular, the Coalition for Corporate Certainty would have preferred that there was not a five-year sunset clause. As such, the new arrangements we are considering today are only a short-term solution. The Coalition for Corporate Certainty advised the committee that, once the referral legislation is in operation and stability returned to corporate law, it may be appropriate for a more permanent and simpler legal and constitutional solution to be considered. Mr Munchenberg, from the Business Council of Australia, said:</para><quote><para>It—</para></quote><para>that is, the legislation—</para><quote><para>is seen by us as an important but temporary resolution of the situation. It gives us a safety net that we can use to now move forward and try to work out a more permanent solution to these problems ...</para></quote><para>Professor Baxt informed the committee that this legislation does not address the problems still faced by other cooperative schemes. He told the committee:</para><quote><para>... this legislation does not pick up the problems that still face the Commonwealth and the states in making national competition policy work, because you still have the problems of the Federal Court and other courts simply not having powers in relation to competition cases—the access issues in relation to gas, et cetera.</para></quote><para>The committee considered—and I again endorse the views of the committee—that the Commonwealth should examine these other schemes and act to resolve any uncertainty surrounding these schemes. </para><para>The committee was advised by officers from the Attorney-General's Department, and I was advised by staff of the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, that these bills did not change the substance of the law. Mr Faulkner, from the Attorney-General's Department, told the committee:</para><quote><para>I think the first point of substance really is that fundamentally what would be established by the new legislation is the re-establishment of the regulatory environment that everyone thought existed before the decisions in Wakim and Hughes. The plan is not to make any substantive changes to the law. This is not an exercise to tidy up policy shortcomings that might be perceived in the law; it is simply to put what we have got on a secure, legal foundation.</para></quote><para>I understand that is the intention of this legislation—simply to re-enact the current Corporations Law as a single federal law of national application. It was then with some alarm and surprise that I read an article by Alan Cameron, the former chairman of ASIC, which said that there were some substantive changes from the redrafting of some provisions and the correction of incorrect cross-references. He wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 11 May 2001:</para><quote><para>A chapter of the explanatory memorandum is devoted to detailing the correction of anomalies and the changes in drafting style. I had not been aware previously that the law had two sections 252L(1A): the second is to become 252L(lB). A similar phenomenon and similar solution occur at 1317s (2) (a). Nor has the drafting been timid. Numerous sections have been `re-written without any change in effect'—always a bold claim when lawyers are involved. There is clearly substance in some changes. The amendments to 601 FC(3) and FE(2) provide that the duties a responsible entity has as trustee of a scheme's assets, and the duties its directors have not to use their positions improperly, prevail over duties that a director of a responsible entity has under part 2D.l. </para></quote><para>I understand that there may be consequential legislation to correct for the change referred to by Mr Cameron, and I am looking forward to the parliamentary secretary clarifying some of these issues when we go into committee. </para><para>As I said, I will be seeking an understanding from the parliamentary secretary either that there have been no substantial changes to the legislation or that consequential legislation has been introduced or is to be introduced to remedy these problems. I would also like to comment on the changes in the voting rights of the states. This is not an insubstantial change, and I would like to be kept informed if it frustrates the Commonwealth's attempts to legislate. </para><para>I should also note that, in an effort to assist the government, the committee conducted its inquiry as quickly and efficiently as possible. The committee reported on 18 May 2001; thus enabling the government to deal with the Corporations Bill in the very next sitting week following its introduction into parliament. However, the minister, despite protesting that the committee's inquiry would cause delay, did not debate these bills at the very next opportunity. Instead, on 24 May, the government introduced further related legislation—that being the other five bills we are dealing with today. I understand that those bills are necessary, but question why they were not introduced at the same time as the Corporations Bill and the ASIC Bill. As a result, the bills we are debating today were not debated in the House of Representatives until 6 June 2001. </para><para>It was unfortunate that the government did not introduce the whole package of bills at the same time, so that the committee could have considered all of these bills. It appears to be coming a habit of the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation to introduce related legislation in lots rather than simultaneously. This makes it much more difficult to assess the impact of the legislation. The minister appears to have exercised the same degree of mismanagement in relation to the <inline ref="R1256">Financial Services Reform Bill 2001</inline> as he has with the Corporations Bill. The FSR Bill was introduced on 5 April, and further legislation was introduced on 7 June.</para><para>Debate interrupted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>24441</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Job Network: Providers</title><page.no>24441</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>24441</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Alston, representing the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business.

It comes as a result of Telstra consulting widely over at least a 12-month period with some 400 groups and individuals. I think it has been a matter of ongoing concern. It was obviously in the too-hard basket for the Labor Party throughout that whole 13-year period as were things like untimed local calls in outer extended zones. They simply could not be bothered and did not do what they are threatening to do now, that is, to force Telstra to do it irrespective of the cost—in other words, to require them to undertake fundamentally uncompetitive activities. That seems to be the new approach of the Labor Party. I very much look forward to the detail of that when it is announced.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday's announcement related to a new 25c flat rate untimed call to lower the cost of a call from outer metropolitan areas to the cities—the inner suburbs and the CBD. It will commence on 1 August. Telstra estimates that it will benefit up to 170,000 maybe 200,000 customers and will save them up to $46 million a year. So it is clearly a very significant step forward. It is an option, so no-one by definition can be disadvantaged because they do not have to take it up. Telstra estimates that, using this new call option, the price of a 30-minute daytime phone call will fall from $3.22 to 25c. Similarly, one of the other announcements is in relation to those within 85 kilometres of regional areas. They can have a 99c flat rate call for up to three hours. That will dramatically reduce the cost of those calls under the previous long distance timed call arrangements. These changes have been welcomed by a wide variety of people—for example, Penrith's Labor mayor, David Bradbury. I gather Senator Hutchins knows him very well. He probably employs him still, does he? No.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—It is the other way round.

What is Labor's approach? Once again, they are going to have an independent inquiry. They have already announced inquiries into detention centres, Maralinga, FIRB, superannuation, the dairy industry, flood insurance, the very fast train and petrol pricing.

Each voter will only get one letter because all they need to be told is what you have to offer and that is it. Of course it will not be.

If you are opposed to people being told what is going on out there, say so.

You voted against them in the parliament, you have made it plain that you do not approve of people in rural areas getting those sorts of benefits and you have Mr Smith running around saying that they are bribes or sops to the bush.

But I can remember, for example, with the customer service guarantee that we made it an entitlement of people to get a rebate on their phone bills if their phones were not installed or fixed on time. What we found was that fewer than half of them claimed it because they did not know about it. There was a very significant benefit out there—and I am sure you were not out there telling them—so we actually had to make it compulsory for the carriers to pay those rebates as a matter of course. I think that demonstrates beyond doubt that you cannot simply assume that everyone knows what they are going to get from an announcement that the government might make or from some very significant programs that are very much in their interest, particularly when you lot are out there trying to ensure that they have the least possible understanding of these programs.

If the senator had been reading the budget papers or listening to anything the government was saying, he would have clearly understood that the payment to which he refers, which is just a part of the package for older Australians, is quite specifically designed to benefit older Australians. There are two ways you can deliver benefits: one through the pension system and one through the tax system. Its proper characterisation is assistance to older Australians, not to anybody else who might be on a benefit.</para></talk.start><para>With respect to people who are on disability support payments, they of course cover a very wide range of age groups with a very wide range of disabilities.

He understands, I am sure, that this payment is targeted to the elderly. It is not a payment to people who are simply on welfare and therefore is not expected to go to all other people who are on some sort of payment. But, Senator, since you raised the question of people on disabilities, you might be interested to look at other parts of the budget package that are particularly significant and helpful to those who are on that benefit including more places in employment, including a one per cent additional payment to the business centres, including more places in higher education—the whole gamut of things that come under the welfare reform program.

That any political party in this country encouraging parents to talk to their children about the evil of drugs is somehow condemned defies description. The people of Australia ought to understand that when people like Senator Faulkner get up in this place, asking for the detail about the Tough on Drugs campaign, they have in fact issued media releases condemning the money spent on that campaign.

Firstly, the assumption about price changes and residential care estimates is that they will be relatively low and stable. Secondly, since June 1994 the level of provisional allocations were reduced from over eight per cent of operational places to less than three per cent in January this year. This means we have a reduced backlog of places that were not yet operational since we have been in office.

And we have not seen the start of the Howard government's gratuitous advertising splurge yet. Mr Howard plans to spend some $20 million a month from now until October in a desperate attempt to save his political skin. The total by the end of the year—and this is a conservative estimate—will be $150 million and that does not of course include the genuine advertising campaigns on behalf of the government in areas such as the census, AEC for the election, Defence recruitment and the like.</para><para>We have a blatantly political pensioner bonus campaign running currently. That was not mentioned in the ATO, Prime Minister and Cabinet, or Family and Community Services estimates hearings the week before last. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has finally admitted that the placement costs alone for that campaign will be some $4.1 million. Probably the research and production costs will push the whole campaign to above $6 million. And that campaign advertises a $300 bonus that pensioners are going to receive automatically anyway in their own bank accounts.</para><para>Currently, in regional Australia there is the advancing Australian agriculture campaign. That is a $6 million TV based campaign which would have been better targeted through mail-outs and regional and rural newspapers for about an eighth of the cost. Then of course there is the $15 billion gap health insurance campaign that should be paid for, in our view, by the health insurance industry.</para><para>There are other campaigns to be conducted from August through to October. They include the $6.9 billion Telstra Besley response campaign, targeted at regional Australia; a $5 million campaign on the abolition of financial institutions duty, a state tax; and a $4.2 million campaign at the end of the year to promote Work for the Dole. All these advertising campaigns are either under way or about to start, and they are not genuine information campaigns. The government is trying to shore up its support base in key constituencies—amongst the farmers, the pensioners and the self-funded retirees, where they have lost support, and amongst the overwhelming number of people in rural and regional Australia who are so dissatisfied with the government's decision to fully privatise Telstra, a decision which was reinforced by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts yet again today. </para><para>But I do not believe that Australians will be fooled by this barrage of advertising. I think many will be angry at the fact that $150 million of their money will be spent before the next election campaign, promoting government programs totally inappropriately. It is no wonder that the government has refused to debate the private member's bill that Mr Beazley has introduced, which aims to rein in inappropriate government advertising by imposing the guidelines that were recommended by the Auditor-General in his recent report on political advertising. Mr Howard's last card is to try to advertise his way out of trouble, and the way he is doing that is by pouring hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money into the pockets of the television and advertising companies in a desperate attempt to save his own skin. It is inappropriate, it is a corruption of the process, and the government stands condemned for these campaigns. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>24455</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Listening to Senator Faulkner's contribution, one would have thought that the rules had changed—that the principles that this government uses when determining whether or not public information campaigns are appropriate are somehow different from the principles that were used by the former Labor government. What Senator Faulkner did not tell us was that they are precisely the same. This government, in its public information campaigns, operates under the very same guidelines, promulgated by the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications, as did the previous Keating Labor government. Allow me to read those guidelines. I think they express very effectively the philosophy behind government information campaigns, and they do make it clear where the line is to be drawn between information and propaganda. The guidelines read:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The government stresses—</para></quote><para>I pause to say that at the time these guidelines were written the then government was a Labor government, of which Senator Faulkner was a senior member—</para><motion><para>that all Australians have equal rights of access to information about programs, policies and activities that affect their benefits, rights and obligations. The government therefore expects all departments, agencies and authorities to carry out their public information programs based on the principles which guide all of the government's relations with the community: fairness and equity. All departments are required to conduct their public information programs at a level appropriate for their impact on the community, particularly where they concern the individual's benefits, rights and obligations.</para></motion><para>Those are the principles. They were good principles for the then government, of which Senator Faulkner was a member, they are good principles now, and they are the principles according to which the Howard government has conducted itself. </para><para>Senator Faulkner, in implicitly challenging the operation or the application of those principles, neglected one of the greatest sources of disadvantage and inequality in this country—inequality of access to information. There is a whole host of programs that the Commonwealth, the states and, for that matter, municipal governments run that are focused and targeted on categories of people who suffer specific identifiable disadvantage, whether it be borne of social inequality, of distance, of inability to communicate in the English language or of other sources of disadvantage. Those programs will not operate optimally unless the people who are to be the beneficiaries of the programs firstly know about them and, secondly, understand the way in which they operate and the way in which they will be affected by them.</para><para>Senator Faulkner might be surprised to learn that not everybody in Australia reads the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Australian,</inline> that not everybody is a member of the political class or the chattering classes and that not everybody has, as grist for their daily mill, the policy debates in which people like Senator Faulkner and many others on both sides of this parliament engage. These are people for whom government is something that they do not completely understand. They are people who sometimes feel threatened by government, and certainly they are people who feel cautious of government and sceptical about government. </para><para>When the government decides to promulgate a policy that targets a specific disadvantaged social group, those people have to be communicated to in a way that gets beyond the policy makers, in a way that gets beyond the political class, in a way that reaches into the community and speaks to those people in an unthreatening fashion, and in a way that arrests their attention and brings them to understand the effect of the policy or the program upon them. So the way in which these messages are mediated through the various print and electronic media will vary according to the target group. As the ministerial council, of which Senator Faulkner was himself a member, recognised, unless government can do that, the opportunity to correct one of the greatest sources of inequality in this nation—the inequality of access to information, inequality of appreciation of the way in which government programs benefit particular sections of the community—will be lost. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>24456</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last night and over the weekend if you were a viewer of commercial TV in Melbourne you could not have drawn any other conclusion from the amount of government advertising being broadcast but that this is the government that is now the largest advertiser in Australia. It is the largest advertiser out of any other organisations in Australia. We heard Senator Brandis say that, somehow or other, there has been a change in the arrangements that have taken place between the two previous governments. What Senator Brandis failed to point out are the differences between genuine advertising campaigns that try to draw people's attention to their rights and to genuine information, such as the Defence recruitment campaign and the Electoral Commission's campaigns, and those such as the <inline font-style="italic">Unchain my heart</inline> campaign, run by this government in the period running up to the last election—a program predicated on the one assumption that it was government policy. It was not even a program that was passed through this parliament; it was a program that we now see as part of a $362 million campaign by this government aimed at winning support for a political point of view. It was not an information campaign; it was a straight-out propaganda campaign.</para></talk.start><para>When the Keating government was in office, the Liberal opposition complained that it spent $9 million. What is the equivalent figure now? On the basis of the campaigns that Senator Faulkner pointed out, we see a figure of $150 million. That is the real difference. The real difference is not just a case of information versus propaganda; it is the extraordinary quantums involved. We can understand why A.C. Nielsen's list of the top 50 advertising companies has the Australian government as the largest advertiser in Australia. It is bigger than Telstra; it is bigger than Coles Myer. It spends twice that which is spent by McDonald's, Toyota or Woolworths. The government's spending on advertising is four times that of Coca-Cola and five times more than that of Qantas. And this figure does not include the extraordinary amounts being spent this year, because these figures were calculated on last year's figures. That is why $20 million a month will now be spent by this government on political advertising—an additional $150 million between now and the election.</para><para>Media campaigns such as these do not include the cost of the advertising on the direct marketing campaigns that this government is also embarking upon. They do not include the information in the mail-outs to schools or the mail-outs to families that indicate what the government says is its concern about drugs; nor does it include the amount that it is spending on media monitoring. There are extraordinary increases in the cost of the media monitoring undertaken by this government to keep an eye on its critics.</para><para>We saw a deliberate campaign in Melbourne over the weekend and, as we heard in the motion to take note of answers to questions today, it is a politically biased campaign by the government directed specifically at Melbourne. Not all Australians are treated equally in this advertising campaign; there is special attention on Melbourne. Why is that? It is because there is to be a by-election in Melbourne. We have seen a series of five separate TV campaigns running in Melbourne over the last weekend. There are campaigns with regard to health, education, New Apprenticeships, the environment, banking and aged care benefits. There is a whole series of measures aimed specifically at interest groups and at particular segments of the population that this government believes are moving away from it. It is a desperate attempt by the government to try to win back support.</para><para>We can see that the government is clearly not much interested in debating the difference between genuine community campaigns, genuine information campaigns or those blatantly political campaigns because, at the moment, it has at its disposal an additional $150 million to aid is re-election. That is what this is all about: a deliberate attempt by the government to aid its re-election in the run-up to a difficult election. We saw a similar strategy pursued at the last election in relation to the GST. It was a close election. It is arguable that the advertising campaign undertaken by this government as part of its $362 million GST advertising campaign may in fact have been the decisive factor in its return. People are entitled to ask: what is the cost of this? What is the cost not just in terms of public policy but also in terms of how many teachers, how many nurses, how many aged care beds and how many books in school libraries? What sorts of actions could be taken by this government to actually help people? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>24458</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking to this motion to take note of answers, Senator Faulkner for the Labor opposition listed a range of government advertising campaigns and alleged that those advertising campaigns were not genuine information campaigns but were designed to shore up the government's political support. My colleague Senator Brandis has already made reference to the fact that that allegation by Senator Faulkner fell absolutely flat because those advertising campaigns and programs are indeed determined by the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications, which operates under exactly the same guidelines implemented by the previous Labor government in February 1995. It is exactly those guidelines that are applied to determining the nature, the type of advertising and, indeed, the range of programs subject to advertising by this government. These are the guidelines that were determined, implemented and operated by the previous Labor government.</para></talk.start><para>Surely pensioners, self-funded retirees, farmers and others are entitled to information about programs that affect them.

All departments are required to conduct their public information programs at a level appropriate for their impact on the community, particularly where they concern the individual's benefits, rights and obligations.</para></quote><para>The fact is that people are not automatically aware of government programs. In my experience as a parliamentarian, I have known of many occasions when people have not been aware of government programs. Indeed, many have missed out on benefits because of ignorance of those programs, and when they are finally advised of them, through one means or another, it is often too late to obtain the benefit that could otherwise have been derived. Therefore, it is crucial that there be effective government advertising of the benefits of these programs. That is what the advertising to which Labor senators have referred is directed.</para><para>We are obliged to publicise government programs and initiatives. Indeed, because of the likelihood that people will miss out on the benefits of those programs, if the government had failed to advertise them, we would have been open to even greater criticism. As far as the Labor opposition is concerned we are damned for advertising but, in terms of the broader community, we would be damned if we failed to undertake that advertising. Labor, it seems, does not want to acknowledge that people want to know, that they have a right to know and that it is important for them to know what the government are doing and what programs are available to them.</para><para>Senator Carr came into the debate and said that it was all well and good to quote from the ministerial guidelines but the nature of the advertising undertaken by this government was different from that undertaken by the Labor government. The fact is that it was the Labor Party in government that was guilty of blatant misuse of government funds and abuse of government advertising. But, as I said, both governments have based their advertising on those ministerial guidelines that were established under the Labor Party in government. </para><para>In that context, let us not forget the `money growing on trees' campaign that was developed under the previous Labor government for their superannuation advertisements. What about the Working Nation advertisements, which had no content whatsoever? And we ought not forget the thousands of dollars paid to Bill Hunter for the advertising he undertook on behalf of the Labor government. Then, of course, we saw that very same actor, Bill Hunter, bob up in Labor's election commercials. One could almost suggest the possibility of a conflict of interest in that case. As Senator Carr said, it is important to distinguish between the advertising of Liberal governments and Labor governments. When one looks at what the Labor government did, one can say that they went pretty close to breaching their very own guidelines, whereas this government has assiduously applied those guidelines in a fair and proper manner.</para><para>I think it was Senator Carr who mentioned a number of private enterprises that had smaller advertising budgets than the present government. Of course, what Senator Carr failed to mention was that the federal government is much larger than any of those enterprises. It has a much wider range of programs and therefore requires a much wider range of advertising of those programs for the benefit of the community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>24459</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A few weeks ago I happened to be watching television—one of the rare occasions I had a chance to—and I saw an ad promoting the Agriculture Advancing Australia program.

I was intrigued by this, and at the recent estimates proceedings Senator O'Brien and I had the opportunity to ask questions of Minister Alston, representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, about this advertising campaign. As usual, Senator Alston spent very little time actually at the estimates proceedings. He is usually totally disinterested in what happens in this portfolio that he represents. </para></talk.start><para>We were advised by officers of the department that there was a $6 million campaign being undertaken to advertise to farmers the existence of the Agriculture Advancing Australia program—the AAA package. What is intriguing about this is that this AAA package was announced in 1997, yet the government is today running ads to advise farmers of the existence of this package. Why is it doing that? It became clear from the evidence we received that at the time the package was announced and throughout the next two or three years there was little effective advertising done. From research undertaken it also became clear that only 26 per cent of farmers were aware of some of the aspects of that package and only six per cent of farmers were aware of the total benefits available under that package. </para><para>There is certainly a need to inform farmers of the benefits that they may be able to access under this package, but why was this not promoted properly when the package was introduced in 1997? As the department acknowledged in the estimates proceedings, they were aware in 1998 that there was a need to promote this program amongst farmers. But they did not do anything. They have left it to just on the eve of the federal election to undertake a massive TV advertising campaign for this package. But what is even more interesting and very telling is that the money is being spent mainly on television advertising. Pretty close to $3 million of the total amount is being spent on TV and there are further amounts being spent on radio advertising. Out of that $6 million, only $106,000 is being spent on direct mail to farmers. </para><para>As was evident in the question I asked Senator Alston at question time, a database of farmers has been developed, and the department indicate they can effectively target 95 per cent of farmers in Australia by utilising that database. But this government has neglected the use of direct mail to farmers, who are the target group. The government had produced on its behalf glossy-type print advertisements and colourful TV advertisements that are being shown across Australia, including in metropolitan areas, when supposedly the campaign is to be targeted at farmers to inform them of the benefits and the programs they may be able to access. </para><para>It is quite clear that this campaign has very little to do with endeavouring to inform farmers directly. There is direct mail and there are means which can be utilised through the organisations that exist to service and represent farmers, but the government is not using those means. Instead it is undertaking a broad brush television advertising campaign which is clearly designed to make the government look good in the eyes of rural and regional Australians. As research has shown, Australians in rural and regional areas are not listening. They have given up listening to this government because this government has no answers to their problems. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Privatisation</title><page.no>24460</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>24460</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston) to a question without notice asked by Senator Allison today relating to Telstra call charges.</para></motion><para>I think it is fair to say that this is perhaps one of the more hypocritical and contradictory answers from the minister—and that is saying something. To suggest that there is no interference in Telstra is a complete nonsense. We all know that the minister wanted to get rid of the so-called formal means of interfering with Telstra, but the Senate and the Democrats would not allow that to happen. However, we all know that there are many ways of informally pressuring Telstra. </para><para>The Democrats have been saying for years that call charges should be reduced for distance. There is no longer any logical reason to charge higher rates for rural and particularly for semirural calls. Gone are the days when we had telephonists plugging plugs into holes in telephone exchanges. The cost of delivery of telephone services no longer justifies higher rates for the vast majority of people living in country areas. This has been the case for many years. It is not something that has happened in the last six months and is the sudden reason why Telstra can now afford to do this that was not present last year or even six years ago. In fact, the city is subsidised by the bush when it comes to telephone services. We have strongly supported lower telephone costs for country people. The reason they have not been delivered before is the bottom line: the effect on revenue. Suddenly, we have found a reason to do that. We have an election looming and rural seats are likely to be lost. Suddenly, we find there is a review, and Telstra willingly forgoes $48 million in revenue—I do not think so. </para><para>We all know that delivering the telecommunications infrastructure to remote areas of Australia is expensive, and that is why we have the universal service obligation. In another ill-conceived bit of ideology, the attempts to introduce competition here have also failed over the last few weeks. The pilot USO projects attracted no bids other than Telstra's, and yet this government still blindly follows the argument that competition and privatisation are everything. That is the Holy Grail, if you like, in telecommunications services. People in the country are not fooled. They know otherwise. The Democrats know otherwise. We have been reminding this place of that for a long time. </para><para>The other interesting contradiction in the minister's statements over the last couple of days has been that selling the rest of Telstra will ensure that there is no government interference. That is the biggest joke of all. The coalition, having robbed the Telstra coffers to the tune of billions of dollars since coming to government and forcing it into debt, want to make sure that all Australians can no longer receive the benefits of this very important and very profitable public company. The other part of this contradiction is that the minister cannot see that his position on Telstra and that of SingTel and Optus is problematic. It seems okay, according to his public comments, for the Singapore government to have a controlling interest in SingTel—the Democrats do not have any problem with that; in fact, we think it is a very sensible public policy. This company is also operating in Australia through Optus and it is a principal competitor of Telstra's. So we have this ridiculous situation where the government have no problem with that—and I am not saying that they should—but, on the other hand, they are saying that what we need for competition is for government to get out of the way of business. We have heard that mantra for too long in this place. It does not work. It is not working at the present time. That contradiction must be very obvious to the vast majority of Australians, including those people in the bush for whom this will be of some benefit, presumably $48 million worth of benefit—although the jury is out on even that because some of them will have to give up some of their concessions and programs in order to sign on to this deal. It is a very complicated one, as they usually are. </para><para>I remember the days when Telstra used to publish their call charges in the phone directory. You could actually look up what you would be charged for whatever call you were making over whatever distance. As I said, those distance considerations are not realistic, because they are based on technology which has moved on. Nonetheless, the matter has become very complex with various sorts of deals and contracts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>24461</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>24461</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Deputy President, I seek leave of the Senate to make a personal explanation. </para></talk.start><para>Leave granted. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—In question time today Senator Amanda Vanstone, in response to a question about disability pensioners being excluded from the one-off $300 payment, said that I had not even been born when Australians were going off to Vietnam and that my comments during the budget period were generationally insensitive—I believe that is what she was saying. She also questioned my commitment to Vietnam veterans. Firstly, Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War was from 1965 to 1972.

I am amazed that Senator Vanstone would have the nerve to mention veterans in light of the $300 payment.

Senator Carr moved a motion that the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business table certain documents by no later than immediately after the taking note of answers on Monday, 18 June 2001. The documents sought to be tabled are held by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and relate to an industrial dispute in the meat processing industry involving G &amp; K O'Connor Pty Ltd and the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. Since the making of the order on 24 May this year, the government has been examining the issues raised with a view to presenting a considered response to the order within the timeframe specified by the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>Last Friday, 15 June, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business received correspondence dated 14 June from one of the affected parties, G &amp; K O'Connor Pty Ltd. In that correspondence the company refers to the return to order and to the existence of pending litigation and made a request that it be given a period of notice within which to view the relevant documents and an opportunity to make appropriate submissions as to the potential for the contents of the documents to prejudice the company in ongoing litigation. It also advised that a directions hearing is scheduled in the Federal Court for 29 June. I table that correspondence of 14 June 2001.</para><para>Given this request and its reference to matters that are still before the courts and to potential prejudice to litigation, it is appropriate that the minister takes further advice on the request prior to presenting a more detailed response to the return to order. Since the receipt of the request last Friday, it has not been possible to finalise that advice nor consider its implications. The minister will respond further to the return to order at the earliest reasonable opportunity. I emphasise that in making this statement the minister is not at this stage accepting or rejecting the request made last Friday but rather taking advice upon it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>24462</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the statement.</para></motion><para>I note that the government has not actually rejected the Senate's return to order; it has not actually said it will not provide the documents. What it has done today is suggest to us that the government would like more time to think about the questions involved. If this matter were not so sensitive and did not go to so many issues of importance to this government, one might be able to say it is a fair enough request that you need more time. We are yet to hear from the government, however, as to how much time it requires. We are yet to hear from the government as to what issues it feels it needs to consider more carefully. What we hear from the government today is a continuation, I might note, of an approach to this question that we have seen since 1999 when these issues first began. I might take this opportunity to advise the Senate of what the issues are in regard to this matter, and it may be possible for the Senate to come to a clearer view on the nature of the government's statement here today.</para><para>I asked for the government to provide documents that related to its dealings in regard to an industrial dispute at G &amp; K O'Connor in Victoria. I am sure that many people would say, `This is a relatively minor matter. Why are you troubling the Senate with these requests?' This is a matter that concerns some 250 of my constituents. I was faced with the unfortunate circumstance—and many politicians, I am sure, would befaced with such issues—where a large group of Australians felt they had been deprived of their rights and their opportunities to actually receive normal benefits and arrangements that other Australians receive. In those situations, they turn to their members of parliament to seek assistance and to give some voice to their concern. On that basis, I have taken this matter up. I have spoken to the Senate now on three occasions on this question, this being the third. It is clear that this is a matter that requires additional comments, so I will just take the Senate through the issue.</para><para>In March 1999, the particular company, G &amp; K O'Connor, chose to lock out their 250 workers. They chose to force them on to unemployment benefits. They chose to deny those employees access to an income and access to their entitlements, and some of those employees had been working in this plant for 20 years. They chose to do that because they wanted these workers to accept a pay cut of just under 20 per cent. That was a very substantial pay cut for many workers concerned and was in very stark contrast to what workers at that plant had been entitled to for many years. In the past, that plant had been regarded as a progressive employer, as a place which was reasonable to work at in so far as the meat industry was concerned and as a place that had been seen to break from other more redneck employers in the industry and adopt a more reasonable attitude to their employees.</para><para>What was different about this particular circumstance was that Mr Reith, the minister for industrial relations at the time, had chosen to make an example of this industry, and this particular plant was the vehicle by which that example was to be made. He set down three industries to target. He said that he wanted to see substantial changes in the waterfront, and we saw what occurred there in the Patrick dispute. We saw how Australians were deprived of their livelihood, and we saw thugs, doberman pinschers, alsatians and men in masks used in an attempt to destroy the organisation that had represented those people on the waterfront. We saw the CFMEU and the building industry being targeted by this government, and the government has not been able to find an employer to do its dirty work. We also saw the government's work in the meat industry. They were the three industries—meat, construction and waterfront.</para><para>The meat industry was the O'Connor plant in Victoria. That company took up the minister's invitation. We know that is so because on 19 February 1999, one month before the lockout occurred, the department and this minister met with O'Connor. We also know that there were various communications between the company's legal representatives and the government department, through its so-called Workplace Reform Unit—this is the particular hit squad within the department of industrial relations. That unit had discussions with the company's legal advisers on 26 February 1999; on 5, 10, 12, 19, 22 and 31 March 1999; on 7, 9 and 30 April 1999; and on 13 May 1999. That is, of course, information provided by the department.</para><para>In questions before the estimates committee, I sought from the department advice as to what sort of contact they had had with this company, and I was advised that essentially it was nothing: that there was nothing in it, that my concerns were misplaced, that these were issues of just ongoing monitoring of matters and that occasionally there might have been some sort of information to the minister. What we discover is that, within the department, there are 820 folios of information concerning this particular matter. That is not bad for an organisation that claims to have had minimal contact with the employer—in this particular case, the employer that had locked out, as I say, 250 of my constituents in Victoria. We now discover that the Federal Court has intervened and has made a decision. It has decided against the actions of the company in regard to its attempts to reduce the wages and conditions of its employees on that particular site. It has found that the actions of the company were wrong and that very, very substantial sums are likely to follow in terms of backpayment.</para><para>It gets better than that, though. We discover that this company, in its desperation to pursue its industrial agenda on behalf of this government, has decided to employ a group of thugs—a group of people who have become associated with unsavoury actions on the waterfront. There is a Mr Bruce Townsend, a professional scab herder and strikebreaker, who has a long record of involvement in this industry in using what any reasonable person would say appear to be illegal actions in attempting to break unions, trying to destroy organisations that represent working people in this country and in attempting to undermine workers and their resistance to unreasonable demands by employers.</para><para>At this point, we have discovered that this particular group—one might call its members Pinkerton style activists, using the analogy of the sorts of actions we saw in the 1930s in the United States—is using those sorts of tactics here in this country. They have sought the secret employment of third-party strike breakers. They have been hired as spies and placed within the workplace. They have been used then as agent provocateurs to encourage unionists to pilfer. They have been used to provoke fights on the floor in such ways as to cause violence to take place within the industrial plant. All of this, of course, leads to the dismissal of any particular workers. We have seen assaults upon union members, as I say, within the plants and outside. We have seen assaults in terms of following union members home and various other forms of intimidation at their residences, with their families being subject to these sorts of abuses. We have seen persistent attempts to entrap union members in various other activities which would be breaches of the law.</para><para>We saw all of this put before the Industrial Relations Commission, uncontested—in terms of evidence, uncontested—by the company. Company executives, such as Mr Peter Allen, have urged these spies to perjure themselves before various courts of law in this country. We have seen company executives, such as Mr Allen, offer to bribe ex-employees and to give false evidence against union members before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>I put it to this chamber that this department—Minister Reith's department at the time, and now Mr Abbott's department—has been monitoring these issues very closely. It occurs to me that it may well be that the department is involved in these arrangements. What I would like—and this is the reason for the return to order—is to have a look at the documents. That is not an unreasonable request. What this government then says is, `Oh, hang on a minute, it may be that the employer'—this is the affected party in this that the parliamentary secretary has just quoted—`does not want the government to hand over the documents because he might choose to appeal the Federal Court's actions.' That is what we are hearing today from the parliamentary secretary.</para><para>What are the sorts of things that I am looking for? I have a very detailed list, considering the 820 files. What we notice is that some of them are quite innocuous. I understand why the government has objections to handing over the government's assessment of the parties to this dispute, but why would this government seek, for instance, to prevent access to email messages of several officers regarding the issues in dispute? That is one of the documents I have asked for. These emails are from various officers in the department, funded out of public expense to undertake work on behalf of this parliament. Why should the government feel it necessary to deny this parliament access to the various messages between officers on this highly contentious matter?</para><para>For instance, there is the appellant's outline of submissions to the ARC. The government says, `Oh, you can't have that; there might be some breach of legal privilege here; there might be some sort of sub judice question.' That is bunkum—that is complete bunkum. These are matters that go back to 1999. A copy of the AMIEU's application to the Federal Court and the appellant's outline of submission are surely not secret—but that is the nature of the government's blanket refusal here today. `Email messages regarding issues in dispute' is a term that comes up again and again on the file. Why does the government feel it is so necessary to prevent the parliament having access to them?</para><para>What I think has occurred here is that this government is obviously in some difficulty over these issues; it anticipated this would be a nice, clean, sharp kill, and it did not happen. Whatever actions have been resorted to, no matter how illegal, no matter how grotesque in terms of the attempts to intimidate, attempts to entrap and attempts to encourage people to take action which would be outside of the law, have all failed because the union members on site have remained solid. The Federal Court has found in their favour, which is a big shock to the government. It has found that the government is breaking its own laws. No matter how unfair, no matter how unreasonable they were, they still found that they were not sufficient to break the union. They were not sufficient for those workers at that particular plant to be obliged to accept the starvation wages that the company was trying to impose. I think the government is implicated in this right up to its neck, quite directly through its officers who are implicated in this issue.</para><para>We have also sought information regarding payments that have been made between this government and this company. This is a whole range of programs where it is my contention money has been transferred to that company—a whole range of issues that go to this government's support for these illegal actions. It seems to me these are matters of great importance. It is not a question of sub judice; it is a question of whether or not the government is prepared to face up and be politically accountable. I can only echo the words of the secretary of the union in this particular matter, who talks about these constituents that I had the great honour to represent here but the unfortunate circumstance where we were placed in this situation. I had nearly 200 of them in the office where these issues were put to me. In the words of Graham Bird: </para><quote><para>These people in my view are heroes of the trade union movement. They are people who have suffered enormous financial pressure. They have been abused. They have been stood over. There has been enormous pressure applied to their families. There have been break-ups in families. There have been houses that have been taken off them. These people have had their cars taken away from them. Enormous financial pressure. They have done all of that because they believe that they are entitled to belong to a union.</para></quote><para>That is the issue at stake here: whether or not it is legal for people to belong to a union and whether or not this government is entitled to pursue all of the resources available to it to act in support of illegal actions in preventing people from defending their rights. It is open to this chamber to assess the government's response. It may well be necessary for us to have a look at other alternative actions if this government fails to respond to this return to order within a reasonable period of time. I do not know what that is, but perhaps we could ask by this time next week, if the government has not responded, whether or not we are entitled to consider a Senate inquiry into these issues. It may well be that this government will refuse to front up to its responsibilities, will seek to duck and weave and hide behind this ludicrous notion that it is sub judice. Sub judice! The employer is thinking about an appeal therefore the government cannot hand over the documents—what a load of nonsense! This is almost as bad as its other great defence of commercial in confidence; I was waiting to hear that today. Frankly, this is an issue that this chamber is entitled to consider further, and it may be necessary for us to take this issue through in other forms to encourage the government to see—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—It is in a similar sort of vein as that.

In its previous report in 1999, the committee concluded that there is no evidence to date that regulation 4.31B has deterred genuine refugees from applying for review. We have made the same finding on this occasion. The regulation has been in force for a period of years, but no hard evidence has come forward to the committee that the regulation prevents any genuine asylum seeker in this country from applying for review. Some of the persons who gave evidence to the committee continued to put forward that assertion. They do not have convincing evidence. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs does not believe—and the committee was not convinced—that the regulation prevents a genuine asylum seeker from applying for review. There is evidence within the body of the committee's report that it has a small effect, but nonetheless an effect, on those who are seeking to abuse Australia's protection system.</para><para>The committee, in weighing up all the evidence, decided to play it safe and, rather than reaffirming that the regulation remain forever, decided that a further sunset clause should be put around the regulation and that it should be reviewed again in two years. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><quote><para>Regulation 4.31B was introduced on 1 July 1997 as part of a package of measures to combat abuse in Australia's refugee determination system. The regulation provides for a fee of $1,000 to be charged those whose claim for refugee status has been refused and who then unsuccessfully appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal for refugee status.</para><para>The regulation is intended to deter applicants who have no real claim to be considered refugees.</para><para>The Committee previously reported to the Parliament on this regulation in May 1999 and recommended that it be subject to a sunset clause. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs requested that the Committee again review the regulation prior to its scheduled expiry on 30 June 2001.</para><para>The Committee received 28 submissions from 21 organisations and individuals. This was more than the Committee had received for the 1999 review.</para><para>In the course of this review the Committee heard evidence from a number of people with relevant expertise. These included the Refugee Review Tribunal, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the International Commission of Jurists, the Migration Institute of Australia, and the Refugee Advice and Casework Service.</para><para>Many submissions argued against the continuation of the fee; some urged that it be continued and increased; others believed that the fee should not exist.</para><para>The Committee returned to the basic questions it had asked in 1999: whether there was abuse of the refugee review system; whether the fee had an effect on any abuse; and whether people with bona fide claims to be considered refugees were being discouraged from seeking review.</para><para>In looking at abuse of the refugee review system, the Committee found that one in three applicants invited by the refugee review Tribunal to put their case in person did not take up this invitation. The Committee considered this evidence that the applicants themselves knew that their claims could not be sustained. [2.11]</para><para>Most of those who had been refused refugee status since the fee was introduced were still in Australia. This indicated that their motivation was a desire to prolong their stay in Australia. [2.13]</para><para>In short, Madam President, there is abuse of the refugee review system which requires attention.</para><para>The Committee then examined whether the fee was reducing the level of abuse. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs argued that applications for review which lacked merit would be concentrated in nationalities from which there were very few successful refugee applications.</para><para>The proportion of applicants from this group who were refused refugee status by the Department and who then appealed to the Tribunal had been increasing by 10 per cent each year prior to the introduction of the fee. Since the fee was introduced in 1997 the increase has been only one per cent each year. [2.34]</para><para>The Committee considered that this was evidence that the fee was deterring applications which were not made in good faith. [2.37]</para><para>An equally important consideration for the Committee was that the fee should not discourage bona fide applicants, that is, those who genuinely believed that they would meet the refugee definition.</para><para>The Department provided an analysis of nationalities from which most refugee applications were successful. Applicants with a genuine belief that they would qualify as refugees could be expected to be concentrated in this group. The proportion of these unsuccessful applicants for refugee status who appealed to the Refugee Review Tribunal was rising prior to the introduction of the fee in 1997 and was unaffected by the fee. [2.49]</para><para>The Committee considered that this indicated that the fee was not discouraging bona fide applicants from seeking review. [2.49]</para><para>The Committee also sought comment on this important point from those directly involved with refugees. Not one of them claimed that the fee had discouraged any bona fide applicants from applying for review. [2.50]</para><para>The statistical and practical evidence convinced the Committee that the fee was not adversely affecting bona fide applicants.</para><para>This conclusion was also relevant to the argument advanced by a number of organisations that the fee was discriminatory and therefore breached Australia's international obligations. However, the evidence showed that the fee was not discouraging bona fide applicants. It was therefore not discriminatory. The Committee considered that the fee did not put Australia in breach of its international obligations. [4.15]</para><para>Another argument advanced for removing the fee held that it was not cost effective.</para><para>However the Committee observed that a total of $1.3 million dollars has been collected thus far, and in the last financial year receipts were five times the total expenditure on processing. [4.38]</para><para>The Committee therefore concluded that the financial argument against continuation of the fee could not be sustained. [4.40]</para><para>The Committee also received submissions which proposed alternatives to the fee.</para><para>A number of the proposals had been made during the 1999 review, but had not been adopted by the Committee. During the current review the Committee was not provided with any new information to support those proposals. The Committee therefore did not pursue them during this review.</para><para>In addition, some proposals for the replacement of the fee had the potential to open up new avenues for delay or litigation. The Committee therefore did not endorse them.</para><para>In its review of Migration regulation 4.31B the Committee noted that refugee determination process takes some time to reach a conclusion. Therefore the full effects of the fee might not yet have become apparent.</para><para>The Committee concluded that the regulation should be extended for a further two years and subject to another review. [4.59]</para><para>During the review the Committee's attention was also drawn to the continuing level of concern about the activities of some migration agents. This issue had been raised in another of the Committee's reviews in 2000, and Committee had itself commented on it in its 1999 report on this regulation.</para><para>The Committee has therefore recommended that the activities of migration agents be brought under closer scrutiny by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Migration Agents Registration Authority. [3.47]</para><para>Madam President, this regulation again highlighted to the Committee how the legitimate processes involved in determining migration issues can be exploited to permit people to remain in Australia who otherwise would be unlikely to have a valid reason to stay.</para><para>The Committee considered that this aspect of the migration system requires continuing review. It has therefore recommended that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs systematically examine the existing migration processing and review operations with a view to streamlining them. </para><para>I would like to thank those who provided the Committee with submissions and evidence, and also made available further material as needed by the Committee.</para><para>My thanks also go to the Committee for their work on what was their second review of the regulation in two years. Although already familiar with the main issues, the Committee approached the new inquiry with open minds, seeking new insights to the crucial questions involved.</para><para>I would also like to extend my thanks to the small committee secretariat of Richard Selth, Steve Dyer, and Vishal Pandey for their assistance with the inquiry arrangements and processes.</para><para>Madam President, I commend this report to the House. </para></quote><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Senator Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned. </para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title><page.no>24472</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>24472</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>24472</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Senator Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on visits to immigration detention centres.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Senator Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Senator Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>As Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I am proud to note that this is the 100th report that the committee has tabled since it was formed some 50 years ago. Before dealing with the report's recommendations, I would like to provide a brief outline of the process that has led to this report.</para><para>The genesis of the visits to the immigration detention facilities was committee and community concern about the treatment of detainees in the centres. Before undertaking the program of visits, the committee was briefed on the operation of these centres and the departmental process by officers from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Over a four-day period in late January this year, a number of committee members visited five immigration detention centres: Curtin, Port Hedland, Perth, Woomera and Villawood. A month later, committee members visited the Maribyrnong centre.</para><para>At each centre, committee members were briefed by departmental officers and representatives of Australian Correctional Management services, the holder of the contract for the provision of services at detention facilities, about the operation of that centre. In addition, the facilities available to detainees were inspected and a total of 15 meetings were held with detainees. At all but one centre, separate meetings were held with women and children. To ensure that the detainees' views were heard, no DIMA or ACM staff, other than interpreters for the major national groups, were present during meetings with detainees. The visits to the detention centres formed the basis of this report.</para><para>Subsequent to the visits, two further meetings were held with officials from DIMA and ACM. In addition, the committee met privately with the minister and, at each of these meetings, we discussed a range of issues that had arisen during our visits to the centres. This report is not the result of the normal comprehensive inquiry process undertaken by the committee. We did not seek a range of views and test that evidence at public hearings. However, this type of report is not without precedent. For example, the committee has previously reported on visits made to Defence establishments and such reports are dealt with in the procedural guides for both houses. It is also common for this type of report to include recommendations.</para><para>Committee members are keenly aware of the difficulties in housing those who seek asylum, and in processing their applications for protection under the refugee convention. However, the difficulties experienced by both detainees and staff in detention centres must be continually monitored. Conditions are far from perfect. I would draw the attention of the Senate to the section of the report that refers to Juliet block at the Port Hedland detention centre. The members who inspected this block at the suggestion of detainees were shocked by the conditions they witnessed. DIMA has since advised the committee that this block is being refurbished and that only pressure of numbers, after a disturbance in January, had led to its use at the time of our visit. However, the committee was extremely disappointed that it was not informed in detail about the use of Juliet block and the substandard conditions there during our pre-inspection briefing.</para><para>This report recommends some courses of action that could be taken to improve conditions for detainees, particularly women, children and families. The committee has made a total of 20 recommendations, including: that a time limit be placed on the period people should spend in detention; that the department trial a release into the Woomera community for women and children, and I welcome the minister's recent announcement that that will occur; that access to detention centres be provided for appropriate community organisations, including religious and welfare groups; and that the adequacy of psychological services provided to detainees be reviewed.</para><para>It is now over four months since the subcommittee visited the detention facilities. The minister and the department have been most cooperative in allowing a good deal of public scrutiny of detention centres, which has helped facilitate informed public discussion. The Flood report was tabled in February after our visits had taken place, and the department has progressed a range of policy and administrative issues which were of concern to the human rights subcommittee. Mandatory detention for illegal arrivals has bipartisan support in order to maintain an orderly migration program and one which allows an accepted quota of refugees each year.</para><para>It is important for us to note that there has been a significant decrease in the time taken for primary decisions for unauthorised arrivals. Today, 80 per cent of protection claims now have a primary decision in 13 to 14 weeks compared to some 32 weeks previously. Some straightforward cases can have a primary decision made in as little as four to six weeks. The recent influx of asylum seekers and illegal arrivals reflects an emerging trend amongst the over 22 million refugees worldwide. The recommendations in this report are designed to assist the government as it deals with this very difficult administrative and policy challenge.</para><para>The treatment of illegal arrivals is a sensitive and complex issue. Increased numbers since the end of 1999 have placed great pressure on DIMA and its contractor ACM. The string of disturbances in the Curtin and Port Hedland centres this year, and more recently at Woomera, have drawn these difficulties to the attention of all Australians. The committee hopes that, now that this report has been tabled in parliament, the department will examine its recommendations as part of its ongoing review of service provision in detention centres.</para><para>I want to place on record the committee's appreciation of the staff of the secretariat, particularly Patrick Regan and Inga Simpson, for their work in organising the visits, because a very comprehensive number of visits took place over a short period of time and covered long distances. The work of Patrick Regan, Inga Simpson and the general staff at the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Joint Committee secretariat is greatly appreciated because they spare no effort in ensuring that we get the best possible attention and have the best and fullest program possible.</para><para>The movement of people, which has increased at such a rapid rate in recent times, is a very difficult problem for all parties in parliament and for all governments around the world. From my own personal point of view, I commend the minister for his efforts to try to make sure that we are processing an ongoing improvement in conditions for those people who have come to our shores, albeit unauthorised. We also need to remember when we are dealing with people who arrive as asylum seekers, illegal immigrants or unauthorised arrivals—however you might like to categorise them—that the people who come in this manner are people who, in some way, can afford to pay somebody to bring them here by boat, and we are trying to get their processing time down to 12 to 14 weeks. This contrasts sharply with the hundreds of thousands of other refugees around the world who are confined to camps and living in squalid conditions who are going through the normal processes which sometimes take two years or more.</para><para>We need to bear in mind the fact that there are large numbers of refugees throughout the world who are not arriving on our shores illegally and who we need to give some consideration to, because the quota of refugees we take remains constant. Under the current quota system, people we take who come as unauthorised arrivals are taking the place of some of those who have been waiting a long time. I commend this report to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>24474</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise as a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and also as a member of the Human Rights Subcommittee to speak in support of not only the tabling of <inline font-style="italic">A report on visits to immigration detention centres</inline> but also the report's recommendations. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the late chairman of the subcommittee, Mr Peter Nugent. I have not previously had an opportunity to acknowledge in parliament Peter's contribution as a member of parliament, but I want to do it here.</para></talk.start><para>Peter was chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee and, when we were in government, he was a member of the committee as a backbench member of the Liberal Party. He was a committed supporter of international human rights and human rights in this country. It was most appropriate that Peter chaired the Human Rights Subcommittee on behalf of the government and the Liberal Party. He made a very distinguished contribution to human rights development in this country, one of which he, his family and all Australians can be proud. I send my very deep sympathy to his widow and his family and I regret the fact that, because of unavoidable commitments, I could not get to his funeral.</para><para>I recognise that it is a bipartisan report, as was noted by the chairman of the committee, Senator Ferguson. The Labor Party members and the Liberal Party members will agree that we had to compromise with each other to get a unanimous report. As a former chairman of this committee, I can say that we as a committee have always striven for bipartisan, tripartisan or quadpartisan agreement. We know that the contributions and the recommendations of the committee have greater weight in the community and with the government when they have broad parliamentary support. This report does have broad parliamentary support.</para><para>All of us on the committee dealt with this issue knowing that there is no black-and-white answer to the question of how to handle illegal immigrants to this country. Achieving a balance between protecting our borders and being generous in handling genuine refugees is very difficult. We know that certain elements in the populist media beat up stories against illegal immigrants to a level that is unhelpful in the debate. An impression is created that we are being flooded each year by tens of thousands of illegal immigrants. The report shows that the figure is really between 2,000 and 3,000. Some years the figure is down to 1,000; some years it may be more than 3,000.</para><para>I do agree that most of these illegal immigrants have paid people smugglers to get to Australia. You may ask whether they are genuine refugees, compared with those who are trapped in camps around the world who do not have the money or the ability to get out of the camps and to make their way illegally to Australia. To put this in context, it should be remembered that, at any one time, over 50,000 people are illegally in this country through overstaying their visas. That is the biggest problem we have with people who are illegally in this country. Yet this issue does not get the same coverage in the media and does not raise the same concern as does the issue of boat people. Nevertheless, we cannot allow anybody to arrive illegally and then believe that they will be allowed to stay in Australia without proper process.</para><para>I have visited only the detention centre in my electorate, and that is at Woomera in South Australia. We call it a detention centre but, by any observation, it is a prison. It has all the paraphernalia and all the structure of a medium security prison in Australia. That is now unavoidable, in view of the disturbances that have taken place and the fact that we are detaining illegal immigrants until their cases are heard. Seeing the razor wire, the barbed wire, the double gate entry and all of the things that we would associate with a prison at the Woomera detention centre does strike a chord with ordinary Australians. I can understand why some detainees are restless. For those who are waiting many months, if not a year or more, for their appeal to be heard, frustration and anger can set in.</para><para>This time of the year in Woomera is very pleasant. The winter is a very pleasant time to be in the desert. It is cool in the morning and pleasantly warm during the day. But, when I was there in January-February, it was goddamn hot, and it is hot for several months of the year. Day after day, Woomera has temperatures over 40 degrees. It is a stony environment with a lack of trees, because trees do not grow in such a waterless area. So you are putting people into an environment that is harsh, particularly in summer. That is unavoidable. In this report, we have made a number of recommendations to improve the process, the facilities and the treatment of the detainees. I hope the government can take all the recommendations on board. After talking both formally and informally to the officials of DIMA, I understand that they realise there is always room for improvement.</para><para>I am not yet convinced that it is wise to outsource the running of detention centres to a private company. We would be better off having detention centres run by fully employed Commonwealth staff, so that it is fully within the responsibility of the Australian government and of employees employed under the Commonwealth Public Service Act to answer queries about the running of those centres. That is an important issue. The individual staff members of the private companies do make every effort to do a good job. But when you are running a detention centre  to make money, there is always the fear that the profit will override the provision of facilities. That is why we should be very careful about where we allow outsourcing to take place. Running detention centres is not an example of outsourcing that I would agree with.</para><para>I want to finish my comments by saying that there is no doubt that we are not going to say to the people who are now on the temporary visa—and I really have to say this to the government—after three years, when they have been in the community working and then they apply for permanent residency, `No, you can't get it anymore, you don't meet the criteria, you now have to leave Australia.' I do not believe that will happen. I believe most of those people will stay in Australia, because of the agony of trying to force them to leave Australia after three years of residence, when they have established a family or got a job, have bought a house and are making an overwhelming contribution in the community. I cannot see any government sending the Federal Police around and saying, `Take them away, put them in handcuffs and put them on the nearest plane to fly them out of Australia.' I just do not think that will occur. Though it might have been a temporary measure to get the government partly off the hook of dealing with illegal boat people, I think it has just meant indirectly that those people will end up staying. They may have a very good reason to stay.</para><para>Finally, I do agree with Senator Ferguson that the real issue here is: if we let these people come in and we grant them refugee status, it means that, for others who do not make the boat, there are fewer opportunities to apply from those camps overseas. We really do have to say as a country, `Why can't we increase the refugee numbers that we take each year in Australia?' I think the number is around 15,000. I do not think Australia would fall apart if we took 20,000 or 25,000. I think that is a very reasonable number for a country of nearly 20 million people, with our standard of living and our commitment to human rights, to take without in any way putting a stress or a strain on our own society. From what I have seen, many of the refugees that I have met over my time in this parliament have turned out to be excellent citizens who have made a contribution to this country which they can be proud of and which we can be proud of as well.</para><para>I commend the report. I trust the government will adopt all the recommendations. I also imagine that at some stage in the intermediate future this committee or other committees of the parliament will revisit and review the operation of the detention centres—as is only appropriate on an issue that is so sensitive to Australia's national and international standing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>24476</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join with others who have spoken in their expressions about Peter Nugent, the former chair of this committee, and also about the very hardworking secretariat of the committee. I do not want to canvass extensively what is in the committee report; much of that has been done both here and elsewhere. But I do want to say that I believe the government should move for the closure of detention centres in isolated areas over time. The government should also ensure that alternative arrangements to detention be made for asylum seekers where detention is not necessary for security or other valid reasons. This should particularly apply to women, children and family units.</para></talk.start><para>People reading this report will wonder why that recommendation was not to be found in the report, because what I have just said and what I have just called on the government to consider follow logically from a number of observations in the report. These observations include: the need for detention time limits; the impact of detention on families, particularly on women and children; the need for sponsorship by nearby city communities; the call for greater access to detainees by community members; the psychological impact of detention, particularly in remote and isolated localities; and the growing frustration and despair. The report says:</para><quote><para>... the despair and depression of some of the detainees, their inability to understand why they were being kept in detention in isolated places, in harsh physical conditions with nothing to do.</para></quote><para>That direct quote comes after the clause in the report which observes that the majority of the committee were shocked by what they saw.</para><para>A number of the recommendations and observations in the report deal with the need to: improve the conditions; provide better educational facilities and opportunities; provide better sporting facilities; and provide greater access to other outside persons coming into the centres, including persons from the community and from various religions. It is true that the department and ACM come in for some legitimate criticism, but the fact is that the overall problem is not just one of conditions. The overall problem, in my mind, is the system of mandatory detention, particularly in isolated areas.</para><para>I believe—and I will finish on this—that there is an absolute urgent need for the government to consider whether the current situation justifies the enormous economic and emotional costs to all concerned. I commend a reading of the report to all honourable senators and to those of the public who are able to lay their hands on it. It is now on the Net, of course.</para><para>The time has really come. There has been report after report. There have been Ombudsman reports, three HREOC reports to my knowledge and of course you have the Flood reports. We have had report after report, and I believe the resolution of a large number of the problems is to be found in the decision that should be taken up by the government for the closure over a period of time of detention centres in isolated areas. The government should ensure that alternative arrangements to detention are made for asylum seekers where detention is not necessary for security or other valid reasons.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>24476</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I start off with an apology from the chair, who mentioned to me that he meant to mention a previous chair of this committee, Mr Peter Nugent, who very sadly died while—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>—Senator Bourne, just in case you have some other salient points, the time for debate will expire in about four minutes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name></talker><para>—Thank you.

By the time we finished, I think we were very much in agreement on almost everything. We ended up with some very strong recommendations. We have noted that there are huge numbers of asylum seekers around the world. We only get a very small number of those but, even so, that has challenged the facilities we have here.</para><para>One of the comments that was made and repeated was that people felt that if they were in jail and they had been sentenced to a time in jail then they would know when they were going to get out. On so many occasions in our immigration detention centres the detainees had no idea where their cases were at and what was going on. I do not think that this has been helped by the minister and his language in his press releases and his comments on this. I know that the minister will read this report. I hope that he gets something out of it and I hope that he considers moderating his language, which I think in some cases has been very detrimental to refugees and very unfair to them.</para><para>Mandatory detention, the chairman mentioned, has bipartisan support in this parliament. I would not say it has complete and utter support in this parliament. I would like to draw attention to the comment that Senator Harradine and I have made at the end.

The report recommends 18 changes to the management of the roll and the regulation of political parties. It is aimed at restoring public trust in the electoral system, which was damaged by last year's revelations about electoral fraud in Queensland.</para><para>The majority of the committee, comprising the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Democrats, support all the recommendations made. A key intention of the committee's inquiry was to identify the weaknesses and the strengths in current roll management practices and make recommendations aimed at restoring public confidence in the accuracy of the electoral roll. While the allegations of fraudulent enrolment in Queensland have achieved the most prominence, the evidence gathered by the committee leads it to believe that this practice is most likely not confined to Queensland. The committee concurs with the finding of the Shepherdson inquiry that enrolment fraud is not uncommon.</para><para>On this basis, the committee believes that the Australian Electoral Commission has to be careful that it is not overly confident about the effectiveness of its current roll management practices. Indeed, at times the evidence of the commission bordered on the defensive. A more circumspect and perhaps less assured attitude is more appropriate in light of the findings of both the Shepherdson inquiry and this committee.</para><para>I would like to highlight six key areas for improvement identified by the committee. Firstly, the Australian Electoral Commission has made various improvements in maintaining the integrity of the roll through its computerised roll management system and the continuous roll update process. The committee supports further enhancement of this approach. However—and this is critical—the committee believes that many of its concerns about electoral fraud would be alleviated if identification were required for new enrolments and the movement of existing enrolments. This reform was recommended by previous inquiries of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters. The government has adopted it, but the states have failed to agree on a uniform application of identification for enrolment. Because of the importance of bringing about this long needed reform, the committee believes that the Commonwealth should proceed with identification for enrolment without the states, if that is required.</para><para>Section 85(1) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 provides for the creation of new rolls for divisions. The committee has recommended that the AEC investigate the possible use of this section to create new rolls in divisions such as Herbert, where the accuracy of the roll has been brought into great question. Evidence provided to the committee suggests that the deterrent value of the penalties for enrolment fraud is not sufficiently high. The report recommends that the benchmark penalty for enrolment offences in the Electoral Act be increased to 12 months imprisonment or a fine of 60 penalty units. This will have the added benefit, pursuant to the Commonwealth Constitution, of disqualifying people convicted of these offences from running for the Commonwealth parliament. The Australian National Audit Office is currently conducting a performance audit of the electoral roll. The committee believes that, as part of the performance audit, it would be useful for the Audit Office to test the accuracy of the roll by conducting a data matching exercise. If the exercise is successful, the Audit Office should use such exercises to test the accuracy of the roll on an annual basis.</para><para>Penultimately, the committee found that one of the main motivators for electoral fraud was to gain control of preselections, both by union and non-union forces, in the Australian Labor Party.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>—Senator Conroy, you are unruly.

For that reason, the committee has recommended breaking new ground in the regulation of political parties and proposes the insertion of `one vote, one value' as a requirement of registered political parties' constitutions. Finally, the AEC's fraud control plan is 18 months out of date and is currently under review. The committee would like to see the AEC develop a more comprehensive approach to dealing with enrolment fraud as part of the new AEC fraud control plan.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I reiterate that the recommendations in this bright red report are designed so that public confidence in the electoral roll can be restored. The committee believes that these recommendations should be adopted as a matter of urgency. While these recommendations are commonsense—this is not rocket science—and they enjoy the support of the majority of the committee, it saddens me to say that the Labor members of the committee do not seem to share our commitment to protecting the integrity of the democratic process in this great country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESI-DENT</name></talker><para>—Senator Conroy, you continue to defy me.

There are a couple of unsavoury and unappealing aspects, but one might expect that. Underpinning it all is a concern that the recommendations of the majority might hinder voter participation at elections. That is a concern of the Labor Party's. I think it might even be true to say that the Labor Party seems more concerned with maximising voter participation even where that is achieved at the expense of the integrity of the electoral roll. We in the coalition disagree. We in the coalition, joined here by the Australian Democrats, assert that good public policy can be better found by adopting the recommendations contained within the report. We assert that the integrity of the electoral roll is critical. For this reason, to compromise the integrity of the electoral roll, or to be seen to allow the compromising of its integrity, is to corrupt the administrative touchstone of our democracy. Worse, it corrodes public confidence in the legitimacy of our democracy. That is a price we cannot afford to pay.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I do not wish to comfort those who believe that our democracy is a rude joke and that our electoral system is a rort. These people will never be completely satisfied with the electoral system no matter what reforms we propose, but the committee's recommendations will, I believe, satisfy many sceptics. Much more importantly, they will go a long way to re-establishing that perception of integrity among the broad populace. It is difficult to overstate the importance of that.</para><para>As befits an issue of this importance, there was wide community participation in this inquiry. The committee received 87 submissions and held public hearings in Canberra, Brisbane, Townsville and Sydney. There was also wide media interest in the course of the inquiry. I would like to thank the Australian Electoral Commission and members of the community who contributed to the review. I would also like to thank all members of the committee and in  particular the chairman, Mr Christopher Pyne, and the committee secretariat for the contributions to the inquiry and to the report. I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>24479</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The inquiry into the integrity of the electoral roll by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters started out as a partisan political witch-hunt into the ALP and, of course, finished with a pathetic whimper. In March after the Liberal Party's disastrous result in the Queensland state election, it was obviously decided that this particular inquiry was going nowhere fast so the Prime Minister shut down the inquiry. The inquiry had backfired on both the Prime Minister and the committee chairman, Mr Pyne.</para></talk.start><para>The only result that the Liberal Party has got out of this inquiry has been to delay a more important inquiry into funding and disclosure laws. The government promised so much and made such a fuss about `investigating rorting wherever it may be found'. But, when faced with allegations of electoral fraud involving Ministers Kelly and Brough and about other fraudulent enrolment activities by Liberal Party apparatchiks, the Liberal Party members of the committee ran for cover. Mr Pyne's high sounding words about the need for JSCEM to `investigate rorting wherever it may be found' were shown to be hollow. It was just another case of Liberal Party double standards. Mr Pyne blocked the appearance of Minister Jackie Kelly four times by using his casting vote to refuse to allow Ms Kelly to be invited to answer questions about wrongful enrolments at her own house.</para><para>Many of the recommendations are completely gratuitous, and some of the others are vague and badly worded. But I would like to deal with some of the issues that arise from the recommendations. The opposition strongly believes that the government's proposed enrolment witnessing regulations will not have any effect on enrolment fraud, but they will discourage and frustrate the genuine enrolment of young people, low income earners, people in rural and remote areas, Aboriginal communities, disabled people and the homeless. They will affect the most marginalised and disadvantaged in our community.</para><para>Wrongly, the government believes that its proposed ID checks for new enrolments will stop voter fraud. It is widely accepted now that people determined to get something they want will not stop at falsifying ID to get it. That is not just the opinion of the opposition; it is also the opinion of the Federal Police, the Attorney-General's Department, the AEC, the Australian Taxation Office, Centrelink and, interestingly enough, the Westpac Bank. To illustrate this problem, on 10 February 2000, before a House of Representatives committee inquiry into tax file numbers, Mr William Chapman, the Chief Manager, Operational Control at Westpac gave some rather telling evidence about ID checks. He said that 13 per cent of birth certificates used as part of their 100 point ID check were found to be fraudulent. He was very concerned that birth certificates are normally produced to obtain other forms of ID. Westpac were clear that ID checks are a very small speed bump for people who are determined to commit fraud. But it is not only Westpac. The government's own task forces on this matter found that using ID and the 100 point check was a very weak way to stop fraud. Like the AEC and every other government agency that relies on the integrity of identification, they support improved data matching, as does the opposition.</para><para>But the proposed regulations will not stop voter fraud. They will create another problem by discouraging and frustrating the genuine enrolment of many voters. Making people produce original forms of ID and asking them to find a specific witness will deter people from enrolling. That is a witness from a very restricted list. Aboriginal people living in isolated communities will be very hard hit by these proposals. There is already low voter enrolment in those communities and it will undoubtedly drop further. This is occurring, of course, under a government that abolished the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Electoral Information Service. You can see what the government is on about.</para><para>A simple and constructive approach would be to have an appropriate check at the most critical point in the process: when people vote. So we agree that the AEC could ensure that its certified list of voters on polling day includes details of date of birth and gender. We agree with that recommendation. It is a good step forward and I note that it is an agreed recommendation of the committee. The electoral rolls, of course, are very good. They are the best electoral rolls in the best electoral system in the world, but that step will improve the integrity of the rolls where it is needed most: on polling day.</para><para>Another recommendation that has received some publicity is the imposition of the so-called `one vote one value' on political parties. This Senate is not elected on that principle, but the Liberal Party is recommending that parties be subject to this principle even though they do not support it for the legislature in the state of Western Australia. No analysis of the impact of one vote one value on the internal operations of political parties has been undertaken. Without that analysis, we say it is ludicrous for the committee to propose this recommendation. Most registered parties have collegiate voting structures, and it is absurd to apply the principle of one vote one value in those circumstances. Parties try to balance a range of democratic principles, such as representation of minorities or smaller states. Affirmative action arrangements or affirmative action loadings would be affected by this principle. Federal as opposed to national voting systems would be affected by this proposal.</para><para>But, of course, the reason for it is to try to affect the 60 to 40 trade union branch's ratio apparently in the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party. What a hide for the Liberal Party members of this committee to be proposing that the Labor Party in Queensland ought to get its act together, when the Queensland Liberal Party managed to return three seats, three members, in the last state election! This is an example of the waste of time and energy this whole committee inquiry has been. It has resulted in very few constructive proposals. On that last proposal of one vote one value, no evidence was adduced on it and no submissions sought on it. In my view, it is an outrageous attempt to interfere with the internal workings of a political party without any proper process and without any attempt to investigate what the implications of such a proposal would be.</para><para>The committee has deliberately had this partisan inquiry and has delayed the other very important inquiry. I accept that the Democrats supported Labor's intention to have the funding and disclosure inquiry proceed, but that very important inquiry has been delayed. The Prime Minister and the Liberals showed what they thought about reform of funding and disclosure laws when that particular inquiry by JSCEM was junked. Like on so many occasions during the life of this inquiry, the Liberal Party has been absolutely opportunistic and completely two-faced in its motives in relation to this inquiry, and it has stood exposed in relation to these matters. This committee has been a fiasco. It has been an attempted witch-hunt into the Labor Party, and it has backfired miserably on the Liberal Party, on the government and, I am pleased to say—I am sure Senator Ferris will join me in this; she will be as delighted as I am—on its chairman, Mr Pyne.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>24481</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report entitled <inline font-style="italic">User friendly, not abuser friendly: report of the inquiry into the integrity of the electoral roll</inline>. That report has 18 recommendations. The Labor Party has objected to six of those, so I assume that it supports 12. Those six that the Labor Party objects to are recommendations 4, 6, 10, 13, 14—13 and 14 go together—and 18. The Australian Democrats view those recommendations as needing a number of steps before they become reality: firstly, that the cabinet and therefore the government accept them and, secondly, that they become drafted into legislation. It is at that stage that we will look at them on their merits and their applicability.</para></talk.start><para>There are two recommendations which we will examine with some care. We have previously been very nervous about recommendation 6, as propounded to the parliament before, and we continue to be nervous about that recommendation. I suspect that, until such time as we are assured either by fixed dates for elections, by better marketing or by other arguments, we will continue to be nervous about recommendation 6. The other recommendation that we will have some concern with will be recommendation 4. That is already law—the identity recommendation it might be called—and has gone into regulation. But the regulation is not before us, and we would look to see the content of the regulation before deciding to tick it off or otherwise. We will review that once it is before the Senate.</para><para>Turning to the issues that arise out of the report, we must recognise that the weakness of any inquiry such as this is that it can review only the evidence that is put before it. The JSCEM is not an investigatory body. It does not go out and establish exactly what has happened out there. As a consequence, we can deal only with such evidence as we receive.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>—Senator Conroy, I do find it difficult to hear the speaker.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is important to recognise that the inquiry found no widespread evidence of corruption. But the inquiry also recognised that, whilst we all agree—it is a nonpartisan view—that we have a very fine electoral system, which may be the best or one of the best in the world, it is not perfect, and because it is not perfect reform is necessary. However, the fact that there is no widespread evidence that full federal or full state elections have been corrupted is encouraging. </para></talk.start></continue><para>However, to my mind, there was a great deal of evidence that, in the 1980s and indeed in the early 1990s, there were extremely concerning examples of electoral roll corruption. I think the great improvements to the AEC system since that time will have lessened the dangers. The Democrats believe that one of the problems that we have to deal with further is the problem of getting people to comply with the law; namely, in making sure that they register their address changes through some easy administrative process and in marketing the roll so that people who should be on it do get on it, rather than the large numbers not on it at present. </para><para>I suppose I should in this address remark on the fact that there were some really fiery and partisan exchanges during the committee's deliberations. Regrettably, I have seen those types of exchanges in estimates committees and legislation committees, but the exchanges in this particular committee were some of the strongest expressions of low political standards of that sort. However, in finally arriving at the report and the deliberations, it is my view that the secretariat and the committee set aside that kind of excessively partisan discussion and have arrived at a quite considered and helpful review of the issues at hand.</para><para>One recommendation which is going to generate a great deal of passion in the Labor Party, and perhaps in other parties, is recommendation 18. It recommends that the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to ensure that the principle of one vote, one value for internal party ballots be a prerequisite for the registration of political parties. It is quite astonishing to me that the principle is being attacked. Once the legislation is produced, examine it; but imagine attacking the principle. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—You just expelled them all.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—You can hear one of the prime supporters of the current system barracking me. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—I draw the attention of the Senate to article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory, which reads:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions: </para><para>(a) To take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives; </para><para>(b) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors; </para><para>(c) To have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country. </para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—Of course, if Senator Conroy had heard those remarks—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESI-DENT</name></talker><para>—Senator Murray, would you please resume your seat.

Since the 1960s, the Labor Party have been particularly strong about the principle of one vote, one value, first introducing legislation in the federal parliament in 1972 and 1973. In recent years, the ALP have taken the matter to the High Court with respect to the Western Australian electoral system. You would therefore expect them to support one vote, one value as a principle within political parties. It is a well-established principle, it is widely supported and it is the core principle of democracy. Indeed, it was Carmen Lawrence who said in August 2000:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>... unions—honourable contributors to Labor history and policy—exercise disproportionate influence through the 60:40 rule and through their affiliated membership, many of whom have no direct connection to the party. One vote, one value—the prime condition for a democracy—is not observed in the party's rules.</para></quote><para>It is nonsense, I think, to say that the collegiate system in political parties is affected by this. The collegiate system means that a federal body is able to gather in a collegiate manner. It can in some circumstances mean a representative system whereby 100 members vote for 10 delegates. Nothing in the one vote, one value principle attacks that. It has been remarked that it affects the representation of minorities. Nothing in the one vote, one value principle affects proportional representation. It has been remarked that it affects affirmative action. Nothing in the one vote, one value principle affects the ability to promote affirmative action. In other words, the arguments against the principle are trying to prevent the principle being translated into workable legislation. That means that the Labor Party will be found to be defending the indefensible. If the legislation turns out to be inadequate, by all means attack it; but how you can attack the principle is beyond me.</para><para>As far back as February 1964, the United States Supreme Court gave specific support to the principle, and since then one vote, one value has been at the core of Labor support for electoral systems. They should not resist it as a means of correcting preselection problems, delegate selection problems or ballot matter problems as emerged during the Queensland inquiry and as were identified both in the JSCEM inquiry and in the Shepherdson inquiry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Sherry)</name></talker><para>—Will someone adjourn the debate?

and</para><para>·	superannuation assets are projected to reach around $700 billion by June 2005 and $1 trillion (that is, $1,000 billion) by June 2010.</para><para>Despite the wealth of funds, many couples whose marriages break down do not consider superannuation among their assets when they arrange their property settlement.</para><para>In a recent study entitled Superannuation and Divorce in Australia, the Australian Institute of Family Studies noted the increasing significance of superannuation among family assets.</para><para>The Institute found that superannuation may approach, or even exceed, the value of the family home for many couples who have limited assets.</para><para>The average aggregate superannuation balance per person is now about $50,000, with wide variations depending on years of membership and the level of contributions.</para><para>By June 2005, the average balance is projected to increase to $67,000.</para><para>By June 2010, this will increase to $80,000 and to around $135,000 in June 2020.</para><para>However, the Institute also found that even though superannuation is increasing in value and importance, separating couples did not consider splitting it in more than half of all cases where property is divided.</para><para>Even if couples negotiating a family law settlement do recognise that superannuation is an important asset, there is currently no mechanism for superannuation held in one person's name to be divided, or transferred to the other.</para><para>Nor can the Family Court order a third party (such as a superannuation fund trustee) to provide benefits to a former spouse at some future time, even though this might provide the fairest outcome for both spouses.  </para><para>The Family Court can, and does, take superannuation interests into account and divide other property accordingly.</para><para>However, this is not an ideal solution because it often means that current property - usually the family home - has to be traded away in exchange for superannuation that may not be able to be accessed for many years.</para><para>This may leave one person with a house, but no retirement income, and the other person with no accommodation, but significant retirement income.</para><para>This legislation is designed to address the inequity and inflexibility of this situation.</para><para>The bill will amend the Family Law Act 1975 to allow superannuation to be divided after the parties to a marriage have separated.</para><para>This division will be able to be achieved in one of two ways - either by agreement of the separating couple, or by order of the court.  </para><para>The bill will permit separating couples to make binding agreements about how to divide their superannuation interest or interests.</para><para>This gives people the flexibility to settle their own financial affairs wherever possible, and therefore to avoid costly and protracted litigation.  </para><para>This is consistent with the approach in Part VIIIA of the Family Law Act 1975, which commenced on 27 December 2000.</para><para>Part VIIIA of the Family Law Act allows couples to make binding financial agreements, either before or during marriage, or after the separation of the parties to the marriage, about how any or all of their property is to be divided on separation.</para><para>The Superannuation Bill will provide that couples may make a superannuation agreement, in the context of these broader financial agreements, to specify how their superannuation will be divided on their separation.</para><para>The Government recognises that, in some circumstances, couples will want to defer an agreement about how their superannuation interests are to be divided.</para><para>This might be because the person who holds the superannuation interest is nearing retirement, or another condition of release, at which time the actual value of the interest will become known.</para><para>The bill therefore provides for couples to make an agreement to “flag” their superannuation interest.</para><para>This agreement would prevent the superannuation trustee from dealing with the flagged superannuation interest until the “flag” has been lifted, either by further agreement or by court order.</para><para>When a superannuation agreement is in force, the trustee of the relevant fund will be required by law to give effect to the agreement.</para><para>The bill contains special provisions to ensure that people do not enter into contrived arrangements.</para><para>Where a couple has separated, but not yet divorced, at least one of them will have to sign a document called a separation declaration.</para><para>This declaration will state that the couple is still married, but that they have separated at the time of the making of the declaration.  There are significant penalties provided in the bill for the making of false declarations.</para><para>If the value of the superannuation interest is greater than the Eligible Termination Payment threshold determined under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 then a more detailed declaration will be required.</para><para>For people to be able to make agreements about dividing their superannuation, they will generally need information about the fair value of any superannuation interests to be taken into account upon separation.</para><para>For this reason, the bill provides that a superannuation trustee must provide information to the spouse of a member so that both parties are aware of the details of superannuation interests that are involved.</para><para>It is important, however, that personal privacy is maintained to the extent possible - an issue that was raised in the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services' reports on the bill.</para><para>The bill provides that it is an offence for the trustee to provide the address of a member or to inform a member that an application for information has been received.</para><para>Valuation is a particularly important issue for defined benefit schemes, and also partially vested accumulation schemes, where there is a vested benefit and an unvested value.</para><para>The unvested value is generally not accessible until the fund member satisfies certain requirements specified by the fund.</para><para>The value of an interest in such a plan is typically based upon years of service with an employer and salary levels prior to retirement, as well as contributions and investment earnings.</para><para>As the final benefit is dependent on future events, the full value of the retirement benefit cannot be predicted with certainty at the time of separation.</para><para>The value of an accumulation plan is generally more easily ascertained.  </para><para>For this reason, the bill will provide for different methods of valuing a superannuation interest, depending on the type of interest.</para><para>The details of how the value is to be calculated, including actuarial information, will be set out in the Regulations.</para><para>This will ensure that people are generally aware of the value of the interest they are dealing with in the agreement, and will also ensure that there can be no dispute about how the value is to be calculated.</para><para>Obviously it is preferable that people are able to make their own arrangements for dealing with superannuation interests.</para><para>However, if they are unable to agree, the court will have the jurisdiction and power to make an order to divide superannuation interests.</para><para>Such orders will usually be made as part of a broader court order dealing with all of the property of the parties that has not been dealt with in a financial agreement.</para><para>These orders will bind the relevant third party superannuation trustee.  </para><para>As with superannuation agreements, the court will be able to make an order either to split a superannuation interest or to “flag” an interest and deal with it later.  </para><para>The amendments will apply to all marriages, including those that were dissolved before the amendments commenced.</para><para>The amendments will generally not apply, however, where a property settlement has been finally concluded, whether by formal agreement or by court order.</para><para>In addition to the amendments of the Family Law Act, the bill makes a number of consequential amendments of other legislation.</para><para>The bill provides for preservation of superannuation money by making the superannuation payment subject to regulations that provide for payment out of a superannuation fund or retirement savings account.</para><para>The bill creates a payment splitting regime only and does not create a new separate superannuation interest for the non-member spouse.</para><para>The non-member spouse, who has a right to payments from the member spouse's interest, will, however, be accorded some of the rights that the member spouse has.  These rights might include the right to receive the annual report and other information.</para><para>The amendments of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 contained in the bill are designed to facilitate this.</para><para>Complementary amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations will allow - in certain specified circumstances - the creation of a new interest for a non-contributing spouse who is to receive payments under an agreement or order to split a superannuation interest. </para><para>That interest will be carved out of the withdrawal benefit of the contributing spouse's superannuation interest.</para><para>Membership of the fund is intended to provide the new member (the non-contributing spouse) with similar membership rights to those enjoyed by other members in the fund.</para><para>The Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 provides a low cost dispute resolution mechanism to deal with complaints from members and beneficiaries of superannuation funds about decisions of trustees that are not settled through a fund's internal complaints mechanism.</para><para>The amendments to the Complaints Act will permit non-contributing spouses, for whom a new interest in the fund is created, to make complaints to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal about their treatment by the superannuation trustee in appropriate circumstances.</para><para>The amendments of the Family Law Act, and the consequential amendments of other legislation, will commence on a date to be fixed by Proclamation.</para><para>The reason for the delay in commencement is to allow the superannuation industry and relevant government agencies to make the necessary adjustments to their information and computer systems to implement the division of superannuation on the separation of the parties to the marriage.</para><para>The superannuation industry expressed concern, in submissions to the Senate Select Committee, that much of the detail of the new regime will be contained in the Family Law Amendment Regulations and the Superannuation Industry (Superannuation) Amendment Regulations and that, therefore, the commencement of the new regime should be more closely tied to the commencement of the regulations - rather than the commencement of the bill.</para><para>In response to these concerns, the Government moved amendments in the House of Representatives so that the bill will now commence on date to be fixed by Proclamation.  The Proclamation will be made when the timing of the necessary changes to the Regulations is clarified.</para><para>However, there is a fixed limit to the length of the delay as the bill provides effectively that it must commence 18 months after the Act receives Royal Assent.</para><para>—————</para><para>EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMEN-DMENT BILL 2001</para><para>The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2001 delivers on the Government's promise to extend the EMDG scheme for another five years and provides a number of improvements to the scheme.  </para><para>The EMDG scheme provides $150m per annum to support the export promotion activities of eligible businesses under $50m per annum turnover, by partially reimbursing the expenses that these businesses incur in promoting their exports.   </para><para>The scheme, administered by Austrade, is a proven success in assisting small business to export, and supports this Government's strategy for a robust, internationally competitive economy.  </para><para>Last year nearly 3,000 businesses received Export Market Development Grants - 700 of which received a grant for the first time.  These businesses generated $4.5 billion in exports and employed thousands of Australians to fill the export orders.  An estimated 54,000 jobs are attributable to the exports generated by EMDG recipients.  With the average grant being $45,000, the EMDG scheme is achieving its objective of providing effective assistance to businesses seeking to develop export markets.  Importantly, 21% of these grants go to businesses in rural and regional Australia </para><para>Studies by Austrade and the University of NSW have shown that exporting businesses are successful businesses; good for the employers, good for the employees and good for the country.  Exporting businesses on average pay their employees more than non-exporting businesses.  Exporting businesses better utilise technology and modern management practices, than typical non-exporters.  </para><para>But despite recent gains and our improving export performance, research from Austrade and the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that Australia needs to continue to encourage business to export.  According to this research, less than 5% of Australian non-farm private sector businesses export, which doesn't compare well with many of our trading partners.</para><para>Against this background, in late 1999 the Austrade Board began a comprehensive review of the scheme.  The Review featured broad industry consultation, a survey of the scheme's clients, and independent analysis provided by Professor Bewley of the University of NSW and from PricewaterhouseCoopers.  The Board then provided a detailed report of its recommendation and findings, which I tabled in August 2000. </para><para>As an initial response to the Review's findings, the Government announced it would extend the scheme until 2005/06 and bring forward legislation to implement its overall response to the Review by the end of this financial year.  This bill fulfils that promise to the Australian small and medium sized business export community, and implements the key elements of the Government's response to the recommendations of that Review report. </para><para>Most importantly, this bill extends the EMDG scheme until 2005/06, with a provision to review the performance of the scheme by June 2005. </para><para>The Austrade Board recommended the EMDG scheme be extended after econometric analysis by Professor Bewley found that an additional $12 in exports was generated as a result of every grant dollar.  The Review found that the scheme's assistance is very effective in generating additional export promotion that otherwise would not have occurred, and importantly, the assistance is well-targeted delivering value for money for Australian taxpayers. </para><para>As well as providing certainty for current and future EMDG recipients by extending the scheme, this bill also improves the scheme by making it more flexible and improving access for small business, in line with the business community's input to the Review and with many of the Review findings themselves. </para><para>This bill improves small business access to the scheme by:</para><para>reducing from $20,000 to $15,000 the minimum expenditure required to access the EMDG scheme</para><para>reducing the period that related family members need to be employed in a business before their travel expenses are eligible from five years to one year, and</para><para>removing the current requirement that intending first-time claimants must register with Austrade before applying for a grant. </para><para>This bill also expands the range of products and activities that are eligible under the scheme, in line with the Review's findings.</para><para>The Review noted that bringing overseas buyers or potential overseas buyers to Australia is an important promotional tool, particularly for the tourism industry.  This bill provides for the travel, accommodation and meal expenses incurred in relation to such visits to be claimed under the EMDG scheme.  </para><para>Events promoters - such as professional conference organisers - promote events to foreign residents on behalf of the holders of those events, and thus increase the export impact of a wide range of business, academic, sporting and other events.  This bill gives events promoters access to the EMDG scheme.  This will help to boost the number of foreign visitors and business tourists to meetings, conventions and other events in both regional and metropolitan Australia.</para><para>To provide enhanced flexibility for EMDG applicants in how they direct their export marketing activities, this bill contains provisions to merge the existing categories relating to Overseas Representation and to Short-term marketing consultant expenses.  It removes the requirement that marketing consultancies be “short term” only, and caps the new combined category at $250,000 per application.</para><para>Similarly, this bill broadens the expense category relating to Trade Fairs to include genuine export marketing activities - seminars, in-store promotions, certain international forums and private exhibitions - which are currently excluded. </para><para>The bill also contains an amendment - suggested by the Review - to expand the EMDG Act's prohibition on grants relating to the export marketing expenses of pornographic film products to ALL forms of pornographic material.  This Government is not interested in providing taxpayers' funds to the pornography industry. </para><para>The bill also provides that, consistent with the Government's overall strategy that the Australian Business Number be used as an identifier for business dealings with Commonwealth agencies, entities wishing to receive an EMDG grant must hold an ABN.</para><para>The EMDG Amendment Bill 2001 also contains a number of technical amendments:</para><para>to provide more consistent treatment of service exporters</para><para>to ensure that education services exporters who are not properly accredited do not receive grants</para><para>to tighten the rules targeting the scheme to firms with exports of less than $25 million per annum</para><para>to provide Austrade with more flexibility in relation to the time within which EMDG applicants should respond to requests for information by Austrade, and</para><para>to streamline the application of the EMDG Act's insolvency provisions.</para><para>As well as the measures in this bill, Austrade will action the findings of the Review report covering</para><para>better promotion of the scheme's support for Internet and e-marketing costs</para><para>ensuring that related domestic costs - including those of business people flying from regional destinations to capital city airports on the first leg of an overseas promotional visit - are included in the EMDG Overseas Visits Allowance</para><para>reviewing the Grants Entry process with a view to simplifying it and making it more effective, and</para><para>continuing to seek improvements in the EMDG assessment process. </para><para>I would like to thank the individuals, business people and organizations that contributed to the Review of the scheme.  The suggestions to improve the EMDG scheme were listened to and the government has incorporated many of them into this bill.  I believe these changes to the EMDG Act will be warmly welcomed by the export sector. </para><para>In considering this bill, it is important to keep in mind that EMDG is all about helping smaller Australian businesses become successful exporters.  One such business is Nu-Lec Industries Pty Ltd of Brisbane, a graduate of the EMDG scheme, which is now a major exporter of electrical switchgear with exports exceeding 50 million dollars annually.  Nu-Lec no longer receives EMDG but recently wrote to me supporting the scheme.  </para><para>Nu-Lec's Vice-President, Neil O'Sullivan, said that when Nu-Lec first started exporting it was a small company and that - without Austrade's support through the EMDG scheme - it would have been “virtually impossible” to fund the costs associated with export marketing.</para><para>Nu-Lec received EMDG grants for seven years (1992-99) and Mr O'Sullivan said it was the EMDG payments that made it possible for the company to achieve the export success it has.</para><para>It's people like these exporting heroes this Government is sworn to help, and what the EMDG scheme is designed to assist.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Denman</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to a later hour of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DRIED VINE FRUITS (RATE OF PRIMARY INDUSTRY (CUSTOMS) CHARGE) VALIDATION BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24489</page.no><id.no>R1254</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>DRIED VINE FRUITS (RATE OF PRIMARY INDUSTRY (EXCISE) LEVY) VALIDATION BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1255</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>24489</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patterson</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bills read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>24489</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>24489</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speeches read as follows</inline>—</para><quote><para>DRIED VINE FRUITS (RATE OF PRIMARY INDUSTRY (CUSTOMS) CHARGES) VALI-DATION BILL 2001</para><para>This Bill together with the Dried Vine Fruits (Rate of Primary Industry (Excise) Levy) Validation Bill 2001 seeks to validate certain regulations that purported to fix retrospectively the rate of the primary industry (customs) and charge (excise) levy on dried vine fruits and for related purposes from 1 January 2000.</para><para>The purpose of this bill is to ensure that subsection 48(2) of the <inline font-style="italic">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</inline>,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>which<inline font-style="italic"></inline>invalidates any regulation that is expressed to take effect at a time before it is gazetted and operates to the disadvantage of any person other than the Commonwealth is taken not to have applied to Schedule 1 of the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.1) (Statutory Rules No. 236).

The repeal of the old Act would normally have had the effect that regulations identifying the rate at $10.00 per tonne would cease to be in force.  However, the Regulations were kept in force by transitional arrangements under the new Act.</para><para>Consistent with industry requests, it was decided in March 2000 to reduce the rate of levy on dried vine fruits from $10.00 per tonne to $7.00 per tonne to prevent an excessive build up funds occurring.  The reduction was to take retrospective effect from 1 January 2000.</para><para>The method chosen to facilitate this request was to repeal the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Dried Vine Fruits) Regulations and amend the Primary Industries Excise Levies Regulations 1999.  However, since the necessary amendments and repeals were carried out some time after 1 January 2000 the amendments and repeals were necessarily retrospective.</para><para>Contrary to the original advice received from the Attorney - Generals Department, the regulations imposing the new levy or charge have been deemed to possibly contravene subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 which invalidates any regulation that is expressed to take effect at a time before it is gazetted and operates to the disadvantage of any person other than the Commonwealth. </para><para>The purpose of this bill is to ensure that this legislation is taken not to have applied to Schedule 1 of the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.3) (Statutory Rules No. 237).  The amendments to the regulations which facilitated a reduction in the excise levy for dried fruit from $10.00 to $7.00 per tonne for the period between 1 January and 1 October 2000 will be thus validated.</para><para>The actual levy collected by the Levies Revenue Service has been reduced to $7.00 per tonne since it was originally gazetted in September 2000 to minimise any impact on levy payers whilst the situation has remained unresolved.  The monetary size of any refunds will be minimal.</para><para>The bill does not create any new administrative burden for levy payers and the only rights adversely effected are those of the Commonwealth.</para></quote><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Denman</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24490</page.no><id.no>R1279</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1277</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND METHODS OF NOTIFICATION) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1286</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>24490</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>24490</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together.

The first concerns members of the board, who are currently appointed on the recommendation of a limited group of bodies specified in the act. It is proposed that the bodies that can make those recommendations instead be prescribed by regulation and that appointments not be limited to such nominations. This will ensure a greater flexibility in the appointments, though it will not change either the number of board members or the knowledge and expertise for which the members are appointed.</para><para>In 1992 the institute's responsibilities were broadened to include welfare related functions. The second amendment to the institute's act is an essentially technical one to remove an inability to release identifiable welfare related information for statistical purposes. The release will be under the same strict conditions that currently apply to release of health related information.</para><para>The second area being amended by this bill relates to the recognition of specialist medical practitioners. The amendments are primarily designed to simplify the process for recognising medical practitioners as specialists, though the criteria for recognition will be unchanged. The changes will result in administrative efficiencies.</para><para>Thirdly, this bill will also amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to allow the Health Insurance Commission to pay Medicare benefits directly to general practitioners where `pay doctor via claimant' cheques made out to general practitioners are not presented within 90 days of issue. Under the act, Medicare benefits are payable only to the person who incurs medical expenses, that is, the patient. Where a patient has not paid the medical expenses, the patient can request that a cheque for the amount of the Medicare benefit be drawn by the Health Insurance Commission in favour of the medical practitioner who rendered the professional services. These are referred to as `pay doctor via claimant' cheques. As it is the patient who receives the service, the act requires that the cheque be sent to the patient. The patient is then expected to forward the `pay doctor via claimant' cheque and any patient contribution to the practitioner. The great majority of patients do present the `pay doctor via claimant' cheques to their doctors in a timely manner. However, some cheques are received very late and some are never presented, leaving doctors with unnecessarily long delays or ultimately bad debts for medical services already provided in good faith. This amendment will allow for payment of the amount of benefits to be made directly to a general practitioner where the cheque has not been presented within 90 days from the date of issue.</para><para>The fourth set of amendments relates to the coalition's very successful 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance scheme. Under current arrangements, where funds require reimbursement for claims made late or low, the payment is via an act of grace. This cumbersome procedure will be revised to allow the Health Insurance Commission to make those payments. Other minor amendments include clarification of the premium reduction calculation for the rebate and removal of redundant items from legislation.</para><para>—————</para><para>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLIC-ATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</para><para>This bill amends legislation in the immigration and multicultural affairs portfolio to harmonise existing criminal offence provisions with chapter 2 of the Criminal Code.  </para><para>It is one of a series of government bills designed to apply the Criminal Code on a portfolio-by-portfolio basis. </para><para>Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code, contained in the Criminal Code act 1995, establishes the general principles of criminal responsibility.  It provides a standard approach to the formulation of commonwealth criminal offences.</para><para>The Criminal Code will apply to offences against a law of the commonwealth on 15 December 2001.  </para><para>Many offence provisions in migration legislation pre-date the Criminal Code and there is a possibility that the application of the code will change their meaning and operation.  </para><para>The purpose of the bill is to make all the necessary amendments to offence provisions to ensure compliance and consistency with the general principles of the Criminal Code.  </para><para>However, the offence provisions, as amended by the bill, will not change in operation or meaning. </para><para>The bill harmonises offence provisions in migration legislation in several ways. </para><para>First, the bill makes it clear that the Criminal Code applies to all offences against migration law.</para><para>Second, the bill replaces references to certain general offence provisions in the Crimes Act 1914 with references to the corresponding provisions of the Criminal Code.</para><para>Third, the bill clarifies the physical and fault elements of offences.  This will improve the efficient and fair prosecution of offences. </para><para>I anticipate that this measure alone will save many hundreds of hours of court time otherwise spent in complicated, and sometimes inconsistent, interpretation of offence provisions. </para><para>Fourth, the bill amends migration legislation to remove unnecessary duplication of the general offence provisions in the Criminal Code.  </para><para>For example, it removes the ancillary offence of attempt and the defence of lawful authority.  Reliance is instead placed on the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code. </para><para>Finally, the bill amends certain offence provisions to expressly provide that they are offences of strict or absolute liability. </para><para>If an offence is not expressly stated to be one of strict or absolute liability, then the prosecution will be required to prove fault in relation to the physical elements of the offence. </para><para>The amendments in the bill are necessary to ensure that the strict or absolute liability nature of certain offence provisions is not lost after the application of the Criminal Code. </para><para>Without these amendments, the offences would become more difficult for the prosecution to prove and almost unenforceable. </para><para>I would like to emphasise that the bill does not create any new strict or absolute liability offences. </para><para>Overall, the bill will bring greater consistency and clarity to commonwealth criminal law.  </para><para>It is one step in a process that will give Australians greater certainty, protection and confidence under the criminal law. </para><para>It is important that the amendments in the bill are made prior to 15 December 2001 in order to ensure that there is a seamless transition.</para><para>I look forward to the bill receiving the support of the opposition. </para><para>I commend the bill to the chamber. </para><para>—————</para><para>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ELECT-RONIC TRANSACTIONS AND MET-HODS OF NOTIFI-CATION) BILL 2001</para><para>The main purpose of this bill is to bring the Migration Act and the Australian Citizenship Act into line with the Electronic Transactions Act.</para><para>The bill establishes a legal framework that is sufficiently robust for the immigration and multicultural affairs portfolio to pursue, with integrity, the government's commitment to provide services on-line.</para><para>The electronic transactions act gives effect to the validity of electronic communications.</para><para>That act will apply to all commonwealth legislation from 1 July 2001.</para><para>Australia, and the world, is rapidly being transformed by technological advancements and innovations.</para><para>These advances have already been recognised, and are being used, within the immigration and multicultural affairs portfolio.</para><para>In 1996, for example, the introduction of the electronic travel authority visa, also known as the “ETA”, substantially facilitated travel to Australia of overseas tourists.</para><para>The ETA is the most advanced and streamlined travel authorisation system in the world.</para><para>It enables visitors to obtain authority to enter Australia at the same time they book their travel arrangements.</para><para>The ETA is issued within seconds by computer links between my department, travel agents, airlines and specialist service providers around the world.</para><para>This has greatly benefited the tourism industry and Australia in general.</para><para>This bill will enable my department to further avail itself of developments in information technology and business processing, in several ways.</para><para>First, the bill facilitates electronic communications by removing existing impediments in the current legislation that may prevent the use of electronic transactions.</para><para>Second, the bill establishes a framework to allow for the use of computer programs to make decisions in the migration and citizenship context.</para><para>The approach taken is similar to that under the Social Security (Administration) Act.</para><para>Electronic lodgement of applications and computer-based decision making will provide new opportunities for clients who have previously been restricted by office hours.</para><para>Where services are available on-line, clients will be able to lodge electronic applications 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</para><para>This will provide greater convenience for clients in submitting applications.</para><para>Visa and citizenship services will only be provided electronically after all security and integrity risks are satisfied.</para><para>For example, systems will be carefully designed to guard against fraud.</para><para>As such, computer-based decision making will have a limited field of operation.</para><para>In the migration context, a computer program will only make decisions on certain visa applications where the grounds for grant are objective and where the criteria lend themselves to automated assessment.</para><para>A decision to cancel a visa will not be made by a computer program.  Computer-based processing is not suitable in these circumstances because these decisions require an assessment of discretionary factors.</para><para>Nonetheless, the legislative framework is sufficiently flexible to allow for technological advances which may occur in the future.</para><para>The challenge, however, is to have legislative strategies that allow for the use of these advances while providing adequate safeguards for both the integrity of government processes and achieving equity for clients.</para><para>To this end, safeguard measures have been incorporated into the bill.</para><para>Should a computer program not function correctly because of a computer-related error, the minister may substitute a more favourable decision for one made by the computer program.</para><para>This will ensure that adverse decisions can be corrected without inconveniencing the applicant.</para><para>I would like to emphasise that existing merits review rights of applicants will not be affected by these amendments.  All review decisions will continue to be made by a tribunal member.</para><para>Third, the bill provides the ways in which the minister, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal may give documents to persons.</para><para>The amendments also determine the time when the document is taken to have been received and allow for the transmission of documents electronically, to comply with the requirements of the electronic transactions act.</para><para>These amendments essentially consolidate into the migration act, existing provisions found in either the Migration Act or the Migration Regulations.</para><para>They clarify when notification of a decision occurs and on what date.</para><para>This is critical for review mechanisms, as an application for review must be made within a specified period, or the case is out of time.</para><para>Finally, the bill corrects some minor technical errors and misdescribed amendments in the Migration Act.</para><para>In summary, this bill facilitates electronic communications, embraces a new approach to decision making and consolidates legislative provisions for the giving and receiving of documents.</para><para>It is an important bill, and one which will ensure that my portfolio can give effect to the government's commitment to enable expanded use of electronic communications, while maintaining the integrity of Australia's

<inline ref="S171R1247">Corporations Bill 2001</inline> and related bills, the <inline ref="R1256">Financial Services Reform Bill 2001</inline> was introduced on 5 April. Further legislation was introduced on 7 June—including some important transitional, consequential and substantial amendments—and I understand that further amendments are to be introduced when the bill is actually debated for the first time in the House of Representatives next week. Meanwhile the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities has resolved to inquire into the bill, given that it is a substantially different bill to the draft that was circulated last year. This was done immediately so that the Financial Services Reform Bill could be introduced—again, so as to assist the government with the passage of the legislation. But the committee's task has been made harder by not knowing what the whole picture is.</para></talk.start><para>The Labor Party broadly supports the bills that we are examining today to the extent that the bills overcome the constitutional uncertainty surrounding the current Corporations Law scheme. While the arrangement that the Commonwealth has negotiated does reflect compromises and has resulted in increasing the voting power of the states in relation to certain proposed amendments to the Corporations Law, a national system of corporate regulation greatly facilitates business in Australia. The bills have the strong support of the business community as a necessary and relatively immediate solution to the uncertainty which has surrounded corporate law for the past two years. I do however urge the government to commit to finding a long-term solution to a national system of corporate regulation and to rectify any constitutional uncertainties surrounding other cooperative schemes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>24494</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is not that much to say about the <inline ref="R1247">Corporations Bill 2001</inline> and related bills, except for the need to get on with them and make sure that they become law as soon as possible. The Corporations Bill is the cornerstone of a package of bills introduced in response to the High Court's decisions in Wakim and Hughes and the consequent virtual collapse of the national Corporations Law scheme. The <inline ref="R1247">Corporations Bill 2001</inline> and related bills will, in effect, re-enact the Corporations Law as a Commonwealth act, capable of operating throughout Australia. To meet the provisions of the new agreement between the Commonwealth and the states on these matters, a significant rewrite of a number of sections was necessary to avoid the previous constitutional difficulties. The bills are not intended to effect any substantive policy changes. The agreement requires that the new national scheme will operate subject to a five-year sunset provision—which, in our view, is a negative—but it is anticipated that its operation will be extended beyond that period. This legislation will restore a reasonable level of certainty into corporate regulation. The government has given a commitment that the bills contain no new policy measures, and the inquiry of the corporations and securities committee, of which I was a part, confirms that view. Consequently, the Democrats propose to support the bills without amendment.</para></talk.start><para>Due to the need to expedite the passage of these bills, the Democrats do not propose to use the occasion of their presentation in the Senate to further pursue our agenda of amending, wherever necessary, the Corporations Law to address the democratisation of companies and to significantly improve corporate governance. For some years now, I have sought to amend bills relating to the Corporations Law to at least give the option to shareholders of implementing methods of greater accountability into the corporate governance of public companies. So far those amendments have not been successful, although there have been a number which I have been able to get up in conjunction with the Labor Party. I will continue to pursue those changes to empower shareholders and make directors more accountable, and I expect an opportunity to do that with future bills in this area.</para><para>There are other issues which require amendment, including provoking greater coverage of the remuneration disclosure clauses. I do know that Senator Conroy is very fond of that particular issue, and I can assure him of our support in that matter. I think this time around the government will be more supportive with the disclosure of remuneration than they were the last time around.</para><para>The status of Corporations Law in this country is dependent upon our Constitution. One of the great strengths of Australia might be regarded as its constitutional set-up, but sometimes it creates such real difficulties that you have to have sympathy for those who believe that a substantial constitutional rewrite would be helpful in some areas. The tremendous difficulty had by the Attorney-General and, indeed, his staff in trying to get agreement in this area I think is indicative of a circumstance which is undesirable. In my view, Corporations Law should be unequivocally in the hands of the Commonwealth, and the states should have nothing at all to do with it—and, if I could get a constitutional change to effect that, I would. But there we are: we have to first develop that change and, secondly, put it to the Australian people—and both those processes are very difficult.</para><para>The other thing I want to say—apart from the need, after 100 years, for a wholesale review of the Australian Constitution—is about the status of corporations generally in the eyes of the public. Corporations, particularly what is known as the big end of town or big business, attract an awful lot of opprobrium in the general community, and that arises most of all from the power and the effect they have in our society. I think it was the Labor Party who brought out Professor Saul from Canada; he is one of the people who research the powers of corporations world wide. I think it was his research that said that 51 of the major economies in the world are corporations. Those of us in nation states seek to protect ourselves and provide for peace and good outcomes by promoting democracy. It is democracy that protects the world most of all from many of the excesses to which it would otherwise succumb. Therefore, it is in the interests of nation states to pursue the democratisation of companies and to continually review the way in which companies are regulated and the effects and standards that they carry through.</para><para>I note for the purposes of the record that there is a company law review, for instance, presently being carried out in the United Kingdom, and a major issue right at the heart of that review is corporate governance. I think it is essential over time to keep reviewing the Corporations Law to ensure that it remains in step with community feelings. Whilst it is my party's belief that, on a taxation basis, as far as possible, entities that conduct business should all be taxed on a similar basis, I also hold the view that we need more diversity in terms of our entities. I think development in Corporations Law of something equivalent to the close corporation as developed in South Africa or the limited size of companies elsewhere in the world needs to be developed—a kind of mini version of Corporations Law that would be more suitable for small business and medium business, and perhaps even for micro business.</para><para>The other issue I wish to raise in my general remarks on these bills is the issue of the greater expectations of companies as expressed through legislation and regulation. It used to be that people believed that companies would do the right thing as a result of common values, common ethics and common standards, particularly as expressed through directors and management. More and more, however, there is an expectation that community standards need to be expressed in a prescriptive manner. That happens with environmental regulation. It happens with social regulation such as on health and safety, and we are starting to see real pressure on companies and indeed on legislators to legislate for sustainability measures—what is known as the `triple bottom line', which is awfully difficult to express in accounting terms but is an important view. I note that the United Kingdom government, for instance, in the Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment, and Assignment, Forfeiture, Bankruptcy etc.) Amendment Regulations 1999 have actively promoted ethical standards of investment. The United Kingdom government is taking the view that superannuation schemes and pension schemes have to report on ethical types of investments. A campaign has been running in this country for those sorts of views to be taken on board.</para><para>Sometimes it is necessary for governments to try and run ahead of the community, but in this case I think it would pay both the department and the minister concerned, in either this government or the next government, to look far more closely at what the expectations of the community are concerning our corporations and what should or should not be reasonably in the law to reflect that. Far too often the governments of the day focus just on the more efficient or simpler or more legalistic areas to the exclusion of values and value systems which people want attached to our corporations. They want those values and value systems attached to our corporations entirely because of the power, the effect and the impact that corporations have in our society.</para><para>However, after having ranged a bit in my remarks, I want to congratulate the government in finally persuading the recalcitrant states to come good on this. They were not all recalcitrant. I think New South Wales and Victoria behaved far better, for instance, than Western Australia and South Australia who both happened to be in the hands of Liberals at the time, although the Western Australian Liberal Attorney-General is a particularly eccentric sort of Liberal, I think. Anyway, well done! The Democrats will certainly support the passage of these bills.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>24496</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1247">Corporations Bill 2001</inline> and related bills are important. They are important bills for the sorts of reasons that have been raised by speakers before me. We have just heard an excellent speech from Senator Murray, who has many wise things to say in this chamber. I must say, though, that there is something I disagree with him about.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—Something more.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—That is right, Senator Murray. We do not agree on everything. Senator Murray took to task the states. This situation was because of the decision of the High Court—and the High Court is always, by definition, right. When the High Court made the right decision, that meant that Australia's understanding of how Corporations Law was to operate was thrown into some disorder. People throughout the country were alarmed—and properly alarmed—and measures were taken. The interesting thing is that after those measures were taken a right result was obtained.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We can be too precipitous in writing laws. We are a federation, and we have all the benefits and disadvantages that a federation brings. But I think we would be alarmed, the country having developed as it has for a hundred years, if we did suddenly have some central power that could make all laws that need to be made and that was the end of the matter. We would become like the United Kingdom, and that may be a problem.</para><para>This leads to a consideration of what forms corporate law. At the moment, corporate law is within the portfolio of the Treasurer. When we were in government, it was in the portfolio of the Attorney-General, and there were some great Attorneys-General who had much to say about corporate law. Mr Michael Duffy—you would remember him well, Mr Acting Deputy President Sherry—struggled for some time with corporate law. He was typical because, I think, corporate law is something that will never be settled. There is not, as it were, a situation we can reach where there will be no need for any more corporate law, because corporate law deals with companies and with companies' relationships with lots of other people. If you have relationships like that, then you are going to have the need to adjust the law. Family law, for example, is in a similar position because you are dealing with relationships and relationships keep changing. There are new developments in relationships and new laws need to encompass that.</para><para>With company operations, a whole series of relationships occurs. I will go through them all, although they are well known to everybody here. There is a relationship between the people who run the company—the board and the chief executive officer—and the owners, the shareholders. There is a relationship, depending on what sort of company it is, between the customers and the company. There are relationships between the people who work for the company and the company. There are relationships with the community as a whole. We have heard in this chamber many a discussion about companies' responsibilities to the environment, companies' responsibilities to employees, companies' responsibilities to customers, and so on. We have heard that the basic law is that the company's responsibility should be to its shareholders and to its own wellbeing. That concept came out of the common law in the 19th century, as Diane Brown, whom I see here, would know—she is very learned in this area, and I often rely upon her wisdom.</para><para>The concept of where company law has gone is interesting. It has been taken out of the Attorney-General's Department, which really deals with human relationships. It deals with the wide thrust of the law, which is really about putting into rules those standards that we should abide by as a decent community. This government has taken company law out of the Attorney-General's Department and put it across to Treasury, whose purpose is to see that the economy runs well and that the wealth of the nation increases. That is not so much concentrated upon the wellbeing of the community generally, except in the sense of getting money so that it can be expended for the good of the community. This brings up the concept of the proper balance between the economy and the community.</para><para>It is proper that we make political decisions about the Corporations Law in the context of the Constitution. Good political action requires discussions, an understanding of how things work, the testing of propositions and, finally, the application of wisdom to bring about the right results. Politics has had a big part to play in Corporations Law, and so it should, in my view. That theme is adopted by Mark J. Roe, a professor at the Columbia Law School, who has written a fascinating book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Strong Managers, Weak Owners—The Political Roots of American Corporate Finance</inline>. In his preface, he says:</para><quote><para>I show that politics—democracy in general, and American democracy in particular—affected the organization of the large firm. The interaction between firms and financiers was, and still is, mediated partly by politicians, and that mediation in a democratic society is a central—and neglected—explanation for the organizational forms we observe. Were the title—</para></quote><para>that is, the title of his book—</para><quote><para>not already taken, a good one for this book would have been <inline font-style="italic">The Visible Hand</inline>, because the visible hand of politics affected the structures of financial intermediaries, which in turn affected the structure of the large public firm.</para></quote><para>He says that the political decisions that have been made over the years in America are central to the way in which companies have developed and that that has been neglected, but he is bringing it forward. In the paragraph above the one I have just read, he says:</para><quote><para>American political organization has been important. Our federal system favored smaller, local interests over concentrated private economic power. An American antigovernment bias tended to suppress the alternative of allowing concentrated private economic power, and building a countervailing national political power in Washington: the public would have more easily accepted powerful private financial structures had there been a stronger central government.</para></quote><para>I accept that. In his learned address, Senator Murray said that it is a pity that the power to legislate for companies was not all centralised. If it were all centralised, we might have a corporate law which was more efficient in the sense of enabling more money to be made, but then companies' effects upon society may well have been much more adverse.</para><para>What the High Court did might not have been as bad as we might at first think. It applied the law according to the Constitution, and that has led to the situation that we have now arrived at: everybody across the board accepts the legislation that is now before us. Although economic efficiency is good and economic efficiency should be encouraged, proper weight should be given to the political process. We are now going through the political process. It has been a good political process. We are coming up with a bill that people find satisfactory at least. The business world can breathe a sigh of relief. The states are comfortable with the bill. Of course, the states can withdraw the power if they feel like it, but clearly, if it works, that will not happen. A referendum giving the right powers to the Commonwealth might be contemplated—it might have been a way out of this—but, in the end, what we have reached is fair enough.</para><para>It is not only the Corporations Law that has been changed; all the other law that goes along with it has been changed too. In particular, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Bill 2001 has been brought up to the point where it can operate as was intended, in the same way as the Corporations Law is to operate. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is absolutely essential to the way corporate law runs. Mr David Knott, who presently heads up the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has shown a lot of energy and wisdom in this area, and I want to note that. He succeeded another person who deserves that praise, namely Alan Cameron, who ran that organisation immediately before he did. When he first came to this area, he ran the Australian Securities Commission. In these speeches, I always like to pay tribute to Henry Bosch. He ran the National Companies and Securities Commission. He was a man of great wisdom. He is near my age and anyone near my age must have wisdom and judgment. I am sure that Senator Denman would agree with that, not that she has got anywhere near my age.</para><para>The point is that we can have all the good law in the land but, unless we have the right people administering it, it can all go wrong. In that context of people who have contributed, I think we ought to pay tribute to the advisers from the department in the boxes over there who have had to get this legislation up to speed—isn't that right, Senator Patterson?—and which has now been presented in the chamber. I think we ought to give them a bit of praise as well.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—You don't even need their votes!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—No, this is all going to go through.

These are important pieces of legislation. The importance of this legislation ultimately is this: companies are now perhaps the most central institution in our society. It has been said that some companies have empires around the world in all sorts of different countries. Some companies have incomes of vast proportions. We must stop looking at company law simply as a means of balancing company rights against the rights of others. We must start looking at company law almost as a constitution for companies so that companies have a set of laws that cause them to act in a way best suited to the community as a whole. Those old 19th century ideas that linger, where those who own the company have what are often selfish ends met and where companies are somehow considered to be a benign influence in the world of capitalism, and that is all, must go and we must start to see companies as they really are: as very big forces in a community. The churches do not have the power they used to have and I do not think politics has the power it used to have. Those powers have decreased, but the powers of companies have increased and it is in that light that we should start looking at corporate law. These bills have given me the opportunity to say those things and, having said them, I will now sit down.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>24498</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I follow the remarks of Senator Cooney in this debate and wish to add some short matters to it.

In passing, Senator Cooney referred to the underpinning issues of corporatisation and globalisation which he viewed as going hand in hand. I am not sure if the world is yet ready for a world corporate court. That might be a little further away, although corporations might be pursuing it in their own way.</para></talk.start><para>If it was not for a smart bootmaker, we would not be here today dealing with Corporations Law. The smart bootmaker was Solomon who, in a famous case, started what has brought us to where we are now. The Corporations Law has had a long development, stretching from the 19th century to now. In that long development, there has been an incubation of various concepts that have been teased out and developed. It is an issue that has confronted us throughout the ages. One of the issues that confronted us recently—the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum call it a `recent event'; it has taken two years to deal with Re Wakim, which is not recent, in my view—was a difficult issue and now seems to have been resolved, at least for the states of New South Wales and Victoria, although the caveat is that it can be sunsetted in five years or that either state could withdraw from it. From reading the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum, I understand that the other states will come on board. A couple of caveats also surround their involvement in the system.</para><para>In response to Senator Murray's suggestion of a national scheme, Senator Cooney commented on one of the difficulties that have confronted people not only in Corporations Law but in other jurisdictions and other areas in relation to our federalist system. Unfortunately, I did not hear the contribution by Senator Murray, but one can assume it suggested that it would be a lot easier with a national system—devoid of the necessity of dealing with the states. The case of Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd was one of the matters that went through the full Federal Court and then on to the High Court. It was subject to the Re Wakim decision and it found it difficult to get around it. In a sense, it found its way through by using the accrued jurisdiction of the Federal Court, rather than dealing with it as the Federal Court did, in saying it was a matter that was subject to Re Wakim. I am saying that in short form, so the lawyers that are present might excuse me for that. Page 4 of that decision states:</para><quote><para>The significance of the decision in <inline font-style="italic">Re Wakim</inline> appears from the following statement:</para><para>`Australia is a federation of a dualist kind, consistently with the common law tradition. While some provisions in the Constitution provide for co-operation, they do not fundamentally alter its dualist character; indeed, if anything, they reinforce it. The nature of the Australian constitutional system needs to be borne in mind in designing co-operative procedures. The issues at stake essentially are questions of principle.'</para></quote><para>When dealing with these areas, we must take on board the dualist nature of our system. We do understand that it has to be a cooperative system and, in truth, that is the strength of our system. It is a federation and we can learn from that. If we then deal with it as a federation and as a dualist system, we can provide excellent responses to it rather than, in some instances, treat it as a single system or a unitary system.</para><para>The mechanism that has been adopted in the corporations bills has taken some of the elements of a dualist system on board and has developed a unique solution by using a power that was provided in the Constitution to deal with one of these issues. I refer ostensibly to section 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution, which goes to the broader issue of examining how you would then deal with inconsistencies in matters that arose. The 1890s debates of our founding forefathers, when dealing with the Constitution, went to this provision. We could utilise this provision in obtaining the approval of states to move the federation forward. Section 51(xxxvii) deals with:</para><quote><para>... matters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliament or Parliaments of any State or States, but so that the law shall extend only to States by whose Parliaments the matter is referred, or which afterwards adopt the law ...</para></quote><para>Perhaps if we had looked at those provisions a lot earlier and tried a little harder, we would not be where we are today, although that is a matter of history.</para><para>The report of the provisions that deal with the bill itself takes the history right from the inception—at least, there was a national will to invoke a corporations system which was national in its character and which allowed the business world to deal with the national scene and the international scene and to allow both corporate citizens and corporate entities to further their goals. From memory, its incubation was from about 1961 to 1 January 1991, when we came up with a national scheme. It was not for want of trying on the part of the parties who put their minds to developing a national scheme. However, this current reconfiguration of a national scheme will—I trust the government in this one instance—meet the needs of business, meet the needs of being able to deal in a corporate world and meet the requirements of business for certainty in dealing with both legislation and the contracts that it desires to be made.</para><para>The corporations bills, then, are a collection of bills in response to the High Court's decision in Re Wakim and, later, Hughes. The bills are designed to replace the Corporations Act 1989. That present scheme started on 1 January 1991 and is administered by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Central to that national scheme were the cross-vesting provisions, which were seen as the solution to establishing a national Corporations Law. As we discovered earlier, examination of the Constitution itself might have highlighted the solution which we have now adopted. However, the cross-vesting legislation did not survive in its entirety when challenged in the High Court. It is a matter of history now that the High Court cast doubt on the constitutional foundation and the important element of the Corporations Law scheme. The term `cross-vesting' is used to describe legislative arrangements which allow federal, state and territory courts to exercise each other's jurisdictions and which provide for transfers and removals to ensure that cases are heard in the appropriate courts.</para><para>So we had a system that said that, in relation to matters where litigants wished to pursue particular cases, they would be transferred to the appropriate jurisdiction to be dealt with. The heart of the cross-vesting legislation was to enable that to occur. The decision in Re Wakim made the cross-vesting arrangements invalid to the extent that they tried to confer state jurisdiction on a Federal Court. The general scheme was established by the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987, which was Commonwealth legislation. Reciprocal legislation in the states and territories was designed to give effect to that scheme. It was useful in that a matter could be instituted in a superior court. It was useful in that the matter could then be heard in that superior court, which was deemed appropriate for that time.</para><para>The outcome of the process since the cross-vesting legislation gave that power, particularly in the national scheme that was envisaged in the 1991 Corporations Law, was that we would then have a Federal Court which could develop a body of case law, a body of precedent and a sophisticated expertise in dealing with corporations matters. Of course it was highly regarded, and still is highly regarded, so much so that there has been at least a drive—which is reflected in the current bill before us today—to reinstitute the Federal Court into a pre-eminent position as one of our bodies that deal with Corporations Law in a thoughtful, meaningful, pragmatic and appropriate way.</para><para>Unfortunately for the Federal Court, the demise of part of the cross-vesting scheme in relation to the corporations part, on which it relied in dealing with the federal inability to confer state jurisdiction, resulted in a significant reduction of its workload. The number of cases that were filed in the Federal Court dropped significantly—in fact, down to a very slow dribble. The matters, consequently, had to be taken and filed in the state supreme courts, and in effect this was a travelling backwards in time to prior to the cross-vesting legislation when the state supreme courts would deal with Corporations Law matters.</para><para>Of course, business likewise argued that it was no longer a satisfactory solution to allow matters to go back to the state supreme courts, although this was not a reflection on the state supreme courts themselves. The short solution to overcome this was seen by the states as at least ensuring that the decisions made by the Federal Court were still sound. The so-called federal courts states jurisdictions act of 1999 was passed. The legislation did two things. Firstly, it provided that parties in judgments of the Federal Court have the same rights as if those judgments were judgments of the state supreme court. Secondly, it provided for state matters commenced in a federal court and part-heard to be transferred to the state supreme court, at least ensuring that parties would not lose their rights.</para><para>It did not, however, address what the current bill does—the viability of the national scheme over time—or ensure that the Federal Court would be replaced in its position as the pre-eminent court to deal with Federal Court matters dealing with corporations. The decisions which created so much uncertainty were Re Wakim and, to a lesser extent, Hughes—although Hughes did raise further problems, which I will not go into in great detail today. They are certainly highlighted in a report of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, which examined this bill in detail and reported in May 2001. This valuable report does provide insightful comment about the problems that arose as a consequence of Re Wakim and Hughes.</para><para>Let us get to the element most needed by business, the community and people who deal with corporations. Corporations are sometimes given the enigmatic appearance of being large organisations which are faceless, but in essence they encourage trade, they deal with trade, they deal with contracts and they allow the ordinary discourse of business. The solution which was put forward came from a joint meeting of the standing committee of the Attorney-General, which agreed in principle sometime back in August 2000 that the preferred realistic option for resolving the current dilemma would be to proceed with a referral system. However, the devil was in the detail, and that unfortunately foundered on some difficult rocks.</para><para>The Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria did agree to overcome the difficulties in any event. The need to ensure certainty and consistency in this area was certainly going to overcome obstacles that arose. At least the target date for parties is 1 July 2000. At this stage we know that New South Wales and Victoria have signed up. The other states are, we understand, in the process or have signed up as we speak. If not, they are not very far away.</para><para>There were some impediments: the growth in the federal area to overcome the states and the states were reticent to give up any of their power in relation to the industrial relations area. The solution which was put forward by the Commonwealth was to provide an objects clause about that matter to ensure that there was no desire by the Commonwealth to overcome, through this mechanism, the states ability to deal with industrial relations on a state basis. One of the good things about the mechanism is that it does allow the states to opt out or to walk away if they find the system not working. I doubt that will happen, as Senator Cooney has said. The desire to have a national uniform system of Corporations Law will ensure that the parties maintain a good working relationship, and it does allow the states to have a little bit more say with the Commonwealth about how a national system will work. It provides a return to certainty.</para><para>On the matter of how to solve it in the longer term, the legislation is one of those solutions that can stay. An alternative course that has been suggested is a constitutional change. The Senate, more than most, understands the difficulties that can be presented with trying to achieve a constitutional solution or amendment to the Constitution. Also, other matters that could have been taken up which would have allowed a return to certainty may have been canvassed. But in truth the basis of quickness, the ease of bringing the legislation before us and the certainty of restoring confidence in our Federal Court in dealing with national legislation and the Corporations Law suggested that the referral power would, in effect, be the best solution at this point in time. It was seen as a mechanism to allow flexibility for the parties. That was also a matter that was at the forefront of the 1890 debates, when that provision in the Constitution was put in. It was seen as a flexibility mechanism in the Constitution.</para><para>In conclusion, the New South Wales and Victorian agreement on the referral will ensure that at least the key problems which have been highlighted in the past about the referral system—whether a state retains power to legislate in a matter which it has referred to the Commonwealth, whether a reference may be made subject to conditions in its excise or duration or whether it can in fact have a sunset provision—will not eventuate. These are matters which were answered a while ago now—in the constitutional commission of the 1980s—in the affirmative. They are still alive today. But it would appear from the overall drive to ensure that there is a national scheme that those problems people perceived will not eventuate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>24502</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I genuinely thank all honourable senators for their contribution to the debate and thank Senator Ludwig for being brief, as he promised at the outset of his remarks.</para></talk.start><para>A couple of remarks made by both Senator Tierney and Senator Ludwig do deserve a response and amplification. Senator Ludwig referred to the fact that we have solved the problem as a federation and we have done so in a cooperative way. We did that as a federation back in 1990. Senator Cooney was the chairman of the committee that handled the legislation that put in place the scheme that we will have in place until this legislation comes into effect. It was rudely shaken by the High Court's decision of last year.</para><para>Senator Cooney would remember that the then opposition, which I was a very young member of, ensured that that legislation was passed by the Senate: not without proper scrutiny—we did hold a one night hearing and we put it under scrutiny. He would recall, perhaps better than Senator Ludwig, that even to get to the scheme that we put in place as a parliament and as a federation in the dying days of 1990—it came into effect on 1 January 1991—took an extraordinary amount of effort by the then government. I think Lionel Bowen was the Attorney-General and I think Michael Duffy might have taken over the batten. And it took an extraordinary amount of effort by the parliaments and the Attorneys-General of each of our states and territories, to an extent.</para><para>It answers the question that Senator Ludwig asked about why we did not do the referral of powers in those days. I think Senator Cooney and I know the answer to that. States do not give up their power lightly; nor should they. The history of centralised unitary governments is not a good one in terms of protecting the rights of individuals. Australia is blessed with a very strong federation, very much because of the foresight of our founding fathers in ensuring that we had some very strong checks and balances and constitutional and institutional bulwarks against the centralising tendencies of federations. Australia has been very well served there. The evolution of the Corporations Law is a very good example of that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator Cooney</name></talker><para>—Can you take this interjection?

The more interesting point about my involvement, since the honourable senator has raised it, is in fact that I was—as you would know better than most—very cautious about this new scheme. I was particularly cautious because a number of my friends and colleagues in the then state parliament were cautious. You will recall the Hon. Robert Pike, who was very concerned about the 1990 scheme. Senator Lightfoot was not a member of the upper house in that particular year; he was soon thereafter. Our dear, departed Mr Pike was a member.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There was a group of business people in Western Australia, called the WA Opposition Group—a very distinguished group of lawyers led by Mr Laurie Shervington, now of Minter Ellison I think, and then of Northmore, Hale, Davey and Leake—who formed a group of corporate lawyers and other business people who were very concerned about the centralisation of the Corporations Law under the Commonwealth. I think I can speak accurately for Mr Shervington, who was very instrumental in ensuring the shape of the law. He was consulted by the then Attorney-General and consulted by Mr Lavarch after the law came into effect. Mr Shervington—along with others, I am sure, in the other outlying smaller states—ensured that the intent of the scheme was that the states did have a say in how ASIC would conduct itself, that there would have to be votes when there were substantive changes to the law and that regulations did maintain the intent of the parliament and the people who forged the new scheme. I was privileged to be the parliamentary secretary with responsibility for ASIC between November 1996 and October 1998. I can say that the states—the ministers in particular; the Attorneys-General who made up the ministerial council on corporations—took their roles very seriously, as they always do in these things.</para><para>The Commonwealth, although it tended to get its way, had to work very closely with the states on a range of issues and has had to continue to do so. To answer a question raised by Senator Conroy, those same mechanisms that ensure that the states are heard, are in place in this bill. As all honourable senators have said, this is a very important piece of legislation that creates the constitutional certainty that is required. As a result of reforms, particularly over the past couple of years through the Corporations Law Economic Reform Program, Australia has in place a Corporations Law that is the envy of many jurisdictions around the world.</para><para>It is interesting to read the debate that is currently raging in Europe over takeovers reform. There is a clear perception around Europe, internationally and across the English Channel in the city of London over the future of the takeovers regime in Europe. It is quite clear from the debate that is raging about that particular important segment of the Corporations Law that, if Europe does not get their takeovers directive right, it will be a massive competitive disadvantage for businesses headquartering anywhere within the European Union. This throws focus on the importance of the Corporations Law reforms that this government has put in place over the past couple of years.</para><para>It is crucial for a nation of Australia's size—with something less than two per cent of world capital markets—that all of our Corporations Law, and the law governing our financial sector generally, is at the leading edge. You cannot afford to rest in this area—you need to keep your eye on the ball—so I take this opportunity to once again make a plea to the Australian Labor Party and to the Australian Democrats to look at their opposition to the government's takeovers reforms in relation to the follow-on rule. It is a crucial piece of reform. It is a piece of undone business that will ensure that the performance of corporate boards at the top end of town is put under constant pressure through a real and live daily threat to corporate control. There is a reluctance on the part of the Senate to embrace reforms that would ensure that members of boards, sitting in their comfortable leather chairs, are put under a serious day-by-day threat from the marketplace and to ensure that our takeovers law is in sync with the best takeovers provisions in the world, and they are based in the city of London—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Just like the club.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—Senator Conroy talks about the club.

We believe that, to ensure that boards do not become comfortable—to ensure that the clubrooms become far more uncomfortable—they should be subject to the pressure of a follow-on rule and mandatory bids that ensure that control can pass in a freer marketplace.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—Senator Conroy wants to defend the comfortable people in the clubs in Collins Street and the clubs in Sydney who become entrenched in their directorships and who are subject to very little competition for corporate control because the Labor Party and their friends on the crossbenches—the Democrats—refuse to ensure takeovers reform in this country and that the takeover code is left behind. We could have a world leading regime in Australia that ensures particularly that our leading ICT sector companies are able to do mergers and acquisitions to give them scale. We are talking about the Corporations Law, and of course takeovers are a crucial part of that. When it comes to takeovers reform and building a good corporate sector in Australia and a competitive environment for corporate control, I will never let a chance go by.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With those comments, I have provided to Senator Conroy written responses to the particular concerns he raised. If he would like me to put them on the record I would be happy to but, really, they say that there are no substantive changes to the law involved. There was also a reference in Senator Conroy's questions to some points made by Alan Cameron, the former distinguished head of ASIC, in relation to some numbering changes and cross-referencing changes that have been made. Apart from that, I can assure you that there are no substantive policy changes. There is also a summary in the document I have provided to Senator Conroy, which I am happy to have tabled, that talks about the progress of the legislation in each of the state parliaments.</para><para>I note that, in my home state of Western Australia, the legislation has been referred to a parliamentary committee. I take this opportunity to commend the bill to that committee and to that parliament. This is an important change that has been made, and I can speak on behalf of Laurie Shervington and the people who have worked very hard on corporations matters in Western Australia for the past decade or so in saying that the business community is very keen to see this law put in place. It is very different from what happened in 1990, when there was a reluctance to put in place a new national scheme. The Western Australian business community, including small business, medium enterprises and very large businesses such as Wesfarmers are very keen to see this new scheme put in place. I call on my parliamentary colleagues in the Western Australian parliament to listen very carefully to the business community in Western Australia when enacting this important legislation.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bills read a second time, and passed through their remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24504</page.no><id.no>R1111</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>24504</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 5 April.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>24504</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the committee insists on the amendments made by the Senate to which the House of Representatives has disagreed.</para></motion><para>I would like to make some remarks in relation to the <inline ref="R1111">Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000</inline>. Senators will recall that the last time this bill was before the Senate the government flagged the view that the provisions we are dealing with, which the ALP, the Democrats and I think some other senators voted to excise from the bill, relates to provisions that enable the ACCC to take representative actions on behalf of them, particularly in relation to the secondary boycott provisions.</para><para>The government has made a decision that has been flagged publicly that it will not hold up the many other benefits that will flow from the reform of the Trade Practices Act by seeking to continue the disagreement between the two houses on this issue. I certainly would like to make it clear that the government is committed in a policy sense to pursuing this. We are somewhat bamboozled at the incredible backflip performed by the Australian Labor Party. It is probably not incredible when you are made aware of the policy paucity, the policy laziness, on the other side and also the incredible power that the trade union movement has over Labor Party members and senators. It is not surprising that that power exists, because most members on the other side of the chamber are either active union members or have come from careers within the union movement.</para><para>During the last debate, I believe Senator Andrew Murray made the point that he would like to see far greater disclosure of the union movement's donations and influence over the Australian Labor Party. What occurred during debate on this bill earlier this year should ring loud alarm bells with not only Senator Murray and the Australian Democrats but also anyone who cares about parliamentary democracy. We saw on a series of occasions late last year a range of Labor spokesmen making comments about not only how desirable this bill was for Australia but also how desirable this very provision of the bill was for Australia. I quote none other than Joel Fitzgibbon, the shadow spokesman for small business, on 9 November 2000 at approximately 1.22 p.m. in the House of Representatives, when he said:</para><quote><para>The ACCC already has the power to take representative actions under parts IVA and V of the act, and it makes sense to extend that to part IV.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>This is a sensible amendment and both the Reid committee and the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector unanimously recommended it. </para></quote><para>This chap in the other place was very enthusiastic, and he was joined in his enthusiasm by Mr Kim Wilkie, who I might say is very hard to get enthusiastic about anything. But on this issue Mr Wilkie became almost animated, which again is unusual for Mr Wilkie. He said:</para><quote><para>It gives small businesses more reasonable powers to be able to seek redress and fairness ...</para></quote><para>He is right. On this occasion Mr Wilkie actually got it right. It may have been an aberration, but he is in fact right. He said:</para><quote><para>It gives small businesses more reasonable powers to be able to seek redress and fairness in relation to unconscionable conduct. It is a most important bill—</para></quote><para>right again, Mr Wilkie—</para><quote><para>given the lost opportunities that the government has had since it came to power to amend and improve the Trade Practices Act.</para></quote><para>I tell you what, Mr Acting Temporary Chairman, it is pretty hard to amend things like the Trade Practices Act when you have to bring the bills through this place, the Senate, when you have the trade union movement's advocates sitting on the other benches. Mr Wilkie also said:</para><quote><para>Small businesses are crying out for fairer competition laws ...</para></quote><para>Hear, hear, Mr Wilkie—yes, they are, and they are crying out for representative actions. So Mr Wilkie was behind us at 5.08 p.m. on 9 November, and he was joined by Stephen Martin, another Labor member. On 27 November, Mr Martin said:</para><quote><para>As I have indicated, they certainly chose to support the measure that the Trade Practices Act be amended to give the ACCC the power to undertake representative actions and to seek damages on behalf of third parties under part IV of the act—and that is great; Labor certainly supported that. </para></quote><para>Stephen Martin would know this, because I think at one stage he was the shadow minister for small business. So he would have actually spoken to small businesses about this. At the risk of boring you, Mr Acting Temporary Chairman, I will just repeat what he said:</para><quote><para>... and that is great; Labor certainly supported that.</para></quote><para>That is, the power to undertake representative actions and to seek damages on behalf of third parties. </para><para>And what are we talking about? What is Mr Martin talking about? He made the point that I made back in March—that is, that taking action under the secondary boycott provisions is something that a Woolworths or a Coles can do because they have a legal department and they have significant resources. If you are the little local super value store or the little local grocery store and you are being affected by a secondary boycott—you might have a lawyer you employ every now and again for contractual or commercial reasons, but you probably never contemplate suing someone and taking action under the Trade Practices Act because of the resources you would require—you would need a bank account of potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars to take these sorts of actions. </para><para>The government has sought to put these provisions in the law to ensure that those small businesses—which are obviously in head to head competition with massive nationwide and sometimes internationally based organisations which can afford big legal departments and big legal bills—are provided with an option, a remedy, a course of action that is open to small businesses. Labor has said no—and sadly they have said no to this important provision with the support of the Australian Democrats. Kelvin Thomson, another Labor member of the other place, said:</para><quote><para>The ACCC currently has the power in part IVA and part V, so this change will help make the act more consistent and help to protect small business people. Let me also indicate that I think these changes are very modest and that more action is needed in this area generally.</para></quote><para>So he was saying that we should go further—but, again, he was supporting it. That was on 28 November 2000 at 4.51 p.m.</para><para>What happened between 4.51 p.m. and 5.12 p.m. on 28 November? This is something that Senator Murray should look at very closely. Anyone who is contemplating a vote for Labor, but who is concerned about the incredible and quite often insidious influence of the trade union movement upon people who are elected by the people and come into this place, should look closely at this and ask Labor: who took a phone call on 28 November 2000 between 4.51 p.m., when Mr Kelvin Thomson spoke in the other place, and 5.12 p.m., when Mr Bevis, the shadow minister for industrial relations—not small business; nothing to do with the Trade Practices Act—spoke? It was 21 minutes. That 21 minutes is the closest parallel to the faceless men photograph and description of the Labor Party back when Gough Whitlam was trying to reform the Australian Labor Party. In that 21 minutes a phone call was received by someone in the Labor Party in this building from someone outside the building. We will not hear who they were, Senator Murray, because they do not have to reveal these sorts of things. Mr Bevis said:</para><quote><para>... the Labor Party do not believe that the secondary boycott provisions should be dealt with under trade practices law. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—The point I was making before we suspended an hour ago was that between 4.51 p.m. and 5.12 p.m. on 28 November—I am assured that it was a period of about 21 minutes—a telephone call was made from someone in the union movement we would suggest and we saw the Labor Party do one of the most miraculous backflips in Australian political history. Within less than half an hour they went from saying, `What a fantastic amendment this is that we are debating tonight,' to saying—in Mr Bevis's speech on 28 November at 5.12 p.m.—that this was part of some ideological campaign in the industrial relations community by the government. I will remind the chamber that this was 21 minutes later. I find this quite incredible, and it is the only evidence you need to know that the Labor Party in government are certainly a government of the people, by the people, for the people, as long as those people are trade union officials. Twenty-one minutes after Mr Thomson said that this was an important change and a good change to the legislation, Mr Bevis said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>... the Labor Party do not believe that the secondary boycott provisions should be dealt with under trade practices law ... it is our intention to move amendments to carve out the secondary boycott provisions from this bill so that it is clear that the wider, more extensive powers that the bill affords the ACCC are not used as a backdoor method by the government in its ongoing ideological campaign in the industrial relations community.</para></quote><para>That comment was made at the same time that Joel Fitzgibbon, the shadow minister for small business, was saying, `This is a sensible amendment'. Mr Wilkie, the member for Swan, said that `small businesses are crying out' for this, and Mr Martin said that this would give the ACCC power `to take representative action and to seek damages on behalf of third parties for breaches of part IV of the act'. That was great. Labor certainly supported that. But 21 minutes and one or two telephone calls later, a huge backflip occurred. We know who is in control of the Labor Party. That seems to be the only reason that Labor have given for this incredible backflip, this awesome abuse of union power within the Australian political process and this abuse of small business. We want small businesses to be able to go to the ACCC and seek the use of representative actions in the case of alleged secondary boycotts. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats do not want small businesses to have that open to them. In fact, the union movement do not want the people to have that open to them. </para><para>The ALP's contention is that the government could use the powers afforded the ACCC in some mythical, ideological campaign. In fact, the record shows that the ACCC has been in a position to take action against secondary boycotts since the current provisions came into effect in 1997 and in that time has undertaken only a handful of cases. Under section 29 of the act a minister cannot direct the ACCC on part IV matters. As I think all Australians know, the ACCC—and I challenge any member of the Labor Party to allege otherwise—guards this independence closely. Small businesses can take action under the Workplace Relations Act but those actions are necessarily restricted to actions provided for by that act and generally speaking must be employment related. The Workplace Relations Act does not give small business the right to take actions arising out of an alleged breach of the anticompetitive conduct provisions, including the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>24507</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition support the position we originally took in the Senate that the <inline ref="R1111">Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000</inline> be amended to exclude this government proposal.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Order, Senator Campbell.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—The parliamentary secretary is getting quite excited. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—I am amused.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—Well, you can be amused or bemused. The parliamentary secretary talked about the government's interest in small business. Over the last 12 months, the government have let loose on small business the worst regime of regulation and red tape in the history of Federation. That is why out in the electorate small businesses are burning the coalition to pieces in resentment and anger. They were told that they were going to get a better and simpler tax system with the introduction of the GST. They were told that they were going to have a more efficient tax system. They were told in the 1996 election that there would be a 50 per cent reduction in red tape for small business. That was the unequivocal promise by the Prime Minister and the coalition.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The indisputable facts are that, since this government came to office and since the introduction of the new tax system, the tax act has gone from 3,500 pages to over 8,000 pages and the requirement to fill in forms has spiralled out of control. Every day we see stories in the paper of small business being interviewed about the nightmare of red tape and the nightmare of trying to fill in the BAS form. This government said, `It's only one or two pages, but by the way you have to read a 180-page document to know how to fill the one or two pages in.' So for any minister of this government to get up and say that they are in favour of small business and are trying to help small business is just hypocritical in view of what the government has done to small business. I draw the parliamentary secretary's attention to an article that appeared in today's <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> or yesterday's Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun Sunday</inline> about a businessman reconditioning engines in the Alston electorate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Aston?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—Sorry, the Aston electorate.

He has apparently voted Liberal all his life but feels absolutely dudded by what this government has done to his small business through the tax changes. So with those introductory remarks, I will explain to the parliamentary secretary and the government why we will reject the message from the House of Representatives.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The <inline ref="R1111">Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000</inline> has come back to the Senate tonight in its original form because the government has rejected Labor's proposed amendments. This is confirmation that in this debate the government is prepared to put the big end of town and its obsession with the trade union movement ahead of the small business interests. Again, the only group of people now cheering on the GST and the tax changes are a small circle of mates of the Liberal Party out of the big end of town. Of course, they have bureaucracies in those big, private companies who can handle the paperwork. The GST was drawn up with the influence of the big end of town who knew that they would have accountants and lawyers to help them fill the forms in. They did not care about small business and what they would have to do. So it is clear that, on any issue dealing with the economy, when this government is faced with a conflict between big and small business big business always wins.</para><para>We have known since the lower house rejected Labor's amendments that this transmission was coming back to the Senate, and that is why tomorrow my colleague in the lower house Mr Joel Fitzgibbon, the shadow minister for small business, and I who represent him in this place will be introducing private members bills that pick up the recommendations of the retailing committee. What is the government doing today by rejecting this Senate message? It is putting at risk all of those initiatives that have been begging for adoption since 1997. The Reid committee made its recommendations to the parliament, and here we are in the year 2001 still trying as an opposition to get them through the parliament. Why are we having difficulty getting them through the parliament? The government is allowing its intransigence on this issue and its obsessive hatred of the trade union movement—which has just been shown again tonight by the parliamentary secretary, and we hear it in question time day in, day out—to be ahead of the interests of small business.</para><para>The government says that these recommendations were adopted by the retailing committee only two years ago, a committee of which I was a member, and we are still considering them. The government was dragged screaming to the establishment of a retailing committee after Labor took the initiative, and then what did the government do next? It made sure none of the recommendations would ever see the light of day. Mr Bruce Baird, the Liberal member from the lower house, was handed the poisoned chalice as the committee's chair. The government was never serious about implementing any initiatives flowing out of the committee, and it was made abundantly clear to the chair that it would not accept any changes. This was doubly clear when the government rejected the Baird committee's recommendation that a mandatory retail code be established.</para><para>The secondary boycott provisions in sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act are not necessary to implement the objectives of the Reid and Baird committees. What the committees had in mind was the misuse of market power provisions of the act. Currently, the ACCC can take action against a firm guilty of misuse of market power and secure fines of up to $10 million. However, that penalty is of no assistance to a small business that has been injured by the actions of a larger player in the market. These matters go to sections 46 and 47 of the Trade Practices Act. At no time did either the Reid committee or the Baird committee consider 45D and 45E to be an issue for small business. These were committees chaired by the Liberal Party with a coalition majority on them. That is the point we make. When the committees dealt with these issues, we got bipartisan recommendations. This is what this government, for ideological reasons, now chooses to ignore.</para><para>My colleague Mr Fitzgibbon and I will be challenging members of the government to support those bills as a sign of their commitment to small business. This will be a true test of their mettle and a sign to the small business sector of the Howard government's sincerity towards small business. We know that this sector, as I said in my opening remarks, is tax reform weary, battle fatigued and struggling to keep its head above the water in the government imposed GST environment. We have no compunction in rejecting the government's view on this bill. We have no compunction at all in voting against the message from the House of Representatives. </para><para>What we do look forward to is the debate in the small business community in the next six months about comparing what this government has done to small business with what the small business future should be under a Labor government with an effective roll-back in a number of areas. We cannot unscramble all the egg, but we will be able to make a number of initiatives to improve the small business environment. With this GST tax reform package, one million small businesses in Australia have been left to hang and in many cases go broke or have their long-term interests destroyed by an ideologically obsessed government. We look forward to the debate in the election campaign. We look forward to small business making it clear to this government that they have been sold a dud and they have had their economic prospects and prosperity wrecked for stupid reasons. The government's bill is a mealy-mouthed effort to divert the attention of the small business community away from the GST imposed havoc and blame the trade union movement. We know that is not going to work, and it has not worked. Therefore, the opposition very strongly rejects the message from the House of Representatives and the government's position.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>24509</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1111">Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000</inline> is a good bill. It is a bill that we welcomed. It took far too long to get to the parliament in the first place, some eight months, but it did introduce five out of the 10 unanimous recommendations of the Liberal, Labor, National and Democrat political parties. So five out of 10 was what came forward, and we fully supported those recommendations and approaches. In that respect, Mr Acting Chairman, you would wonder why the government would put at risk what would be welcome changes by the small business community, for the sake of rejecting two amendments from the Senate that do not alter the existing law at all. The schedule of amendments made by the Senate, to which the House of Representatives has disagreed, states that the ACCC can already take actions under the secondary boycott provisions and may seek monetary penalties or injunctions; equally, individuals may seek injunctions, damages or an ancillary order under the secondary boycott provisions. So already there are laws, which both we and the government support, which would not be affected if the Senate amendments were to be accepted; they would just not be strengthened in the way that the government wants.</para></talk.start><para>I understand the government's position, but we have not supported it. In preparing myself for today's debate, I had another look at my second reading remarks on this issue. I will repeat them pretty well verbatim, if I may, because not much has changed. At that time I stated that the amendments:</para><quote><para>... remove sections 45D and 45E—which deal with secondary boycotts and contracts affecting the supply of goods or services—from section 87, which will provide for representative actions. Sections 45D and 45E are provisions that are, to a greater or lesser extent, related to industrial action by employees or unions. It is fair to say that, from memory, when the retailing sector committee considered the idea of representative actions under part IV of the Trade Practices Act, no attention was paid to those workplace relations provisions being present in part IV. </para></quote><para>I was a member of that committee; there is nowhere that I can recall them ever being raised. I continued:</para><quote><para>They might have been in the minds of some people but I cannot remember their being discussed. As I recall, most of us were concerned about the ability of the ACCC to take representative actions for things like predatory pricing and anticompetitive behaviour. I make the point that, for small business in particular, there is no other recourse but to the ACCC for anticompetitive behaviour but, where workplace relations matters are concerned, small business has recourse to the Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>The Democrats [did] not see that these two need to be combined or that the need [was] readily apparent. When I, as the Democrats' representative on the committee, concurred in the report, I confess that the issue of secondary boycotts and sections 45D and 45E was not in my mind, and I suspect it was not in the minds of the Labor members of the committee, who also concurred in the report. I have specifically asked the shadow minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, about his memory of that, and he said it was not in his mind at the time.</para></quote><para>So here we have a committee that reviewed certain small business issues and then came to some conclusions, and the government has extended those conclusions to take in an area of concern—that is, of concern to the government but not at all an area of concern for the committee. To my mind, that is just taking a licence with the views of the committee.</para><para>I do not in any way say that the government is not entitled to pursue its legitimate policy views; the government would like to see the ACCC take representative actions for industrial relations matters on 45D and E. But we simply see that as being an unnecessary addition to what is a welcome bill. For the government to overturn or refuse to let the bill go through merely for the sake of that small addition would be foolish. Small business is not going to say, `Well, it's the fault of Labor or the Democrats that we don't have the bill,' because we will be able to explain to them how small the issue is that is being dealt with. They will say, `It's the government's fault for not giving us these very welcome powers and changes,' which as you know, Minister—through the chair—all parties support; there is no-one who opposes them.</para><para>With those remarks, I indicate that the Democrats continue to insist on the amendments that the Senate made. I hope that the government will accept that insistence and, if it feels necessary, come back to this issue from its policy perspective in another way at another time—but not in a way that affects or prevents these particular reforms from being accepted and put into law to the benefit of small business.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>24510</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would make it clear to Senator Murray that I have moved that the committee does insist on these amendments, which means that we are all in agreement so far. I would make the point that we are not in any way at all attributing something to Mr Fitzgibbon in relation to what may have been in his mind in relation to agreeing to the committee's report unanimously. He made the point for himself in his own words at 1.22 p.m. on 9 November when he said that the ACCC:</para></talk.start><quote><para>has the power to take representative action under Parts IVA and V of the act, and it makes sense to extend that to Part IV.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>This is a sensible amendment and both the Reid committee and the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector unanimously recommended it.</para></quote><para>That is what Mr Fitzgibbon said in the other place, as did a number of his other colleagues. It is certainly quite clear—certainly to me—why the Labor Party have changed their mind. For Senator Schacht to then say we are protecting the big end of town and not looking after small business! This amendment has no great advantage to big business or the big end of town. They are quite capable of taking actions themselves. They have the legal resources—to use your words, Senator Schacht—and the accounting resources, if you want to relate it back to the business activity statements and tax reform. They can do that. This is a representative action which allows smaller businesses without the resources of a legal or accounting department and endless financial resources to seek the assistance of the ACCC in these matters. So on this occasion, the Labor Party is siding with the big end of town, knowingly or unknowingly, and letting small business hang out to dry. To accept Senator Murray's invitation: yes, we will have to revisit this. We would like to see the bill pass, for the good reason Senator Murray has made clear. There is a lot of other good law in it and we are not prepared to see it held up any longer because of an ideological obsession of the Australian Labor Party in relation to defending to the death the rights of a privileged few in our society—the officials of trade union movements.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Resolution reported; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FAMILY LAW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24510</page.no><id.no>R1044</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>24510</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>24511</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This <inline ref="R1044">Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 2000</inline> proposes to amend the Family Law Act and other legislation to enable superannuation interests to be divided on marriage breakdown either by agreement or by court order. At present, superannuation interests themselves cannot be split but they can be taken into account by the Family Court. This bill will allow the splitting of interests. In the event of a marriage breakdown it is always preferable for marriage assets to be divided fairly between the parties by agreement. Given the complexity of superannuation, fairness demands that an effort be made to ensure that people make informed choices about the division of superannuation assets. This bill requires that the parties to a financial agreement splitting superannuation assets obtain legal advice prior to entering into such an agreement.</para></talk.start><para>I note that a 1997 survey claimed that the average value of women's superannuation on divorce was just $5,590, compared with $26,152 for men. The survey also found that both men and women are ill informed about their spouse's superannuation. In the context of a widespread disparity in superannuation assets and a relatively low level of knowledge about superannuation, the requirement that the parties have their rights explained to them by a professional is a very important safeguard. Other safeguards will exist. Agreements can be set aside if, for example, they are obtained by fraud. The requirement that legal advice be sought prior to entry into an agreement is likely to minimise the number of cases in which that occurs.</para><para>We recognise that it will not always be the case that superannuation interests can be split by agreement. It will be necessary for the Family Court to make orders to divide the assets of former spouses. This bill will now allow superannuation interests to be split by court order rather than simply be taken into account. That requires an estimation of the value of existing superannuation interests. In relation to interests in defined benefits plans, that may present significant difficulties, as the present day value of the interest may depend upon future events. Factors such as the ultimate length of service of an employee and the income at retirement can influence the present value of the benefit. The bill and the regulations propose to deal with that in most cases by using actuarial tables. That will usually be a fair approach; however, I note that in some cases alternative valuation methods will apply. In particular, the cliff vesting provisions and the provisions relating to valuation methods supplied by superannuation funds offer alternatives that may be more appropriate in particular circumstances.</para><para>The Democrats support the legislation, but we will monitor its implementation to ensure that it operates fairly and provides a workable solution to the problem of dividing superannuation benefits on divorce.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>24511</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1044">Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 2000</inline> was introduced into the House of Representatives on 13 April 2000. The bill will amend the Family Law Act 1975 to provide for the division of superannuation interests on marriage breakdown. The bill was seen by the government as being part of an overall reform package which would include regulations under the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993.</para></talk.start><para>Currently, the division of property following marriage breakdown is a matter governed by the Family Law Act 1975. It allows couples to make their own informal arrangements or use the Family Court in a variety of ways to settle matters between the parties, particularly to make property orders under section 79. However, there have been legal difficulties in dealing with superannuation interests because they are not currently defined as property under the Family Law Act. Doubts have also been raised over the Family Court's power to affect the rights of people who are not parties to the marriage—for example, the trustees of superannuation funds. There is doubt not only whether the Family Law Act authorises that but also whether the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to legislate to enable the court to do so.</para><para>The Family Court can, and does, take superannuation interests into account and divides other property accordingly. However, that is far from ideal, because it often means that current property—usually the family home—has to be traded off in whole or in part against superannuation that may not be able to be accessed for many years. In many cases, that may leave one person with a house but no retirement income, and the other person with no house but significant retirement income that may not be accessible for many years. As the Attorney-General observed, the proposed legislation is designed to address the inequity and inflexibility of that situation.</para><para>In 1998, there were 51,370 divorces in Australia. A recent Australian Bureau of Statistics study of marriages from 1977 to 1994 concluded that about 43 per cent of all marriages end in divorce. Of those, eight per cent occurred within five years of marriage, 19 per cent within 10 years, 32 per cent within 20 years, and 39 per cent within 30 years. On the value of superannuation policies in Australia, the parliamentary <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> No. 55 notes:</para><quote><para>An increasing number of Australian employees now have superannuation policies. The relative value of those policies is increasing and is projected to continue increasing. In 1986, a report published by the Australian Institute of Family Studies ... revealed that of the men and women surveyed, in about 55 per cent of cases at least one spouse had superannuation. By 1997, 81 per cent of the men and women sampled by the AIFS reported that at least one spouse had superannuation. By 1999, 91 per cent of Australian employees had a superannuation account. AIFS estimates that the percentage of a couple's total net assets represented by superannuation increased from about 14 per cent in the late 1980s to about 25 per cent in the late 1990s.</para></quote><para>In the lead-up to this legislation, a series of reports and discussions papers canvassed what to do about problems associated with superannuation in the context of marriage breakdown. For example, as far back as 1987, the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Acts entitled <inline font-style="italic">Family law in Australia </inline>recommended a discretionary power to enable the court to defer the making of a final order in property proceedings until superannuation benefits had been received.</para><para>The Australian Law Reform Commission's report <inline font-style="italic">Matrimonial property</inline> suggests that the notional value of superannuation be included in the value of matrimonial property unless that would lead to inequity. In 1992, the Attorney-General's Department proposed in a discussion paper that on marriage breakdown the vested portion of a person's superannuation interests be reallocated between the parties. In 1992, the Family Law Council recommended that superannuation be divided on marriage breakdown in proportion to the length of cohabitation unless injustice would result. In 1992, the Australian Law Reform Commission's report <inline font-style="italic">Collective investments: superannuation</inline> made several recommendations, including for accumulation schemes that the court be empowered to order the relative entity to divide the superannuation interests and to roll over the non-contributor's share into an approved deposit fund. It also recommended for defined benefit funds that the court be empowered to order the relevant entity to pay an amount to be determined by a prescribed formula into an approved deposit fund and also that, subject to court approval, the parties could agree to vary their shares.</para><para>Since then, there have been a number of other reports. Time does not allow me to go into them in great detail, but I should mention that in 1995 the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services, of which I am currently deputy chair, recommended that in view of the lack of progress the resolution of the treatment of superannuation assets on marriage breakdown should be dealt with as a priority.</para><para>I would now like to comment briefly on the separate property regime. The proposed legislation will operate against the background of a separate property regime as opposed to a community of property regime. The Attorney-General's Department explained that the fact of marriage does not create any special property rights in the partners. The department added that each party to the marriage retains, until otherwise decided by the court, or until the parties agree otherwise, whatever property he or she may have had prior to the marriage, and any property acquired in separate names during the marriage. Following marriage breakdown, the court then has a discretion to alter interests in that property. That power is provided under section 79 of the Family Law Act. But it must not make any such orders unless it is just and equitable to do so. In making its orders, the court can take into account a range of factors. Those factors include the contributions, both financial and non-financial, that any spouse has made to the marriage. That includes the acquisition, conservation and improvement of property as well as contributions to the welfare of the family.</para><para>A separate property regime has an effect on how superannuation may be divided. The court could not be limited in its jurisdiction only to some amount of superannuation accumulated during the period of cohabitation or marriage. As with all other property, the court has to be given a broad discretion over all superannuation. As the Attorney-General's Department pointed out, the court has to be given two essential matters so that the proposals can operate successfully: firstly, jurisdiction in relation to the subject matter—superannuation; and, secondly, the power to bind third party trustees so that the court's orders could operate successfully.</para><para>The legislation proposes to do a number of things. The bill is a continuation of the reform of family law. Under the proposed legislation, couples will be able to divide their superannuation interests on marriage breakdown in the same way that they can divide their other assets. The bill will amend the Family Law Act 1975 to include superannuation within the definition of property, and to allow superannuation to be divided on marriage breakdown in one of two ways: either by agreement of the separating couple, or by court order. The bill will permit separating couples to make binding agreements about how to divide their superannuation interest or interests. This gives people the flexibility to settle their own financial affairs wherever possible and therefore to avoid costly and protracted litigation.</para><para>A person holding a superannuation interest may be nearing retirement or another condition of release at which time the actual value of the interest will become known. In such circumstances, or for other reasons, couples may want to defer an agreement about how their superannuation interests are to be divided. The bill therefore enables couples to make an agreement to flag their superannuation interest. This agreement would prevent the superannuation trustee from dealing with the flagged superannuation interest until the flag has been lifted, either by further agreement or by court order.</para><para>The bill also provides that when a superannuation agreement is in force, the trustee of the relevant fund will be required by law to give effect to the agreement. Where a couple has separated but not yet divorced, the bill requires that at least one of them will have to sign a document called a breakdown declaration. This declaration will state that the couple is married, but they have separated at the time of making the declaration. If the value of the superannuation interest is greater than the eligible termination payment threshold determined under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, then an additional declaration will be required.</para><para>For people to be able to make agreements about dividing their superannuation, they will need information about the fair value of any superannuation interests to be taken into account upon marriage breakdown. For this reason, the bill provides that the superannuation trustee must provide information to the spouse of a partner so that both parties are aware of the details of superannuation interests that are involved.</para><para>Valuation is a particularly important issue for defined benefit schemes where there is a vested benefit and an unvested value. The unvested value is generally not accessible until the fund member satisfies certain requirements specified by the fund. This is the most difficult area in reaching an equitable conclusion as to the division of assets. The valuation of an accumulation plan is more easily ascertained. For this reason, the bill provides for different methods of valuing a superannuation interest, depending on the type of interest. The details of how the value is to be calculated, including actuarial information, are to be set out in the regulations. This will ensure that people are aware of the value of the interest they are dealing with in the agreement, and will also ensure that there can be no dispute about how the value is to be calculated.</para><para>It is preferable that people make their own arrangements for dealing with superannuation interests. However, if they are unable to agree, the bill provides for the Family Court to have the jurisdiction and power to make an order to divide superannuation interests. The amendments to the Family Law Act, as proposed in the bill, will apply to all marriages, including those that were dissolved before the amendments commence. The amendments will not apply, however, where a property settlement has been finally concluded, whether by formal agreement or by court order.</para><para>As I mentioned earlier, the bill provides for some issues to be dealt with by regulation. These regulations are particularly important and need to be scrutinised very carefully. The matters covered by the consultation draft regulations include the following: the valuation of interests of parties; the calculation of the growth factor for base amounts allocated to nonmember spouses under agreements or court orders; fees payable to trustees for splitting superannuation interests; and other matters such as unsplittable interests and payments, the identification of trustees in some cases, provision of information by trustees, prescribed forms, and how the total withdrawal value of a person's various superannuation interests is calculated.</para><para>The Senate superannuation committee, of which I am deputy chair, carried out an exhaustive set of consultations in respect of this legislation. While the minister is here, I would like to acknowledge the extensive cooperation we received from the various government departments—in particular, the Attorney-General's Department—with respect to the committee's consultation on this legislation. Generally, it was much greater cooperation, I might say, than we have normally been accorded in respect of superannuation legislation that appears before the Senate.</para><para>As I mentioned, there are a number of difficulties—in particular, in respect of defined benefit funds. The issues that create the most difficulty were highlighted by the IAA in a submission to the superannuation committee. They include trustee discretion to split a defined benefit interest while in the accumulation phase, the treatment of partial vested accumulation interests, whether the definitions of accumulation phase and payment phase adequately cover the field, problems relating to trustee responsibilities, the order of deduction for members' benefit components, some implications of the treatment of surcharge liability, the appropriate index to adjust the base amount in defined benefit schemes and the application of a vested benefit minimum. These are some of the details that caused the most significant concern before the committee. Having flagged some of the identified difficulties, I would point out that, generally and overwhelmingly, the vast majority of submissions before the Senate committee were supportive of the legislation we are considering this evening.</para><para>I would like to mention a couple of other issues in passing. It is not necessarily always to the advantage of one of the partners in the breakdown of a relationship that they receive a superannuation asset. It is usually the female who receives the family home or a monetary value that is related to the value of the family home. Why is that so? The asset in this case can generally be accessed straightaway, through either the sale of the family home or a payment of money in lieu. Given that females are the custodial parent in 90 per cent of cases, this is often to their advantage, rather than waiting for access to moneys at age 55 or later, depending on their date of birth. It is often to their advantage to be able to effectively access their superannuation moneys before access age is reached. So that is one disadvantage. It is not a clear-cut issue, as many would suppose.</para><para>Some of the complaints will end up being resolved by the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. I have no concern about that in itself; however, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal does still have a significant backlog, following a High Court decision about its powers. The legislation will also require an extensive education campaign to inform the family law community and the superannuation industry. I would not underestimate the size of that task. I hope that the government is preparing such a campaign—and I certainly hope that it is not one of the propaganda campaigns we have become so used to in recent times in the form of government advertising. There needs to be an education campaign and I sincerely hope that it is focused on the areas that it is required to be focused on. I hope that it is not part of some political propaganda exercise in the lead-up to the election.</para><para>A major underlying issue is the adequacy of superannuation contributions. The level of superannuation contributions has been a matter of some public debate in recent times, and that issue underpins the final retirement incomes of the two partners after a relationship breaks down. Another interesting aspect of this concerns me, the Labor opposition and the entire superannuation committee, and that is that the proposed legislation does not deal with de facto and same sex couple relationships. The reason it does not deal with those is that there is no jurisdiction with respect to de facto couples. It is, as I understand it, clearly in state law. It does seem to me that this places married couples at a disadvantage. De facto couples are covered by a state statute, if it exists, or state common law. They will certainly not be covered by these particular provisions.</para><para>It was argued before the superannuation committee that this could act as a disincentive to marriage. Whatever one's views about the status and nature of marriage in our society, I do not believe it is a good thing that one particular relationship is discriminated against over another with respect to the dealing of property rights. This is a general problem in the area of property rights where a relationship ends, but the issue of superannuation does highlight a particular problem. The same issue applies to same sex couples. I take issue on principle. Whatever one thinks of same sex couple relationships, the fact is that the property—in this case, superannuation—is the property of the individuals. It is not up to the state to determine what happens to their own personal relationships, and they should be covered by the same provisions that we are considering this evening.</para><para>The Labor Party will be supporting this legislation without amendment. We still have some concerns, which we hope will be addressed in the regulations, but it does follow many years of exhaustive consultation. It is necessary legislation. It is important legislation, particularly given superannuation's growth as a major asset of couples in this country. It should be given greater certainty and greater surety and the rules should clearly be laid down so that they can be implemented in a practical way on the regrettable dissolution of a marriage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>24515</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1044">Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 2000</inline>. This bill before the chamber tonight has the ability to amend portions of another piece of legislation that is still before the parliament. For substantiation of that we need only look at the bill itself, where the government says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>A Bill for an Act to amend legislation relating to family law, and for related purposes.</para></quote><para>It does not define succinctly that it is amending the Family Law Act 1975. What we have here this evening can only be equated in reality with what we so often look at on our TVs with great humour: the <inline font-style="italic">Yes, Minister </inline>program. That is the level we have reached in relation to this bill. We are setting out to amend a piece of legislation that has not even completed its passage through this house.</para><para>The superannuation bill will provide for different methods of valuing a superannuation interest, depending on whether the interest is a lump sum or a pension. The details of the information needed and the calculations necessary to value that superannuation and to split it will be contained in the family law regulations. Here, again, we have another problem with the bill that the government is putting forward: it does not give clarity in any way as to how the process will be followed. It merely says that the detail will be in the regulations. There is no doubt that when those regulations are brought before this chamber we will be back in exactly the same situation, where this chamber will have no input into those regulations. We will have no input into the process of how the calculations are made, other than to accept or reject the regulation. Again, we have legislation that is being driven by a process that this chamber does not have the ability to scrutinise fully or amend.</para><para>The bill allows that in some circumstances the parties may agree to defer how the superannuation interest is to be divided. Minister, are we legislating to encourage a person, by deferring the settlement on an unfortunate family break-up, to ensure that they do not agree, because there may be a financial benefit to that person by holding out for a later date at which the settlement may be made? I have grave concerns that this legislation will do this instead of creating a situation of a just and equitable separation. The government on numerous occasions have put before us the fact that the legislation may jeopardise their other main criteria: the ability to have a clean break between partners in a marriage that has deteriorated to the point where they wish to separate. I believe this legislation will delay or defer settlement within a marriage break-up. If it is not the government's intention for that to happen, the government need to very clearly and succinctly, through the debate in the committee stage of this bill, set out how they intend to ensure that that is not the result.</para><para>The bill also allows the court to set aside a superannuation agreement in certain circumstances—for example, if it is obtained by fraud, if it was otherwise void or where there was a significant change in circumstances. If you wanted a bill so wide that the courts could basically at any time set aside a superannuation scheme, the government has just handed it to you in the way it has drafted this bill—that is, if this chamber passes the bill unamended, as Senator Sherry has indicated.</para><para>Section 79 of the Family Law Act provides that under certain circumstances the court can set aside orders in relation to property interests. Section 79A(1) says:</para><quote><para>Where, on application by a person affected by an order made by a court under section 79 in proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to a marriage or either of them, the court is satisfied that:</para><para>(a) there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of fraud, duress, suppression of evidence (including failure to disclose relevant information), the giving of false evidence or any other circumstance ...</para></quote><para>So the act itself sets out the process under which the court can set aside orders and alter property interests. This bill that the government is introducing under section 79 gives the court the ability to change the interests of the parties in a property and, under the new definition of this bill, superannuation will be defined as part of a property settlement. So the court can, if it is satisfied that it is just and equitable, change any agreement that is entered into by those parties.</para><para>If we look at some of the other issues that the bill does not address, we see that the issue of great concern is that the bill does not define the time to which the superannuation refers. The bill does not in any way define whether the period over which the superannuation was accumulated was different from the period of the marriage. If a person at a young age enters into a superannuation scheme as an individual and then at a later point enters into a marriage and continues to accumulate that superannuation, the bill does not in any way whatsoever define whether the financial benefit that is derived by that single individual prior to the marriage is excluded from the calculations. </para><para>The bill itself also relates to superannuation agreements that I believe would have too much scope for the Family Court itself. It has the possibility to allow the Family Court to interfere with the arrangements that parties have agreed to and also to frustrate the implementation of those agreements.</para><para>In the committee stage I will be seeking clarification from the minister to define certain issues in relation to this bill. I will be asking: what are the words `a significant change in circumstances' going to mean to a person entering into an arrangement? What right of redress will either parties have in relation to settlements made by the courts, if they cannot be agreed to by the partners? Also, I will be asking for clarification from the minister in relation to the splitting of superannuation and whether that spitting will occur in such a way at a defined time that it will deliver for both parties within that process a clean break, so each one can then move forward in restructuring their lives. Will the parties forever have hanging over them the ability of the other person within that relationship at any given time to go back to the court under section 79 and reopen the issues?</para><para>I believe that the bill, because it has the potential to amend legislation that has not even completed its passage through this chamber, should have been set aside until that section of the legislation relating to financial agreements is actually completed. This issue relating to the superannuation could then have been addressed in the knowledge of what could be contained within a financial agreement. Today we certainly do not know what implications that other piece of legislation may have. I will be moving a series of amendments to the bill in the committee stage in an attempt to clarify it and to assure that it will be just and equitable for both partners who enter into these agreements and that, where possible, it will ensure a clean break so that each partner can then set about restructuring their lives.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>24517</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me start by thanking honourable senators for their contribution to the debate on this important piece of legislation. The <inline ref="R1044">Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 2000 </inline>will amend the Family Law Act 1975 to give effect to the government's commitment to enable the division of superannuation on marriage breakdown. For many years now, the Family Court has had to grapple with superannuation being simply a financial resource. It was a contingent interest—it was not one that was available for division immediately upon a separation or upon a court order as a result of property settlement proceedings in the Family Court. So for years there has been this uncertainty. This bill will give relief to all those who go to the Family Court to deal with superannuation, and I think it will serve the community well. </para></talk.start><para>In general terms, the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill provides that parties will be able to divide superannuation either in its accumulation phase or in its payment phase by agreement or, where the parties are unable to agree, by court order. This bill is one component of the legislative package that will implement the new regime.</para><para>There are other parts to this. The Family Law Amendment Regulations will deal with the valuation of a superannuation interest. It is a contingent interest, so it is rather difficult to value at any particular point in time, especially when a superannuation benefit accelerates dramatically on the occurrence of some event such as the attainment of a certain age. The second part is the Superannuation Industry Supervision Regulations, which deal with the creation and certain specific circumstances of a new superannuation interest for the nonmember spouse. Of course, an essential part of this package is allowing the nonmember spouse to have this interest in the superannuation. Thirdly, there are consequential amendments to tax, social security and veterans' affairs legislation which deal with the effects of splitting up the superannuation.</para><para>This bill was referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services. In considering the bill, the committee looked at preliminary drafts of the Family Law Regulations and the Superannuation Industry Supervision Regulations, which were released for public comment in October last year. The Senate committee's final report made several recommendations for amendments to the legislative proposals. A number of its recommendations are more properly implemented by amendments to the regulations. Others are more appropriately dealt with by legislation, and that has been accommodated in the other place. As well as that, some other amendments have been made by the government in the other place, which have come about as a result of consultation from interested groups, the judiciary and the legal profession. We now have an amended bill, which includes those amendments.</para><para>Perhaps the most notable amendment that the government has introduced relates to the concept of a percentage only interest in this bill. A percentage only interest, which will be prescribed under the Family Law Amendment Regulations, will only be able to be split by the specified percentage method or by a special percentage method applying for such interests. The policy intention is that the interest that will be prescribed to be percentage only interest will be interest for which the only equitable and appropriate method of splitting it is by specifying a percentage rather than a base amount split. That means that, when the superannuation payment becomes payable, the nonmember spouse will have a percentage that would have been ruled by the court or agreed to. This has been a very complex area but one which needed to be dealt with.</para><para>I note that Senator Harris has foreshadowed amendments; in fact, he has circulated amendments in the chamber. At this stage, the government are unable to support any of those amendments, and perhaps it is best that we go into the reasons for that during the committee stage. I do thank all those who have contributed to the debate on this bill and also during the course of the inquiry; it has really been dealt with on a bipartisan basis. I think that recognises the importance of this bill. What we have here is a reform to family law which was much needed.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>24518</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>24518</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Clause 5, page 2 (lines 18 to 20), omit subclause (1).</para></quote><para>The purpose of this first amendment is to alter the legislation in such a way that the legislation does not impact on marriages that have been dissolved before the start-up time.

In another Senate committee inquiry we have looked at some cases of tax minimisation schemes involving superannuation. I will not go into all the details. Suffice it to say that there are some people who have been using superannuation trusts to minimise tax, let alone minimise their obligations under the Family Law Act if there is a potential dissolution of a marriage. I am certainly aware that a number of people in this country hide assets in the form of superannuation funds in offshore superannuation trusts. I suspect that it is not only to avoid tax but also in the event of a dissolution of a marriage. I do not believe that those arrangements would be brought to the attention of the other partner in the marriage. In circumstances like that—and, unfortunately, it does occur from what I have been able to observe from the other inquiries of the superannuation committee—where assets are clearly hidden via a superannuation trust in another jurisdiction the matters should be revisited, because I do not think that is fair or reasonable. It is not just unfair and unreasonable to the Australian taxpayer and the tax office but also unfair and unreasonable to the partner from whom the assets have been hidden in the form of a superannuation trust.</para></talk.start><para>Sadly, it does go on. I do not think it is very significant but, where it does go on and the perpetrators are caught, it should be taken into account and, similarly, where duress occurs. I do not believe that in our society we can accept a situation where one partner in a marriage is subject to duress. It is unacceptable and, where it is proven in a court of law—and at times it is not easy to prove, from my understanding of the law—I think that is an appropriate ground on which the arrangements can be revisited if they are the circumstances.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>24519</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have no problems in relation to a miscarriage of justice that has been carried out by fraud.

The insertion of the sentence, `It does not matter whether or not the superannuation interests are in existence at the time the agreement is made,' takes away from the financial agreement the ability to include financial interests which have not yet come into being—that is, accumulations pursuant to superannuation. You might have a young couple who have a financial agreement who are about to embark upon a working career or who have just started a working career, and they have a superannuation package which has not yet started to accumulate any interest for them. Understandably, they have a financial agreement. In that agreement, it says that in the event of certain things happening there will be a split in a certain manner. This amendment could do away with that provision and take one step backwards and not have the flexibility that we would envisage by this. That would be a shame, because we need to have financial agreements that can deal with superannuation which is just about to start or which is in process or which could well be almost at its conclusion.</para></talk.start><para>I think Senator Harris is asking, `How can you have a financial agreement where someone has accumulated interests in a superannuation package?' I think that is quite easily answered. Where you have a husband and wife and one brings into the marriage assets by way of superannuation, then your financial agreement can recognise what was brought into the marriage. It would do that. There would be recognition for that spouse having brought those assets into the marriage. The financial agreement would not result in an unfair windfall, if you like, for the party that does not have the interest in the superannuation, because what you would do in the financial agreement is to recognise what each party brought in respectively. It would be the same as if one party owned a house and the other did not. If Senator Harris was implying that this could enable one party to be unfairly enriched, then that is not the case. It certainly is the opposite. The financial agreement in this case enables the record to be set down: this is what people have brought in, and this is what people are entitled to in the event of a break-up.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>24521</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the minister for his reply, but I seek an additional clarification. At a subsequent time after the superannuation interest had been defined and agreed upon, if the member spouse then agreed to increase their superannuation payments above that level at which they were structured when the agreement was reached, would the benefits from those increased contributions made by the member spouse remain for the benefit of that individual within that agreement? If the agreement were based upon a pension basis—in other words, not a payout at the age under which the superannuation becomes available—how are the administrators of the fund going to be able to determine the equity of each partner?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>24521</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, if either party after separation or divorce, or more particularly, I should say, after the resolution of financial matters between themselves, earns more money or obtains further assets, that is normally their own. For instance, if you have made a financial agreement as to how superannuation should be divvyed up and the spouse who is a member then says, `I'm now going to contribute more out of my salary to the superannuation,' from that point on, in the absence of any other agreement, that would be their asset. But, of course, you have to remember that in the financial agreement it could well stipulate that, if the member spouse is to increase contributions, there could be some increased entitlement for the nonmember spouse. So primarily you would look to the financial agreement to see what would happen in the event of a member spouse increasing his or her contributions. In the absence of any agreement though, it would be most likely that the spouse concerned would simply get the benefit of their extra contribution because it would be post-financial agreement, post the severing of financial relations.

I believe that any person has the right to know if an application has been made in relation to disclosing information pertaining to their superannuation scheme.

It is not necessarily the commencement of proceedings; in fact, it is not. It is just simply the nonmember spouse going to the trustee and making inquiries about the superannuation fund. This protects the nonmember spouse in making that inquiry from running the flag up the pole, if you like. There are a number of reasons for this: it might antagonise the other spouse, or you might have a domestic violence situation—all manner of reasons might come into play. It does not deprive the member spouse of any natural justice because, once the nonmember spouse decides, `Well, yes, I'm going to go to court,' of course proceedings have to be commenced and the application in the court has to be served on the member spouse. So all this talks about is an application for information; that is all it is. It is not an application in court—and that is what I think Senator Harris is confusing it with. He mentions natural justice. Of course you could not make an application to the court—it would be an ex parte application—without the other side knowing. You could not do that at all; it would be crazy.

Export promotion is vital for Australia. Our own market is too small to sustain our standard of living, so we must make our way in the global economy. For many of our industries, our primary producers for instance, this has been well understood for a long time. For our wool, wheat, meat and mineral producers exports have always been crucial, and they have succeeded in selling to the world despite having to confront massive market distortions in the form of trade barriers and foreign production subsidies. Australia's other industries are also widening their horizons. Our exports of manufactures and services are growing. This is crucial, not only because these industries employ the overwhelming majority of Australians—four out of five Australians work in the service economy—but because they are the fastest growing sectors in the global economy. Australia has a competitive edge in many of these areas, whether it is the high-tech fast ferries made by Austal in Western Australia and Incat in Tasmania or the wide range of professional services sold to the regional and global markets by Australian financial, legal, educational and hospitality providers. Australia is already part of the global economy and competing successfully in it. It is a battle not yet won. The global economy is increasingly competitive, and we have to do a much better job of equipping ourselves to compete, a better job of building a knowledge nation. It is in an export oriented economy that Australia's future lies.</para></talk.start><para>The expansion and broadening of Australia's export base over the past 20 years has brought benefits not only in terms of export revenue. The increase in export orientation of our businesses is also changing our industrial landscape. Studies have consistently shown that exporting firms provide better paying and more interesting jobs than firms that rely solely on the domestic market. The most recent study into this issue, conducted jointly by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Trade Commission, found that exporting businesses paid their staff on average $17,000 more than non-exporting businesses—a massive 60 per cent more. Other findings of the study were that export businesses were more likely to employ people on a full-time basis and were more committed to staff training than non-export businesses. So trade is about more than the business bottom line. It is also good news for the wider economy and for Australia's workers. Yet it is sometimes argued that the increasing exposure of the Australian economy to trade is a bad thing for workers. From this assumption comes the conclusion that constraints to trade will benefit workers and that their interests would be served by Australia withdrawing from involvement in the global economy.</para><para>I should say that these ideas do not have political boundaries. They are heard across the political spectrum and in the country and city alike. It is true that changing patterns of trade will affect workers in some industries. There are some industries in which Australia is not as globally competitive as we might wish. But technology is an even more important driver of economic change, and the answer to issues of employment does not lie in trade barriers any more than it lies in trying to hold back new technology. After he had done considerable work on this subject, the Nobel prize winning economist Amartya Sen said recently:</para><quote><para>The economic predicament of the poor cannot be reversed by withholding from them the great advantages of contemporary technology, the well-established efficiency of international trade and exchange, and the social as well as economic merits of living in open rather than closed societies. Rather, the main issue is how to make good use of the remarkable benefits of economic intercourse and technological progress in a way that pays adequate attention to the interests of the deprived and the underdog.</para></quote><para>Sen identifies the key issue before government today: how to use the tools of government to harness the benefits of trade and shape economic outcomes on the ground. Governments need to recognise that trade can have dislocative effects for particular industries and for particular workers, and they need to respond by implementing policies that ensure that we do not leave people behind. This means constructive industry policy and safety net policies, not an outdated and obsessive attachment to trickle-down economics.</para><para>Accepting the economic theory underpinning trade—that is, trade's potential to raise living standards—is important, but even more important is accepting the responsibility that governments have in managing the impact of globalisation. The Howard government tries to tell people that trade is good for them, but it has no strategy for explaining why trade is good for the Australian economy and it has no strategy for dealing with circumstances—real circumstances—where particular industries and workers are adversely affected by changing economic patterns due to trade or some other factor or combination of factors.</para><para>The opposition are committed to ensuring that Australia competes successfully in the global economy—we are confident in the ability of Australians to do so—but we do not believe that the approach based on telling people to take their medicine and sit down is an effective substitute for policies designed to address real, everyday situations. Unlike the government, we are not slaves to the market. Rather, we will seek to use the levers of government to ensure outcomes that deliver the benefits of trade to all Australians, not just to those businesses and individuals already succeeding in the global economy. The Labor Party is proud of the decisive role it played during the Hawke and Keating years in restructuring and internationalising the Australian economy. These changes, frequently opposed by the coalition parties when they were led by Mr Howard in opposition, had many benefits. One was a sea change in the way in which Australian businesses viewed the global economy and a subsequent explosion in our exports. That explosion was based on fundamental restructuring—that is, on something more than US50c to the $A1.</para><para>It was under Labor that Australia became fully connected to the global economy and it was under Labor that trade became a crucial contributor to our national wealth. Trade is now responsible for 40 per cent of our GDP. That came about because we had a view of trade as part of a broader economic framework. We still hold that view and we will work in government to ensure that trade policy serves the economic interests of the entire Australian community.</para><para>One part of our work when last in office was the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. That was an original Labor scheme set up by Gough Whitlam and Jim Cairns. The idea was a visionary one, predating the contemporary debate about globalisation and free trade. It was based on a simple premise: that smaller Australian businesses should be encouraged to develop an export culture and seek out export markets, and that they need some help to get started. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme operated effectively from the start, and it was refined by the Hawke and Keating governments. I am pleased to have had a role in that process, having overseen the scheme as minister in 1993-94 and having become well aware of its effectiveness while also serving as industry minister in the Keating government.</para><para>The bill represents the Howard government's response to the latest review of the EMDG conducted by the Austrade board last year. Before talking about the government's weak response to the review, I would like to say something about the Austrade board's findings. The board confirmed that the EMDG is a highly successful program. It is worth noting some of the conclusions of Professor Ron Bewley of the University of New South Wales, who conducted an econometric analysis for the review. Professor Bewley found, amongst other things, that during 1997-98 each grant dollar from the scheme resulted in approximately $12 in additional exports. He further estimates the additional tax return from these additional exports as being between $25 million and $29 million. Beyond the scope of Professor Bewley's analysis, of course, is the flow-on to employment and the other positive effects of this economic activity.</para><para>While one should always view the results of that sort of economic analysis with some caution, there is no disputing the central conclusion: the investment made by the taxpayer through the EMDG Scheme is returned many times over in the form of increased economic activity, export and tax revenue, and jobs. The public benefit of government programs is sometimes not as clear as it might be. But the EMDG Scheme has clearly been a success by any measure. </para><para>As I have noted, Professor Bewley's work was part of a broader review of the EMDG. The review found that the EMDG was generally meeting its core objective: encouraging the creation, development and expansion of foreign markets for Australian goods, services, intellectual property and know-how. The review also found that business is investing the full value of grants back into export promotion activities. Before approaching the government's response to the board's specific findings, we need to address some core issues about the Howard government's mishandling of the EMDG and its lack of support for small business, the constituency that the government likes to regard as its own.</para><para>The fact is that the EMDG has been put through the wringer by the Howard government. The scheme got caught up in the wholesale slashing of government services in 1996-97 when the Howard government took a blunt axe to all government programs, irrespective of their effectiveness. We are still seeing the results of the mess created by the 1996-97 budget, from public services withdrawn only to be subsequently restored in a response to the electoral backlash to government assets privatised and outsourced and their value to the community diluted or lost.</para><para>In my shadow portfolio area, resources were slashed from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, diminishing our international influence in a host of ways, including our capacity to support Australian businesses internationally. The EMDG was another baby thrown out with a few drops of bathwater. Despite its success, it was slashed too, giving us an early signal of the impotence in the government of the foreign minister and successive trade ministers, although at least we saw Tim Fischer doing some trade policy work, not just issuing endless press releases congratulating exporters.</para><para>It is worth taking a moment to calculate the damage that this government has done to the EMDG. With the funding cap applied in 1997 and extended by this bill until 2006, real funding in 2001-02 will be 37 per cent lower than it was in 1996-97, the last year that Labor's EMDG Scheme operated. Recipients in 1996-97 totalled 3,851. In 2000-01, only 2,956 businesses received funding under the scheme, a decline of nearly 25 per cent. Worse still, the funding cap until 2006 means that, by then, funding in real terms will be barely half of what it was under Labor. To illustrate the point in stark terms, if real funding in 2001-02 had been retained at the 1996-97 level, $234 million would have been available as grants for Australian exporters next year. Using Professor Bewley's analysis as the basis, this amounts to $1.1 billion in additional exports forgone, along with approximately $16 million in additional tax revenue. This is a strange response from a government that still trumpets its support for exporters and small business.</para><para>The truth about this government's commitment to this country's small business lies in its performance. The recent budget had absolutely nothing for Australia's small business community. They were entitled to think that they would get some relief. After all, Mr Howard promised before the 1998 election that red tape would be cut by 50 per cent and that the GST would improve small business cash flow and profitability. Of all Mr Howard's broken promises, surely this is the one that rings most hollow to Australian small business today.</para><para>The reality is that small business now has the massive, costly and time-consuming burden of the GST, with no help in sight. The budget has no compensation, no simplification, no extension of the write-off period for investment in GST related plant and equipment, and no changes to the many and different thresholds that determine eligibility for the simplified tax system and the simplified accounting method.</para><para>Now this bill compounds the disappointment for small business. At a time when the export climate has rarely been better, driven by an ultracompetitive Australian dollar and an improvement in Australia's terms of trade, the bill does nothing to lower the hurdle confronting Australian small business. The favourable exchange rate is, of course, good for exporters although it is not good for all parts of the economy, as shown by the precipitate recent decline in imports of capital goods. But small and medium sized businesses can only benefit from the low Australian dollar if they can get themselves established in export markets, and they can only do that if they have the capital to commit to the necessary promotion and marketing. However, small businesses do not have that ready cash because they have been mugged by the GST—mugged in terms of the capital forgone as a result of GST payments, and mugged in terms of the drain on their financial and human resources from the compliance burden.</para><para>This is the context in which we should see this bill: a small business sector in Australia that continues to suffer under the impost of an unfair and regressive tax. And now, as businesses grapple with the GST-BAS nightmare, we have this half-hearted effort. We should be under no misapprehension: it is not an easy thing to step into exporting, especially for small companies which are perhaps relatively new businesses. Governments can help not just by reimbursing a proportion of marketing costs, as the Export Market Development Grants Scheme does, but also through the technical advice provided by Austrade and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. But this assistance amounts to very little in the face of the incessant GST compliance nightmare.</para><para>I have discussed the EMDG funding situation. It is clearly inadequate. It is also a matter of concern that Austrade's administration of the EMDG seems more focused on compliance than on export promotion. Close to 20 per cent of reimbursement claims are rejected by Austrade. This suggests that businesses are not being well enough informed about their entitlements under the scheme. It also raises the question of whether the cap, $150 million less $7.5 million in absorbed administrative costs, is dictating decision making under the EMDG. If this is the case, the scheme is meeting the needs of bureaucratic bean counters rather than the needs of small businesses seeking to make their way in the world.</para><para>However, there are other concerns about the way the scheme operates identified in the Austrade board review. It is clear, for instance, that smaller businesses have little incentive to claim small grants under the scheme as it is currently constituted. In contrast, larger enterprises with more flexibility to commit to export promotion in the first place stand to benefit from the scheme more directly. This seems to run counter to the rationale of the EMDG, which is to encourage an export outlook amongst businesses that might not otherwise be attracted to the often uncertain export market.</para><para>The Export Market Development Grants Scheme needs to focus clearly on the needs of smaller Australian companies. It does not need to provide long-term assistance to companies that are already globally engaged or which already have the capacity to sustain significant export marketing budgets. We are seeing fewer and fewer small businesses accessing the scheme and we are hearing more and more stories bemoaning the difficulties of accessing the scheme. Yet this bill is complacent. It does not address those concerns and it is clear that the government, having shut the policy shop up until the election, is content to pay lip service to the export needs of our smaller businesses. This bill also continues the Howard government's snub of the Australian tourism sector. For this important sector, too, there is nothing in the budget except, of course, for a hike in the passenger movement charge, one of Mr Howard's non-core taxes which, like his non-core promises, he prefers not to count.</para><para>This bill belatedly makes the meetings industry eligible for EMDG grants, something that Labor had agreed to in 1995. Unfortunately, it was another casualty of the 1996-97 budget. Such is their embarrassment about their neglect of the tourism sector, we now have the government making misleading statements about the timing of that sector's inclusion in the EMDG scheme. Two weeks ago we had the member for Cook, who should know better, say that tourism first became eligible for the EMDG under the Howard government. It did not. Inbound tour operators were brought into the scheme in 1990 by the Hawke Labor government. Later, the Keating Labor government expanded the scheme to cover tourism suppliers. It does the government no credit to be compounding their negligent approach to this important industry by seeking to fudge the public record on tourism's access to the EMDG.</para><para>Labor will support this bill. Australia's small and medium sized exporters need this scheme to help them get started in the global market. But this bill has been a long time coming—the Austrade board review of the EMDG was completed a year ago—and it represents a tepid and inadequate response to that review. It leaves the EMDG significantly underfunded, and it misses the opportunity to calibrate the scheme more effectively for small businesses. Unfortunately, this is not surprising. It continues the Howard government's sorry record on export promotion and support for small and medium sized Australian companies. Those businesses are entitled to feel disappointed that their needs are not being addressed by a government that has run out of ideas on trade and that takes Australian small businesses for granted.</para><para>When Labor return to office, we will clean up the mess the Howard government has made of export promotion and its wider neglect of Australian small and medium sized businesses. We will do it promptly and in a way that will enable small business to play a much stronger role in the export market. With the dollar at these levels, we should be creaming them everywhere. But if small business cannot get access to the market because of other compliance costs and the GST, it does not matter what the exchange rate is; it will still not succeed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>24528</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the <inline ref="R1310">Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2001</inline>. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme has been in operation since 1974, in various forms, providing funds to small and medium sized businesses in order to assist them with the cost of promoting and developing export markets. By most accounts, the program has been a success. Recent reviews indicate that the scheme has developed an export culture, has assisted businesses to establish products and reputations and has resulted in an increase in export earnings.</para></talk.start><para>A broad range of industries has accessed these funds: the tourism industry, the IT industry and many others. Submissions to the recent review of the scheme indicated a broad level of support for the scheme from businesses. Those submissions also made a number of proposed changes to the scheme, many of which have been incorporated in this bill. Whilst it is positive to see the government supporting investment in small export businesses as a long-term investment in a healthy economy, it is unfortunate they are not more willing or able to take the same long-term view in relation to education, health and the environment.</para><para>With one exception, this scheme provides blanket opportunity for people from various industries to access the scheme and, therefore, makes no attempt to articulate social policy. It is purely economic, dollars and cents, driven. The one exception is the prohibition contained in the bill in relation to X-rated material. The government is saying that it does not want to use taxpayers' funds to subsidise the expansion of an export industry in X-rated material. That is not something the Australian Democrats are expressing any opposition to. It does indicate that there are clearly circumstances where the government is prepared to exclude particular industries—in this case, for social policy reasons—being able to access subsidies under this scheme, even though those industries are not illegal in Australia. Any illegal industry is not able to access this scheme either. That single exemption does not constitute policy, but it does indicate the possibility of achieving policy objectives through financial and market mechanisms.</para><para>The Democrats believe the scheme presents an opportunity to represent a comprehensive collection of community values. We are moving a few amendments to the bill which would allow the scheme to reflect more broadly legitimate community concerns and concerns of the Democrats. These amendments do not pretend to be a comprehensive expression of Democrats policy but would serve as the beginning of a framework in which good investments can also be good policy.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>24529</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Alan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Ferguson)</inline>—Order!

In Australia, the larger investment managers have an advantage over John Citizen the investor in that some fund managers, given their size and investment strength, are able to secure advanced private briefings and, in the process, are presented with inside information and other data that can be useful in their giving advice whether to buy, hold or sell certain stock. This information is supplied ahead of information in official company circulars to shareholders.</para></talk.start><para>The Canadian securities regulators have recently recommended tighter disclosure guidelines for companies in order to provide a smoother playing field for all investors. In the past, analysts and other investment professionals have had the upper hand over the average man-in-the-street investor, with better access to key executives at publicly traded companies. This has meant that important information has been filtered through these specialists. That filter has now been removed. This means that everybody in the marketplace, both professional analysts and small private investors, will have the same information at the same time.</para><para>Canadian security regulators two weeks ago issued draft disclosure guidelines that will raise the bar on how companies disseminate information, including information on their performance and their future plans. Their recommendations include: adopting a policy that opens analyst conference calls to anybody interested in listening via telephone or the Internet; tighter policies regarding company comment on draft analyst reports to guard against any direct or indirect earnings guidance slipping out; observing a quiet period near the end of the year or the end of the quarter before the publication of earnings; and, lastly, keeping company web sites updated and accurate.</para><para>If the policy is officially adopted later in the year, it will be good news for all investors—both people who research their own stock and those who are thinking about becoming more active. The guidelines would not be compulsory, but most firms would be hard-pressed to ignore them. The first and last recommendations regarding conference calls and the Internet are particularly important in the way they provide the prospective investor with a great deal of necessary information when making decisions about their money. Prospective investors would be encouraged to listen in on the conference calls when executives are available to analysts and the media to account for company performance.</para><para>The key executives open up with presentations about the company performance over the past quarter and where the company is headed, followed by a question and answer session. These conference calls will give the investor an insight into the company and a feel for the capability of the management team. Traditionally, only analysts—the people who evaluate the stocks and make the recommendations on their purchases—were allowed to sit in on the conference calls. Opening these conference calls to all interested parties means that investors can make their own judgment on all aspects of their investments. Investors need to pay attention to the questions asked by the experts, which in the past would have been asked behind closed doors.</para><para>The recommendation to use the Internet has a great deal of merit as it is now one of the best tools for investors. The Internet enables people to examine a variety of analysts' reports and then compare the information. Investors should also be encouraged to attend annual general meetings and to visit the corporate web sites or one of several independent Internet sites, such as www.globe.investor.com or www.sedar.com.</para><para>With the new guidelines proposed by the Canadian securities regulators, one-to-one meetings will be a thing of the past, and all questions will be asked in a public forum. Through these methods investors can gather data on companies' track records and their earnings history. Armed with this material, they can plan their own future with a lot more assurance. Perhaps now is the time for the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian regulator ASIC to follow the Canadian example.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Managing Director</title><page.no>24530</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>24530</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In tonight's adjournment debate I wish to look at a number of issues raised with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation at the estimates hearing of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee earlier this month. I would like to make some comment on what those matters mean for the ABC, its future and its direction. </para></talk.start><para>The ABC, our national public broadcaster, is clearly in trouble. Events have unfolded since Mr Shier became managing director last year that are of serious concern to the opposition. The picture of the direction of the ABC that emerged at estimates hearings can only be described as bleak. Australians revere the ABC. We value it because it is widely considered to be an independent and reliable source of news and information and because it has produced and broadcast Australian programs in a wide variety of genres. There are some worrying signs at the ABC. In recent times there has been a dearth of new Australian programs, particularly Australian drama. Instead, reruns of <inline font-style="italic">Fawlty Towers </inline>and <inline font-style="italic">Yes, Prime Minister </inline>have been slotted in at peak times to fill up programming schedules.</para><para>A number of issues have been raised in relation to the staffing of the ABC. There has been considerable restructuring, changing of staff and turnover of staff, particularly at a senior level, during Mr Shier's administration at the ABC. Mr Shier advised the Senate committee that several headhunting firms were retained to source alternative staff for a range of senior positions at the ABC upon his commencement at the ABC. Mr Shier has expended exorbitant sums on redundancies, higher salaries for staff to replace those made redundant or who have resigned, and fees for the services of headhunters. One example of this is the two staff who were hired to replace Ms Sue Masters upon her resignation as head of drama last year. It has been reported that the two replacements were on salary packages of $270,000 and $230,000. Together, that is more than five times what the previous occupant, Ms Masters, received for doing her job so well. We await the ABC's confirmation or denial of those figures in responses to questions that were taken on notice. </para><para>Despite this substantial financial commitment to salaries for the new heads of drama, no programs have been produced or commissioned. This failure to perform is remarkable in view of reports that the head of drama, Mr Tony Virgo, spent considerable time and resources lunching and dining with the independent film industry. His reported corporate credit card bill of $9,000 for December and $1,000 for a single week in January is shocking, considering the failure to convert the expenditure into programs. But like a number of Mr Shier's appointments, Mr Tony Virgo did not stay too long. The recent resignation of Gail Jarvis is another indictment of either the managing director's inability to select appropriate staff or his management of the ABC.</para><para>Certainly, the managing director's management style has been the subject of intense criticism. Structural changes at the ABC have been misguided and have failed. Mr Shier's own vision for the ABC's development, commissioning and production of programs has proven unworkable. Mr Shier's master plan was to create an overarching division of the ABC to concentrate on development. This division has failed to develop anything. Mr Shier has been again forced to restructure the ABC as a consequence of this new division's failure. Mr Guy Dunstan was appointed by Mr Shier as director of program content and development. He warned Mr Shier that the plan for restructure was unworkable. Mr Shier sacked Mr Dunstan but subsequently implemented his ideas by returning executive producers to producing programs. Morale within the ABC is reportedly very low. This is a concern for an organisation whose success rests exclusively on the performance of its staff.</para><para>There have been a number of allegations of interference with the independence of the ABC since Mr Shier took over as managing director early last year. Based on notes that reportedly document a conversation on 29 January this year between Mr Shier and Gail Jarvis during a meeting of executive directors—Ms Jarvis was appointed by Mr Shier as director of television—allegations of political interference with the ABC's independence have arisen. The document reveals an attempt by Mr Shier to prevent <inline font-style="italic">Littlemore</inline> from airing. During the conversation, Mr Shier claimed to have the support of the board and the minister to base programming decisions exclusively on the basis of a ratings threshold.</para><para>Many Australians would argue that what distinguishes the ABC from the commercial stations is the emphasis on ratings. Ratings are the bottom line for commercial television stations; they should not be the bottom line for Australia's national broadcaster. The ABC should be at liberty to make decisions independent of government—decisions on how it will best fulfil its charter. The ABC's value lies in its independence. The minister has publicly stated that while he favours increased standards of accountability for the ABC, that does not mean a high ratings benchmark is necessary. While Mr Shier apparently places such great emphasis on ratings, he has failed if ratings are a measure of his success. The ABC's ratings have been declining in recent times. Indeed, over the four months from February through to the end of May of this year, ratings in the ABC have declined by 25 per cent.</para><para>Another action that suggests that the ABC's independence is compromised was the decision of the head of audit of the ABC, Mr Hodgkinson, to refer to the Australian Federal Police the leak to the press of an internal ABC document. Mr Hodgkinson referred the matter as one of possible fraud. Precisely why this was considered to be potential fraud remains unclear. However, understandably, many staff were distressed at being subjected to interviews by the Federal Police. I fail to see that this action could be objectively perceived as anything short of intimidation or a deliberate plan to negate opposition to the new administration.</para><para>It is clear that the ABC is in crisis and that this is a direct, possibly even intended, consequence of the way Mr Shier is managing that organisation. The changes in terms of restructuring, personnel and culture are seemingly the obvious consequence of an attempt to control the impact of the ABC. Since Mr Shier took over the helm at the ABC, that nothing has been developed by his `development division' suggests that perhaps it is a lack of vision or completely inappropriate vision by Mr Shier that is destroying the ABC, rather than his vision for a change of culture within the ABC.</para><para>Whatever the reason for the changes that have been taking place, they are disturbing for anyone who is concerned to see the ABC retain its independence into the future. The opposition calls on Mr Shier to acknowledge the detrimental consequences of his actions and to seek to ameliorate those consequences and maintain the ABC's independence.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Maritime Exploration of Australia: Anniversary</title><page.no>24532</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>24532</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A month from now, on 18 July 2001, our calendars should mark what is an important date in the history of the maritime exploration of Australia.

The <inline font-style="italic">Investigator</inline> was formerly the <inline font-style="italic">Xenophon</inline>, a north country collier of 334 tonnes which had been built in 1795. In appearance it looked much like the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> and was chosen for many of the same reasons. Unfortunately for Flinders, its conversion and fitting out for scientific and survey work had been improperly done and, as he discovered at sea, it leaked badly.</para><para>In the history of his voyage of exploration, published in 1814, Flinders described the occasion of his departure in a typically modest and self-effacing way:</para><quote><para>At sea, the Western Approaches, Tuesday, 21 July 1801. On July 18 we sailed from Spithead; and in the afternoon of the 20th, having a light breeze from the eastward, with fine weather, our departure was taken from the Start, bearing N.18° W. five or six leagues.</para></quote><para>Flinders was 27 years of age but already had a distinguished record. In 1791, he had sailed with William Bligh in <inline font-style="italic">Providence</inline> as a midshipman and taken observations at Point Venus, the observatory set up earlier in Tahiti by the then Lieutenant James Cook on the voyage that led to Cook's discovery of the east coast of Australia. Later, with George Bass, in a small boat, the <inline font-style="italic">Tom</inline><inline font-style="italic">Thumb</inline>, Flinders helped chart part of the south-east coast of Australia and prove Tasmania was an island by sailing through and naming Bass Strait. </para><para>In 1801, when Flinders sailed from Spithead, France and Britain were at war. Indeed, the Flinders history goes on to say: </para><quote><para>On the following day we fell in with Vice Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell, and a detachment of four three-deck ships from the grand fleet cruizing before Brest.</para></quote><para>Flinders, however, sailed with a passport approved by France and signed by the French Minister for Marine and Colonies granting him the right to go about his scientific work and exploration unmolested.</para><para>In the pantheon of the great maritime explorers of Australia, by popular acclaim Flinders is rated just behind Cook. He lived in the great age of exploration but even by the standards of the time he accomplished astonishing feats of discovery, of coastal surveying and in the natural sciences. Even by modern standards, his charts of the Australian coast are outstanding. Many of them were in common use right up to and during the Second World War. What is perhaps just as significant is that he more than anyone else is responsible for giving our nation its modern name, Australia. Up until when Flinders drew the first complete map of our country, several piecemeal maps were in circulation, with great expanses of coast simply imagined or just joined by straight lines. The most common name given to this incomplete chart at the time was `New Holland'. When Flinders completed his map, he called the country he had charted `Australia'. This was not the first time he had used that name. Even before he sailed he referred to New Holland as Australia and on first meeting Aborigines near Port Lincoln described them in the ship's log as `Australians'.</para><para>After all his work, adventures and exploration in Australia, and after seven years captivity on the French colony of Isle de France—Mauritius—Flinders finally came home to England a virtual nonentity. Cook had returned a hero. Flinders came back to a nation at war and, despite all he had achieved, a nation too engaged in fighting Napoleon to pay him much heed. Although something like due recognition has been given to Flinders since, the extent of what he did is still not well understood. As a country, we could do more to honour his achievement.</para><para>But on 18 July 1801 there was another expedition of science and discovery which was already in Australia. Australians know little about Nicolas Baudin, yet his achievements rank near those of Flinders. Baudin led two ships on an expedition which sailed from La Havre on Sunday, 19 October 1800. It was a triumphal departure. The ships, the <inline font-style="italic">Geographe</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Naturaliste</inline>, also had a passport for scientific purposes. This had been granted by the British and had to be presented to the commander of a British frigate blockading the port at the time of the departure so that Baudin's ships could be given free passage.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Geographe</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Naturaliste</inline> were later described by Francois Peron, who joined the expedition as a zoologist, as `the <inline font-style="italic">Geographe</inline>, a fine corvette of 30 guns, drawing from 15 to 16 feet water, an excellent sailor, but rather too slightly built for such service; and the <inline font-style="italic">Naturaliste, </inline>a large and strong built store ship, drawing much about the same waters as the <inline font-style="italic">Geographe</inline>, not so good a sailor, but more seaworthy and, on that account, much superior to the corvette.' The poor sailing qualities of the <inline font-style="italic">Naturaliste</inline> were to retard the expedition and frustrate Baudin for most of the time the expedition was at sea.</para><para>By the time Flinders left the <inline font-style="italic">Solent,</inline> the two French ships were in Shark Bay in Western Australia, having first touched Australian land near Cape Leeuwin on 25 April 1801. As Flinders was clearing the western approaches, the French had charted the south-west coast of Western Australia and Rottnest Island, had laboriously navigated the Swan River and were working on maps of the Shark Bay region. Any map of Western Australia will testify to their presence: Point D'Entrecasteaux, Cape Hamelin, Cape Freycinet, Cape Mentelle, Cape Clairault, Cape Naturaliste, Geographe Bay, Cape Bouvard, Heirisson Island, Freycinet Estuary, Hamelin Pool, Naturaliste Channel, Cape St Cricq, Cape Ronsard, Cape Cuvier, Cape Dupuy, Le Grande Island, Dalhambrey Island, Poissonier Point, Cape Bossut, Lagrange Bay, Cape Latouche Treville, Cape Bertholet, Lacepide Island, Lacepide Channel, Cape Leveque, Boneparte Archipellago, Montague Sound, Cape Voltaire, Montesquieu Island and Cape Bernier.</para><para>Many of his names have also been kept for landmarks in South Australia and, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, in Tasmania as well. Baudin was a sailor who worked his way up through the ranks. This and his apparent autocratic manner did not endear him to many in his crew and the savants that sailed with him. He had been dangerously ill for many months before he died on 16 September 1803 `around the middle of the day' at Port Northwest, Isle de France.</para><para>Although Flinders was relatively ignored upon his return, his reputation was restored by the middle of the 19th century. Those that sailed with Baudin traduced his reputation when they returned to France. Even now, although he is one of France's greatest explorers, his achievements are not properly recognised. Nothing he surveyed did he name after himself. The only permanent geographical reminder of his presence in Australia is the Baudin Rocks in the Great Australian Bight, named by Matthew Flinders.</para><para>In Australia's popular memory he is etched as an indistinct figure and not given real substance by a clear understanding of his historical role. He is perhaps best remembered because of his chance rendezvous off the site of where Victor Harbour now stands in Encounter Bay in April 1802. When they met, both commanders would have been right to assume that Britain and France would be at war. However, as men of science and exploration, both bearing passports to allow them free passage, they met in peace. In many respects they were rivals but it is to their enduring credit that they met peacefully and emerged in a spirit of cooperation. In our modern world that encounter between hostile flags should be a powerful symbol. For multicultural Australia, where tolerance and understanding are central, it shows what can be achieved and, because they met as equals in exploration and science, it demonstrates the international nature of the science ideal. All these are valid interpretations of the events and should be emblematic for contemporary Australia.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, in April next year we will celebrate the 200th anniversary of that meeting. Anyone who wants a more complete understanding of what Flinders and Baudin achieved should read Anthony J. Brown's very literate, authoritative and vivid history of their voyages, <inline font-style="italic">Ill Starred Captains Flinders and Baudin</inline>, published by Crawford House Publishing, Adelaide, Australia. As well as learning more about our early maritime exploration, any reader will be enjoyably entertained by Brown's lively prose and the effortless way in which he intertwines the stories of these two great explorers and renders them with compelling insight and understanding. I acknowledge this book as the source of the quotes that I have used tonight.</para><para>I understand that Anthony Brown is also the historical consultant to the Encounter committee, which is organising a celebration of Flinders's and Baudin's meeting next April. This parliament could well mark the occasion by transmitting a message of congratulations to the committee and supporting its work. I indicate that at the appropriate time I will move a notice of motion in these terms in order to give the Senate that opportunity. In the meantime, let me commend the committee in its efforts to commemorate this historical meeting. It is important in bringing our history alive and to deepen our understanding of our heritage.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>22:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>24534</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate

The analysis indicates that it makes economic sense to sell the Commonwealth's remaining shareholding in Telstra.

The Government has committed that it will not introduce legislation relating to the sale of the Government's remaining shareholding in Telstra until it is satisfied arrangements exist to deliver adequate services, in particular to rural and regional Australia. The Government's immediate priority is to get more services into rural and regional areas. At the present time, the Government is not satisfied that such arrangements are in place and believes more work needs to be done, including in the context of the response to the Telecommunications Service Inquiry into the adequacy of service levels in rural and regional areas.</para><para>(12)	The anticipated timetable for the further sale of Telstra is commercially confidential. Public release of such information could adversely affect the Commonwealth's financial interests.</para><para>(13)	The MYEFO Statement of Risks is consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998.

Following the election and MoGC changes, the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business (DWRSB) gained Employment from the then Department of Employment Education and Youth Affairs. This change significantly altered the Group by introducing mainframe requirements. As a result DWRSB removed itself from the Group, with the agreement of the Group and OASITO.</para><para>(6)	The changes in project specification did not substantially alter the cost to the department.</para><para>(7)	Yes.</para><para>(8)	OASITO prepared a paper which clearly articulated the roles and responsibilities of agencies, as well as their own organisation. This formed the basis for ensuring that agency business and particular requirements were included in the RFT and contract.</para><para>(9)	(a)	Group 5 members were responsible for undertaking the `service and risk' and financial evaluations of tenders. Department of Industry Science and Resources (DISR) later replaced by the Department of Communications, Information Technology, the Arts (DoCITA), in conjunction with industry advisers, was responsible for evaluating the Industry Development (ID) aspect of the bids. OASITO provided representatives on the `service and risk' and financial evaluation teams.</para><para>	(b)	Three assessments of the tenders against the published evaluation criteria were conducted separately and in parallel: (i) ID evaluation, (ii) service and risk evaluation and (iii) financial evaluation. The financial evaluation was kept separate in order to avoid biasing the outcome of the assessment of tenderers' technical and corporate offerings (`service and risk').</para><para>The findings of the service and risk evaluation were combined with the financial evaluation in a final evaluation report which was prepared by the evaluation teams and endorsed by the Group 5 Evaluation Committee. The Evaluation Coordinator had a key role in coordinating the final evaluation report. This committee consisted of representatives from each Group 5 agency and was also chaired by OASITO.</para><para>The combined service and risk and financial evaluation report was considered by the Group 5 Steering Committee which consisted of senior representatives from each Group 5 agency. The Steering Committee was also chaired by OASITO.</para><para>After acceptance by the Group 5 Steering Committee, the combined service and risk and financial evaluation report was presented to the Options Committee. This committee consisted of independent experts and ID representatives from DISR (then from DoCITA after the ID function was transferred to that agency). The Options Committee was chaired by OASITO. The Committee separately received the industry development report. Based on the latter report and the combined `service and risk' and financial evaluation report, the Options Committee made a recommendation to the Minister for Finance and Administration on the successful tenderer. Group 5 agencies were not represented on the Options Committee (with the exception of the ID representatives).</para><para>In the case of the Group 5 process, the `service and risk' evaluation involved a shortlisting process prior to the final evaluation finding (30 September 1998).

Under the agreement software is retained in the Commonwealth's name and managed by the external service provider, the exception being some back end server and network software.</para><para>(26)	Desktop equipment specifications are required to be updated in line with market trends every 6 months by the external service provider. LAN and other `backend' infrastructure is upgraded by the external service provider at their risk depending on the ability of that infrastructure to support the contracted service levels. The external service provider is required to prepare technology plans and update these at regular intervals in order to project future technology requirements and align these to stated agency business requirements.</para><para>(27)	The services agreement is non-exclusive. It allows the department to seek new technologies not only from the external service provider, but also from other service providers.</para><para>(28)	The department would be required to make additional payments to access new technologies where the new technologies fall outside the external service provider's contracted obligations in relation to evolving the service it provides. This may be as a result of a significant change in the department's business requirements.</para><para>(29)	The department provided no independent advice to Department of Finance and Administration (DoFA) in relation to potential savings from outsourcing.</para><para>(30)	No.</para><para>(31)	No. The department used the OASITO model to determine cost savings.</para><para>(32)	See question 31.

This proposition is supported by clinical, experimental and general biological evidence.</para><para>(2)	(a)	Clinical evidence is derived from experience with the epidemic of BSE in the United Kingdom. It has been estimated that approximately 750,000 BSE-infected cattle entered the food chain in the UK between 1974 and 1995. High-risk material from these animals would have ended up in meat and bone meal fed to pigs, poultry and cattle. Note that pigs and poultry are omnivorous animals and meat and bone meal has long been an important component of their rations. Furthermore, the amount of meat and bone meal fed to pigs and poultry would have been relatively higher than that fed to cattle. While there were over 179,000 confirmed cases of BSE in cattle, no cases of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy were discovered in pigs or poultry.</para><para>Investigations of BSE-infected cattle that were born after the ban on the feeding of meat and bone meal showed that cases were clustered in areas where pig and poultry raising was high. Significantly, meat meal was still included in the rations of pig and poultry but BSE only appeared in cattle probably as a result of the cross-contamination of feed.</para><para>Experimental evidence comes from studies to test whether a species barrier exists for BSE infection in pigs and poultry. In trials piglets were not infected when fed BSE-contaminated material. However, infection resulted when piglets were infected by direct inoculation into the peritoneal cavity or the brain. Domestic fowl were not infected when fed BSE-contaminated material or inoculated into the brain.</para><para>Additional evidence comes from general biology. First, and indirect, is that pigs and the domestic fowl are cannibalistic by their nature and are likely to be adapted to this habit. Second, chicken prions do not bind copper, pointing to an entirely different metabolism that may rule out the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Thirdly, chickens are unusual in that they mount immune responses against bovine prions and may be protected in this way. Fourth, the prion protein gene of the pig has overall similarity of 77% to 88% compared with the prion gene from other mammalian species. The prion gene of the chicken has 55% similarity or homology compared with the genes for mammals. This degree of dissimilarity is likely to be important in determining whether the first step in infection with BSE can occur in pigs and poultry.</para><para>	(b)	Specific mammalian material is a term used to describe what is banned from feeding to ruminant animals like sheep and cattle in order to close off the possibility of an epidemic of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in Australia's livestock. It originally included meat and bone meal prepared from ruminant animals. Now it also includes kangaroo meat.</para><para>On 9th March 2001 ARMCANZ extended the range of banned material to include porcine, equine, or macropod materials, blood and blood products, inspected meat products (which have been cooked and offered for human food and further heat processed into animal food) and poultry (offal and feather) meals and fish meals. This decision places Australia in the forefront of animal feeding practices throughout the world.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Newstart and Youth Allowances</title><page.no>24580</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3503)</subtitle><id.no>3503</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24580</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 8 March 2001:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	From November 1999 to March 2001 what were the monthly number of: (a) Youth Allowance (unemployed) recipients; and (b) Newstart Allowance recipients.</para><para>(2)	From November 1999 to March 2001 what were the monthly number of long-term (greater than 12 months) unemployed: (a) Youth Allowance (unemployed) recipients; and (b) Newstart Allowance recipients.</para><para>(3)	From November 1999 to March 2001 what were the monthly number of new claims for: (a) Youth Allowance (unemployed); and (b) Newstart Allowance.</para><para>(4)	From November 1999 to March 2001 what were the monthly number of new grants for: (a) Youth Allowance (unemployed); and (b) Newstart Allowance.</para><para>(5)	From November 1999 to March 2001 what were the monthly number of exits from: (a) Youth Allowance (unemployed); and (b) Newstart Allowance.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>24580</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)(a)	From November 1999 to February 2001, the monthly number of Youth Allowance (unemployed) recipients is given in table below.

Training activities at the range are centered on the range impact area of 1 square kilometre, utilising a north-south approach and departure axis. While a number of flight paths used for training overfly the same areas, the total area affected by the longest flight path used for range activities is approximately 80 square kilometres.</para><para>(4)	(a)	Yes.</para><para>	(b)	Defence has initiated a number of studies aimed at reducing the impact of aircraft noise on the surrounding communities, without impacting on RAAF training requirements.

A 'hot-line' has been established to answer public concerns and queries relating to military aircraft activities.</para><para>(5)	The impact of noise from airfields on surrounding land must be properly managed. The Department of Defence produces Australian Noise Exposure Forecasts (ANEFs) for all its military airfields to provide information to local planning authorities.

It is a temporary measure to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people, and needs to be assessed on that basis. That said, it is difficult to assess the impact of the Oil for Food program in isolation, as a range of factors have affected Iraq's economic situation. For example, the current regional drought has had an adverse effect on Iraq's food production, while the cost of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war severely depleted Iraq's economy.</para><para>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1302 of 8 June 2000 called for the appointment of independent experts to prepare a comprehensive report and analysis of the humanitarian situation in Iraq. However, the Iraqi Government has refused to cooperate with this initiative, meaning that a comprehensive, independent report on the humanitarian situation in Iraq is not available.</para><para>Nevertheless, there are indicators which suggest that conditions in Iraq have improved sharply under the Oil for Food program. For example, UN data show that the average daily food ration in Iraq has increased from around 1,275 kilocalories per person per day in 1996 (before the program began) to about 2,270 kilocalories in January 2001. Production of sheep, goat and chicken meat and milk have risen sharply in recent years. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that Iraq's GDP has increased more than three-fold since 1996, albeit from a low base. The abolition, in December 1999, of the ceiling on Iraqi oil exports under the Oil for Food program - together with higher oil prices - saw the value of Iraqi oil exports rise by over 300 per cent between 1997 and 2000.</para><para>(2)	There is no specific allocation for food per se under the Oil for Food program. Funds allocated to the humanitarian program may be spent on a range of humanitarian supplies - including food, medicine and a range of civilian infrastructure equipment - as well as on oil industry spare parts and equipment to the value of US$600 million every six months. The Iraqi Government and, in the case of the three Northern governorates, the responsible UN agencies, are free to determine the proportion of the funds available under the humanitarian program which is allocated to food.</para><para>Between 10 December 1996 and 28 February 2001 Iraq's total oil revenue amounted to the equivalent of some $US39.6 billion. Of this amount, around US$25.7 billion (or an average of 65 per cent) was allocated to the humanitarian program. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1330 of 5 December 2000 decided that an average of around 72 per cent of proceeds from the current six-month phase (Phase IX) of the Oil for Food program will be allocated to the humanitarian program. UNSCR 1330 also expressed the Security Council's intention to establish a mechanism to review the appropriateness of this allocation.</para><para>Between 10 December 1996 and 28 February 2001, food supply contracts valued at US$8.2 billion were lodged for approval with UN. This represents 32 per cent of the total allocation to the humanitarian program, and 21 per cent of Iraq's total oil revenue, over this period.</para><para>The Iraqi regime reportedly also earns substantial revenue from oil smuggling. However, evidence suggests that this revenue is spent on luxury items for members of the regime, not on the humanitarian needs of the ordinary Iraqi.</para><para>(3)	Yes.</para><para>(4)	The resources available to the Iraqi Government for expenditure on its citizens' needs include its share of export revenue under the Oil For Food program, taxation receipts and other revenue earned from domestic economic activity and the proceeds from oil smuggling.</para><para>As noted above, around US$25.7 billion was allocated to the humanitarian program between 10 December 1996 and 28 February 2001. Over the same period, oil smuggling has contributed substantial funds (over US$1 billion in 1999 alone, according to Economist Intelligence Unit estimates) to the Iraqi regime. The Iraqi Government's revenues from domestic economic activity are unknown, as it has not published financial accounts for some time, but they are substantial given the government's extensive involvement in the domestic economy. For example, the IMF estimates that, in 1993 (the last year for which IMF estimates are available) government consumption amounted to 13.9 per cent of GDP and gross fixed capital formation (much of which would be Government-controlled) amounted to a further 14.5 per cent of GDP.</para><para>The paucity of information on Iraqi Government domestic revenues, and the difficulty of quantifying the proceeds from oil smuggling, mean that it is not possible to give a comprehensive estimate of the total funds the Iraqi Government has available to spend on its citizens' needs.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>International Convention Against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries</title><page.no>24592</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3566)</subtitle><id.no>3566</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24592</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator Bourne</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 April 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Did the Minister state in a press release in July 1997 that this Convention was a `top priority' for this Government.</para><para>(2)	Can the Minister explain why the Government has not signed the Convention, which has been open to signatures since 1990.</para><para>(3)	When will the Government sign and ratify this Convention.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>24592</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Yes.</para><para>(2)	Article 18, paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that “The present Convention shall be open for signature by all States until 31 December 1990 at United Nations Headquarters in New York” (emphasis added).

The AFP does not have the capability to perform these types of tests. The passenger was advised by the AFP case officer in Perth that it would take at least until 1 May 2001 before a result could be expected.</para><para>Customs had previously advised the passenger that hemp oil was a prohibited import unless it was for medical treatment, prescribed by a medical practitioner and supplied in accordance with that prescription.</para><para>If these conditions could not be satisfied, an import permit would be required from the Therapeutic Goods Administration.</para><para>On arrival the passenger presented to Customs officers a letter from his GP that confirmed his medical condition and asking that the patient be given special consideration with aircraft seat allocation. This letter contained no mention of hemp oil.</para><para>(2)	The AFP uses the services of AGAL to analyse all routine seizures under a Service Level Agreement that stipulates a time frame of 15 working days from receipt of the substance by AGAL to the issuing of results. Transportation delays, particularly from Perth, impact on the total time required.</para><para>The hemp seed oil was forwarded to AGAL on 2 April 2001. Initial results of the analysis received by the AFP on 14 May 2001 indicate there was no narcotic substance in the oil.</para><para>(3)	In response to inquiries by the passenger prior to travel, he was informed by Customs that the importation of hemp oil into Australia was prohibited unless he could produce evidence that a doctor had prescribed the substance for a medical condition or obtain authority to import from the Therapeutic Goods Administration office in Canberra. The passenger satisfied neither of these conditions upon presenting to Customs.</para><para>In his subsequent interview with AFP officers, the passenger produced a second letter from his doctor in the UK recommending that hemp oil would be beneficial in the treatment of his condition.</para><para>(4)	The passenger was with AFP at Perth Airport for 1 hour 10 minutes from 3.50 pm to 5.00 pm. During this time every possible concern was shown for his welfare. The actual record of interview took 34 minutes, from 4.22 pm to 4.56 pm.</para><para>Prior to that, Customs records show that the passenger's flight arrived at Perth Airport a little after 2.30 pm and he was processed through the passport control point at 2.39 pm. After collecting his baggage, the passenger was referred for further examination, having declared prohibited goods. It was approximately 3.20 pm before an examination bench became available. This delay in the baggage retrieval and examination area was due to congestion caused by three flights arriving within a short space of time and additional foot and mouth disease check processes. While 30 minutes is longer than expected for the Customs examination, a lot of this time was taken up with answering the passenger's queries about the importation of hemp oil with reference to Customs legislation.</para><para>(5)	When presenting to Customs the passenger did not demonstrate that he satisfied the required conditions under Australian law for the importation of hemp seed oil.</para><para>While the letter from the passenger's doctor was technically not a prescription, it provided sufficient evidence to support the passenger's claim. Had it been produced to Customs at the time of arrival, the goods could have been released.</para><para>The results of the chemical analysis confirmed the oil contained no narcotic substance. The passenger returned to the UK on 13 May 2001. As a result the AFP is arranging to return the oil to him.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>AusAid: Kikori Integrated Conservation and Development Project</title><page.no>24594</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3571)</subtitle><id.no>3571</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24594</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 1 May 2001:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Has the World Wide Fund for Nature applied to AusAid for funding for the Kikori Integrated Conservation and Development Project (KICDP).</para><para>(2)	Has the grant been approved; if so, how much has been approved.</para><para>(3)	When was the first application for the grant made.</para><para>(4)	For what has funding been sought.</para><para>(5)	If a grant has been applied for, but not yet approved, what amount has been sought.</para><para>(6)	Is the Kikori Pacific Limited (KPL) eco-forestry project a part of the broader KICDP.</para><para>(7)	Is the Minister aware that the Papua New Guinea Forestry Authority recently stated that the KPL project does not have approval to be logging mangroves.</para><para>(8)	When was AusAid first made aware that the KPL eco-forestry project that was established by the World Wide Fund for Nature was logging mangroves.</para><para>(9)	What action, if any, did AusAid take when it received this information.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>24595</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>1.

AusAID has undertaken enquiries to clarify the situation. As a result of those enquiries, AusAID considers that the allegations that KPL is logging mangroves currently remain unsubstantiated. AusAID understands that the main business of KPL is training local forest groups in sustainable eco-forestry and sawmilling timber from raw logs sold by small-scale local forestry groups. It also markets the sawn timber of the local eco-forestry company Iviri Timber Investments. It does not undertake harvesting of forest timber. AusAID funding in 1999-00 was for a financial review of KPL.</para><para>The PNG Office of Environment and Conservation (OEC) in Port Moresby is undertaking a full investigation into the allegations. WWF has indicated its willingness to cooperate fully with the OEC investigation and has notified AusAID that it was delaying further activity in relation to KPL under the 'Sustainable Forest Management Program in PNG'.
