I do not share your assertion that to proceed with the case would be to pander to Dr Wooldridge. In order to share that assertion, I would have to agree with whatever claim the AMA have made. I cannot do that; I have not even seen the claim that they have put. I am not certain, for that matter, that either Dr Wooldridge or the Attorney have seen it.

It may well be taxpayers' money. You say, `Pay up. Get peace. Give them some money.'

Sound economic management has enabled us to responsibly invest in this nation's future, like the extra $3 billion that we are investing in innovation, science and technology. Total funding for science and innovation this year is going to be $4.7 billion, which is a record. Of course, the reason we are able to make these kinds of investments is that we are delivering budget surpluses and paying off Labor's debt. As we all know, Labor racked up $80 billion in debt in their last five years in government, and we will have repaid nearly $60 billion of that by the end of this budget year. We are saving $4 billion a year in interest payments, and that is money that we can now spend on things like innovation instead of paying off interest, which is what had to happen under Labor.</para></talk.start><para>Therefore, we were extremely interested to see in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> the latest proposal from Dr Carmen Lawrence, the industry spokesperson for the Labor Party, on how Labor are going to pay for their promisesâpromises they have not yet told us about. The latest proposal from Dr Lawrence is, remarkably, to issue government bonds to fund Labor's Knowledge Nation policy, a policy we are yet to know anything about. She does not seem to realise that, when you issue government bonds, all you are doing is creating more debt. We now know, thanks to Dr Lawrence this morning in the paper, that Labor propose to fund their Knowledge Nation policy by racking up even more debt and by putting the nation back into hock.</para><para>We know they are going to pay for this Knowledge Nation policy simply by sticking it on the bankcard, just like they did for 13 years when they were in government last time. They racked up massive debtâthe sort of debt we had never seen in this country beforeâbut still managed to leave the nation with less investment in knowledge than when they came into government. You wonder what on earth they did with all the money that they racked up in debt.</para><para>Dr Lawrence was a senior minister and Premier of Western Australia during that state's extraordinary financial disaster, so she is certainly an expert when it comes to debt. It is remarkable that, after more than five years in opposition and with less than six months until an election, Labor's best policy to fund their election promises is to go into more debt. But, if you are going to issue government bonds and if you are going to rack up more debt, you are going to place upward pressure on interest rates. Dr Lawrence's plan is going to mean upward pressure on interest rates. We know that they are going to go into debt and raise interest rates to pay for this elusive Knowledge Nation.</para><para>This is the old debt loving Labor Party that we knew so well for 13 years. This is on top of the roll-back policy which Chris Murphy has assured us is going to mean increased interest rates. We know from Senator Conroy that, to pay for their roll-back policy, Labor are going to have to increase income taxes. There is no other way to pay for it. We now know, courtesy of a poll in the Melbourne papers over the weekend, that most of the electorate think Senator Conroy is right: they are going to have to pay for roll-back by increasing income taxes.</para><para>Dr Lawrence, the innovation shadow minister, is the same Dr Lawrence who viciously attacked the biotechnology industry in the House of Representatives recently and she is the same Dr Lawrence who wants to close down our new nuclear research reactor and cost 800 scientific jobs in this country, and now she has trotted out a funny money scheme to pay for her Knowledge Nation, whatever that may be. All she has done today is reveal what we all suspected, and that is that a Labor government simply means higher debt, higher interest rates and higher income taxes.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>25066</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>25066</page.no><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOrder!

It is not true that everybody affected by it necessarily knows the details. In a circumstance where either there are logistical reasons why people might not be in touch with that information or there might be practical reasonsâfor example, a lobby group might be providing incorrect information to a bodyâit is quite appropriate that the government informs that group of people, to the best of its ability, about the changes.</para></talk.start><para>Within my own portfolio, there is the example of the extension to the Commonwealth seniors health card, which meant that something like 400,000 people were entitled, and yet only something like 200,000 had applied. Clearly, we needed to do more to make those people who were entitled aware that they were entitled. I again endorse the comments of Senator Evans, who indicated in estimates that he got sick to death of people asking, `Why aren't I entitled to this?' when they were in fact entitled.

Senator, firstly, as you understand, the issue of diversion is about contravening Customs controls at the borders in order to avoid paying customs or excise duties as well as GST. Secondly, in existing legislation the requirements for the export and then possible return of the goods to Australia are quite clear as long as the importer-exporter provides accurate information to Customs. It is where inaccurate information is provided that fraud potentially exists. </para></talk.start><para>The issue of diversion of exports was raised by the government in the context of amendments to the Customs Act which, amongst other things, provide Customs with some new powers to address diversion, particularly of exports. Diversion of exports can take a number of forms, but experience to date suggests that there have been cases where high taxed goodsâfor example, cigarettesâhave been either exported duty free and then reimported possibly described as something else, or where they were sold duty free, packed for export, but never made it to the ship, having been unlawfully unpacked and replaced by waste paper, telephone books, or some other such product. </para><para>The 30 per cent figure you quote, Senator Murrayâas you have quoted in the past and you are quoting here today and want clarifiedâis not a figure that is necessarily an accurate assessment of what is in Australia. It is an assessment of what is overseas. But there is further evidence from that inquiry that indicates that there is a problem, and that is why Customs takes it seriously. The evidence from the spirits industry to the committee inquiry claimed that there was very widespread diversion of spirits exported to overseas destinations.</para><para>In relation to cigarette smuggling, for example, a number of fraud investigations have been concluded and there are some under way, many of them cooperative investigations between Commonwealth agencies and Commonwealth and state agencies. In respect of the evidence to the Senate committee, work is well under way within Customs to assess the evidence, and discussions with the spirit industry will commence shortly. There are some issues that need to be resolved, some of which may be commercial issues as opposed to directly illegal behaviour. </para><para>In conclusion, we do take these issues of diversion, or fraud against the GST or customs duty very seriously. A number of amendments to the Customs Act are specifically designed to ensure Customs can better deal with those exports and reduce the risk of fraud or diversion. As you say, Senator, those amendments have been passed. Finally, this is quite specifically a Customs responsibility, not a tax responsibility, as it is often referred to in the media.

I would like to say that I was confident that when your party was in government such a rigorous process was followed, but I can assure you that it is followed by this government.

He had a distinguished career in the Royal Australian Air Force, has been active in the veterans' associations having been chairman of the Vasey Housing Association in New South Wales. Any remuneration for directors is set by the Remuneration Tribunal, not by the minister. I think that clarifies for you, Senator, that there is a well-established process and this is not simply a case of somebody appointing somebody they like.

The Howard government has a number of initiatives for Northern Australia, not the least of which was the Northern Australia Forum where we engaged northerners to look at ways of progressing their future. In addition to that, the Howard government has directly and proactively invested in the development of Northern Australia. The Australia Magnesium Corporation is investing $1.3 billion in a magnesium enterprise. It is doing that because of the support of $50 million from this government. That will create 1,000 jobs in construction, 350 permanent jobs and up to 20,000 indirect jobs. The Syntroleum projectâand Senator Eggleston will be very interested in this oneâis going ahead with gas to liquid fuel technology. A $40 million loan from the Howard government has confirmed that project in the Dampier region of Western Australia. We all know about the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. That is another nation building project in Northern Australia. That involves $190 million from the federal government, creating some 7,100 jobs in Northern Australia. As my colleague, Senator Minchin, mentioned yesterday, the latest of these Howard government investments in the north is the Asia-Pacific Space Consortium and the $800 million, first commercial space launch facility in the world. That will create 400 jobs in construction, 550 permanent jobs throughout Australia, and all because of the Howard government's investment of $100 million in public use infrastructure on Christmas Island.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Eggleston asked me whether I was aware of any alternative projects. In spite of questions from the most hardheaded of journalists, and repeated questions in this chamber and the other chamber, so far there has been not a glimmer of a policy on anything from the Labor Party. However, thanks to what I call the Zimmerman extraction, we now know that the Labor Party will raise taxes. The Zimmerman extraction, as you know, Madam President, was like drawing teeth, but young Carl Zimmerman extracted from the opposition Senator's Conroy concession that they will increase taxes should Labor win government. </para><para>We all now know that it is Labor's policy to increase taxes. However, I am concerned about the other element of the Zimmerman extraction where Senator Conroy indicated that the Labor Party could cut services. That worries me as a regional Australian, and as a Northern Australian, because all the way through, the Labor Party has opposed every initiative of the Howard government for rural and regional Australia. Remember the Networking the Nation project that has delivered telecommunications to regional Australia? That was opposed by Labor. Remember the Rural Transaction Centres Program? That was opposed by Labor. Remember Regional Solutions? That was opposed by Labor. Remember the Roads to Recovery program, which Labor called a boondoggle? I challenge the Labor Party, and in fact I challenge Senator Conroy, to answer me three simple questions: will Labor keep Regional Solutions in the current form and at the current level? Will Labor keep the Rural Transaction Centres Program in its current form and at its current level? And will Labor keep Roads to Recovery in its current form and at its current level? We need those answers to assure the future of services to regional Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>MRI Scanners: Funding</title><page.no>25075</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>25075</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Vanstone, representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care.

In this the centenary year of our Federation, we acknowledge this special but often unseen contribution to making this building function for us and for the one million visitors who come here each year. We thank the officers past and present of the Joint House Department for their high quality and loyal service to us all.</para><para>The Parliamentary Library marked its centenary with a special staff dinner on 5 June 2001, and last week the Speaker and I opened a special exhibition in the Presiding Officers exhibition area which has been jointly mounted by the National Library and the Parliamentary Library. This collaboration in the exhibition is entirely appropriate, because the National Library and the Parliamentary Library were for a long time the same institution and the bonds which link the two professionally remain strong and mutually beneficial. If senators have not yet had the opportunity to visit the exhibition, I hope they will do so.</para><para>The Library is of course very important to all senators and members. It enables us to be much better informed and more erudite in the chambers, in committees and in our constituencies than we would otherwise be.

We have agency staff allegedly saying to staff at nursing homes, `There's no chance of you being shut down because we know Mrs Phillips has political connections.' We have the industryâboth the private, for-profit sector and the not-for-profit sector of the industryâcalling for an inquiry into the agency's handling of accreditation and expressing serious concern about what they see as political interference in the role of the agency.

For Minister Vanstone and the Prime Minister to try to deflect those concerns by claiming that we are merely slurring people is quite unfair because, when you look at it, the agency board does look much more like a North Shore Liberal Party branch meeting than an agency charged with responsibility for aged care in this country and which is allegedly independent of the minister. The board was set up with the charter of being independent of government. What we now know is that the minister has appointed to that board the president of the Liberal Party Mackellar federal electorate councilâwhich is in her electorateâwho also is her campaign manager; we know that she has appointed a former Liberal state MP for Pittwater, which is a state seat inside her federal electorate; and we know that she has appointed as chair Mr Harrowell, whose claim to fame is that he is a close friend of the minister's. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>âThat makes him unique.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>âAs I say, the minister probably has a small circle from which to draw if she is appointing friends, but she has found three and she has put them on the board. Minister Vanstone, in her response today, said, `It's all about diversity.' It is funny that on this board it seems the best qualification is to be a friend of the minister, a member of the Liberal Party and a resident of the North Shore. It does not look like a very diverse board to me. I do not question that a number of the people on the board are competent in their field, but when Mr Harrowell was asked why he was appointed chair, he expressed the view that he had no experience in aged care, he had no interest in the subject and he accepted the job on the basis that the minister asked him. Why did she ask him? He is a friend, he used to be in her former husband's law firm, he lives on the North Shore and he would make a good job of it.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>â How much does he earn on it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>âThey all, of course, get honorariums, et cetera. But the real concern goes to the question of political interference. These are three people closely aligned to the minister who have been appointed to the board. If you are trying to ensure a perception of independence, clearly that is not possible when you have people so closely connected, both personally and politically, to the minister, particularly when there are complaints about another person who has similar qualificationsâthat is, one who has North Shore Liberal Party connections, runs nursing homes and is the subject of very serious concern about the standard of care provided at those nursing homes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is the public policy issue at stake. There is very serious concern about the lack of independence of the board. There is very serious concern about the treatment of complaints about the homes run by Millie Phillips. We have the evidence of the former chair resigning and saying that she was concerned about political interference. But what really galls is that if you have a complaint about any of this, if you are really concerned about the treatment you have had from the agency, then you can take your complaint to the complaints commissioner, who just happens to be a Mr Rob Knowles, a former Victorian Liberal Party minister who was appointed in secret without any public selection criteria or selection process to an $80,000 a year part-time job as the complaints commissioner. So whichever way you turn in aged care, you run into political interference and you run into friends of the minister appointed because of their political connections, not because of their interests in aged care. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>25080</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Evans has tried very hard over there to make a case that, in some way, having people with some connection with the Liberal Party being involved in the management of aged care is bad and wrong and reprehensible and not to be entertained.

The facts of the matter are that the aged care sector was mismanaged in a very dismal way by the Labor Party during its 13 grey years of government. What our government has done is to greatly improve aged care. It has done this by ensuring that the standards of aged care homes are improved. It has established an accreditation process so that aged care homes are no longer dank, dirty, horrible places where people go to dieâwhere they are left, with bed sores, in beds that are soaked with urine; where there is overcrowding, toilets that do not work and no proper ventilation; and where insufficient arrangement has been made for people's proper care, in terms of extinguishers, fire escapes and so on, should there be a fire. All of these things have been improved under the Howard government. So why shouldn't the management of aged care homes be improved as well?

In fact, when the coalition came to office, 75 per cent of aged care homes did not meet building standards, 13 per cent did not meet fire safety standards and 11 per cent did not meet basic health standards. That is something which Labor should be terribly ashamed about. Throughout their lives, the aged people of our community have worked and paid their taxesâand the Labor Party just left them to live the last years of their lives in these terrible, degrading circumstances.</para><para>When the coalition came in, we saw aged care as a major issue that had to be addressed, and we set about doing so. The coalition believes that all Australians should have access to a high quality aged care system, and that is what we have sought to provide.

As part of the coalition's belief in a strong private sector, we have set up arrangements to ensure that aged care homes in the private sector have better facilities and a stronger financial base than they ever had during the dismal years of the Labor government.</para><para>Senator Evans is taking a very, very narrow view.

We saw again today Senator Vanstone take numerous questions on notice. In fact, I think she has taken more questions on notice than I have had hot dinnersâand that is an awful lot. But I want to make this explicit from the outset: I strongly support the principle of governments covering the legal costs of their ministers when action is taken against those ministers whilst they are performing their public duties. Such support always has to be on a case-by-case basis and, in my view, should always be determined by cabinet, not just by the Attorney-General.</para></talk.start><para>This should not be taken as carte blanche for any minister to cruise around the country defaming people at will. Indeed, there is no such behavioural pattern in this government or in any past government. But I am concerned at the public statements made early in this issue by Dr Wooldridge, and let me quote. He said that taxpayers would have to `foot the bill' if the court found against him. He went on to say, `I'll be indemnified by government so it's pretty meaningless.' These statements represent institutionalised arrogance by Dr Wooldridge. He should not be using the deep-pocket argument to defend himself from remarks that he has made in public.</para><para>It is quite clear that Dr Wooldridge's characterisation of Dr Phelps will be very hard to defend in a court of law, and so it would serve everyone's interest if this matter were settled. It would certainly allow Dr Wooldridge to get on and tackle the many tasks that face him in his ministerial portfolio. It would certainly help in terms of the relationship between the AMA and the government. Finally, and more importantly, it may well save the taxpayer a substantial sum of money.</para><para>What we had here today in Senator Vanstone's performance was her trying to allege that the opposition was saying that this should be settled for money out of court. No such proposition was put forward. Such a misrepresentation of the opposition's position is disgraceful, frankly. We all know this issue can be settled for no money and no legal costs. It is time that Dr Wooldridge faced up to his responsibilities and got rid of this one off the agenda. It is very unlikely that Dr Wooldridge would ever want to accept any gratuitous advice off me. But there is an old saying that Tony Mulvihill used to tell me in politics: `Son, never flash outside the off stump.' Minister Wooldridge has, and it is time to go back and correct his technique.</para><para>One matter that remains unresolved on all this is: if this matter does go to court and there is an adverse finding against Dr Wooldridge, who picks up the damages? This could be a very critical thing to public policy in future because there cannot ever be a government guarantee that it will pick up the damages, as opposed to the costs, for a minister. There may be precedents on this. I certainly do not know of any, and I do not think at this stage officials from Prime Minister and Cabinet have been able to point me in the direction where such a precedent might exist. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>âAt the federal level.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>âYes, at the federal level. What happens if costs and damages are not covered? It is going to be very hard to get people into public life, to go into the robust world of politics and ministerial life, with no protection at all. But, in this case, I do urge Dr Wooldridge to settle. On the other matter, we have the irony of Dr Wooldridge's department paying his AMA fees year in and year out and also paying for an audio tape that attacks the AMA, all put together by the Liberal Party media training person whom they have used over timeâMichael Schildberger. This must have been a deliberate attempt to attack the AMA. Michael Schildberger is quite a good bloke; he is experienced. He would have known what Dr Wooldridge had said. So we have this great irony: the department pays his AMA fees and pays him to put out audio tapes attacking the AMA. This is a case for the Prime Minister to intervene once again, to settle this particular case, to move it off the agenda and to move the agenda along. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>25082</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to take up where Senator Ray finished. I have been around a long time, Senator Rayânot as long as yourselfâand I was around when the Labor health minister, Dr Blewett, sued the AMA. In fact, I was on the AMA Federal Council when that occurred. I think he got 60,000 bucks out of them, if my memory serves me right. This is not new. The Labor Party are attacking the Liberal Party and the government for a stoush between the President of the AMA and the government. What is new? This has been on from time immemorial. The reality is that there is always a conflict between the providers of health care and the government, on the other hand, which has to get the taxation out of the taxpayers to pay for health care. What did the Labor Party do when they were in power? They had 13 years. They had a deliberate attack on the profession in an attempt to socialise the profession; that is what it was. They had an attack on private health care so that people would not be able to afford private health insurance. The figures went down precipitously to below 30 per cent of people who were able to afford private health insurance in this country.</para></talk.start><para> If there is one thing that Minister Wooldridge and the government have achieved in five years, it is to bring the percentage of people in this country who can afford private health care up to over 41 per cent. In fact, 3.2 million extra people can now afford private health insurance who could not under the Labor Party when they were in power. The reality is that that has relieved the pressure on the public hospital system. With the introduction of the new tax system, the GST is going to the states and no longer will they be able to say that it is the federal government's fault that the public hospital system cannot cope with the number of people. The reality is that we are very proud of what we have achieved in five short years to bring up the number of people who can afford private health insurance because of the 30 per cent rebate so that we have an equitable system where people have freedom of choice. The Labor Party were rapidly heading to a fully socialised system which would be totally dependent on the public hospital systems of this country. With state Labor governments almost completely throughout this country, there will now be no further excuse, because the GST is going to the state governments. So they can no longer complain.</para><para>There is another matter that has been brought upâthat is, the so-called politicisation of appointments. It is hypocrisy that the Labor Party should talk about politicisation of appointments when you look at what they did in the 13 years that they were in office. I would be very interested to go through and see who the appointments were to the boards and committees and everything that occurred during that period. There were some cases where Labor Party hacks were not appointed because there were none to appoint, because the reality is that the majority of my profession support the government. </para><para>Many advances have occurred over that period of time, in relation not only to the public hospital system but to the number of aged care places that have been available. The new system that this government brought in increased the number of aged care places available for older Australians. When we came to office in 1996, the Auditor-General found that there was a deficit of 10,000 aged care places left by the previous Labor government. In the last two approval rounds and in the 2001 round, over 31,000 new places will have been released to make up the deficit and to meet the need for growth. So not only have we advanced the opportunities for people to take up private health insurance and therefore access to the private hospital system; we have increased the number of aged care places that are available. </para><para>Let us talk about residential aged care. In 1995-96, the former Labor government spent $2.5 billion on residential aged care, and the outlay in the 2000-01 financial year is expected to be $3.9 billionâthat is, there is a jump from $2.5 billion to $3.9 billion. The total income to providers of residential aged care during the five years following the reforms is projected to increase from some $4.2 billion in 1997-98 to $6 billion next year. That is an increase of some 41 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>25083</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMinister Wooldridge is a minister out of control.

Each of the state health ministers and premiers in this country, including Liberal Party and National Party ministers, had lost confidence in the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge, and they had to go to the Premiers Conference with the Prime Minister to endeavour to get the issue sorted out. I recall being at a function of the pharmaceutical industry only a couple of months ago where Minister Wooldridge harangued and attacked the Senate because, in his view, it had the temerity to suggest some amendments to his legislation in respect of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. And guess what? The overwhelming bulk of the state ministers agree with our amendments, and I predict that the government will come back and accept many of the amendments that were moved by the opposition in the Senate.</para><para>During question time, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Vanstone, to tell us how much was contributed by the Department of Health and Aged Care and how much was contributed by the private health company Mayne Health to the production of the audio cassette tape that was sent to every doctor in this country. This audio cassette tape is of an interview by Michael Schildberger with the Minister for Health and Aged Care. Michael Schildberger, as Senator Ray has pointed out, does paid work for the Liberal Party in media training. This interview between Mr Schildberger and Dr Wooldridge has been sent to every doctor in this country. It is supposed to set out the government's position on the federal budget 2001 in respect of health care. I invite Minister Vanstone to listen to it, because she obviously has not done so. It is an attack upon doctors and the AMA, and it has been funded by Minister Wooldridge's own department in conjunction with another private company. Minister Vanstone cannot tell us how much was contributed by Mayne Health. </para><para>I want to read to the Senate the note on the cover sheet that comes with the cassette.

As we all know, the decision by the Commonwealth to award $220 million to Victoria for the Scoresby Freeway was driven by the fact that we have a by-election in Aston. First of all, as everybody knows, $220 million will not be enough to deliver a freeway in Scoresby. The Victorian state government has no money in its budget for the Scoresby Freeway, and the Commonwealth government should have known that. No doubt it did know that. The cost of Scoresby will be around $1 billion, so $220 million, even if it is matched dollar for dollar with Commonwealth money, is insufficient to build this freeway.</para><para>The real point of my question was to ask about public transport and why the Commonwealth has not taken the time to look at the urgent need in this part of Melbourne for improvements not just in public transport but also in roads in the area, which are in desperate need of being fixed. The minister also ignored my question a couple of days ago on the matter of public transport. It is interesting that today the mayor of Knox came out and said that he can, under no circumstances, support the Scoresby Freeway because it does not have any element of support for public transport in it.</para><para>Back in the seventies, when the Eastern Freeway was constructed, Melburnians were promised that public transport would be upgraded. It has not happened, and it is not likely to happen with Scoresby either. The minister should have been working on the viability of this project. He says that the governmentâin particular, a number of members in the lower houseâhave been working on this issue for some time. If they had been working on it, they would have asked these questions: how viable is this freeway, how important is it, and is it wanted by the residents of Aston?</para><para>We need to bear in mind that Aston is a growth corridor in Melbourne. An integrated public transport solution is absolutely essential to the many young families in the Aston area. It would be an incentive for further growth in that area. As in any other part of Melbourne, in Aston there are many older Australians who receive social security and many studentsâpeople who do not have access to a car and who do not have somebody driving them around. These are the people who need public transport. Particularly, the 10 per cent of 16-year-olds to 21-year-olds in Melbourne's east who are unemployed do not have access to private motor vehicles and, therefore, public transport is their only solution.</para><para>The minister says that he is not interested in what councils say. He says that that is a matter for the state governments. I would argue that it is Commonwealth funding being committed here and that the Commonwealth has a responsibility to make sure that this is not simply a political decisionâthat this is not simply a bit of money being thrown towards Victoria just because a by-election is onâand that this money is properly considered in the light of what is really needed in this part of the world. While we are on that subject, if the government is interested in Aston at the by-election of 14 July then it will pay a bit more attention to public education in the area. There are schools in the Aston electorate that desperately need more funding. This government is interested in handing out the dollars to the private sector only, and the Labor Party has supported that. A huge windfall to private schools went through at the end of last year, with the support of both major parties. In Aston, it is critical that we look at the issue of public education.</para><para>Beyond schools, we need to make sure the community support services can properly cope and assist young people. It is a disgrace that fantastic programs like the clean slate program, which operated out of the Dandenong Children's Court, faltered because of a lack of funding. This program helped to rebuild the confidence, self-esteem and skills of young offenders with the aim of keeping them from being entrenched in the criminal justice system. It is also a disgrace that no such program operates out of the Ringwood Children's Court. We know that the child protection system is in chaos. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>25085</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>25085</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name><name.id>BX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam Deputy President, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name></talker><para>âYesterday, in the discussion about the tabling of the Economics References Committee report on mass marketed tax schemes, I spoke for several minutes, as did my colleague Senator Chapman.

The term âsupplyâ has no fixed meaning. Sometimes the proposal is propounded with such terms as âbudget measuresâ or âmeasures vital to governmentâ, which also have no fixed meaning. Behind the proposal is a concept that the executive government cannot continue to function (that is, cannot continue to spend money on government services) if some kinds of financial legislation are not passed by the Parliament, and the Senate should be prevented from withholding those kinds of financial legislation.</para><para>As usually described, the proposal would involve amending the Constitution so that some category of legislation could be passed into law without the consent of the Senate. This would mean that the executive government of the day could legislate by decree within that category, because governments usually control the House of Representatives and governors-general assent to legislation on the advice of the government. </para><para>The problem of describing the category of legislation which could be passed in this way gives rise to a larger problem. However the category is described, it raises the possibility of a government being able to include any legislation in that category and thereby pass all of its legislation by decree.</para><para>For example, supporters of the proposal often say that appropriation bills should be passed without the consent of the Senate. An appropriation bill is a bill which includes a clause appropriating money, whether of specified or unspecified amount. Many bills appropriate money, often of unspecified amount. A government can include an appropriation clause in any bill. Sometimes the proposal is restricted to the annual appropriation bills, but the government can include any material in the annual appropriation bills. Sometimes the proposal refers to packages of taxation legislation, but any package of legislation can be turned into a taxation package simply by the inclusion of a bill imposing a levy or charge of some kind.</para><para>All proposals for âstopping the Senate blocking supplyâ so far advanced would allow a government to bypass the Senate with any legislation.</para><para>When it is recollected that governments usually control the House of Representatives on the basis of only forty-odd percent of the electors' votes, but a majority of the Senate usually represents a majority of the electors as reflected in their votes, the danger of allowing a government to bypass the Senate with any legislation is apparent.</para><para>The usual proposal also goes beyond its stated purpose of avoiding a recurrence of the 1975 situation. The objection to the Senate's action in 1975 is to its purpose (to force the government to an election) rather than to the action itself. The rejection or delay of major financial legislation, including annual appropriation bills, by the Senate for other reasons has not attracted the same objection. The first two appropriation bills in 1901 were rejected by the Senate until amended to specify particular amounts and accurately reflect the relevant constitutional provisions. Other precedents followed; in 1970 the then Opposition party in the Senate came within one vote of rejecting the annual appropriation bills because of a general objection to government policies.</para><para>This bill provides a better method for avoiding a recurrence of the events of 1975, while not allowing the government to bypass the Senate with any legislation.</para><para>It would amend the Constitution to provide that, from the commencement of a financial year, until the Senate passes the annual appropriations for that year, the government could draw on appropriations up to the amount of those for the previous year, so that the failure of the Senate to pass the annual appropriation bills would not prevent the government functioning. </para><para>The bill would also restrict appropriation bills for the ordinary annual services of the government strictly to annual appropriations for that purpose, and allow the courts to declare void any appropriation bill which goes beyond that purpose. </para><para>This is necessary to make the proposal foolproof.</para><para>Currently section 54 of the Constitution restricts a bill appropriating money for the ordinary annual services of the government to appropriations for that purpose. There is no requirement, however, that a bill be restricted to appropriations for one year only; the government could put forward a bill appropriating money for the ordinary annual services for several years. The restriction on the content of the bill is also not justiciable; it relies on dealings between the Senate and the House of Representatives under section 53 of the Constitution for its interpretation. The only sanction against a government including other matters in the ordinary annual services bill is that the Senate could refuse to pass the bill until the extraneous matters were removed. This sanction would clearly be weakened if the government could draw on appropriations equal to those of the previous year while the Senate declined to pass the bill.</para><para>The bill would therefore make justiciable the prohibition in section 54 of the Constitution, so that the High Court could declare invalid any ordinary annual services bill which contained extraneous matters.</para><para>The meaning of âordinary annual services of the governmentâ has been fairly clearly explicated by dealings between the Senate and the government over the years, particularly in the agreement known as the Compact of 1965.</para><para>The ability of the High Court to declare completely void any bill which violated the constitutional restriction would provide an effective sanction against a government attempting to bypass the Senate by including other matters in the annual appropriation bills.</para><para>The proposals contained in this bill were also in a bill first introduced by Senator Macklin (Queensland, Australian Democrats) in 1987.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Calvert</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25090</page.no><id.no>R1294</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title><page.no>25090</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>25090</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of Senator Crane, I present additional information received by the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee relating to the committee's inquiry into the provisions of the Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>25090</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Works Committee</title><page.no>25090</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>25090</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>25090</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present report No. 7 of 2001 entitled <inline font-style="italic">Fit-out of new central office building for the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs at Belconnen, ACT</inline>.

In February 2000 the Commonwealth sold the Benjamin Offices to Benjamin Nominees Pty Ltd, which proposes to redevelop the complex.  It is this redevelopment which gives rise to the fit-out proposal.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The need</inline></para><para>At the time of sale the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs held two separate leases in the Benjamin Office complex.  Benjamin Nominees Pty Ltd advised the Department it would prefer the southern section of the complex be vacated when the lease expired in February 2002.  If the Department wished to remain in the complex the rent would be increased to $235 per square metre per annum.</para><para>The Department considered this option to be unsatisfactory in view of the building's age-related problems, energy and space utilisation inefficiencies, and high running costs.</para><para>As an alternative, Benjamin Nominees Pty Ltd offered the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs the option of moving into a new purpose-built complex on the Benjamin Offices site.  Building construction would commence in mid-2001 and be completed in mid-2004.  The Department would fund and own the fit-out.</para><para>The attractiveness of this option was enhanced considerably by Benjamin Nominees' offer of a $7.75 million cash incentive towards the cost of the fit-out.</para><para>Adding to the attractiveness of this option was a rental of less than $280 per square metre per annum.  This rental compares favourably with the rates achieved by other government agencies for A-Grade premises in Canberra.  A recent comparison indicated a range of between $305-405 per square metre per annum.</para><para>A third option considered by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs was to move to accommodation away from the Benjamin Offices site.  This option proved unsatisfactory due to the lack of available properties meeting the Department's needs with regard to timing and space requirements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Project cost</inline></para><para>Madam President I would like to make a few comments about the cost of the project.</para><para>The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has negotiated a Guaranteed Maximum Price for trade works with the project builder for the integrated fit-out of a new commercial building to be constructed on the Benjamin North site.</para><para>Any savings realised against the Guaranteed Maximum Price will be shared on a 50:50 basis between the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the builder.</para><para>The total project cost for the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs fit-out works is $23.97 million.  When the fit-out incentive of $7.75 million is brought to account, the net fit-out cost is $16.22 million.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Advantages of New Building Option</inline></para><para>The new building option offers a number of advantages in addition to those already mentioned.</para><para>A cost benefit analysis prepared by an independent quantity surveyor established that over 13 years, the new building proposal was cost neutral.  The additional rental costs of the new building would be offset by ongoing savings for fit-out and maintenance work for the older buildings.</para><para>The new building proposal also avoids costs payable if the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs were to take up either of the other two options, for example, the payment of approximately $2 million in âmake goodâ costs when the Department vacates the building.</para><para>The new building option also avoids the âdead rentâ payable if the Department were to terminate its second lease early, in order to move its Central Office operations to a new site.  Knight Frank Price Waterhouse estimated this âdead rentâ to be up to $10.7 million.</para><para>In addition, the new building development will provide further regeneration of the Belconnen Town Centre, creating short-term employment opportunities as well as boosting economic activity into the future.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Development approval</inline></para><para>During the Inquiry the Committee became aware it was examining a proposal to fit-out a building that was yet to receive development approval.</para><para>The Committee considers this situation to be less than satisfactory and has therefore recommended that in future, the referring agency obtain all necessary development approvals before referral to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Disabled access</inline></para><para>The Committee considers that every effort must be made to ensure suitable access for disabled staff and visitors to public buildings.  The Committee therefore sought advice from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs regarding the provisions being made for disabled persons in the proposed fit-out.</para><para>The Department advised that its builder, through its architect, would provide expert advice on disabled access issues.  In addition, an independent quantity surveyor would audit all development design solutions through the construction period against legislative requirements and standards.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Support for the proposed work</inline></para><para>The cost and conditions proposed for the new building option make it a highly competitive commercial offer.</para><para>The new building will meet the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs' long term accommodation goals.

Once again, all members of the delegation played an active role throughout the entire conference, participating in all facets of the conference agenda.</para><para>I take the opportunity now on behalf of the delegation to recognise the work of the adviser to the delegation, Mr Phillip Allars from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who ensured that the delegation members were thoroughly briefed on all matters that were being debated before the conference. As the delegation leader, Mr Somlyay, said yesterday in the other place, it is often said that Australia fights above its weight at these conferences. In Havana we fought in all divisions and literally were the only ones left standing at 4.30 p.m. on the eighth and final day of the conference.</para><para>The leader, Mr Somlyay, chaired the drafting committee that debated the motion on terrorism. The member for Pearce, Mrs Moylan, chaired the drafting committee of the education and culture motion. The member for Prospect, Mrs Crosio, continued to play a very active role on the executive of the women's committee. I, for my sins, was appointed rapporteur for the item on international law, and you will be pleased to know that I used my broadest Australian accent in presenting the report of the committee. I also had some work to do on the drafting of two publications for the IPU. They are a handbook for members of parliament on refugee law matters and a handbook for MPs on the worst forms of child labour. I got that additional task because of my role as senior vice-president of the second committee.</para><para>As Madam President and Mr Speaker would be aware, there are a number of concerns about how the IPU is operating. Those concerns were discussed at a special meeting of the Australian IPU group held in this house last week. Scrutiny, transparency and accountability are essential components of our Australian parliamentary system. Sadly, we are not seeing similar reflections from the IPU. It appears that many of the key decisions being adopted by the IPU are as a result of very limited consultation and debate. Equally disturbing is the realisation that many of the decisions are taken in apparent isolation from other decisions. There appears to be no overriding strategy; on the contrary, there appears to be a blind faith that, no matter what is decided, the IPU will have the resources to achieve these objectives.</para><para>I am sounding negative, and I do not necessarily want to sound negative, but the matters that are occurring within the IPU are of grave concern for this parliament and for many other democratic parliaments throughout the world. Not the least of what has happened has been the withdrawal from the IPU of the United States of America. Their contributions to the IPU represented some 15 per cent of the IPU budget. They have been gone from the IPU now for over three years. The IPU, within that period of time, have continued to spend as if the United States of America, with their 15 per cent of contributions, were still paying. Reserve funds have been depleted. There are proposals on the agenda within the IPU to move to new premises in Geneva. The budget for the new headquarters is of course blowing out and yet, when questions are asked within the council of the IPU, the answers that come back are certainly not satisfactory to the Australian delegation or to other delegations.</para><para>Compounding what is happening with the headquarters and with the expenditure of the reserves of the IPU is a proposal for even greater cooperation with the United Nations' system. That sounds good in theory, but as we state in the report at 3.19 on page 17:</para><quote><para>While most delegations see merit in developing a closer link with the UN, the actual procedures and authority for that closer link have not yet been fully costed, debated or approved. In particular, one of the concerns expressed by a number of delegations is the extent to which the IPU representative in New York can represent the views of member parliaments as opposed to the resolutions adopted by representatives from the respective parliaments. The other concern is the cost involved in order to achieve this closer relationship.</para></quote><para>Our concerns were raised, as I said earlier, at a meeting of the Australian IPU group here last week, which was attended by both the President and the Speaker. We have decided to put to the IPU that the matters of the reform of the IPU be addressed at the 107th conference of the IPU in Marrakesh. These matters, whether they become an agenda item for Marrakesh or not, will be determined at the forthcoming conference in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in September this year. I trust and hope that the matters will be resolved. I do believe that the IPU has an important role to play in the international world of parliaments, but the way it is going, unfortunately, it could come a major cropper on that.</para><para>I now turn to the bilateral visit to Mexico and I want to make a few very brief comments. The official program included meetings with the presiding officers, the Minister for the Economy, the Deputy Foreign Minister, representatives from the Australia-Mexico business group and parliamentarians from all major political parties. These meetings engaged the delegation to discuss a range of subjects, including the strength of the ever growing and ever increasing bilateral relationship between Australia and Mexico and the progress of economic reforms in Mexicoâparticularly tax reform, privatisation and indigenous issues. All of these caused some little consternation within the delegation, but of course we were there representing the parliament. This shows where the sensitivities of those earlier matters that I have referred to in regard to the IPU can come out. There was no fudging on the issues as to where the representatives of the different political parties stood when we were responding to questions from representatives of different political parties in Mexico.</para><para>Other issues discussed were: the opening up of the economy and foreign investment, in particular the relationship between Mexico and the United States; the migratory pressures brought about by rural poverty; the political tensions in the south-east involving the Zapatistas, who are seeking some greater power for their individual peoples; the evolving relationship between the Congress and the President; and the hosting of the APEC conference in 2002.</para><para>The discussions were both frank and informative and left the delegation with a very clear impression that Mexico was making steady progress and is prepared to undertake the necessary reforms to address many of its key concerns. The delegation concluded its visit in the historic city of Oaxaca, which was made all the more memorable as it coincided with Easter. All up, it was a very informative and rewarding visit. On behalf of the delegation, I acknowledge the dedication and professionalism of the delegation secretary, Mr Peter Keele, who accompanied us throughout the delegation's visit. I commend the report to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CAPITAL ALLOWANCES) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25093</page.no><id.no>R1278</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CAPITAL ALLOWANCESâTRANSITIONAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1275</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED TAX SYSTEM) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1205</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>25093</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Macdonald</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bills read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>25093</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>25093</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table revised explanatory memoranda relating to the bills and move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speeches read as follows</inline>â</para><para>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CAPITAL ALLOWANCES) BILL 2001</para><para>I move that this bill be moved a second time.  This bill, to take effect from 1 July 2001, further implements the Government's wide-ranging reforms that give Australia a New Business Tax System by providing a Uniform Capital Allowance System (UCA).  The bill delivers on the Government's promise to provide value and efficiency for Australian business in taxation.  It reflects the Government's commitment to simplifying the tax law and streamline the tax treatment of depreciating assets.  The bill contains simplification benefits and improves neutrality.</para><para>The UCA applies to all taxpayers, except eligible small businesses that choose to participate in the Simplified Tax System.  It is a set of common principles that consolidates and replaces at least 27 separate capital allowance regimes in the existing tax law.  These principles allow taxpayers to calculate deductions for the decline in value of most depreciating assets they hold.  The common principles provide standardised rules for many disparate capital allowances.  In addition, specific provisions maintain current rules for primary producers and for mining and quarrying exploration. </para><para>The UCA will continue to allow taxpayers to use either the Commissioner of Taxation's effective life schedule or to self-assess the effective life of their assets.  The legislation provides greater certainty for taxpayers relying on the effective lives of assets as determined by the Commissioner of Taxation. </para><para>From 1 July 2001 taxpayers can choose to allocate to a low-value pool all assets costing less than $1,000, as well as assets that have declined in value to less than $1,000 under the diminishing value method.  These rules do not apply to small business taxpayers who use the Simplified Tax System (STS). Where STS taxpayers are excluded from claiming capital allowances under the STS provisions for certain assets, these may then be allocated to the low-value pool. They can immediately deduct any asset costing less than $1,000, and have their own pooling for other assets.</para><para>In addition to low-value pools, a special pooling arrangement is available to taxpayers who incur expenditure for software development.  Software development pools may be beneficial to those taxpayers who have many software development projects in train at any one time or whose software development has a risk of failure.  In such situations, taxpayers can benefit by pooling the expenditure on these projects and writing off the pool, rather than dealing separately with pieces of software.</para><para>The UCA will allow certain capital expenditures not currently deductible to be written off over the life of the project to which the expenditure relates.  These include feasibility study costs, site preparation costs and environmental assessment costs.  The UCA also provides write off for a number of specific types of capital expenditure, such as the costs of raising equity, establishing or converting a business structure and defending against takeovers, which have not received relief in the tax system before.</para><para>There is also an immediate write off for depreciating assets costing no more than $300 used by taxpayers predominantly in deriving non-business income.  This deduction will be made retrospective, with effect as from 1 July 2000.  This will benefit many taxpayers as currently there is no immediate deduction for plant (except for STS taxpayers).</para><para>Specific provisions maintain current rules for deductions for the decline in value of capital expenditure on primary production depreciating assets that are water facilities, horticultural plants and grapevines.  Furthermore the current write-off for primary production capital expenditure incurred on landcare operations, electricity connections or telephone lines is maintained.</para><para>Under the UCA legislation, the existing immediate deduction for capital expenditure on exploration and prospecting, mining site rehabilitation, petroleum rent resource tax and environmental protection is retained.</para><para>Further details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.  </para><para>I commend the bill.</para><para>âââââ</para><para>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CAPITAL ALLOWANCESâTRANSITIONAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) BILL 2001</para><para>This bill accompanies a New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Bill 2001, which simplifies the tax law and streamlines the tax treatment of depreciating assets.  This is achieved by providing a set of common principles that consolidates and replaces at least 27 separate capital allowance regimes in the existing tax law.   </para><para>This bill will ensure that assets and expenditures subject to the current law moves into the general capital allowance regime smoothly. This is required as existing regimes may be use differing terms and concepts. Further, various provisions of the income tax law as well as other Commonwealth legislation required amending so as to align the terminology used in the generalised regime with that used in these Acts.</para><para>Industry consultations refined the transitional rules for existing mining, quarrying and prospecting rights and information as future rights and information will be depreciating assets. The bill ensures that mining, quarrying and prospecting rights that a taxpayer held before 1 July 2001 will remain subject to the capital gains tax provisions instead of the uniform capital allowance system. The transitional rules will also allow for the costs associated with transitional mining, quarrying and prospecting information that were previously non-deductible to reduce amounts included on realisation of that information in the assessable income of the taxpayer.</para><para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the already presented explanatory memorandum.</para><para>I commend the bill.</para><para>âââââ</para><para>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED TAX SYSTEM) BILL 2000</para><para>This bill inserts a new Division in the <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax Assessment Act 1997</inline> to introduce the Simplified Tax System (STS).</para><para>The STS is an optional package for small businesses.  It will deliver a number of benefits, reducing the time and money that participating small businesses need to spend on bookkeeping and income tax compliance, as well as retaining their access to generous rates of depreciation.</para><para>The STS is based on the recommendations of the Review of Business Taxation.  Consistent with those recommendations, most businesses with an average annual turnover of less than $1 million will be eligible to join.  </para><para>The STS has three key elements.</para><para>The first element is cash accounting.  Under this method of calculating taxable income businesses will, in general, recognise income when it is received and deductions when expenses are paid.</para><para>The second element is simplified depreciation.  Assets costing less than $1,000 are immediately deductible.  Assets costing $1,000 or more and with effective lives of less than 25 years are pooled and written off at 30 per cent per year.  Assets costing $1,000 or more and with effective lives of 25 years or more are pooled and written off at 5 per cent per year. The use of pools removes the need to keep detailed asset schedules.</para><para>The third element is simplified trading stock.  Under the trading stock provisions STS taxpayers will no longer have to account for changes in trading stock of less than $5,000.</para><para>The bill also incorporates a new 12-month rule for determining deductions in respect of prepaid expenditure for STS taxpayers and individual taxpayers incurring deductible non-business expenditure. </para><para>Small business taxpayers who do not enter the STS and non-individuals who incur deductible non-business expenditure will apportion their prepayment deductions over the eligible service period.  These taxpayers will have access to transitional provisions to phase in this apportionment of deductions over the period to 2002-03.</para><para>The STS and prepayments measures included in this bill will apply to assessments for income years commencing on or after 1 July 2001.</para><para>The Government has been consulting with small business representatives since its announcement of the STS on 21 September 1999.  The Government released the Exposure Draft legislation for the STS in October this year for public comment.</para><para>As a result of further consultation and submissions received in response to the Exposure Draft legislation for the STS, the Government has decided to improve certain provisions of the STS Bill including:</para><para>Â·	increasing the depreciating assets threshold for eligible businesses from $2 million to $3 million;</para><para>Â·	removing the requirement to account for the change in value of trading stock on a cash basis; and</para><para>Â·	relaxing the control tests to avoid inadvertent grouping.</para><para>The Government considers that the consultations with small business representatives have been a very positive and important part of the development of the STS.  I would like to thank those involved in that process for their efforts.</para><para>The Government will soon be releasing for public comment the Exposure Draft legislation for the Uniform Capital Allowances system, which also starts from 1 July 2001.

The present arrangements for the licensing of collection centres exclude the public sector, do not place sufficient emphasis on the quality of service and facilities at the centre and are generally unnecessarily cumbersome in operation. The proposed amendments address these issues to permit the introduction of a national approval system for specimen collection centres that is fair and open and emphasises quality. In addition, it uses the level of Medicare pathology activity of an approved pathology authority as the normal basis for determining the number of collection centres that can be operated in each year.</para><para>The bill introduces a simplified procedure whereby approved pathology authorities apply for approvals for specimen collection centres. This replaces the existing system involving the granting of units of entitlement. Approvals will be granted in respect of a financial year and the processes will be subject to approval principles determined as a disallowable instrument under the act. The approval principles will be able to deal with matters such as the method for determining the maximum number of approvals that can be granted to an approved pathology authority in respect of a financial year, compliance with quality guidelines, the duration of approvals and the review of decisions.</para><para>It is intended that the approval principles will prescribe a general method for the determination of maximum approvals in a financial year. This will be based on the experience of laboratories operated by an approved pathology authority over a specified 12-month period as reflected in Health Insurance Commission data. This is in contrast to the previous system of allocating units of entitlement by reference to a fixed pool.</para><para>A four-year phase-in period is proposed to allow the industry time to adjust to a less regulated environment. The present policy of allowing additional approvals where collection centres are located in designated rural and remote areas will be continued. </para><para>The amendments will apply to both the public and the private sectors from a date to be fixed by proclamation. An approved collection centre will be required to comply with the collection centre guidelines published by the National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council and developed by the council and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. With the inclusion of the public sector in the new arrangements, the amendments require the same level of quality for all pathology specimen collection centres at which collections are made for Medicare eligible services.</para><para>The design of the new arrangements, which will be administered by the Health Insurance Commission, has been jointly agreed with the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and the Australian Association of Pathology Practices and is based on the framework contained in the 1999 Pathology Quality and Outlays Agreement.</para><para>The bill also simplifies and clarifies the rules relating to temporary resident doctors and overseas trained doctors and the circumstances in which they can access Medicare. At present, temporary resident doctors are not medical practitioners for the purposes of the act and are therefore not entitled to provide services which attract Medicare unless they obtain an exemption. Overseas trained doctors with Australian citizenship or permanent residence are subject to a 10-year moratorium which restricts their access to Medicare benefits unless they are granted an exemption. However, the new legislation will reduce the inequities between the treatment of permanent and temporary resident doctors and streamlines the procedure to establish eligibility for Medicare benefits. The bill will also reduce complexity of regulation regarding access to Medicare.</para><para>In addition, the bill makes a number of technical amendments. These include amending the definition of `quality assurance activity' to include a reference to the Health Care (Appropriation) Act 1998. The definition of professional services will be amended to clarify that a dental practitioner who is able to render a Medicare payable service in respect of oral and maxillofacial surgery must have been approved for this purpose by the minister in writing. The definition of `relevant offence' will be broadened to include offences under sections 23DR and 23DS of the act, and an obsolete reference to section 21 of the Crimes Act 1914 will be deleted.</para><para>The last part of the bill I would like to discuss is an integral part of the measures that the coalition has put in place since 1996 to encourage more doctors into rural areas. Since its introduction in 1996, section 19AA of the act has required graduating doctors who wish to obtain access to Medicare rebates for work in private practice to meet a qualification requirement. They can do this by simply obtaining a general practice or specialist fellowship, by taking part in a postgraduate training program in order to get a fellowship or, in the short term, by participating in programs such as the Rural Locum Relief Program, which is confined, obviously, to rural areas.</para><para>The so-called provider number legislation was designed to work in conjunction with the other major initiatives to address areas of doctor shortage and oversupply and to improve the training of doctors, thereby enhancing the quality of health care service delivery in Australia. Indeed, this provision is largely responsible for the 14 per cent increase in doctors in rural Australia that has occurred between 1995 and 2001. The sunset clause was originally inserted in the legislation to give us an opportunity to consider whether section 19AA was disadvantaging junior doctors. When the legislation was introduced, there were concerns that there would not be enough training places for doctors and that doctors would not be able to find work. Indeed, at the time, the Australian Medical Association was saying that 400 doctors a year would be unemployed. According to those figures, by now we should have 1,600 doctors out of work because of the operation of this legislation. </para><para>When this part of the act was reviewed by former New South Wales health minister Ron Phillips, he worked hard and could not find a single doctor anywhere in Australia out of work, the AMA's claims of four years ago being merely scaremongering. We have worked hard to ensure there are plenty of opportunities for junior doctors, and I am pleased to be able to say that, after the independent review and success of annual reports on training, there are substantially more training positions each year than there are doctors graduating. So we now have a surplus of training positions, a growing number of well-trained doctors in general practice and in specialties, a high demand for Australian medical graduates to fill vacancies in public hospital systems and an emphasis on rural training and local experience. It would be a disaster if this sunset clause was not removed. It would be particularly hard on rural communities and the Rural Locum Relief Scheme would come to an end. Given these positive results, it is important that the sunset clause be removed as soon as possible.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Denman</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ASSENT TO LAWS</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25098</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>A message from His Excellency the Governor-General was reported informing the Senate that he had assented to the following laws:</para><quote><para><inline ref="S299">Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill 2001</inline></para><para><inline ref="S297">Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001</inline></para></quote></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25098</page.no><id.no>R1294</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>25098</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 25 June.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sue (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Knowles)</inline>âThe committee is considering the <inline ref="R1294">Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001</inline> and requests (6) to (9) on sheet 2244, moved by Senator Woodley.

Is this a decision that is made by the department when appropriating the deregulation payments?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>25099</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very happy to answer questions as best I am able in this committee stage of the debate on the <inline ref="R1294">Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001</inline>. I do, however, indicate that we are in the last week of the sittings before we rise for the winter recess and there are a number of very important pieces of legislation that we have to try to deal with, including this one. So, without wanting to curtail the debate, I would urge all senators to be frugal with their contributions because there is a lot of work yet to be done.</para></talk.start><para>Having said that, I am very happy to try to answer your questions although, in relation to specific elements of an individual's personal situation, it does get a little difficult for me to answer and it is always inappropriate to try to give advice without knowing all of the circumstances. You have mentioned some paragraphs from a letter, but I would imagine that a proper assessment of this particular issue would require intimate knowledge of the arrangements, such as the terms of the lease and other financial arrangements between the lessor and the lessee. It is probably appropriate to say that, if any farmer or anyone in the industry feels aggrieved by some of the decisions that have been made under what I might call the original dairy readjustment package, there is an appeal mechanism that I would urge those people to pursue. The appeal is made in the first instance to the Dairy Adjustment Authority and in certain circumstances perhaps there may even be grounds for an appeal to the AAT, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. So your constituents, your correspondents, should access those appeal avenues if they feel aggrieved by the way they have been treated. I will hope you will understand, Senator, that it is dangerous for me to try to give an opinion on the run when we are not aware of the full facts.</para><para>I might just reiterate for the benefit of those who might be listening to the debate for the first time that I indicated yesterday that this new bill we are dealing with today, which provides an additional $140 million of money to the scheme, has been proposed by the Commonwealth government because the states, particularly the quota states, have not really taken up their obligation, their duty, to compensate those who have suffered loss as a result of the deregulation by the states of the dairy industry. Because the states have failed to do that, the Commonwealth has proposed this new $140 million package to help look after those who, as has been shown in the fullness of time, were not properly compensated because the states have refused to contribute.</para><para>In relation to lessors, which you mentioned yesterday and which you are averting to again today, I mentioned yesterday that there are two groups of lessors that will be eligible. The first group is those lessors who can demonstrate that they suffered a significant event or crisis such as ill health or personal tragedy, which resulted in their temporary or unforeseen change in status from producer to lessor. If eligible, it is proposed that these individuals will be reassessed as owners/operators under the eligibility criteria of the dairy support adjustment package and will receive an equivalent entitlement. The second group is those lessors or owners of the land who have derived 50 per cent of more of their total income from the dairy enterprise lease and who can demonstrateâwe think it is fair that they should be called upon to demonstrateâthat their lease income has fallen by at least 20 per cent as a result of the state's deregulation of the industry.

I raised that agreement to highlight the fact that not all cases where a person leases their building and farm to a lessee for a fee are open and shut cases. Some cases are quite complex and we must try to establish a better understanding for the people who will administer the fund and for the dairy industry.</para></talk.start><para>In his answer, Senator Macdonald mentioned that two types of lessor will be eligible for these additional funds; namely, lessors who have had to lease their properties because of illness, and lessors who can prove, under the hardship clause, that they have suffered a reduction in their income as a result of deregulation. I believe the bill is still flawed because it does not require a dairy owner with a sharefarm agreement to prove hardship. With regards to eligibility, why are we asking one group to prove hardship, because of a definition of the type of legal agreement they have, when the other group comprising the sharefarmer arrangement is not required to do that? I would appreciate clarification on that point from Senator Macdonald.</para><para>I would also like clarification on a point I put to Senator Macdonald yesterday. What is the possible legal situation that the Commonwealth will encounter if it continues to pay a benefit to a lessee who has defaulted on a lease agreement? I understand the necessity for a legal agreement so the government can appropriate a benefit. That is correct. However, I find it difficult to comprehend the Commonwealth's position if payments are continued to be made based on a legally binding agreement in respect of which one party has defaulted. To simplify it, if they require a legal agreement to receive payment and if that legal agreement is voided and no longer has standing at law, they should not receive the benefits of having had that legal agreement. I would appreciate a response from Senator Macdonald on these two questions: first, why is there a difference between the hardship requirements for lessors and sharefarmers? Secondly, what is the Commonwealth's position if payments are continued to be made to a lessee who is in default?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>25100</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe went through these points yesterday, Senator Harris, and I thought I had explained them. However, very briefly, there seems to be some confusion about the standing of the lease agreement between the parties. The Commonwealth is not party to the lease agreement. The lessor has a contractual right to sue the lessee and to recover his rent. As I indicated yesterday, my advice is that most of the lessor-lessee arrangements are in Victoria where the industry is still quite buoyant and is proceeding well. The fact that a lessee might get some money from the Commonwealth and then breach his agreement with the lessor is not an issue for the Commonwealth; it is an issue for the lessor to take his legal rights to sue and recover from the lessee. In our system of society, laws and justice, it is not for the government to enforce private contracts between one party and another; it is for the parties themselves using the courts.

I urge Mr Beattie and his colleagues in this house not to pursue that path in the interests of democracy in Australia. But you divert me, and we should not be divertedâwe have a lot of work to do.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is up to the parties themselves to enforce their legal agreements through the courts of the land and through our justice system, which is fair and equitable, beyond reproach and the envy of the world. They can do that. The government deals with the parties. The fact that they might have breached a private contractual agreement between themselves is not a matter for the government, and it should not be.</para><para>In relation to the other matter, the difference between sharefarmers and the lessee-lessor relationship, as I indicated again yesterday, the reason why we include sharefarmers is that, generally speaking, in most sharefarming agreements the two parties share the proceeds. I gave the example that, if the proceeds are very lowâsay, $10,000 net profitâafter all expenses and they are sharing them fifty-fifty, each gets $5,000, and each will be in a situation where they deserve support from this scheme. If the profit is $100,000 and they are sharing fifty-fifty, they both get $50,000, and perhaps under the scheme they will not be entitled to quite as much.</para><para>With the lessor-lessee situation, I am told that most leases are for a fixed sum. It does not matter whether the dairy producer is earning $10,000 or $100,000, he still pays the lease payment. I picked as an example $30,000 a year. He pays the $30,000 whether his profit is $100,000 or $10,000. The lessor gets a fixed return, which he is entitled to. We do not think that he is in a hardship situation. I mentioned yesterday that my advice is that the government is unaware of any substantial examples of where lessors have missed out. The government knows of a couple of examples where a lease was broken, but the lessor immediately leased the property to another lessee and did not lose any money. That is the rationale behind it.</para><para>There could be variations. Again, it depends how the lease is drawn, it depends how the sharefarming agreement is drawn, and each one is individual. But my advice is that that is how they operate. If a lease agreement has a percentage rental or a share of the profits as rental, my advice is that that might be classed as a sharefarming agreement, notwithstanding that the parties call it a lease. It would depend on the circumstances. Similarly, people might call it a sharefarming agreement, but if it is written in such a way that it really is not a sharefarming agreement but is in fact a lease payment, just because the parties call it sharefarming does not mean that it is. Those things would be looked at by the authority.</para><para>Senator, again, to come back to the basis of what this is all about, it is targeted assistance to those who are really in need as a result of the deregulation of the industry by the states. We do not want to help those who are well off; we do not want to give this money to those who are doing quite nicely and who have not suffered. We want to target itâand it is a limited amount of money; it is a finite sumâand we want to make sure that it goes to those who are struggling and who desperately need the assistance. We do not want to look after those who are doing quite nicely anyhow. Amongst those two extremes there are variations, but there are in place appeal mechanisms to try and catch those who fall between the cracks. The legislation we are dealing with today does provide for those discretionary payment rights, which, hopefully, will pick up all those who are in trouble as a result of the states' deregulation and who are having difficulties. They are the ones we want to help. The discretionary payments rights and other parts of the legislation are intended to pick up those people so that they do not suffer unduly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>25101</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âHopefully, this will be my last contribution in terms of these requestsâthat is, requests (6) to (9)âthat I have moved. I want to quote from the Labor Party's supplementary comment in the Senate committee report on this legislation. I also want to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that, in answering my question last night, the minister indicated that between 300 and 400 dairy farmers will possibly be recipients of the discretionary payments. Under the DSAPâthat is, under the original legislationâthere were 729 applications for determination, because those people were unable to access the full payment under the original scheme, but only 107 of them were granted. Under the anomalous circumstances provisions, there were 402 appeals, and of those only 36 were granted. Out of 1,131 applications and appeals, 143 were upheldâonly 10 per cent of the original appeals. If the same number of people appeal againâobviously, the majority of them are still concerned about this issueâwe will have almost 1,000 farmers who were not helped under the DSAP and who had to appeal the decisions that were given. If the government estimates that 300 or 400 people will be helped by the new legislation, we will still help fewer than half of those who had a complaint last time. That means that we have a problem.</para></talk.start><para>I would point out also that in the committee's report to the Senate this comment about appeal rights was made:</para><quote><para>The Committee remains concerned at the nature and extent of current appeal rights. While there exists a right of appeal under the current Scheme and that such a right of appeal will also be available under the additional scheme, it appears difficult to establish a ground of appealâin practical terms an appeal right may be limited.</para></quote><para>I would go further and say it is severely limited, given the numbers which the government, in answer to my question last night, gave this committee. It is quite clear that the appeal rights are still going to be a problemâif fewer than half of those who appealed last time are going to be covered under this new legislation. We are looking at a very big problem. For that reason I am urging both the government and the Labor Party to accept either these amendments which I am moving or, if they fail to pass, some other amendments on the lessor/lessee issue so that we can make sure that the government's rhetoric about the right of appeal and the provision of appeal processes will in fact be fulfilled.</para><para>The problem is that, because of the very limited and restricted guidelines which last time governed the Dairy Adjustment Authority in terms of its ability to hear and grant appeals, most of the appeals were dismissed. The minister may say, `Well, there is a process in place.' That is true, but if there are no grounds on which those appeals can proceed then we have a problem. It is not much use having a process if the process itself is based on very limited grounds. It means that, as before, a person can go to the Dairy Adjustment Authority, be knocked back, and ask for a review by the Dairy Adjustment Authority. When that review is dismissed they can then go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, but I point out that it will cost them $500 just to get into the tribunal, with no hope of their appeal being upheld by that body either, because the same guidelines will apply. Despite having paid $500, it is virtually wasted because there are no grounds to proceed to an appeal because of the very limited and restricted basis on which the appeal can be granted.</para><para>The other issue is the issue of lessors taking lessees to court. Because the minister has been a solicitor I am sure he knows just how difficult it is for a landlord or anyone to whom rent is owed to actually recover it. I have had personal experience of going through a small claims court trying to collect rent, and it really is a futile exercise.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>âCollect it or pay it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>âI paid as much money as I was owed and still got no result at the end.

And why would we want to put people through that kind of process when the government says it wants to help? It needs to simplify the process. It needs to make the guidelines very flexible. I am not sure that we actually have the guidelines yet, or the scheme that will apply. We have seen some draft guidelines. I am not sure that they are finalised. So in a sense we are working in the dark.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In concluding my remarksâand, hopefully, this will conclude what I want to say on these amendmentsâI think the Labor Party got it right in their supplementary comment on this legislation.

They simply change the eligibility criteria for the lessors to receive the additional payment. The problem is that the government has put in place fairly restrictive thresholds for lessors to receive additional payments.

The second threshold is that they have to have suffered a loss of 20 per cent in their income.</para><para>There needs to be a threshold; it is just that I believe those thresholds are too restrictive.

But what you are saying is that, if they derive 50 per cent of their total income from a dairy enterprise but they have suffered no loss at all, they are still entitled to this. If either of them are the trigger for qualifications, as long as he derives more than 50 per cent, even though his income has not fallen at all, you are still saying that he is eligible for assistance under this grant. That seems silly. Looking at it the other way, you are saying that if he can show that his income has fallen by 20 per cent but he only derives 10 per cent of his total income from the dairy enterpriseâif he is a Collins Street farmer who gets 90 per cent of his income from share investments or something but has 10 per cent of income from the dairy enterprise which he can show has fallen by at least 20 per cent, which, as I was saying, means it falls from 10 per cent to eight per cent, which is one-fifthâthen he is eligible for entitlements.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If I am not maligning your interpretation and if that is what you are saying, those two, I concede, somewhat extreme examples do show why from the government's point of view it has to be bothâthat is, the lessor has to show that he is substantially dependent upon his income from the dairy enterprise and that as a result of the state's deregulation his income has fallen by at least 20 per cent, thus disadvantaging him, and, because he is then disadvantaged the same as others, he becomes eligible provided other criteria are appropriate. Certainly, the government will not be accepting an either/or. We think both of those are quite fair. I repeat that we are in this legislation not to target those who are not disadvantaged; we really want to focus our rescue package, our support package, on those who are severely disadvantaged by this legislation.

All other applicants simply had to prove that they were engaged in the dairy industry and they had a certain production figure. That is why I am saying that to require these particular applicants to prove a number of things is, in fact, out of sync with the intention of the rest of the legislation. My preference was for the original amendments that were defeated, which I think were much clearer in their intent. But, as they were not acceptableâthey were defeatedâI am seeking another way of fulfilling the thrust of the original legislation as to its treatment of people who have been disadvantaged. I would remind you, Minister, that the major disadvantage in Victoria for lessors has been the exit of their lessees. There is documented evidence that over 70 per cent of lessees took the money, the major part of the package, and simply disappeared, which has left those lessors in a very difficult position. So I grant the argument that you are making.

In terms of the dairy farmers in the south-east region of South Australia, I will read into the record this comment by the committee:</para><quote><para>DSAP Scheme payments to South East South Australia dairy farmers have been reduced significantly arising from an anomaly in the definition of market milk for SA Equalisation and the DSAP Scheme. A submission from the SE Dairy Farmers' Action Group argued that South East dairy farmers should be eligible for a discretionary payment right pursuant to the proposed SDA Scheme under the Bill, given that there has been a significant (24% reduction in DSAP Scheme payments) loss as a result of the anomaly.</para></quote><para>It continues:</para><quote><para>The claimed anomaly arises from the claim of exclusion of UHT and flavoured milk from the definition of market milk under the SA Equalisation Scheme. The submission further argues that, because of the difference in the definition of market milk between the SA Equalisation and the DSAP scheme, the SE dairy farmers market milk share will not qualify them for assistance. The net effect appears to be that SE dairy farmers are deemed to have produced less market milk than is actually the case, meaning those farmers received lower DSAP Scheme payments than other dairy farmers in South Australia, possibly by as much as $40,000.</para></quote><para>My appeal is for those dairy farmers who, because of the way in which market milk was defined under the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program, were disadvantaged. This amendment seeks to simply declare that that disadvantage should not be carried on under this legislation but that any regional variations in the definition of market milk should be disregarded for the purposes of the <inline ref="R1294">Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001</inline>. That is the case that I put. It seeks to overcome what I believe to be an artificial application of a definition. Obviously, they cannot access any further money under the DSAP, but I believe that under this new package we should be able to take account of that anomaly, to fix it up, and I believe that this amendment does just that. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>25106</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe dairy support adjustment package entitlements are based on the volumes of market milk on which the domestic market support levy was paid or the domestic market support payments received for manufacturing milk. The additional market milk payment is based on the same principle. This remains the basis for determining the payment entitlements across and within all states, and it does reflect the arrangements producers operated against prior to deregulation. These definitions of market and manufacturing milk had the full support of the industry, which fully appreciated the need for a robust definition of the entitlements in light of the many different regulatory regimes that were in place in the various states.</para></talk.start><para>With regard to Tasmaniaâand I understand that this is the specific point that Senator Woodley is raisingâthe pooling arrangements administered by the Tasmanian Dairy Industry Authority were set up to provide an equitable share to dairy farmers from the market milk trade. Under the pooling arrangements operated by the Tasmanian Dairy Industry Authority, all Tasmanian dairy farmers had the same percentage of their production classed as market milk. Payments under the supplementary measures are targeted. Any change to this approach would be inconsistent with the basic rationale underlying both the existing package and the new scheme, which is to provide higher payments to producers of market milk who face by far the greater adjustment pressure from deregulation. On that basis, we would not be supporting the amendment. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>25106</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âVery briefly, no, it is not the Tasmanian situation that I am concerned about; it is the situation of the Capel Dairy milk suppliers in Western Australia and those suppliers in the south-east region of South Australia.

The problem wasâand I am not sure whether the minister and his advisers are actually hearing meâthat the definition of market milk was based on a levy; it was a problem for those who paid the levy under the domestic market support scheme. The definition of market milk was based on that particular levy, not on the actual volume or percentage of market milk which was delivered, particularly by those farmers in the south-east region of South Australia. </para></talk.start><para>I understand the government's difficulty, but I have to say that this is a genuine anomaly and a real problem. I am seeking to make it possible for that anomaly at least to be addressed by the Dairy Adjustment Authority if those farmers can present a case which the authority deems to be valid. It is still up to those farmers to go through that process. But I want to make sure that we do not simply knock them out by what has ended up being an artificial barrier to their ability to access this additional payment. It is an artificial barrier because of the definition which was based on who did or did not pay a levy rather than on the actual percentage of market milk which they delivered.

It addresses all the levels of the anomalies that exist in the way in which market milk is defined. I ask Senator Macdonald to clarify why pasteurised milk that is delivered for domestic consumption has two different definitions. One is the portion of market milk that is turned into flavoured milk, and the other is UHT milk. I believe that is part of the problem that the suppliers in the south-east corner of South Australia are facing. It is not that they did not supply market milk; it is the fact that, under the definition of market milk, UHT volumes and flavoured milk volumes do not become part of their market milk volume. I would like Senator Macdonald to elaborate on why that definition exists and why there is no support for Senator Woodley's amendment. We recognise that some of these are state processes, but I do not believe it is beyond the capacity of the federal legislation to make allowances for that.</para></talk.start><para>I also ask Senator Macdonald whether he would consider the anomaly we raised yesterday with regard to the Tasmanian producers and accept an amendment that would set the production level of the Tasmanian processors who supplied market milk nominally at 25 per cent. That would bring them into the process. The amendment that the Labor Party has moved in the committee stage would get them that minimum payment. I believe that would be one way in which the federal government could actually assist those Tasmanian producers and take into account that anomaly. So there are two issues. The first is the definition of market milk and the reasons why the definition excludes UHT and flavoured milk and why the Commonwealth finds it cannot accept this amendment, which would change that. The other issue is whether Senator Macdonald would accept a nominal rate of 25 per cent of market milk being applied to Tasmanian producers as well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>25107</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOur position is, as I mentioned to Senator Woodley, that the state market milk regulatory arrangements in the south-east of South Australia, in Tasmania and in Capel in Western Australia allowed commercial sales, which I think you have acknowledged, which were not subject to regulated prices. They did not pay the levy, and they were not recognised under the DSAP. The basis of the DSAP entitlement for market milk was the state arrangements and whether they paid or received the domestic market support levy. That is the arrangement we have put in place in consultation with the industry. Some producers in these areas sold under commercial contracts. They received higher prices but they did not pay the levy, so they were not really part of the scheme then. The majority, if not all, did not pay for quotas, and therefore they have less financial exposure after deregulation. For those reasons, we will maintain our position in consultation with the industry, and we will not support this amendment or any other amendment which you may have flagged.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>25108</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will not be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Woodley.</para></talk.start><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>25108</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI amend request (5) on sheet 2262, and move the amended request:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:</para><para>Schedule 1, item 10, page 10 (lines 13 to 31), omit subclause (4), substitute:</para><para>	(4)	For the purposes of this clause, an entity <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">passes the lease income test</inline> if the eligible lease net income derived by the entity in the 2000-2001 financial year is at least 20% less than the average of the eligible lease net income derived by the entity in the 1999-2000, 1998-1999 and 1997-1998 financial years.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Statement pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000</inline></para><para>The amendments increase amounts that are payable under the Supplementary Dairy Assistance (SDA) scheme and lower the eligibility threshold for the scheme.

If their net income is lower than the average over the preceding three financial years then they are eligible for the additional supplementary assistance. Senator Macdonald mentioned earlier that some larger producers would then be eligible for this further assistance. These larger producers are suffering the same costs on all of their production, over and above the volume that the $80,000 cut-off would afford them. If it is the government's intention to exclude those larger producers, they are doing it at the cost of the smaller family dairy entities.

We have looked into this very carefully in the preparation of the government's package.

I repeat: these payments are targeted to those who are disadvantaged by the states' deregulation.

I reiterateâas I said yesterday and on a number of occasions in the committee proceedingsâthat we understand the issues and the problems that have occurred with respect to the lessors. As I have also said, the problem that has arisen with respect to the lessors has not arisen as a result of the substantial fall in milk prices that affected the farmers and producers who were in receipt of the assistance package. The government have brought forward, in acknowledgment of their earlier failure, a package directed at supplementing, through additional payments, the assistance to those producers who were not assisted sufficiently with the initial package because of the greater than expected fall in milk prices. That is the genesis of this package; that is the target group it is designed to assist.</para></talk.start><para>That is why we moved our amendment earlier which has been carried by the Senate.

Whilst we have sympathy with the position of those lessors who were affected because of flow-on or consequential problems that have arisen, they do not relate to the purpose of this legislation. We do not believe that you can address their problemsâand there are a myriad of situations, from those who may have suffered substantially to those who probably have not necessarily suffered at allâby trying to graft amendments to this legislation. While Senator Harris and Senator Woodley have tried to do thatâand I think Senator Woodley said it himself just a moment agoâyou cannot solve the problem completely.

I make one final plea to the minister and to the opposition, and it is this: the purpose of this request is to remove the hardship test that these producers have found themselves under. They are required to comply with a condition that insists on basing the assistance on their gross income. I believe that that is incorrect because of the following reason: a person's ability to continue in the industry is not as a result of their gross income but is in actuality totally reliant on their net income after they pay their costs.</para></talk.start><para>For Senator Macdonald's knowledge, I would like to convey one issue that really highlights the necessity for this testâif it has to be thereâto be based on the net income: there are producers out there who have had to go and earn additional income to be able to pay the members of their own family to stay on the farm to keep the farm going. We are including the money that they have been forced to go out and earn to be able to continue their operation in the test that makes them eligible for this supplementary assistance that is there to actually assist them. Because they have to go out and earn extra money to stay within the industry, we are penalising them by saying they cannot have the supplementary assistance. The supplementary assistance has to be derived on their net income, because that is the only thing that will sustain them in the industry.

That is not to say we do not support a review of the operation of the scheme. I think this scheme has been under constant review since it was introduced. In fact, it was under detailed review even before it was introduced because, as I said yesterday in my speech during the second reading debate, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee had the opportunity to examine the issue of deregulation and the package that was being proposed at the time when it undertook its very extensive public hearings across Australia. It then brought down that extensive report. </para></talk.start><para>Since then, legislation has been introduced. The first legislation was subject to examination and report by the Senate committee. I know that senators in the chamber, including Senator Harris, have had the opportunity at estimates committees and in question time to continue to examine the application of the scheme and the problems that have arisen since the scheme came into operation in July last year. It has been through that process that this legislation has come about. There has been a lot of scrutiny of the scheme. There has been constant interest shown by senators from the committee, by other senators and by members in their electoratesâparticularly if they happen to represent electorates with dairying communities. I believe that interest prompted the government to belatedly acknowledge that it had to increase the payments and the assistance under the package.</para><para>Our view is that you do not really need to establish or lay down in this legislation the necessity for review after 1 January 2003. That is 18 months away. I can assure you that we in the oppositionâand in six months time I envisage we will be in governmentâwill be monitoring and reviewing this scheme on an ongoing basis. We do not intend to just lose interest. We intend to continue to ensure that dairy farmers throughout the country are afforded the opportunities and assistance they are entitled to. </para><para>There is a range of other issues that we have not really had an opportunity to debateâfor instance, the application of the Dairy RAP scheme, some of the changes that have been made and the way in which that scheme has been managed to date.

We have taken them up not just in the rural and regional affairs committee but also in other Senate committees, because that scheme is administered by another department.</para><para>Whilst we understand the proposition you have put, Senator Harris, and do not object to it in principle, we do not really see that it is necessary, for the reasons I have just outlined. I also think there is a danger that, if you lock in a specific review in this legislation in the year 2003 and a problem arises or continues to occur that you want to raise between now and when we get elected, you are going to get this response from this government: `Wait till the review in 2003.' My proposition is simple. Firstly, do not give the government the opportunity to get off the hook. Secondly, wait until we are in governmentâbe patient.

Senator Harris, as Senator Forshaw has well explained, the Dairy Adjustment Authority are already required to have a major review of the levy arrangements undertaken by the end of June 2003. They are also obliged to provide annual reports to parliament. As Senator Forshaw has said, those annual reports are fully reviewable by the estimates committees.

It is a fairly typical clause that is in most legislation these days. It simply amounts to a cost recovery where the authority is put to some cost in order to provide some documents or to do something that would not otherwise be expected. The example that I am able to give is that if someone has lost their documentation but needs to show the bank their documentation, they can go back to the authority and say, `Can we have copies of our application or our documents,' whatever it is. The authority says, `Yes, but we will have to photocopy them. We will have to pull them out of our files. That costs some money; so, yes, we will give them to you but it will cost you $10 for the photocopying charge.' I am told that is a fairly common arrangement in all Commonwealth legislation and section 37S simply applies to that. It is not intended to require fees for any application or anything substantive. You will see that the provision makes it quite clear that it does not amount to a taxation; it is actually a cost recovery fee. I hope that has clarified that.</para><para>In conclusion, I indicate that we are very keen to get this bill into operation before the end of this week, because at the end of this week the parliament rises until mid August, and the government would be very disappointed if the bill is not passed through the parliament by Thursday evening. If the bill is not passed through the parliament, then this $140 million will not be available to the dairy industry and it will not be able to be targeted to those people who history and practice have shown were disadvantaged. Our original legislation did not cover those issues. We have learnt from experience that the prices for market milk have not been as high as anticipated and that there have been people who have been more severely disadvantaged than we anticipated. </para><para>The Bureau of Transport Economics has done a study and has shown that to the government. As a result of that, the government has come back and said, `We acknowledge that more assistance is required.' As I indicated yesterday, the principal reason why more assistance is required is that we originally anticipated that the states, being the cause of the deregulation and being the ones that manipulated and controlled the quota, would have come in with some compensation on their own. They have not; they have completely walked away from this. It has been left to the federal government, in conjunction with the industry, to come in with a package. Our package is there to pick up the shortfall when the states did not enter into the spirit of it. We are desperate to get that out to those people who are desperate and who do need the assistance. We are very keen to do that.</para><para>We have gone through this matter in very close detail; we have looked at all of the submissions that have been made; and, in one way or other, we have considered the various amendments that all of the parties have raised. But after considering all of those very carefully, both before we got here and even since last night, the government feels that it is not in a position to amend the proposal that it has put forward. We would all like to give everybody every bit of money that everybody wants right across the boardâI am not talking to dairy farmers here; I am talking generallyâbut there is a cost to that. </para><para>You have to balance what you can give with where you get the money from to give it. It is always a fine dividing line: perhaps we are a little high in some areas; perhaps we are a little low in others. But the government, with the support of the industry and in conjunction with the industry, has tried to find that dividing line. I accept there will be some people who do not like where we have drawn the dividing line and I can appreciate that. That does not mean to say that they are not genuine people who might believe that they are entitled to something more. But you have to draw a line somewhere. It does not matter where you draw it, you will always find there will be some people outside the line and those people will be disappointed. That is human nature, and I accept that. But governments have to draw a line. We have to balance the needs of targeting those who are really disadvantaged against the cost of the scheme, the cost of the interest on the way throughâand the cost is substantial, the levies that have to be imposed upon the processors and importantly the consumers. </para><para>We think we have the support of the Australian public in putting this package together. But, again, there is a line beyond which you start to lose support. We very carefully looked at the whole proposal and, for all of those reasons, this is the conclusion the government has come to. I know that there is no senator here who would not want some benefit to go through to those who are disadvantaged, and I know all senators will want that to go through at the earliest possible time. That is why it is essential that we try and conclude the bill. Obviously, it has to go back to the House of Representatives. What happens there is a matter for Mr Truss, but I understand that all these issues have been looked at previously and the government has come to a conclusion. I understand that the government will stand by its position so the matter will come back, hopefully before next Thursday night, because we want both houses of parliament to deal with this issue. While in some quarters there are perceived deficiencies, although that is not the government's view, we believe that the government's attempt is a huge step in the right direction to try to help those who are genuinely disadvantaged. I commend the original bill to the Senate. Hopefully, when it comes back to this chamber at a later stage, it can be dealt with expeditiously so that this benefit can get out to those disadvantaged farmers at the earliest possible time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Shayne (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Murphy)</inline>âSenator Woodley, for the purposes of expediting this process a little, do you want to speak to the amendment or do you want to make some general comments?

We warned the government about these issues in our initial report in October 1999. We told you about the likelihood of these problems arising when we debated the first legislation. The government acknowledges that the problems have come about because of falling milk prices. ABARE told the government that that would happen, but the government ignored that advice. The ABARE report on the current situation came out in January this year. The government had ample time, if it wanted to get the legislation through by the end of this week, to make sure that it was on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, before the committee and before parliament much earlier than this week.

And it had to be the second line of your budget speech! You have lost the plot. This government has prided itself on its economic management. This budget demonstrates that this government has no credibility as an economic managerânone whatsoever. The Howard-Costello government has been on a spending spree, but one based on political imperatives rather than economic investments. In 1997-98 an $11 billion surplus was forecast for this year. It has become just $2.3 billion. The $15 billion surplus forecast for next year has become just $1.5 billion. The 2001 budget forecasts surpluses of $1.5 billion, $1.1 billion and $4.1 billion respectively for the next three financial years. In last year's budget, the surpluses projected for those three years were $3.2 billion, $8.8 billion and $14.4 billion respectively. This budget has therefore shaved almost $20 billion off those projected surpluses. Over 90 per cent of that deterioration occurred in the last six months and over 80 per cent of the fiscal deterioration is due to policy decisions, not parameter changes, that is, the deterioration cannot be attributed to the downturn in the economy or the inevitable changes in parameters that that producesâthe increase in welfare payments or the reduction in taxation receipts. The decision to run down the surplus was a deliberate policy decision. For example, we have witnessed the government backflip on petrol excise and its backdown on entity taxation, which will impact significantly on future revenue collections.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This government has also shown an appetite for fiddling the figures, just like last year. And just like last year you have been sprung again. While the Treasurer's budget speech was devoid of policy innovation, his spending spree has unleashed a rash of creative budget accounting. This has not gone unnoticed by market economists, who point out that the 2001 surplus of a meagre $1.5 billion is built on deliberate reshuffling of asset sales and squeezing additional dividends from the Reserve Bank of Australia, a $2.8 billion grab. The dividend payment attributable to the Reserve Bank is from profits made from trading in the Australian dollar. In other words, had it not been for the collapse in the Australian dollar in recent times the budget clearly would have been very substantially in deficit. </para><para>We have also seen the bringing forward and holding back of Defence property sales. Defence property sales worth about $360 million that were due to occur in this financial year have been held back to next financial year and Defence property sales worth about $200 million that were due to occur in the forthcoming financial years beyond 2001-02 have been brought forward. So $560 million worth of Defence property sales that were not scheduled to occur in the forthcoming financial year have been put into that year just to prop up the surplus. The fiddling by the government is confirmed by the ANZ in its <inline font-style="italic">ANZ budget report 2001-01</inline> where it said:</para><quote><para>Moreover, without a marked increase in the RBA dividend next year and substantial non-financial asset sales, the <inline font-weight="bold">2001-02</inline> underlying budget position would be in substantial <inline font-weight="bold">deficit</inline>.</para></quote><para>I repeat: substantial deficit.

The tax tally now, Senator McGauranâjust to save you taking your shoes and socks off to count itâis 114 increases. There has been one tax cut in five years and 114 increases. Like his broken tax promises, the Prime Minister's approach to the budget is deceptive. The Prime Minister would have you believe the tax to GDP figure is actually quite low. What he will not tell you is that he is not counting the $24 billion GST.

Senator McGauran, it is a simple question: if the state government passes a motion in the state parliament to increase the level of GST, is it valid? No, it is not valid.

The Prime Minister promised pensioners and other retirees that they would be better off under the GST. They are not, and they know it. The budget contains a $300 one-off payment to pensioners. Senator Heffernan was just a bit jealous that Peter Costello was getting a bit too much publicity instead of his man. During the election year campaign, the Prime Minister told all Australians over 60 years that they would get a $1,000 payment to compensate for the GSTâno qualifications, everyone would get it. Yet it turns out that 40 per cent of Australians over the age of 60 were paid nothing, and a further 10 per cent were paid less than $50. Now the Prime Minister wants these Australians to believe they should be satisfied when they get $300. This is the extent to which the government thinks it can buy off people by promising them one thing and delivering substantially less or breaking that promise. And then it thinks it can ease the pain again just before an election comes along. The public will not be fooled again.

The Treasurer's promise on budget night that the tax threshold for self-funded retirees would be significantly eased did not include self-funded retirees in the 55- to 65-year-old age group.

This budget has been introduced at a time when business and consumer confidence are at all-time lows. Even Senator Heffernan is not dumb enough to try out the Chris Murphy line. The GST has mugged the economy. Growth in the Australian economy has halved. Three quarters after the GST was introduced, the economy has only grown by 0.9 per cent. Moreover, that growth has been on the back of government spending and household consumption. Government spending is now rising at its fastest quarterly rate under this government. That is an unsustainable position.</para><para>The latest national accounts figures also showed that the rate of household savings has plummeted to a record low. When Labor left office, people were saving $5 in every $100. Today they are saving 70c. Debt levels are also at record highs. The level of household debt has increased at an alarming rate in recent years, and we have a record high household debt ratio and record high credit card debt. Credit card debt in particular has grown rapidly under this government. Australia's total credit card debt stands at $17.8 billion, almost tripling the debt of $6.6 billion the country had in 1996 when Labor was in government. The consumption that this government is relying on to drive growth is driven by debt. People are being forced to borrow more and go further into debt simply to survive under the weight of the GST. Senator McGauran, we can debate it any time on any street corner in Benalla. Growth in the Australian economy is unbalanced and the government is failing in its management of the economy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âCan I bring Sophie along?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âIt would take two of you and it still wouldn't be a contest.

We have seen the surplus blown in an attempt to buy this government's way back into office, but it is absent a commitment to investment and export growth that we need to achieve an economy that is placed to prosper into the future.</para><para>The Labor market is also weak. The budget papers state that unemployment will increase to seven per cent in the coming year. There is already evidence from the ANZ job series of weakness in the labour market. The ANZ job advertisement series reveals that the number of job advertisements in major metropolitan newspapers fell by a seasonally adjusted 3.2 per cent in April to an average of 19,388 per week, the lowest level since March 1997. The decline in April comes on the heels of a 7.9 per cent fall in March and a 10 per cent fall in February. April's level of newspaper job advertising was 36.5 per cent below the most recent peak, in May last year, and 34.3 per cent below the level of April last year. This is the largest year-on-year decline since July 1991.</para><para>Bankruptcies have also risen. Australian foreign debt is also at record levels. Its net foreign debt now stands at a record level of $317 billion, or 48 per cent of GDP. Senator McGauran, the debt truck, the street corner in Benalla: I will see you there; pick the day. It is worth remembering the comment of the Treasurer back in 1996 when he was shadow Treasurer. He stated that a rise in net foreign debt to $180 billion, or 39 per cent of GDP, was the `final indictment of Keating's economic mismanagement'. The exchange rate now is hanging by a thread above 50c. It has not had a `6' in front of it since 30 June last year, the last day before the GST came in.</para><para>What we need now is a plan, a vision to remedy these ills. This year's budget fails miserably.

However, it is clear that the Howard government has been unable to grasp the importance of R&amp;D to the economy. Business investment in research and development has fallen in every year of the Howard government, compared with rises in every one of the 13 years of the last Labor government. The ABS has been measuring private investment in research and development for 20 years, and the last two years are the only ones on record when private R&amp;D in Australia has actually declined. An indication of the poor performance of the Howard government can also be seen from the fact that, since coming to office, this government has cut spending on universities and R&amp;D by $5 billion. In 1995-96 Commonwealth support for science and innovation was 0.75 per cent of GDP; in the coming year it has been estimated to fall to 0.65 per cent of GDP. The R&amp;D tax concession in Labor's last year of office was worth $800 million to industry; next year it will only be $470 million.</para><para>The budget also lacks any plan to develop the Australian economy in the long run. This is a government in policy panic and without vision. Mr Costello's statement offered very few initiatives to increase investment and encourage growth. This is a budget long on politics and short on economics. The measures it does introduce are borrowedârather inexpertlyâfrom Labor. The enrolment benchmark adjustment is Labor's policy. The learning gateway is Labor's policy. Medicare After Hours is Labor's policy. Medicare Online is also Labor's policy. The reduction in petrol excise to account for GST is Labor's policy. The BAS simplification is Labor's policy. The liquid assets test for over-55s that we heard the Treasurer talk about: that was a Labor policy that the government abolished when it first came in. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>25119</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on a number of matters relating to the appropriation bills before the Senate today.

We know that this budget has been used by the government in an attempt to buy the votes of elderly Australians, but we see little or nothing in it to help others climb out of their struggling predicament at the hands of this government's mean and tricky policies and economic mismanagement. There is nothing in this budget for families, there is nothing in this budget for small business and there is nothing in this budget for young peopleâparticularly those who are desperately looking for a job and want real training opportunities. This budget, like the Howard government's vision for Australia, is much ado about nothing.</para><para>The coalition has plundered the surplus. In 1998-99 the Treasurer, Mr Costello, forecast a budget surplus for 2001-02 of $14.56 billion, yet the budget papers note that the 2001-02 budget surplus will fall to just $1.5 billionâa $13 billion turnaround. By anyone's standards, this is a disgraceful example of the Howard government's economic mismanagement and recklessness with Australia's future for its own short-term gain. But, as it tries to buy its way back into office, the government has added insult to injury by wasting hundreds of millions more on political advertising, not to mention the millions that have been spent on consultantsâand all at the taxpayers' expense.</para><para>We in this place all have a rough idea of how much taxpayers' money has been squandered by the coalition government on advertising and consultancies over the past five years, but it might shock or indeed outrage others in the community, particularly those who are struggling to meet the added impost of the GST, just how much money Mr Howard and the coalition have thrown away on political advertising and consultants. It would undoubtedly leave a bitter taste in the mouths of many families in the federal seat of Aston, for example, to learn that the Howard government has spent an all-time record of $1.5 billion dollars on consultants and advertising, much of which could only be regarded as blatant political advertising. This should have been funded by the Liberal and National parties, not the taxpayer, as noted by Mr Mark Ludlow in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> on the weekend:</para><quote><para>The Federal Government has spent a record $1.5 billion on consultants and advertising since Prime Minister John Howard came to power five years ago. </para><para>Almost $1 billion has been paid to consultants and $540 million spent advertising policies such as the unpopular GST.</para></quote><para>That is exactly why this government have spent such an extraordinary sum of taxpayers' money on advertising. Their unpopular policiesâlike the GST, like the complicated BAS, and the list goes onâare not being well received in the Australian community. So what do they do? They spend millions trying to convince us all that they are good policies, that they are not really unpopular. The fact is that the government are policy lazy. Labor have over 70 policies publicly available, and the Australian public know exactly what Kim Beazley's plan for our country is. Yet, in contrast, the wheels of the Howard government are falling off. They offer no direction; they have no plan to lead Australia through the next decade, let alone the next 12 months. All they have to show is a taxâa huge tax that has dogged the economy and placed a heavy burden on families and small businesses. The budget demonstrates this point. To make up for their policy laziness, the coalition are spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars on politically motivated advertising to gloss over what they seriously lack in policy direction, as reported by the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline>: </para><quote><para>Advertising spending will peak this year when $20 million a month is expected to be spent by the Government trying to convince voters to give Mr Howard a third term. </para><para>... Mr Howard's Government spent an average $327 million a year on consultants over the past three financial years and employed 12,454 consultants at a cost of $983 million.</para></quote><para>That is $20 million a month on advertising alone. One can only imagine how many new hospital beds and important medical services could be made available if that money were better spent. Just think how much our children in public schools or the leaders of tomorrow in our universities across this country would benefit if this money were better spentâif it were spent on the things which matter most to Australians such as health, education, and better living standards, and not on glossy television and newspaper advertisements aimed at winning their vote. The fact is that these advertising campaigns are costing up to $500,000 a nightâa frightening figure when you consider how some of our essential services have been neglected and run down by the Howard government. As Labor leader Kim Beazley has stated, it is a `wholesale looting of the public purse'. Labor has already provided fully costed details on how it will cut back on this wasteful advertising and funnel it into the areas which matter most to average Australians.</para><para>In simple terms, the Howard government has little to offer Australia but record taxation and record spending. The government has not been spending on the important areas like health and education, communications or regional services; it has been spending on political advertising and thousands of consultants. But why should we be surprised? `Tax and spend' is, after all, the Howard way. After promising that `no way, never ever' would the coalition implement the GST, we now know that the Liberal-National coalition, with the support of the Democrats here in the Senate, burdened Australia with the GST. The government has since spent hundreds of millions of dollars telling the Australian people how lucky they are to be paying this tax. Tax and spend is the Howard way.</para><para>I made mention of some key areas of concern arising out of these bills and, indeed, the government's budget strategy as a whole. Of particular concern for people from my home state of Queensland, which these bills will do little to address, is education funding. It is evidently clear that the Howard government places a very low priority on education and education funding in this country. You only need to look at the mean and tricky policies that have been directed towards public schools by this government.</para><para>Last year the coalition provided a massive funding increase for wealthy private schools, but there was no corresponding increase for public schools. Under this government's shameful system, schools such as King's Schoolâwith its 15 cricket fields, 50-metre swimming pool and indoor rifle rangeâwould receive an extra $4 million by 2004. Other wealthy category 1 schools like Geelong Grammar will receive an extra $4.3 million. There is an extra $7.8 million for Trinity Grammar, $9.2 million for Caulfield Grammar and $10.4 million for Wesley College.</para><para>In contrast, what do the thousands of kids who attend public schools get? Surely the government would recognise, as we do, that Australian children have the right to, and should be afforded, a high standard of education in public schools around the country. Unfortunately, the answer is no, it does not recognise that. The Prime Minister and his education minister, Dr Kemp, seem to think that a good education is something you can only buy at a priceâand a very high price at that. When you take the fudging and fiddling out of the figures in this budget and account for the abolition of the shonky enrolment benchmark adjustment, the Howard government has provided public schools with a measly $33 million extra over four years. Disgracefully, that works out to be less than $4 per student, when category 1 private schools are receiving over $1,000 extra per student. Even at Dr Kemp's old school, Melbourne's Scotch College, an extra $576 per student has been allocated. Parents who send their kids to public schools must be asking: why is this so, Minister? Why are wealthy southern schools like Dr Kemp's old school almost 150 times more deserving than public schools in Queensland and, indeed, in other states around Australia?</para><para>Unfortunately, this is the reality, but it does not have to stay this way. All Australians have the right to a quality education. As we have stated on many occasions, a Beazley Labor government will reinvest in our public schools by redirecting the money that Mr Howard and the coalition want to give to wealthy private schools. Indeed, Labor have already detailed fully costed proposals on how we will stop these increases and redirect education funding to where it can and will achieve so much more. Labor will provide $100 million in capital improvements for public schools. That means better classrooms, libraries and laboratories for all our children. Labor will also establish 1,000 scholarships each year to attract the best and brightest students into a teaching career, and we will offer 10,000 professional development courses for existing teachers to keep them informed. We will give our kids the best chance yet to succeed, and we will work hard to close the gap between those in wealthy private schools and those in our public schools.</para><para>However, the fight does not stop there. Tertiary students and researchers in our universities have also paid a high price under this government. Since 1996, the Howard government has certainly left its mark on tertiary education in this country. The coalition has reduced government funding to universities by $3 billion, which has had a savage impact on teaching and research. At the same time, the government has tried to introduce voluntary student unionism, VSU, which would have threatened the ongoing provision of essential student services and facilities. This includes services like child care, counselling and health and recreation, to name just a few. Worse still, despite failed attempts, Minister Kemp undoubtedly still wants to introduce $100,000 degrees with full fees and real interest rate loans.</para><para>The Howard government has introduced the GST on students' clothes, food, bills, transport and computer software. It has doubled HECS for most students and forced students to repay HECS faster by slashing the repayment threshold. Of course, the latest HECS fiasco represents only more pain for past and present university students. The one million or so Australians who currently have a HECS debt would have received their HECS information statement last week. Judging by the deluge of calls, emails and letters to my office and to the offices of many of my colleagues, most people have been shocked to find that their HECS debts have been increased by a whopping 5.3 per cent in indexation. The indexation rate is of course based on the rate of inflation, which the government says is 3.25 per cent after taking out the GST. In simple terms, this means that the GST has added around two per cent to the HECS debts of Australians. This GST spike amounts to a $120 million rip-off from students going into the government's coffers. So much for Mr Howard's pledge that education would be GST free!</para><para>As millions of Australians now know, this promise, like most of the government's promises on the GST, is a hollow one. It is another GST lie that will add to the struggle of many Australians hit by the GST slug and is a clear indication that the coalition cares little about making Australia a knowledge nation, in contrast to Labor's ambition for our country. Labor's vision for Australia's future is one of a knowledge nation. We will increase investment in universities and establish the University of Australia Online, providing 100,000 new tertiary education places. Labor will double the number of research fellowships, support student associations and never allow $100,000 degrees. We will stop wealthy students buying university places to jump the queue, and we will roll back the GST to make it fairer and simpler. This contrasts with the performance of a government which has cut university and R&amp;D funding, cut TAFE and VET funding, attacked public schools and savaged funding for regional universities by more than $200 million. What does this say about the Howard government's record? Frankly, it is a terrible reflection on the government's commitment to education and the priority it gives to a better future for our kids.</para><para>All Australian parents want to give their children the very best in educational opportunities available. However, the majority of parents cannot afford to send their children to private schoolsânor should they have to. The realisation of the hopes and dreams we have for our children should not be confined to the rich and affluent. Yet the Howard government seeks to achieve exactly that by taking money from public schools and giving it to the ultra-rich category 1 private schools. It is perhaps the Prime Minister's desired version of the story of Robin Hood: take from the poor and give to the rich.</para><para>It does not stop there. The government is also seeking to further the divide by increasing HECS fees and GST induced indexation hikes for university students. It has also slashed vital research funding, particularly in regional universities such as James Cook University and the University of Southern Queensland. Government measures in education must not exacerbate the class divide in our community. A good education is a universal right in this country. You only have to look at systems in places like the United States to see what a move towards a user-pays regime will result inâthat is, systems where you can get the best education money can buy only if you can afford it.</para><para>In Australia, we are lucky that this system is not yet entrenched. The Howard government has nevertheless demonstrated its willingness to establish such a system here. Its attempts to introduce full up-front fees for universities and its continued push towards greater funding of wealthy private schools at the expense of public schools is irrefutable evidence of that. The Australian public, in their collective outrage, signalled their absolute opposition to the government's plans. Despite what the government may now think, the Australian people are not so naive that they would allow the government to have another go at it. Quality education gives our kids the best chance to succeed in life, regardless of their background, and it will help build the strong and prosperous knowledge nation that we in the Labor Party seek to foster.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>25123</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI too wish to discuss the question of education in the debate on the <inline ref="R1304">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002</inline>, the <inline ref="R1303">Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2001-2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1302">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002</inline>.

That has recently attracted some attention in the media.</para></talk.start><para>It is undeniable that the short-sighted and vindictive actions of Dr Kemp have caused long-term damage to our tertiary education sector. As the evidence provided by DETYA has demonstrated, the number of Australians enrolled in public tertiary education has begun to fall for the first time in a decade. This follows the six per cent real cut in funding for public expenditure on universities in the period from 1996 to 2001. It follows the rise in staff-student ratios from 16:1 in 1996 to about 18.8:1 in recent years. These are figures confirmed by DETYA officials yesterday.</para><para>This government has taken $5 billion from the research and education sectors, yet it recently announced in its so-called Innovation Statement and in Backing Australia's Ability that it intends to replace that $5 billion with $3 billion. It is important to note that the bulk of that $3 billion will be expended at the very end of the forward estimates period. The overwhelming bulk of it occurs not before this election but after the next and the one after that. So we are looking at expenditure commitments claimed by this government to be made over the life of three parliaments.</para><para>Questions have arisen about quality assurance, the declining standards in undergraduate teaching, soft marking in pursuit of satisfying full fee paying students' demands and the senseless neglect of regional universities. These are part of the litany of genuine complaints and grievances that have been made about this pettifogging education minister. There is national concern at some of the side effects of the universities' rush to embrace private ventures, which has seen not just a myopic obsession with private funding but long-term damage in the sector. The overwhelming weight of the evidence that has been presented to the current Senate inquiry into higher education underscores both the extent and the gravity of the problem that our educational institutions now face. We have heard from witnessesâfrom vice-chancellors to members of the publicâthat there is deep concern in our community about the state of our universities.</para><para>The chairman of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee referred to the crisis within Australian universities. Grave concern has been expressed about the financial pressure facing our universities, greater than they have ever faced before. This financial pressure has led to overcrowding and allegations of a decline in standards. We have seen corners cut in quality assurance, fewer resources available to support greater student numbers, falling morale and a perceived preference for full fee paying students over HECS paying students.</para><para>The submission to the Senate inquiry from Professor John Quiggan is particularly illuminating in this regard. Professor Quiggan's summary encapsulates the dilemmas being faced by the entire sector. The arguments he has presented to us are essentially that Australian universities are facing a crisis of resources and morale and that the damage done by cuts in public funding has been exacerbated by pressure to adopt a market style orientation of teaching and research and by pressure to adopt a managerialist style of governance within our universities. He argues that the standard of teaching has declined as a result of reduced resources and pressures to attract and retain students at all costs. The claims that market forces, such as the desire for reputation, would prevent this have of course proven to be mistaken. The commercialisation of research has been demanded by the policy makers, with no understanding of the role of the public good research and with an inadequate awareness of the financial and other dangers associated with inappropriate approaches to commercialisation itself.</para><para>The story of Melbourne University Private provides an insight into the health of our tertiary education system and assists in identifying the most effective means by which our universities can recover from the disasters that have been imposed by Dr Kemp's policies. Unfortunately, Melbourne University is not isolated as an example. One only has to think of Unisearch Ltdâa wholly owned subsidiary of the University of New South Wales, which just a year or so ago required a $10 million bailoutâor the equivalent ventures at Macquarie University, Newcastle University and the University of Western Sydney, all of which have been splattered with red ink.</para><para>The University of Melbourne is one of our oldest, wealthiest and most prestigious universities. Public facilities built up over decades of public investment, combined with the talents and the dedication of staff, have given thousands of Australians, including me, the opportunities that otherwise would not have been available to them. It has been said that where Melbourne leads, others follow. The University of Melbourne's influence and prestige lie at the heart of the current conundrum. In the current climate, some of the universities have come to believe that reliance on public funding and adherence to public responsibility will inevitably compromise standards. One is struck by the very real suspicion that many senior administrators actually believe that there is no longer a need for commitment to the principles of public education.</para><para>The University of Melbourne has become one of the flagships in the privatised armada of Dr Kemp. He has sought to create the impression that Melbourne University Private will of course provide an alternative to public education in this country. In this, I am afraid that Dr Kemp is joined by Jeff Kennett, who praised the establishment of Melbourne University Private. At the time of its birth, it was hailed as a window to the future of tertiary education in Australia. Now what have we got? We have seen in recent times Professor Gilbert admit, and I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>of 18 May 2001, that this is `the most disappointing of an array of strategies' initiated by the university.</para><para>I should be clear at this point: I am not much interested in gratuitous attacks on universities or senior administrators. We have to acknowledge that there have been enormous challenges faced by senior management within universities in recent years. We have seen various strategies being developed to protect and defend public tertiary education, which must be recognised and supported. I want to concentrate on the actions of those who have collaborated with the government in its regressive policies on education. In the course of developing what they saw as a new, profitable, government pleasing strategy, they have instead jeopardised the reputations of a number of our leading universities. They have supervised de facto the privatisation of public assets. They have wasted public moneys on speculative commercial ventures, and at the end of the day attempts to obtain further public bailouts because of their short-sighted policies and their incompetence should not be condoned.</para><para>Melbourne University stands as a case study of what one ought not do to augment public education funding through private efforts. Its origins, I am sure senators will recall, lay in the privatisation of Melbourne's power industry, which was supposed to provide rich pickings for training, consultancies and commercial advice. It was also said that this private centre was there to be exploited, for developments would soon blossom with the idea of the full privatisation of the public university itself. It would be a vehicle by which university administrators could free themselves of public constraints and accountabilities. It was argued that expensive awards and non-award education could be provided to select clientele drawn from the private sector and the upper echelons of government. It was argued that this would be a safety net that the university would be able to draw upon should there be further withdrawal of public support by government.</para><para>Professor Alan Gilbert, the university's vice-chancellor and one of the most articulate advocates for this proposal, saw this as an opportunity to extract private benefit from the public profile and reputation of Melbourne University itself. He wanted to exploit Melbourne University's brand name. Three critical issues were faced by Professor Gilbert in his attempts to pursue this objective. Firstly, he needed to find a legitimate use of the term `university'; secondly, he needed to be able to argue that there would be finance for such a project, that it would prove profitable to the university; and, thirdly, he needed to find a site for the new university. Professor Gilbert solved all of these problems by combining them in a grand plan, which he submitted to the education minister in Victoria, Mr Phillip Honeywood, who in a fast-tracked approval process asked few questions, sought few real explanations and provided no accountability requirements within these approval processes to demonstrate that the public assets of the university would be quarantined from loss by this speculative venture.</para><para>If you compare the 12-week process that was undertaken to provide the authorisation for the establishment of Melbourne University Private, you can see that it is in sharp contrast to the process that was undertaken for the establishment of the Australian Catholic University or the rigorous process that was imposed on this government by way of its approach to Greenwich University, which is now under some duress. We ultimately found how useless an organisation that was and how totally inappropriate an organisation of that type was to the Australian university scene. We have seen in the subsequent history of Melbourne University Private that the claims made by the university itself in its briefings and submissions to government were totally unsubstantiated.</para><para>For instance, it was said that there would be a separate parcel of investment by superannuation funds, banks and other commercial interests through the separate business vehicleâpromises, of course, that have been made for a sum of $200 million. It was said that the university would commit $25 million towards the project, in parcels of $10 million and $15 million later on.</para><para>Corporate Australia voted with its feet. Not only did the university not provide the $25 million that it had argued it would from its own source but no money was found from the private sector of the $200 million that was originally identified. The university found, some eight months prior to the drafting of its submission to government, that the Boston Consulting Group had made an initial review of the private university proposal and said:</para><quote><para>Commitment at this point in time to significant, purpose-built facilities represents a high risk ...</para></quote><para>a high riskâ</para><quote><para>... to the University of Melbourne as the shape, size and form of the final schools are not clear. The sourcing of benefaction and soft equity to fund any such development will need to be pursued as an essential precursorâ</para></quote><para>I repeat: as an essential precursorâ</para><quote><para>to the establishment of Melbourne University.</para></quote><para>None of those things were done. The cautions expressed by the Boston Consulting Group were not followed through. There was a sorry episode of botched planning and impossible promises. Nonetheless, the Victorian government signed up to this whole adventure.</para><para>A review committee was established that argued, in terms of academic issues, that it required Melbourne University to develop its own independent research profile and meet a number of other Australian Vice Chancellor Committee criteria. It remains a matter of credulity that the rudimentary nature of this university submission was never fulfilled. One now looks back at these matters with some disbelief that the government could have at any point accepted the commitments that had been made. Nonetheless, commitments were made and the commitments were accepted by the Kennett government in Victoria.</para><para>Private investment in Melbourne University has been conspicuous by its absence, so students have not come, investment has not come, the programs have been substantially changed and the public reputation of Melbourne University has been seriously damaged by this proposal. In recent times we have seen the various consultancy reports to the university actually raise the serious issue of the insolvency of the project itself.</para><para>By the end of 2000, Melbourne University Private was in desperate straits. Not only had its enrolment and financial projections proved wildly inaccurate; it had also lost moneys cumulatively in 1999-2000 of $3.5 million, its capital reserves barely exceeded $4 million and Professor Barry Sheehan, the Chief Executive Officer of Melbourne University Private, had foreshadowed losses of more than $7 million this year and $8 million in 2002. And there is an immediate danger of insolvency. These issues were only resolved by the forced amalgamation of Melbourne University Private with another Melbourne University private arm, Melbourne Enterprises Internationalâa wholly owned private entity used by the university to develop international networks of language colleges and which had retained $29 million from the highly controversial 1999 float of Melbourne University IT.</para><para>This entire episode demonstratesâand if one looks at it in retrospect one can see that it does assume the proportions of a French farceâthat public administrators were playing, unsuccessfully, at being businessmen and cutting corners in the process; the private sector directors of university subsidiaries were actually the ones calling for administrators to be accountable in the name of probity and public accountability, and that is an irony in itself; Professor Gilbert was making quite wild claims to the press about `business as usual' at Melbourne University Private in a desperate attempt to rein in a situation that was increasingly out of control; and government staff and the students at the universities were being told nothing at all.</para><para>In recent months we have seen a whole series of conflicting legal advice commissioned by the university and various dissidents within the MEI directors, which has found that the various business plans proposed by Melbourne University Private have not been accepted within the board itself and that the claims being made cannot be sustained on any close examination. Furthermore, Melbourne University Private, so uncritically promoted by senior administrators in this country, by senior government figuresâboth within the Commonwealth Liberal government and within the state Liberal governmentâhas demonstrated that they were wrong. The university is now being brought into question and, as a result, that has raised serious questions as to the appropriateness of this sort of model being pursued as an alternative education policy.</para><para>Four points need to be made about this whole exercise. Firstly, Melbourne University Private was conceived and operated as a commercial venture, which has failed. Under such circumstances, it is appropriate that the University of Melbourne should now produce a full balance sheet for its operations between 1998 and 2001, which would call into true account all the costs associated with its operationsâits course development, as well as property development and the fit-outs commissioned on its behalf. It is no longer good enough for the administration at Melbourne University to take refuge in the semantic difference between `public funds' and `taxpayer funds'. The Victorian Auditor-General has shown that there is no such distinction: in fact all funds under the control of the university are deemed to be public assets.</para><para>Secondlyâand I refer back to the Boston Consulting Group's recent warnings about the unattainability of the revenues and gross margins that have been proposed in this ventureâthe current business plan proposed by the consultancy group canvassed a number of financial scenarios, all of which demonstrate the irrelevance not just of Melbourne University Private but also of the investment strategy for the new entity that is being established to try to prevent or stave off insolvency. </para><para>What is of extreme concern, though, is the number of caveats and qualifications that have been presented as part of these analyses undertaken by these financial experts. This is clearly an issue which does require considerable public debate. It ought to be the case, as the Victorian Auditor-General has recently issued similar warnings, that there be much thorough examination of the propositions entered into by universities as they seek to compensate for Dr Kemp's policies. We clearly cannot have people essentially misusing the term `university' and bringing into disrepute all universities in this country in their drive to attract private moneys in a bid to make up for what has been a disastrous policyâpursued from Canberra and directed by Canberraâwhich clearly undermines what we might regard properly as the civic responsibilities of our universities to ensure that all Australians have access to high quality educational services and to protect academic freedom. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>25127</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1304">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002</inline> and related bills. It is certainly interesting to note that we have just been through a budget from this government. The annual budget is perhaps the most important economic, political and social document prepared and issued by the government. A budget brought down in what must be an election year is an even more important document. But if the government is in political troubleâor, in the case of the Howard government, in big political troubleâthere is a temptation to abandon proper financial rigour and proper administrative process and spend large amounts of money. That is exactly what this government has been doing. In a matter of months it has committed not millions but billions of dollars.</para></talk.start><para>The key feature of this last Costello budgetâand I know it is something that a lot of people do laugh about and that has put some people to sleepâis that it reflects the key policy failures of the Howard government and the mounting problems for many elderly Australians that have built up as a result. This budget amounts to a concession that the previous four years of the Howard government have been policy failures. This budget is a confession that the GST has had a severe effect on older Australians, including pensioners and self-funded retirees. Many people in these two groups have received little or nothing from this government and this budget. While there has been an attempt to at least try and ease the burden imposed by the GST on the elderly, there has not been much of an attempt to help families, nor is there any joy for the small business sector. Mr Howard inflicted the GST on families and he has inflicted the GST on small business. It appears that they have received little or nothing in return. He has offered them nothing more than more GST.</para><para>In this budget the Howard government added insult to injury by giving some older Australians a one-off grant of $300 after promising $1,000 to everyone. It is interesting to note that over 730,000 Australians aged 55 and over will not be receiving the $300. Included in this group of 730,000 are people on disability support pensions, carer payment recipients and all self-funded retirees under the pension age. Self-funded retirees who have attained the pensionable age and who have a single income of more than $20,000, or a joint income of more than $32,612, will also get nothing. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people on low incomes who are under the age of 55 and who are struggling to make ends meet as a result of the GST also get nothing except more GST.</para><para>It is clear that this government has learned nothing since the Prime Minister announced the $1,000 savings bonus. The Prime Minister promised everyone $1,000 just before the last election. That was a very public commitment. It was on national radio.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>âIt was qualified.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>âThe fact of the matter isâ</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>âIt was exactly the same as the $300.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>âIt was exactly the same as the $300, was it, Senator Calvert? That is very interesting. If it was exactly the same as the $300, then it is hard to explain why some people got fractions of the $1,000 and some people got nothing. This very public commitment was made on national radio. I do not believe that the Prime Minister would make a careless statement on national radio. There is not any doubt that the intention was to have people believe that they would receive $1,000, but many people found subsequently that they were not eligible for anything. Many others discovered that they were only entitled to a paltry amount. In fact, around 40 percent of people over 60 years of age received precisely nothing and 160,613 people received between $1 and $50. That is a long way short of $1,000. That is bad enough but, to make matters worse, the Howard government then claimed it had overpaid 1,800 people and is demanding that they repay various sums, totalling $2,308,909. That is mean and tricky in the extreme. The whole bonus payment program has turned out to be a poorly orchestrated hoax.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to touch on the issue of taxation. Mr Howard claims taxation reform is a central plank of his government's policy, if not the central plank. Tax reform, frankly, has been the reason for being for this government. Before the 1996 election, Mr Howard promised the Australian people that he would not introduce any new taxes and would not increase any existing taxes. That promise, of course, was abandoned in the most spectacular style with Mr Howard's plan to put a 10 per cent tax on just about everything. But who can forget the `never ever' commitment on the GSTâthe GST which was tinkered with by the Democrats, but only a little. This is a tax which, far from being simple, remains complex; this is a tax which was described as fair but remains grossly unfair; and this is a tax which can only be described as regressive. It does not matter whether you are earning $1 million a week, $1 million a year or $100 a week, you still pay the same rate of tax. This is a tax which goes up and up and up, in the sense that a 10 per cent rise in prices reaps ever increasing revenue for the government. This is a tax which was always going to be a growth taxâa growth of revenue for governmentâfrom which the government, without adjusting the rate, can reap higher and higher financial returns from the public. But, of course, no-one believes the rate will remain the same. Everyone believes that the rate will go up.</para><para>But a closer look exposes a much broader and far more comprehensive breach of that initial tax promise made by Mr Howard. Let us remember that promise that he would not introduce any new taxes and he would not increase any existing taxes. Since Mr Howard won office, his government has introduced legislation for 113âyes, that is 113ânew taxes and tax increases. Mr Howard was at it again as recently as last month when, on 25 May, he was on his regular spot on radio 3AW talking tax. He said:</para><quote><para>We are not going to increase any taxes. </para></quote><para>Obviously he was talking about his possible next term after the next election. But, by the Sunday after that, the mobile Howard government tax plan was on the move again. Mr Howard told viewers of the <inline font-style="italic">Meet the Press</inline> program:</para><quote><para>We do not intend to increase any taxes in our next term. </para></quote><para>So it did not take long for the Prime Minister to start to step away from the absolute to a statement which allows a future Howard government, if any, to find ways to say, `We didn't actually say we weren't going to increase taxes. We just didn't intended to increase them then but we will now.' So between a Friday and a Sunday we had Mr Howard changing from saying no tax increases to having no intention to have tax increases.</para><para>Unlike Mr Howard, Labor's position on tax is quite clear: we will not increase personal income tax; we will not increase capital gains tax, and I might admit that we voted for a cut in the capital gains tax in 1999.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>âWe will come to the money issue, Senator Calvert, shortly. Labor will also roll back the GST to make it simpler and fairer, because we are about reducing, not increasing, the tax burden on Australian families. That is what roll-back means. In fact, let us face it: this government has been forced to do a little rolling back itself on the GST, but there is a long way to go. As I referred to earlier, unlike Labor, Mr Howard is leaving his options wide open when it comes to further tax increases. There is absolutely no guarantee that the Howard government will not increase the GST tax rate or extend its coverage.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Despite all the rhetoric from Mr Howard, his is the biggest taxing, biggest spending federal government in living history. There is ample evidence for all to see on that point: a massive boost in the tax burden on ordinary Australians through the GST; no less than 113 new taxes or tax increases introduced since Mr Howard took office; and a massive $20 billionâthat is right, $20 billionâcut from the forward estimates of budget surpluses between May last year and May this year. What a spending spree! One commentator is reported to have said that there is no question as to whether the government is doing it; the only question is which wall they are doing it against. </para><para>As I said earlier, there is nothing in this budget to help ordinary Australian families in the cities and certainly not in the country. There is little relief from the GST for anyone. In fact, if anything, this budget opens up a bigger divide between the rich and the poor and between the cities and the country. Under Mr Howard's government, the fortunes of regional Australia continue to slide. Mr Howard's plan is to sell Telstra and its intention, though it currently denies itâGST style, I might sayâis to sell Australia Post. That will drive prospects for people living in regional Australia even lower.</para><para>There is no doubt that the Howard government plans to sell Telstra and there is no doubt about the impact that the sale would have on regional telecommunications. The sale of the balance of the public ownership of Telstra is factored into the budgetâit is undeniable that that is the intention of the governmentâand with it would go regional jobs, and if it occurs regional services will decline.</para><para>The reality is that some of the measures that the government put into place to make the bitter pill of the sale of part of Telstra easier to swallow were proof of the value of the public ownership of Telstra. For example, in respect of Broadband e-Lab in the City of Launceston, an amount of money was committed to a project which I do not have time to describe at the moment. However, a significant amount of money was committed by Telstra to that project, provided it was matched by the Commonwealth. I think it was clear to everyone that were it not for government pressure, this experiment would not have been taking place in regional Australia. </para><para>When you looked at the equation, it was interesting to note that the amount of money that Telstra put up had to be matched by the Commonwealth for the simple reason that Telstra was putting up an amount of money to match the Commonwealth's ownership of Telstra, and the Commonwealth was putting up an amount of money to match private ownership. In other words, it was doing that to say, `You don't actually have to balance off the private investment; we'll cover that part of the investment. You put up money to cover our part of the share.' That is what Telstra did. The reality is that nothing would have happened. There would have been no Broadband e-Lab in Launceston if there had not been part public ownership of Telstra.</para><para>A majority of Telstra must remain in public hands because only then can people living outside the major population centres have some confidence that they will have ongoing access to modern telecommunications. As I said, despite its rhetoric, this government has the privatisation of Australia Post on its agenda, or at least the hiving off of the profitable parts of Australia Post, leaving an uncompetitive, inoperative shell. When you remember what happened in the past, you would have to say that when you hear the Howard government promise not to privatise Australia Post, all you have to do is call up those memories and remember the GST.</para><para>I have touched upon the decline in regional services that those sorts of things would lead to, but remember this: Labor will ensure that Australia Post remains in public hands. Under Labor, of course, there will not be further deregulation of the Australian postal industry. We achieved significant efficiencies with reforms in the past. This government has gone on with reforms. Efficiencies can be achieved without the need for privatisation or stripping services.</para><para>While Australia Post is an issue, in the brief time left to me, I want to refer to the fact that regional Australia is suffering under this government. It is not getting its fair share of economic opportunity. That is why we have seen the rise of simplistic organisations such as Pauline Hanson's One Nation in regional Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>âThat is crazy and opportunistic.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>âIt is very interesting that Senator Boswell talks about opportunism, and I might take the opportunity to examine that concept on another occasion in relation to One Nation and the National Party in Queensland. However, at the moment, I want to say that this budget does nothing to put back what John Howard has cut out of regional Australia since the infamous 1996 budget. This government continues to focus on the big end of town. This is the second budget in a row that has failed to respond to the Regional Australia Summit recommendations for a regional development strategy. I thought that that was the National Party policy, but we will see what Senator Boswell has to say about that. The National Party got nothing from this government in terms of meeting that regional Australia development strategy.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Howard government has only two big ideasâand they are both very bad ones, I might say. The first was the GST and the second is the full sale of Telstra. It has managed to put the first one in place.

What a tragedy that, over a century and a half later, this term is still needed.</para><para>For a while in this country, we have been sold deception. We were sold a story that unfettered markets would be in the interests of the common good. Finally, the deceptiveness of this is becoming apparent. Part of the problem has always been in the fallibility of economics as a predictive tool. Even physics is not an exact science in the true, philosophical meaning of predictive fact, yet the economists of the last 20 years have laid it down as a commandment in stone about how the future should be. Anyone who challenged their models or status was seen as a Marxist or a Luddite holding back progress.</para><para>In a recent St Vincent de Paul Society report, many of these untruths were exposed. In section 2 of its report entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Unconscionable Gap Between Rich and Poor</inline>, it highlighted the self-evident chaos that has resulted from the unfettered market. It states:</para><quote><para>While GDP has grown by leaps and bounds in the last 20 years, it is patently obvious to even the most casual observer that not everyone has benefited. While the top quintile of households in the 1990s enjoyed around 50% of Australia's gross weekly incomes, the bottom 20% of Australians received less than 4%.</para></quote><para>Is it any wonder that the social problems faced by the community are increasing? The Howard government keep on having inquiriesâwe rarely see the results of themâyet they do little about the structural and legal inequalities of our society. They prefer to keep driving down the road as if they do not know where else to go. In some ways, it reminds me of Bryce Courtenay's book <inline font-style="italic">The Power of One</inline>, which I paraphrase: they run here, they run there, because they are afraid. They are afraid of going to an election when everyone in the country wants one. That is not just my opinion.</para><para>An acquaintance of mine recently visited the northern areas of New South Walesâthe towns of Tenterfield and Glen Innes. They are in trouble and they want an election, as the youth of their towns are forced away by a lack of economic critical mass. That in turn leaves the elderly more reliant on government services, as the economic and social impact of distance tyranny compounds the problems of some of the elderly in our small regional centres. I see that all the time in the area where I liveâthe north-west coast of Tasmania. The young are leaving the area, and the elderly are becoming more isolated, particularly from their families, and they are having to move away from their regional communities to go into care because there are not enough care places in small communities.</para><para>As Mike Steketee highlighted in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 30 May, in an aptly titled article `Out of work, out of hope', the budget ignores the long-term jobless. There is no hope for the young in regional Australia, there is no hope for three generations of unemployed in the most depressed areas of Tasmania, and there is no hope and no answers from this government. Work for the Dole is not the answer. There is no point in being job ready when there are no jobs. The answer does not lie in paying people a pittance for a structural economic problem. Again, that was aptly highlighted by the St Vincent de Paul Society on page 3 of section 2 of its report. It states:</para><quote><para>Since some of the reasons for the increasing gap are endemic, to current economic arrangements for wealth creation ... some fundamental changes are required.</para></quote><para>Thus the myth of unemployment is exposed quite simply. It is largely not their fault; you cannot cattle prod the unemployed into non-existent work by threats of poverty when there are no jobs. The St Vincent de Paul Society report also points out:</para><quote><para>How can 600,000 or more unemployed all find work if there are less than 100,000 real jobs available?</para></quote><para>Yet, if you listen to this government's social policy think tank, our country is a mess because of the poorâthe ones without power or influenceâand, for a tidy fee, the banks are the good guys.</para><para>Governments may not be able to control world commodity prices, currency fluctuations or GDP growth; however, the ability to redistribute the wealth and power of their own countries is still within their legitimate domain. In other words, we may have no control over the macro world we find ourselves in, but we can control the micro world and how we redistribute wealth and power. That is not to say that we have a flat earth policy as far as equality and power are concerned. Rather, we should address the ever widening gap between the haves and the have-nots, again as noted in the St Vincent de Paul Society report, which states:</para><quote><para>... we will co-operate in developing a just and compassionate Australia.</para></quote><para>If we as a nation were to take a small leap along that road, the children of our nation will sing our praises in a hundred years from now.</para><para>As many of you know, I live in rural Tasmania. Many rural areas have been doing it tough, in some ways as a direct result of the concentration on market fundamentals to the exclusion of social ones. Our unemployment figure is higher, our poverty is more extreme, our opportunities are shrinking, and so the list goes on. As illustrated before, we are not alone in this occurrenceâmany other small towns are not doing well. As a National Economics report <inline font-style="italic">The State of Regions 2000</inline> highlights, the gap is not just between the rich and the poor; rather, it is reflected in, for example, `global Sydney' and rural and regional areas, and it will continue to grow unless structural reforms are made, as cited in section 2 of the St Vincent de Paul Society report.</para><para>Thus, in some ways, we find ourselves at a crossroad of how we, as people of a sovereign nation, want to structure our economy within the confines of global vagaries. Ironically, as we head for overcrowded cities where the poor and the rich become further and further separated from life's experiences, history teaches that the greatest threat to the rich is the extreme alienation between those who have and those who have not. If we have courage as an inclusive nation, we can play our part in shaping the surroundings that we live in. Humane agency can help shape the world we live in and thus feed back into how we feel about ourselves, both as a collective and as individuals.</para><para>In the last two decades, we seem to have relinquished the belief that the market is a tool we should manipulate. Rather, we have allowed ourselves to be deluded into handing over complete servitude to it. A report titled <inline font-style="italic">Hearing the Voices (Calling for Change)</inline> put out by Anglicare Tasmania in cooperation with the Poverty Coalition and TasCOSS in January 2001 speaks of the need for concession schemes. It reminds me of rationing booklets during the war. As a recent Anzac said, there is no glory in warâthey were doing a job they simply had to do. I am sure that the charity organisations would rather not have to produce reports on what amounts to war on the poor and disenfranchised. I am sure they would love to write reports on the social justice of our nation. The need for concession schemes arises as a result of an inability to pay power bills. In Tasmaniaâto paraphrase a line from good King Wenceslasâthe winter nights are cruel and, unlike the women in the hymn, gathering fuel is not an option these days: neighbours get upset if you pinch their fence palings. If you cannot pay your power bill you cannot sit around an open oven door in sleeping bags, as some of the younger people in Tasmania do when they run out of firewood. You can always tell when you knock on the door, as you hear them bouncing up the hall in their sleeping bags, with their teeth chattering as they let you in.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FY5</name.id><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name></talker><para>âSenator Boswell, these quotes are from this report <inline font-style="italic">Hearing the Voices (Calling for Change)</inline>.

Decent people have to swallow their pride orâas one of our past prime ministers aptly suggested in relation to another matter of individual sovereigntyâdoff their cap or, in a Dickens sense, ask, `Please, sir, can I have some more?' Unless the inequality is adequately addressed they will have to keep on doing it, begging for help as the layers of shame after shame keep building until they feel nothing at all. With no hope of getting a job, through no fault of their own, and no hope of getting out of the economic situation they find themselves in, they are becoming more and more alienated from mainstream society intoâas the French Sociologist Durkheim so rightly termed it in his study on suicide over a century agoâanomie. Anyone familiar with Durkheim's work will understand he was referring to the conflict that arises between the expectations you have been socialised to achieve and your inability to achieve them. As an aside, Durkheim was a deeply spiritual man, writing many comments on the nature of comparative religion, exploring totems in a similar way to Jung, who explored archetypes years later. One would suggest that he would not have envisaged an end to church based charity but would have realised that if the superstructures are not balanced in equitable ways we will reach a crisis in our social organisation, one of the systemic symptoms of which is an increase in suicide, particularly amongst men. Often our response has been to employ more professionals to counsel, either spiritually or psychologically, those with suicidal thoughts or to employ pharmacological help. Both these methods have their place. The danger surely lies in the Sorbent Green response of Huxley's <inline font-style="italic">Brave New World</inline> that seeks to medicate or pacify disquiet, rather than acknowledge the symptoms of social discord.</para><para>I noticed an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>on Sunday about people that work in disability. I know some people that work in that field in Tasmania. Recently I heard a story from a woman who had worked 64 hours in a week. For 32 of those hours she received the sum of $80. This has to do with a thing called `sleep overs'. That means that they stay overnight on the premises. If you sleep as a residential carer overnight, you do not have to do anything, thus you only receive $20 for the sleep over. This practice is not just confined to disability. It ignores the fact that you are away from your home and your family and friends. It also ignores the dedication of the staff. Talking to these workers, the toll of sleep overs is certainly worth more than $20 a night. It is worth an hourly rate at normal hourly wages, as the work demands you are away from your place of residence.</para><para>On Saturday, TasCOSS released a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Dead men's shoes</inline>. It refers to the plight of the long-term unemployed forced to wear the shoes of people that have died. Though I congratulate TasCOSS on the direction of the report, I feel it is unfair to concentrate exclusively on our state government as the source of blame. Tasmania has a small economy and thus has less resilience in the economic gales that blow from overseas and the mainland. I am not trying to absolve my state colleagues entirely. The state government in itself can achieve an impact that cannot be denied. I am merely suggesting that without adequate federal motivation to seriously address the human tragedy of long-term unemploymentâone of the real tragedies of the modern worldâand without a national focus on unemployment and wealth differentials, we can achieve very little.</para><para>From that report, I just want to read very quickly a couple of interviews with people from all over Tasmania.

I will give an interpretation from the Northern Territory and describe the impact of this budget on the Northern Territory. Let me begin by saying that we all know that the Howard government has lacked any vision for Australia's future. We would have hoped that the first budget for the new millennium would be used to present exciting ideas for Australia's future. But this is not the case, and was never going to be the case. This is a budget framed by panic that has used the surpluses to cover up the damage done by the GST. The measures in this budget all reflect the true and growing cost of the GST and the desperation of this government to shore up support from those voters it has put offside over the last five years.</para></talk.start><para>Having no vision, the Howard government has had to steal Labor's policies. It has watered them down and then tried to pass them off as its own creative masterpiece. Let me list some of them: the removal of the enrolment benchmark adjustment; the learning gateway; Medicare After Hours; Medicare Online; the petrol excise backdown; the BAS backdown; the beer backdown; and the training credit for the unemployedâall policies which Labor has released and which are out there for comment. There are 74 of them on the web site, like sitting ducks in cyberspace, that this government wants to snatch, copy and recycle as its own.</para><para>The budget also proves that the Howard government has no idea and is drastically out of touch on education policy. The Howard government claims credit for putting back $3 billion into universities and research and development. It also should be pointed out that it intends to put back the $3 billion mostly in the fourth and fifth year, though, of this five-year budget cycle. The government has simply put back $3 billion over five years, having taken out $5 billion over the last five years that it has been in office; and then it tries to claim credit for this move.</para><para>The budget also confirms that the government is keen to copy policy initiatives of the Labor Party, as I detailed earlier, such as our plans to abolish the enrolment benchmark adjustment in the education sector. The unfair enrolment benchmark adjustment takes money away from public schools if the percentage of students attending government schools declines. The Howard government is now saying it will agree to give back the money that it was taking away from state and territory departments of education on the condition that they submit a plan to improve the teaching of sciences and information technology in government schools.</para><para>The budget also included a cheap imitation of Labor's learning gateway unveiled in July last year. Labor's plan is for the learning gateway to provide better access to high quality, online content to help students in Australian schools. Also in the budget papers, the government announced an increase in funding of $230 million for vocational education and training, but that is after it cut $240 million from VET over the last five years. This does not even replace what the government cut from VET in the 1996 and 1997 budgets.</para><para>The Howard government, in education, proposes to increase funding to elite category 1 private schools by an extra $105 million over the next three years. Under the government scheme, Geelong Grammar, for example, will receive an extra $4.3 million, Trinity Grammar will get an extra $7.8 million, Caulfield Grammar gets an extra $9.2 million and Wesley College gets an extra $10.4 million. Unlike this government, the Labor Party believes that there should be support for non-government schools and for parental choice in schooling. Continued government funding to private schools should be on the basis of need. Category 1 schools should not be the highest priority for extra government help. Other schools, we believe, have greater needs. Category 1 schools will continue to receive annual indexation increases in line with the average government school's recurrent cost. And while Labor will continue to fund them at the year 2000 level, indexed for inflation, we will redirect funding from category 1 private schools to the public school system, where it is much more urgently needed. This will free up $105 million that we will spend to improve our public schools through extra capital works and to also improve the quality of teaching in both government and non-government schools. </para><para>The Labor Party will spend half of the $105 million on improving the quality of our public schools by increasing the investment in capital works. We will fund 1,000 new teacher scholarships each year to encourage more of our best year 12 students to consider a vocation in teaching. We will also use that money to fund 10,000 extra professional development training courses for existing teachers. So unlike this government, Labor will use the money to assist public schools and to support those people at the chalkface by offering to improve their skills and knowledge base to achieve a high quality outcome for all students.</para><para>In passing, I want to comment on claims by this government that it is a low taxing government. What a myth. Since 1996 the Howard government has brought in legislation to increase taxes and to introduce new taxes 121 timesâ63 times in its first term. Tax cuts were supposed to sufficiently compensate Australians for the increase in the cost of living as a result of the GST. That compensation in the form of tax cuts has by no means been adequate to make up for the increase in the cost of living as a result of the introduction of the GST. In the Northern Territory, we are only too aware of the inadequacies of those tax cuts. </para><para>As the Senate well knows, Territorians did not want the GST; they voted against it at the last election. They knew what would happen. Before the introduction of the GST, Territorians were already paying some of the highest prices for goods and services in Australia. Territorians knew that a 10 per cent flat tax on their already high priced goods and services would mean that they would be paying proportionately more tax than people down south. They knew that the already high cost of living in the Northern Territory would increase further, with the token compensation afforded in no way making up for their extra costs.</para><para>The question asked at the time of the introduction of the GST still stands and remains unanswered. Why should Territorians be doubly penalisedâfirstly, by paying more for the items and, secondly, by paying more tax? Look at the exorbitant fuel prices paid by Territorians. While residents of remote Territory communities could be paying GST of up to 18c based on $1.80 for a litre of unleaded fuel, residents of Sydney or Melbourne are only paying about 9c a litre in GST. Is that fair? Is that equitable? Territorians certainly do not think so. And watch outâif the infamous David Tollner, the CLP's candidate for the seat of Solomon at the next federal election, has his way, the GST will be expanded. Just to remind you of the CLP's view on the GST, on ABC radio on 28 May Mr Tollner told the ABC broadcaster Fred McCue:</para><quote><para>I think GST should apply across the board, it would be a far simpler system and I think there should be reductions inâmore greater reductions in PAYE tax. If I get to Canberra, that's certainly something that I'll be fighting for.</para></quote><para>Good on you, David, but sorry. Territorians did not want the GST before the election, and I am sure you will find out that they do not want any expanded GST to include all foods in the future.</para><para>Nearly 12 months down the track, the GST and BAS have not got any easier for small business to administer. The extra administrative and accounting costs have hit many businesses hard. One example I noted the other day was contained in a customer newsletter that I received from a local retail business in Palmerston in which the proprietor told customers that they were having to pass on significant price increases from suppliers whose accounting costs and general administration costs have risen considerably as a result of the GST and the implications of the BAS. Contrary to what this government may claim, the GST and the BAS have not become any easier for most small businesses in the Northern Territory. There are numerous stories of Territory businesses going to the wall as a result of the GST, and unfortunately there was nothing in this budget at all that alleviated those difficulties for businesses in the Northern Territory.</para><para>The GST induced slump in the economy has hit Territory businesses particularly hard, most notably in the construction sector. Numerous building companies have gone out of business or into receivership since the introduction of the GST. While nationally there was a decline of about 40 per cent in new private sector housing, in the Northern Territory ABS figures for the March quarter show construction on private sector housing fell by a massive 80.3 per cent, the worst figures for many, many years. As predicted, the GST has also hurt the Territory's tourism economy. Tourism figures for the March quarter show a drop of 5.5 per cent in room nights compared with the March quarter of last year.</para><para>The reality is that this budget does very little for the Northern Territory. For example, there is nothing in this budget that addresses the high cost of fuel for Territorians, the needs of our public education system, the future of the Northern Territory University, the problems faced by the Australian Defence Force personnel, the increased costs of running a small business under the new tax system, the need for additional CDEP places in the bush, the need for better roads for the Territory and the need for more aged care facilities.</para><para>The Northern Territory is facing an immense crisis in the aged care area. We have families that have to drive their ageing parents over 5,000 kilometres to Perth to find them an aged care bed, yet where was the help in this budget for those families? Where was the capital works funding to ensure that allocated beds are taken up by service providers? The Northern Territory already has a waiting list for aged care beds which is nearly double that of the rest of the country. While the national average waiting time for an aged care nursing bed is 55 days, in the Northern Territory it is a staggering 104 days. We have since been told there is no guarantee that the Territory will receive any additional capital works funding in the next 12 months. Well, that is not good enough. Territorians need that funding now.</para><para>There is another good reason why older Territorians are cranky with the Howard government. They remember the Prime Minister telling them on numerous occasions during the GST campaign that everyone over the age of 60 would get a $1,000 saving rebateâeveryone. Now he wants older Australians to be happy if they are lucky enough to get a $300 payment.</para><para>For indigenous Territorians, there was nothing in this budget to get excited about. No additional funding was allocated to indigenous youth programs, or to land or heritage management. It was very disappointing to note that there was also no significant funding for indigenous sport in this year's program. Out of an allocation of $161 million over four years for a more active Australia, only $1.5 million has been allocated for indigenous sports programs. The Territory's indigenous communities are crying out for funding for organised sporting and recreational programs. Sporting programs for indigenous youth would help reduce antisocial behaviour in communities, at a time when much attention is being paid to problems such as suicide of indigenous youth, petrol sniffing and alcohol abuseâwhich lead, of course, to the national cry of `mandatory sentencing'. Much of this antisocial behaviour has boredom as a central component. I am continuously being told that a whole range of antisocial behaviours is dramatically reduced when sporting programs are in operation. The suicide rates, petrol sniffing and alcohol abuse all drop considerably when people have other things to do with their time. Funding for indigenous sports programs, therefore, should be seen as a preventative health community development measure, not simply a sports activityâbut it is a measure that this government has chosen to ignore in this budget.</para><para>Another area I want to mention tonight is the problems faced by our Australian Defence Force members in the Territory. As we know, a large proportion of our ADF capacity is now based in the Territory, with the Air Force in Tindall and the naval base in Darwin. We have about 30 different ADF units covering all three services. Members of the ADF and their families are valued members of the Territory community. When this government came to office, the ADF had about 58,000 full-time members. Under the Defence Force reform program, the government intended to run down the ADF to about 42,500. However, after East Timor, the government signed off on 55,000 full-time personnel. We know that the ADF is finding it difficult to recruit and maintain the personnel necessary to reach that figure. During 1999 and 2000, the ADF recruited 4,043 members, but in the same year 6,467 members left. That highlights the crisis facing our Australian Defence Force.</para><para>And it is no secret that our ADF is suffering from very low morale. The Defence Force community does not believe that it has been treated fairly by this government. The Howard government must deal with the issues affecting ADF personnel if it is to retain and attract the personnel necessary for Australia's defence needs. Look at the issue of fringe benefits tax and the remote locality leave travel allowance. While the government backed down on most of the FBT changes, it has not resolved the remote locality leave allowanceâand this is unfair. Given the nature of service in the ADF, many ADF members are separated from their families for lengthy periods of time. </para><para>Many members cannot afford to pay the difference between the remote locality leave travel entitlement and the cost of airfares to destinations such as Melbourne or Sydney, meaning that visits to their families become less regular or the ADF member decides to leave the Defence Force altogether. And why shouldn't they? Until this federal government chooses to deal with the concerns effecting the lowering of morale of our members in the ADF, it will struggle to retain and attract the necessary people. It could have used this budget though to resolve any outstanding issues and send out a very clear message to ADF personnel that their contributions are valued. But this government chose not to do so.</para><para>For Territorians, this budget was further evidence that this government is unconcerned about the impact that the GST has had on the cost of living for Territorians. This is a budget that I believe has ignored the cries and concerns of people in the Territoryâin respect of fuel prices, the high cost of living, the run-down state of the Northern Territory education system, the decline in funding and respect for the work that the Northern Territory University does, the chronic state of the Northern Territory public hospital system and the state of Aboriginal health in the Northern Territory. These are all areas that this government could have highlighted and could have made a centrepiece of its budgetâbut no.</para><para>In this budget, this government chose to spend surplus on those measures and those areas of its traditional support that it has lost over five years. This is a budget that, as I said earlier, is framed by panicâa budget brought down by the government in an attempt to get itself re-elected through spending money on its traditional voters whose support it has lost. This is not a budget that has really looked at the concerns of Australians, including people in the Territory. This is not a budget that is worried about arresting the rising cost of living or lifestyle of people in the Territory. This is a budget that has ignored people in Northern Australia. But, come election time, be rest assured that the people in the Northern Territory will not forget the actions of this budget and will not forget, of course, the infamous words of David TollnerâDavid Tollner, the preselected candidate for Solomon, who said no less than three weeks ago on radio that he wanted the GST applied across the board. </para><para>Over the coming months, we in the Labor Party will continually remind the people in Solomon of that statement. We will make sure that they are aware that, if they vote for David Tollner, they will be sending a man to Canberra who wants to increase the GST compliance and wants to make their cost of living even more difficult than it is now. Come election time, I feel very confident in the fact that Territorians will not vote for this person and will not re-elect this governmentâbecause this is a government that has ignored the concerns of Territorians over the last five years.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>25137</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTonight I would have liked to talk about all the initiatives for regional Australia that are in the budget. I would have liked to talk about the millions of dollars that are being spent on regional Australians and the huge number of initiatives for regional Australians that are in the budget. Unfortunately, there is nothing to talk about. In fact, it was confirmed at estimates by officers from the Department of Transport and Regional Services, particularly the regional services division, that there were no new initiatives in regional services in this budget. At the time a number of us wondered why that was soâbecause this is a pre-election budget. It occurred to me that perhaps there might be an announcement or a package in relation to regional Australiaâand, lo and behold, we had statements by Minister Anderson at the New South Wales National Party conference about a billion dollars worth of funding for a package for regional Australia.</para></talk.start><para>I noticed Minister Anderson was asked today in the other place where the billion dollars was going to come from and was unable to indicate where the money was going to come from.

In the next couple of days I will be able to describe the process by which we managed to get Senator Ian Macdonald to honour a commitment that the government gave that the estimates would go on. But that is another story. I will give an edited list of highlights of the experience of being in Senate estimates with Senator Ian Macdonald. I have to say that Senator Ian Macdonald has a reputation for probably being the rudest minister in the government, closely followed by Senator Alstonâbut at least you can have a bit of a laugh with Senator Alston, despite his being mentioned at great length in the Shane Stone memo. I understand that the term `doing an Alston' is very close to becoming as much a part of the vernacular as `never, ever GST' and `core and non-core promises'.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Macdonald treats estimates with absolute contempt. Along with most of my colleagues, I have been to virtually every Senate estimates committee with every minister and have had no problems at all, except with him. I suspect that we are not the only people who have problems; there are a number of people on the other side who have problems with him as well. I believe that contributes to the fact that he is facetiously known around the chamber, particularly on the other side, as the `popular minister for regional services'. That is a bit akin to Australians with red hair being called `Bluey'. Senator Kemp, who is quite amusingâhe is a bit underestimatedâmakes a great play of talking about `the popular minister for regional services'. </para><para>Before I get into the substance, I would like to relate an anecdote about Senate estimates that unfortunately did not appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. At one stage in the very tortuous rural and regional Senate estimates, Senator Macdonald moved all of his public servants from one side of the table to the other side of the tableâfrom one side of him to the other side of him. A number of us who were sitting thereâSenator O'Brien might have been thereâwere thinking: `Why on earth would anybody want to do that?' But that sort of aberrant behaviour is pretty much par for the course. We scratched our heads a bit, we did not worry about it, and off we went. </para><para>When we resumed on Tuesday of last week, Senator Macdonald made a statement to the estimates committee that he was concerned that Labor Party staffers were sitting close to him, listening to his conversations between his public servants and himself, and that, if members of the committee were aware of any Labor Party staffers, they should be moved. This caused great consternation to my staffer, who fortunately was sitting right up the back, at the other side. I thought this was very strange behaviour, and one may be entitled to regard it as a touch paranoidâjust a touch! </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>âJust slightlyâthat is right. Let me now take the Senate on a journey through estimates with Senator Ian Macdonald. We start off with a series of questions that the opposition wished to ask in relation to floods. The floods programs, which I know Senator Boswell is very much aware of, are jointly administered between AFFA and the Department of Transport and Regional Services. It is in the AFFA PBS; it is also in the regional services PBS. We organised, with the permission of the committee, to have an officer from AFFA there when we were questioning them in relation to the flood packages. I think the officer was Dr Samson. I will read the following interchange. Dr Samson did the right thing: he gave up his evening to come along to assist the committee in relation to a series of questions on floods.

Let me reiterate what happened. Senator Macdonald offered the CLP candidate for Lingiari, Mr Ron Kelly, a trip up to Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands with Senator Tambling on a RAAF flight in May 2001. This caused a bit of consternation. The addition of Mr Kelly to Senator Macdonald's entourage caused an additional trip between the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island, because a RAAF staffer had to remain behind on the Cocos Islands while the entourage flew to Christmas Island. The plane then had to go back to the Cocos Islands to pick up the staff member and take him to Christmas Island. The RAAF flights are costed at approximately $3,000 per hour, so the cost to the taxpayer of this extra legâgiving Ron Kelly a bit of a leg-up in Lingiariâwas in the vicinity of $12,000, and the whole trip has been estimated conservatively at about $20,000. We thought we would ask Senator Macdonald what happened in relation to this trip.

I asked Senator Macdonald whether he had seen Mr Ron Kelly wandering around, given that he had got a lift with him and so on. I am advised by my colleague Senator Crossin that the plane lands on West Island in the Cocos Islands, which has a population of around 50. I continue to quote the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Senator Ian Macdonaldâ ...

It went on and on. We then asked a question about the national competition policy. It is probably the last anecdote I am going to be able to tell. This minister gave a speech to the LGAQ at the Gold Coast on 30 August last year, in which he indicated in response to a question on national competition policy from a councillor from Mount Isa, inter alia:</para><quote><para>... there are also exceptions to National Competition Policy ... which you'd be aware of.

But can work within the rule books to overcome some of the more draconian impacts of the National Competition Policy. So we'll continue to do that ... I do also support as a general policy, National Competition Policy.</para></quote><para>I then asked the minister what the avenues were, and he had to take it on notice. He did not know what the answers were.</para><para>Finally, Senator Macdonald in the Senate yesterday indicated that I asked a very stupid question at estimates. He said that I had asked how much flood recovery money had gone to Minister Anderson's seat and Mr St Clair's seat. Senator Macdonald then went on to say that the bureaucrat was very embarrassed and said something like, `Well, it's where the floods were.' I never asked that question. That is the reality. The question we asked was about the interstate distribution of flood relief.</para><para>In conclusion, it is no wonder that, when the Prime Minister was trawling around the Queensland Liberal Party, trying to find somebody good enough to put in cabinet, he overlooked poor old Senator Macdonald. The second most disappointed person in Australia was me. The Labor Party would have been absolutely delighted to have a minister of this level of competence in a coalition cabinet. I urge you, Senator Boswell, to try and get the Prime Minister to reconsider this decision and to give Minister Macdonald the leg-up that he deserves.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>25142</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1304">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002</inline> and related bills. The Howard government's budget delivered in May is the result of five years of this government's responsible economic management. It is a budget that builds a stronger Australia. It begins the largest defence modernisation and upgrade program in more than 25 years, which is long overdue, it strengthens our borders in the fight against plant and animal disease and it overhauls the operation of our social welfare system, also long overdue. It invests in our health system, in our natural environment and in our most important resource of all, our people. One of the budget's greatest features is the measures to benefit older Australians, the people who have contributed over time to the many benefits that every Australian today enjoys. Sixty billion dollars worth of Labor's $80 billion legacy of debt has been repaid, and this has created interest repayment savings of more than $4 billion a year. This is a very significant achievement and one which has become the hallmark of the responsible financial management of this government.</para></talk.start><para>Tonight, I would like to focus attention on a successful initiative which will continue to be funded in the Howard government's fifth budget, and that is diversionary schemes put in place in the Northern Territory designed to steer young people away from crime. The issue of diversionary schemes came to the fore during the deliberations about mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory and in Western Australia. It stands to reason that mandatory sentencing has the potential for very disproportionate outcomes for offenders. While there may be some instances where very trivial cases may have been inappropriately punished, evidence given to last year's Senate inquiry showed the contrary in many of the cases that came before the Western Australian and Northern Territory courts.</para><para>The evidence showed that a first time offender in the Northern Territory is charged with an average of five property offences, and a second time offender on a sentencing occasion is charged with an average of eight property offences. It may happen, albeit perhaps rarely, that someone who appears to be charged with something very trivial has no other antecedents in their background and is really a genuine first time offender.</para><para>The human face of mandatory sentencing came to the fore following the much publicised and tragic death of the young Aboriginal Johnno in the Don Dale Detention Centre. While this young boy was in the Don Dale Detention Centre, he found himself alone and without any family support at all. He was an orphan, and any connection he had to anyone close to him had evaporated with the death of an aunt at the time the boy was in the centre. Something to note, however, is that the community in which this boy lived had preferred the charges against him, and he in fact had a number of charges against him at the time he was sentenced. There was a report that the boy was a repeat offender, having had some 20 or more brushes with the law at the time of the sentencing. The saddest thing of all is that the record shows that, when the magistrate was about to sentence Johnno, he asked whether there was anyone who could vouch for the boy's character or anyone into whose care the boy could be committed, and there was no-one. This boy was about as alone as you could be.</para><para>A diversionary program for such an individual would be very difficult to put in place, but what is a community to do with an habitual offender who is really not much older than a boy? At the time there was a lot of criticism about mandatory sentencing and precious little about how there could be better programs and better ways to stop kids getting on the treadmill that would lead to life of crime and a life in jail. It is a very serious issue. What are other citizens and communities to do if they have someone running amok in their community? What are the alternatives? The government's response at the height of the mandatory sentencing debate was to promptly assess diversionary programs, properly resource them and look at models that might be more effective in dealing with this very difficult problem.</para><para>We cannot afford to have a poverty of ideas in dealing with indigenous issues such as the impact of mandatory sentencing laws, in particular in the Northern Territory. We should not discount for one moment the ability of indigenous communities to identify their own problems and come up with their own solutions if given the right assistance. Diversionary programs are right at the coalface of juvenile justice systems in most rehabilitative models, and it is important that these diversionary programs be put in place and that they be allowed to both develop and prosper. They play a very important role in ensuring that young offenders do not get irrevocably locked into the court system and that better options can be canvassed on their behalf.</para><para>The Commonwealth last year provided $20 million over four years to the Northern Territory to divert juveniles from the criminal justice system and to jointly fund an Aboriginal interpreter service. Both aspects of the program are having a marked impact on young people apprehended for offending and on Aboriginal people's contact with legal and health services. This is an example of the dedicated effort towards enhancing and improving the scope and outcome of diversionary programs, particularly in the Northern Territory. During consideration of the <inline ref="S226">Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999</inline> in the Senate last year, I acknowledged that, while a repeal of all legislation imposing mandatory sentencing on juveniles and young adults may have been an optimal outcome, more constructive and sustainable outcomes would be achieved by collaborative effort between state, territory and Commonwealth governments towards diverting young offenders away from the system. Indeed, that collaboration bore fruit.</para><para>However, getting diversionary programs up and running does pose unique problems in the Northern Territory. There are distinct differences between putting in place a diversionary program in the Northern Territory and putting one in place in the suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane. The Northern Territory has very scattered populations, and by their nature indigenous communities are themselves scattered. Therefore, it is often difficult to have a diversionary program that is actually going to work to the benefit of a young offender and to the benefit of a community. The difficulties of designing appropriate diversionary programs are magnified, as one size simply does not fit all. The programs can be implemented only if there are trained counsellors who go out to the communities, make the assessments and work through a problem with community leaders to find a model that actually works and will receive community acceptance.</para><para>A lot of problems of course are with indigenous young people, and some of the crime being dealt with is against other indigenous persons. Logically enough, each program has to be individually tailored to meet the needs of those people in remote communities, including available facilities and the social dynamics of each community. Such programs can only succeed if there is community support. It is important to involve those communities in the delivery of programs to ensure ownership and acceptance of the government's efforts, and that communities be assisted to develop self-generated initiatives to deal with indigenous juvenile offenders.</para><para>Obviously these programs have the potential to meet the needs of young offenders, their communities and the victims. They need to be properly resourced and developed. During the mandatory sentencing inquiry in the Northern Territory, for instance, the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee was told about programs run by indigenous elders who took their young folk out of harm's way into the bush and taught them both life skills and Aboriginal skills. For seven years, the Walpiri elder Mr Johnny Miller had provided a desert camp or clinic to wean petrol sniffers off their dreadful addiction. That is of course all about connection with culture, pride in who you are and self-respect.</para><para>The additional challenge is to break the cycle of idleness through lack of education, employment opportunities and initiative. The challenge provides the potential for partnerships to be forged between government, the private sector and Aboriginal communities to identify and address these problems. These discussions are the genesis of the undeniably successful diversionary programs this government put in place last year in collaboration with the Northern Territory government. Indeed, the Western Australian and Northern Territory governments should be further encouraged to build on these approaches to sentencing and diversion and to consider other models of rehabilitative justice for juveniles that will both meet the community need for and expectation of deterrence.</para><para>During consideration of the mandatory sentencing laws, the government senators' dissenting report recommended diversionary programs be expanded to extend to 17-year-olds and multiple offenders. Concerns raised by members and senators about the impact on juveniles of the Northern Territory's mandatory sentencing laws were an important factor leading to the decision by the Commonwealth to establish the juvenile detention program in conjunction with the Northern Territory government.</para><para>I am pleased to advise the Senate tonight that the early figures available appear to be very encouraging indeed. During the first nine months of the agreement, until 31 May this year, 1,059 cases, or 81 per cent, that came to the attention of the police were offered diversion and 1,043 cases actually undertook diversionâthat is 80 per cent. Of the total of 1,059 cases, 56 per cent were in fact indigenous cases and 80 per cent of those were offered diversion; 572 casesâor 44 per centâwere non-indigenous cases, of which 83 per cent were offered diversion; 20 per cent of total cases were minor offences and were dealt with mainly by way of verbal or written warnings; 77 per cent of total cases were offered diversion at police discretion because they were much more serious offences; nearly 300 of total cases were dealt with by family conference or formal caution; and 57 undertook what has really come to be regarded as a very successful way to deal with these sort of offences, and that is victim-offender conferences.</para><para>Ninety-two registered programs have now been approved by the police as suitable for diversion and 100 organisations, committees and groups have been briefed or consulted by the Northern Territory police on this scheme. Training for police is already well under way, and last week I attended a briefing by some officers from the Northern Territory on their progress. Training is being conducted in victim-offender conferencing and in general diversion.</para><para>The Aboriginal Interpreter Service is another very good news story. It is an example of the success of the package implemented by this government. The service celebrated its first anniversary in April, and by 31 March 2001 it had 176 interpreters covering 104 languages on its registerâan excellent achievement in such a short time frame. The service has completed more than 1,000 referrals. On-site interpreter services have been introduced at the Royal Darwin Hospital to assist patients to communicate with their carers and an office has been established in Darwin to service clients in the Top End and another in Alice Springs to cover the Central Australia region.</para><para>So far, 142 aboriginal interpreters have undertaken training and 181 clients of the Australian Interpreter Service have been trained in effective use of interpreters. These clients include members of the judiciary, police, health professionals, lawyers and legal staffâit is a very comprehensive approach. The AIS has to accommodate significant cultural issues, such as the inability of some Aboriginal people to communicate with other members of their clan or skin group. In criminal cases, the AIS must obtain details about the victim, the alleged perpetrator, their families and the circumstances of the offence and thenâwith due regard for confidentialityâprogressively disclose those to a prospective interpreter before assigning the job. This is a very delicate balance.</para><para>So how does this scheme actually work? The agreement between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory, signed on 27 July 2000 and which came into effect on 21 September 2000, has two tracks: it needs to divert juveniles away from the criminal justice system and it seeks to alleviate the language barriers faced by Aboriginal people who encounter the criminal justice system. Police in the Northern Territory are required to divert a juvenile who has committed a minor offenceâthey are actually required to divert a minor offenderâand they have a discretion to provide diversion for a juvenile who has committed a more serious offence, such as unlawful entry.</para><para>Use of the courts is deemed appropriate only when the offence committed is of a more serious nature or when other options have simply failed to prevent reoffending. The principles of the scheme are: to treat young people fairly, to take into account the views of victims, to reduce youth crime, to support and involve victims in the process, to encourage parental responsibility, to foster closer police and community interaction, and to foster positive social change. The diversion scheme provides different levels of response, including verbal or written warnings, formal cautions and formal programsâsuch as family conferencing, substance and drug abuse programs and community based diversionary programs. It is a consensual process between the police and the offender and, if applicable, the offender's parents or guardians.</para><para>A juvenile can be given multiple warnings, cautions and diversions. A verbal or written warning is only appropriate when the offence is really trivial. If repeated verbal or written warnings are unsuccessful, a formal caution can be issued, with conditions if considered appropriate. Conditions can include, but are not limited to, working for the victim, restoration of damage, a written or verbal apology to the victim, restitution in whole or in part, an agreement not to associate with certain peers, an agreement to dispose of certain possessions, imposition of a curfew or imposition of family agreed conditions.</para><para>Consultation with key and relevant people within the communities, particularly Aboriginal people, is imperative in the development and operation of the community based and driven diversionary programs for juveniles. Juvenile diversion units provide the necessary expertise and support to police throughout the Northern Territory, particularly to remote police stations. Aboriginal community police officers within remote communities are utilised by these units to identify and supervise diversionary programs that suit both the individual and the community.</para><para>And the program is well funded. In the first year of the agreement, specific allocations are: $2.489 million to the Northern Territory police to set up the units and to conduct family conferencing and other diversionary measures; $1.338 million to design and purchase community based diversion programs; another half a million or so to cover 50 per cent of the recurrent costs of the Aboriginal Interpreter Service, including annual training; $250,000 for extra training of interpreters; and $400,000 for direct funding to the Northern Territory Aboriginal Legal Service to purchase interpreter services. Payment to the Northern Territory from 1 September 2000 to 30 April 2001 amounts to more than $2.3 million out of the $5 million allocated for the year to August 2001, $1.7 million has gone towards the juvenile pre court diversion scheme, and $0.6 million has gone to the Aboriginal Interpreter Service.</para><para>Of course, this is in addition to other government initiatives to deal with juvenile offenders Australia wide. The government recognises that dealing with juvenile offenders requires a variety of programs to support, rehabilitate and educate, as well as to deter, punish and meet community expectations for punishment. For this reason, the government funds a number of other programs which help to tackle juvenile crime in this way. For example, there is Commonwealth funding for programs aimed at preventing juveniles reoffending. These programs aim to reduce the marginalisation of young offenders from mainstream employment.</para><para>The Job Placement Education and Training Program, which is also an early intervention program, is designed to assist disadvantaged young people to overcome barriers which prevent them from getting jobs. The National Suicide Prevention Strategy maintains a significant focus on youth while expanding suicide prevention activity across the general population to include other age groups and those identified as being at high risk, such as those in rural and indigenous communities, older people, those with a mental illness, those with substance abuse problems and prisoners. The Young Offenders Pilot Program provides for intensive coordinated assistance for young offenders as they prepare to reintegrate into the community. National Crime Prevention Strategies for Young People assist young people by increasing awareness of underlying factors that affect youth crime. National Crime Prevention focuses on family and youth support through community education, skills development and models of integrated service delivery within local community settings. In addition, other national initiatives on priority areas such as fear of crime and motor vehicle theft have incorporated other initiatives. These are really just a few examples of the positive initiatives this government has funded through budget surpluses that are the result of sound economic management.</para><para>Aboriginal people need the usual things that every other Australian needs and expects. I do not mean to devalue them by listing them quickly. They include good health care, education, housing, employment and access to justice. In effect, it is the chance to live a full life and have hope for the future. In the coming financial year this government will demonstrate its ongoing commitment to reconciliation and reducing indigenous disadvantage with a boost to spending of more than $327 million for indigenous affairs.</para><para>In drafting the budget, the government has listened to the groundswell of opinion, including the views of some prominent indigenous leaders. They said dependency is continuing to have a devastating effect on indigenous communities. Breaking the cycle of welfare dependency and increasing self-reliance is a key aim of the budget with new initiatives in the key areas of housing, education and employment. I commend the bills.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>25146</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to conclude the debate on the <inline ref="R1304">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002</inline> and related bills. Traditionally the discussion on the appropriation bills is a wide-ranging one. Senators discuss issues that are of interest to them or close to their hearts. I take the opportunity of congratulating Senator Coonan on her sensitive, constructive and perceptive treatment of the issue that she discussed. I am especially pleased to be able to draw to a close the appropriation bills discussion this evening.</para></talk.start><para>Given that it is the Centenary of our Federation, chances are that this is in fact the 100th budget that this federal parliament has dealt with, albeit undoubtedly there have been a few mini budgets along the way and supplementary statements. Since that time, lots of things have happened, but it is good to see that we are starting the next century of fiscal management in this country on a sound footing. We did not finish the last century very well. Indeed, we had government debt and fiscal irresponsibility from a previous government. We have set about rectifying that. This budget has $1.5 billion in surplus, which is the fifth consecutive cash surplus. We have been able to reduce the net debt position of the Commonwealth government from about $80 billion down to about $37.7 billion. That is a significant improvement which means that, instead of wasting money on interest payments, we are able to spend more money on the sorts of services that Senator Coonan referred to and on some of the very exciting programs that we are developing for regional Australia.</para><para>As part of this budget strategy, we are often accused of being concerned about surpluses and finances. But the reason we are concerned about surpluses, finances and balancing the budget is all about intergener-ational responsibility: it is to ensure that the next generation of Australians do not have to pay for the profligacy of previous governments. Indeed, it is interesting to note that the former Labor government, with Mr Beazley as finance minister, wanted to talk the talk of surpluses. During the 1996 election they told the people of Australia that they were running a surplus. The reason they told the Australian people that was that they knew a surplus was good and socially just. But what they could not do was bring themselves to take the tough decisionsâno wonder, with Mr Beazley as finance minister. He would never be able to make a tough decision. As a result, instead of a surplus, as Mr Beazley had promised, we were left with a $10.3 billion deficit. That was the fiscal mess with which we, as an incoming government, were faced. As a result of sound economic policy, we have now delivered some very good outcomes: lower interest rates, lower inflation, lower unemployment.

If I need to, I will remind the Australian Labor Party that, whilst Mr Beazley was the minister for employment, he presided over one million Australians on the unemployment scrap heap. In contradistinction to that, we have created 820,000 new jobs. That is the best social welfare policy that any government can deliver: jobs for Australians. On the jobs front, we have heard from the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union that we have somehow cost jobs. They are running a TV campaign about this. It is a pity that they were not so motivated when the former Prime Minister Mr Keating explained to the Australian people that Labor Senator George Campbell was responsible for the loss of 100,000 manufacturing jobs. Isn't it a pity that the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union did not want to get the compulsorily collected union fees to run a TV campaign on that? It is no wonder why.

But my understanding from Senator Mackay is that her understanding of the bush is that green thing that grows out of the concrete circle in her front yard. She would have no idea what the bush in relation to regional Australia actually means. She thinks the bush is something that you take the clippers to once a year, when in fact the bush is an area of Australia where hundreds of thousands of Australians are now benefiting from our policies. Whereas the Australian Labor Party, because of their economic mismanagement, had to close down hundreds of post offices around this country, we have been reintroducing post offices around this country. </para><para>We have also introduced regional transaction centres. In my own home state of Tasmania we have established 63 online access centres, with the 64th to come online very shortly. We have the Medicare Easy Claim and the Roads to Recovery program. The sorts of programs we are delivering such as the Regional Solutions Program and the regional health programs are all being funded out of the budget in surplus, out of a soundly managed economy. The reason we have this money and the reason we are able to put facilities and services back into the bush, into the regional and rural areas of Australia, is that we have been able to crack Labor's debt and we have been able to pay it off. Instead of paying interest, $4 billion worth of extra money is now available to the Australian people to pay for services of this nature. </para><para>Throughout the debate, there has also been some concern expressed about taxation reform.

Nevertheless, he has indicated that over the last 12 monthsâthe first 12 months of tax reformâprices, including the price increase as a result of the goods and services tax, have gone up by about six per cent. But the interesting point Mr Murphy makes is that pensions during that time have gone up by 8.1 per cent; in other words, pensioners are 2.1 per cent ahead of the mark than before tax reform. He also tells us that workers on an average income of about $40,000 are about 8.2 per cent ahead of the mark; in other words, 2.2 per cent better off than they were a year ago. And guess what? The only people that he could find who were worse off were those poor souls that have to make do on an income of $213,000 or more. These are the people that the Australian Labor Party are defending. They say tax reform has hurt the struggling Australian. The facts and figures now show indisputably that pensioners are better off and they also show that the average worker is better off. The only ones that are not better off, whom the Australian Labor Party are defending, are those on an income of $213,000 plus.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, your party to its great credit, albeit there were some recidivists in your party, gave support for the important fundamental of tax reform. We have this ridiculous debate going on in the community at the moment and, indeed, ridiculous polls being done by certain newspapers saying, `Do you support the GST?' Take the tip, Mr Acting Deputy President, if the question was: do you support wholesale sales tax; do you support fuel excise; do you support income tax; do you support any tax whatsoeverâthe overwhelming population would say, `Of course we don't.' But, above all, one thing that the Australian people do not support and will not support is tax increases. We have Senator Conroy to thank for putting that fairly and squarely back into the public arena and the public debate, because we know that, if there were to be a $4 billion roll-back, it would mean a one per cent increase in interest rates. That would have a horrendous effect on all those home owners who are trying to buy their own homes. Not only would they be taxed more under a Labor government; they would also suffer the consequences of higher interest rates on their house mortgages, on their credit cards and on hire purchase payments.</para><para>The chance of a Labor government being inflicted on this country unfortunately cannot be dismissed at this stage. However, I hope for the sake of Australia that a Labor government is never inflicted. Another example of the policy hypocrisy of the Australia Labor Party is to be found in the area of education funding. They rant and rave against the non-government sector, but what does their leadership do? What do people like Mr Keating, Mr Hawke, Mr Crean and Mr Beazley do for their children?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name></talker><para>âThey send them all to private schools.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>âIndeed, Senator Coonan, you are right: they send them to private schools. But they are the ones on the big, fat parliamentary salaries or pensions so they can afford to do that. What about the struggling workers of this country who want to exercise the same sort of choice that Messrs Hawke, Beazley, Crean and Keating exercised for their children? They would deny that right of choice to those parents and families who cannot afford it because they do not enjoy the sort of incomes that these Labor luminaries enjoy. Indeed, it is a very interesting statistic that 25 per cent of families which have a household income of $26,000 or less send their children to a non-government school. That shows that people on lower incomes want to have the choice of education and make huge sacrifices for the benefit of their children. We as a government believing in social justice say, `If you want to exercise the sorts of choices that the rich people in the community can exercise, we will assist you in that.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>Turning to state schools, having been educated through the state system, let me say that I am very supportive of it and indebted to it. Therefore, I have always followed the education debate very closely and the figures are great. Not only has this government spent more on the non-government sector, it has also upheld the funding for state governments, and it has increased funding for state government schools. Guess why they are called state government schoolsâit is because they are a state government responsibility. The Australian Labor Party continually ignores that. </para><para>In my home state of Tasmania, time after time, I have been at openings of redevelopments. One classic that stands in my mind was in the township of Sheffield in the Lyons electorate which very shortly will be represented by the very good candidate for the Liberal Party by the name of Geoff Page. There was a $1 million plus project at that school. The federal government threw in $800,000, the local government threw in $400,000 and the state government threw in $40,000, but the state Labor government was there with bells on for the joint opening. In the past year, the federal government contributions to state schools have been substantially higher in capital expenditure than those of the state Labor government. However, the Australian Education Union then jumps into bed with the minister and puts out propaganda attacking federal funding while of course ignoring completely the fact that the state Labor government has made no commitment to the sort of substantial increases that we have made as a federal Liberal government.</para><para>This is a socially just government and we deliver social justice through sound economic management. We do not pursue sound economic management as some theory to be pursued. We pursue it as part of our philosophy of delivering a better country and a better society. The way to do that is to live within your means and to stop paying all this outrageous interest for debts that were racked up by the profligacy of previous governments. We have paid off that debt and we can now spend the money for the benefit of the Australian people.

That crisis does not have to do with World War III and it does not even have anything to do with the AIDS virus which is sweeping the African continent significantly. It has to do with the certain predictability about energy. I do not mean personal or physical energy related to homo sapiens; I mean energy generated from fuel and those fuels are the ones we refer to generically as diesel, coal, gas, nuclearâthere, I have said that wordâand wind, solar or tidal. These are the renewables. One thing that is certain is that it is by no means certain which collection of those energies are the best to prevent a brownout or the electricity restrictions that happened in California recently, a state in America composed of 38 million people, and one that is fast approaching the second biggest economy in the world after its parent country, the USA.</para></talk.start><para>If we are to continue as a country that has a high standard of living, with enviable records with respect to per capita home ownership, per capita car ownership, televisions per household, the number of children who receive a tertiary education and the number of people in constant employment, we need to ensure that Australia is energy efficient and energy sufficient. You will recall, no doubt, Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, the crisis that faced the world during the mid-seventies, when the price of oil approached or exceeded $US40 a barrel. Whilst, at that time, that was not as destructive to Australia as it could have been, given that the Australian dollar at the time was worth $US1.20âas I have said, it may have exceeded itâtoday is a different case. When the price of oil reached $US37 a barrel last year, that was a different case for Australia. The price of oil per barrel in Australia dollars was almost double that. Today, we face a similar crisis in the looming northern winter. America, the biggest consumer of oil in the world, and obviously by far the biggest per capita consumer of oil in the world, could trigger in Australia something that happened in America.</para><para>If we become efficient in electricity generation, it needs to be based, in my belief, on several areas. First, it cannot be based on dieselâit is too expensive; it is not acceptable, because it is a greenhouse gas emitter; and it is not acceptable because the particulates that it emits are carcinogenic and cause respiratory problems, particularly in concentrated areas of our capital cities. It cannot be coalâcoal is in the same category as diesel but has the added disadvantage of despoiling a greater area of land than diesel destroys, even when you include the areas throughout the world that oil refineries take up. For example, compare a 1,400-megawatt power plant driven by coal with a 1,400-megawatt power plant driven by, say, nuclear power, of which there are many throughout the world. Three and a half million tonnes of average grade coal would be used to drive the 1,400-megawatt power plant, and that would create a despoiled area of 450 hectares. By comparison, with a 1,400-megawatt nuclear driven power station, the despoiled area would be practically zero. It would create not vast dumps of spoil, but a spoil of perhaps one square metre of medium to high level nuclear waste, as opposed to 450 hectares for coal.</para><para>Australia, as most people who are interested in energy and the future of their country know, happens to have the biggest deposit of mineable uranium in the world. People who have an interest in the future of this country, unlike Senator Conroy, refer to us as the Saudi Arabia of uranium. Saudi Arabia, of course, has the biggest recoverable reserves of oil in the world. Australia has a similar percentage of recoverable uranium.</para><para>Let me finish with some other renewables, and I speak particularly of wind, solar and tidal. The previous Western Australian government almost completed a wind farm down in Albany in Western Australia during its tenure. It is to the great credit of the previous Western Australian government that it was prepared to increase considerably the cost of power to the government. Electricity generation in Western Australia is still owned by the government. The cost of the wind turbines will be about 45c a kilowatt hour. If we actually had to pay 45c a kilowatt hour for wind power, I do not think that anyone would want it. The fact is that it is dropped down to householders at about 12.5c a kilowatt hour because of the subsidy. But it makes Albany less dependent on fossil fuel for its power than any other similar major regional centre in Australia. That is a great innovation for a government to do that, because it is spread across perhaps a million or more electricity consumers in Western Australia.</para><para>As for solar power, yes, solar arrays are very good. They are obviously very expensive to install, but once installed they could last for decades. But the fact is that the sun does not shine at nightâat least, it does not shine in Western Australia at night. It might shine at night somewhere in the world, and let us hope that it doesâlet us hope that we do not have a nuclear winter.</para><para>As for tidal power, I was rather disconcerted when the Western Australian government refused to proceed, even with the generosity of a grant from the Australian Greenhouse Office, to get the tidal power station going in Derby in Western Australia. It was about a 40-megawatt power station, but it could certainly have supplied the needs of Broome, Derby and other areas in the West Kimberley. That was a pity, and history will bear that out. Where do we go if we want a major secondary industry? Gas certainly is the greatest option that we have. It is cheap and efficient. It has only half the emissions that diesel has. The capital cost of installing it is less than one-quarter of a nuclear plant. It is less than half that of a diesel plant and about half that of a coal-fired power station.</para><para>Secondary industry of course is necessary for the employment of youth, youth that prefers not to or cannot for one reason or another go to the professions. If we did have cheap power here in Australiaâand I speak particularly of Western Australia although not exclusivelyâthen we would not be proposing to send 500 million tonnes of alumina powder, generated from over a million tonnes of bauxite from Western Australia, to Mozambique where it is converted into aluminium metal. Sometimes the aluminium metal is referred to as `silver electricity', because that is all it is: it takes only power to reduce it. About four tonnes of bauxite produces slightly less than two tonnes of alumina powder, and two tonnes of alumina powder produces slightly less than one tonne of aluminium. Five hundred million tonnes is going to Mozambique for the simple reason that they have cheap electricity. What all governments might concentrate on is cheap electricity of whatever type we can afford and whatever is acceptable to the people and to our international obligations.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australia Post: Workplace Health and Safety Practices</title><page.no>25151</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Andrew (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Bartlett)</inline>âSenator Conroy.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âIs this going to be the tax policy?</para></talk.start></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>25151</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is going to be a discussion about a recent case before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.

No ministers of this government would never verbal me!</para><para>I want to raise a couple more cases which I would like the commissioner and Australia Post to examine. The first case is Mrs Pamela Row, a mail officer on night shift at the Dandenong Letter Centre. Mrs Rowe injured her back at work on 24 May 2001. She was taken to South Eastern Hospital where as a result of her injury she was required to be admitted for four days. However, due to financial and personal reasons she could not afford to be away from work, so under duress was allowed to leave hospital on the condition that if she could not manage with her injury she was to return. Mrs Rowe was given a medical certificate from the South Eastern Hospital stating that she was unfit to work from 24 to 31 May 2001. However, Mrs Rowe returned to her workplace that same night to fill out forms and organise the collection of her car. On 25 May 2001 Mrs Rowe made an appointment with her treating doctor, who agreed with the medical certificate from South Eastern Hospital. On the same date Mrs Rowe was sent for a `fitness for duty' assessment with the FND, Dr Vj. The FND agreed with the diagnosis of the medical certificate from the hospital. However, the FND advised Mrs Rowe that she would return her to work earlier than her hospital certificate indicated and that Mrs Rowe was to come back and see her again on Monday, 28 May 2001.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESID-ENT</name></talker><para>âSenator Conroy, are you reading your speech, which is contrary to standard orders, or are you referring to copious notes?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âI am actually just referring to some dot points. They genuinely are dot points. I thank you for the opportunity to explain that to the chamber. Mrs Rowe went back to work on Monday, 28 May 2001 and continued to work in pain until Tuesday, 29 May 2001, when the pain was so bad that she was crying and had to go straight back to her treating doctor. On 12 June 2001 Mrs Rowe was required to see an FND again. She refused to see Dr Vj, who had already sent her back to work, so she was sent to FND Dr Lam instead. The FND phoned her doctor without her authorisation. He just picked up the phone and actually phoned her doctor whilst she was in the room. When the FND got off the phone he advised Mrs Rowe that her doctor had cleared her to go back to work. He then contacted her workplace to advise the same. Mrs Rowe has a witness to this conversation. Mrs Rowe then arranged for an appointment with her treating doctor to discuss why he had changed his original medical certificate that she was unfit for work. Her treating doctor was furious and said that he had not changed his medical certificate and that his instructions remained as they were. Mrs Pamela Rowe's doctor has signed a stat dec to that effect. It reads:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>This is to certify that Mrs Rowe suffers from lumbar spine instability. Dr Lam rang me on June 12th, 2001 and stated she was fit to start modified duties. I didn't agree that she was fit to do modified duties on his instructions and restrictions. She was in a lot of pain and she was unfit to do any duties. I issued a certificate stating that she was unfit for all duties.</para></quote><para>You have to immediately call into question a number of facts in this issue. Did the doctor actually phone her consulting doctor without her permission to discuss a medical condition? At what point is this allowed? At what point is permission given for any doctor just to phone another doctor and have a casual chat or otherwise about the medical conditions of a patient? I do not believe that this comes within any laws or any enterprise bargain that is allowed. No permission was given.</para><para>It is disappointing to see that this in actual fact is not the first case, and I would like to now talk about Raymond Jarratt, a postal delivery officer from the Cobram Post Office. He injured his back at work on 16 June 2001, he attended his own treating doctor on 18 June 2001 and he was given an incapacity certificate until 21 June 2001. On 19 June 2001 Clarissa Van Staden, an Australia Post administration officer, contacted Mr Jarratt's treating doctorâagain, without Mr Jarratt's authorisation. Immediately following this, Mr Jarratt was contacted at 3.30 p.m. by his postal manager and advised that his doctor had cleared him to return to work for half an hour. He was then requested to attend his workplace immediatelyâthis despite his normal working hours being from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. </para><para>Mr Jarratt then contacted a union official for assistance and was advised to follow his doctor's medical certificate in the absence of having his original certificate replaced by an altered one. He was also advised to leave the matter at that. On 21 June 2001, at the advice of his union, Mr Jarratt contacted his doctor to ask him if he had in fact spoken to Australia Post without authorisation and verbally returned him back to work. The doctor confirmed that he had and apologised for doing so, stating that he had done so because he was asked to. </para><para>We have a situation here which Australia Post will need to clarify. Do they believe that they have the legal authority to just phone somebody's doctor, without the permission of the individual whose medical situation is in discussion, and put pressure on that doctor to return the individual to work? I do not believe so. I do not believe it is in keeping with doctors' ethical standards. I certainly do not believe it is in keeping with Australia Post's ethical standards, and I would ask Australia Post to consider their actions.</para><para>I welcome the opportunity to correct the record. I welcome the invitation by Australia Post's representative before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission saying, `Contact Senator Conroy's office and he will tell you his view.' I look forward to the phone call from Commissioner Blair when I will set him straight. I still have concerns about Australia Post's practices in rehabilitation, and I will continue to raise matters in the parliament where I believe Australia Post's conduct is unethical.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Tax Effective Schemes </title><page.no>25153</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>25153</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhile not on the Senate Economics References Committee, I have attended a number of its meetings in my capacity as a participating member of the inquiry into mass marketed tax effective schemes. I have therefore had the opportunity to read the committee's report on such schemes that Senator Murphy tabled in the Senate yesterday. Time and time again, reports conveniently minimise the significance of established tax law and play sympathetically to the duped investors who fall hook, line and sinker to the fast talking promotersâindeed, I think one investor admitted to participating in six different mass marketed schemes.</para></talk.start><para>Had the promoters of these schemesâbe they highly regarded QCs, tax lawyers and accountantsâcommitted their views in a corporation prospectus, they would certainly now be serving a jail term or have a severely diminished bank account because of false or misleading information. Such promoters, steeped in an understanding of tax laws, fully understand the basics of the self-assessment system and know the limitations of the private binding rulings arrangements. Private rulings apply to a taxpayer who has made an application to the tax office outlining in detail a proposal. If successful, the ruling has restricted application to that taxpayer, usually within a definite time frame so long as the taxpayer rigidly conforms to the processes, procedures and structures outlined in the application.</para><para>While in the past some taxpayers have shopped around a number of ATO officers for a more favourable ruling than one granted in another tax office, nowadays the tax office generally has greater centralised control over the ruling system so that this practice is minimised. Having secured a favourable private ruling, these arrangements have been promoted by promoters as though they were public rulings, often in a different environment with structures not even identical to that outlined in the private ruling. To say that this tax office advice is legitimate defies logic and must border on criminal intent. I suspect there is criminal intent, because a large number of the promoted schemes are disguised to defraud the tax system and, in the process, dupe ordinary taxpayers.</para><para>Attacks on the tax office inevitably attract a great deal of media attention. I agree with part of the submission from Van Ezk Capital, when they stated that it is essential that both the promoters and their financial advisers and experts be embraced within the proscriptions and subsequent penalties from the tax office. Perhaps the ATO could utilise some of its litigation resources with a test case against the real culpritsâthat is, the promoters, et cetera.</para><para>Yesterday's report is another unfortunate instance of reporting in a manner that undermines public confidence in the integrity of the Australian Taxation Office. For example, how does, as suggested in the report, the tax office distinguish between innocent and guilty victims in the mass marketed tax investment schemes? The committee appears to favour subjective outcomes which I suggest will lead to inequitable outcomes. A further problem is that the committee wishes to ameliorate the penalties for those in mass marketed arrangements but is silent on the smaller arrangements in similar environments where the numbers are low. This therefore will lead to a situation where not all taxpayers within the system will be treated equitably.</para><para>A major inequity arises from suggestions outlined in the report that some will pay the full penalty while others in similar circumstances may escape the full rigours of the law. Where is tax justice? I do not think the report will really help to overcome a very difficult situation, because it fails to adequately acknowledge the repeated warnings that from time to time have been issued by the tax office. If we go to March 1999, for example, the Nat 99/16 media release warned of other cases of tax planners using private binding rulings or advance opinions as tax marketing tools. Obviously that was not in the forestry type of scheme, but the message from the tax office was still there.</para><para>A year earlier, Peter Smith of the Australian Tax Office, speaking at the Australian Tax and Management Authority's workshop, outlined action taken by the ATO in relation to taxpayers refusing or withdrawing 5,000 section 221D variationsâand these were among six other ATO initiatives. As we all know, only sophisticated people who are schooled in advanced tax law know about how these 221D variations work and their implications. These are just a few of the signals that have been put out by the tax office.</para><para>But investors must take some responsibility for their involvement. The law speaks of a `reasonable and prudent person' test. Lawyers know of this; tax planners know of this. But when there are situations where the tax saving far outweighs the outlay, where the investor stands to profit even if the venture is a failure, where the outlay is funded by a tax refund or a tax reduced instalment, where there is no asset acquired other than a potential right, or where the investor has no ability to remove a management company, then I would think a `reasonable and prudent person', in looking at a situation involving two of the above, would expect to lose a legitimate tax deduction.</para><para>But promotersâand I am just going through a whole lot of signals of which I think people should be awareâshould also be aware of much of what I would call the established case law. I will just go back to the Spotless Services case which describes the shape of a transactionâ(1991) ATC 4950, 1991, 22 ATR 613, 1991âwhen, if an investor has the ability to exit an investment scheme early after its first deductions have been claimed but before any income is received, the ATO may argue that the investor entered into the scheme, at least in part, with a purpose other than the derivation of assessable income and, if this is the case, the tax deduction may be denied.</para><para>These are all different areas where tax planners steeped in tax law really should have known and understood the law, and they should feel the full force of the law against them because of the way they roped in so-called innocent people. Were not these promoters aware of part IVA, the anti-avoidance provisionsâgrossly excessive fees, inflation or artificial creation of deductions, round robin investments, and non-recourse loans? These are but a few of the issues leading any revenue agency to doubt deductibility under the general anti-avoidance provisions.</para><para>While I trust that reasonable outcomes will prevail, I also trust that future reports of this nature from the Senate will be much more balanced and less emotional and that they will convey the ATO's position in a better climate. For example, chapter 1 of the report states:</para><quote><para>... the Commonwealth believes that the evidence received raises rather serious questions of the appropriateness and fairness of the ATO's approach.</para></quote><para>That is pretty emotional language. I would suggest that, for a proper reading, the word `impact' should replace the words `appropriateness and fairness'. I make that suggestion because there is a very subjective judgment coming from the committee, whereas really we are talking about the impact of these changes on 65,000 taxpayers. It appears that where enough people are involved there is a lot of sympathy; if there are few people involved, those few people feel the full rigour of the law and are of no concern to the committee.</para><para>I look forward to the next report, where the committee intends to examine whether legislative change is required to prevent the tax system from being exploited in this way in future and what sanctions should be developed against persons who seek to promote such tax avoidance schemes. I hope that these sorts of things will at least be addressed in the next report but, again, we will be left with them for a few months as they now are. Unfortunately, in its concluding remarks the committee uses some further emotional language in signalling that there are `serious faults' in the self-assessment system. We are given no indication of where these `serious faults' lie. So perhaps the next report willâbut I hope it will notâbe a repeat of the first report, which I believe undermines the integrity of the Australian tax system. And I mention that it was the party of the chairman of this committee that introduced the concept of the self-assessment system. I look forward to a fairer report next time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</title><page.no>25155</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>25155</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to inform the Senate that the ALP and the Democrats are delaying millions of dollars going to schools and universities by not allowing the passage of the <inline ref="R1282">Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline> during this sitting week. It is a bill that will start a major transformation in innovation in this country and set our nation up as a leader in development and training. Instead of debating this bill in the Senate and allowing its quick return to the House of Representatives, the ALP and the Democrats combined to force this bill to a committee, and they have combined to put back the reporting date of the legislation to 28 June. So the chances of this legislation being passed during this financial year have now probably disappeared.</para></talk.start><para>One of the major architects of this block is Senator Lyn Allison, the Democrat education spokesperson, who insisted on an extra hearing of evidence from the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs last Mondayâand then did not even bother to turn up to ask any questions. What humbug! As a result, money for eligible schools and tertiary institutions will now be delayed, and the considerable amount of planning needed for both sectors for next year is now under a cloud. It is an absolute disgrace that this delay should be going on, particularly when Labor say that they are committed to something called Knowledge Nation. I am not too sure what that is yet, but we assume that anyone who had such a commitment would not be impeding the passage of this bill. The delay really shows that education is, to Labor, just all smoke and mirrors; they show that they certainly are not serious by bringing on this delay.</para><para>Tonight I would like to explain exactly what this bill does and displace some of Labor's myths by showing how schools and tertiary institutions will benefit from its passage. The federal government's $2.9 billion innovation action plan, Backing Australia's Ability, is aimed at keeping our universities at the leading edge of innovation and research. We have some of the best research bodies in the world, and the government wants this beneficial work to continue with additional support. It is widely recognised that innovation will be a key to economic growth in the 21st century. This bill is a very important part of implementing a strategy to support those innovations that will see Australia tap into its talents and resources. To set the right climate for innovation, we must firstly provide the economic, tax and educational framework that will allow innovative businesses to operate effectively and to ensure that people have the right skills and knowledge to take our nation forward. Secondly, we must provide direct targeted support in areas where private sector funding is not appropriate or available. The government is delivering on both these fronts.</para><para>Tonight I will go through the evidence that was provided to the committee hearing yesterday at which officials from the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs outlined to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and Education Legislation Committee the consequences for education if this innovation bill is delayed. The First Assistant Secretary of the department, Mr Michael Gallagher, made it quite clear that universities and other research bodies have started making plans for next year, based on the innovation statement. These plans include extra university places, more money for infrastructure and the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme. I asked Mr Gallagher what the effect will be if this bill is not passed this week. His response was: </para><quote><para>The investment envisaged by this legislation is long-term investment. There has already been considerable lead-up by universities and by industry in preparing for these measures. There would be, at the very least, a loss of momentum and time. In a sense, time is of the essence because of the rate at which our competitor countries are themselves investing in research and development. So it is urgent that Australia increases it investment in these matters in order to sustain and improve its relative international competitiveness.</para></quote><para>His answer clearly demonstrates the profound importance of providing the resources to our universities, researchers and industry, which the innovation bill provides, to keep pace with other nations around the world in terms of investing in our researchers.</para><para>Mr Gallagher went on to describe what programs will be delayed and the problems that will be caused. The federal government will provide in this bill funding for an additional 2,000 university places specifically designed for maths, science and information technologyâsciences that are at the cutting edge of innovation. Universities have in fact been planning for this, and their departments have already received submissions. However, the minister cannot sign off on these matters until the bill is passed. Universities will not have sufficient lead-up time for an increase in student intake for 2002 if this bill is delayed, and may not be in a position to commence courses from the beginning of 2002, if they do not have adequate lead-up time. In fact, the outcome could be very patchy. Universities will make their own decisions. Larger universities might decide to take a punt on the legislation getting through; smaller universities will probably be more cautious, most of which are in regional and rural areas. Hundreds of country students could miss out on a university place and have their careers blighted by the irresponsible action of people like Senator Kim Carr and Senator Lyn Allison, who are just playing political games with this bill.</para><para>There is also the case of the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme. This innovative scheme has already received considerable interest from students and universities. But, once again, universities are unable to market this scheme to prospective students until this legislation is passed. Students will be uncertain as to whether or not they can expect to get a loan next year. This is particularly important for students who are currently in study and who are looking to continue their studies in the future in postgraduate areas.</para><para>Mr Gallagher also mentioned a range of measures for infrastructure. These were announced in the innovation statement and are contained in this bill. They include major research infrastructure of $580 million over a four-year period both for systemic infrastructure such as library acquisitions and for laboratory and computer equipmentâthings that are at the very heart of an innovative national economy. Mr Gallagher pointed out several reasons why there is a need to increase funding for infrastructure. These reasons included the need to keep up with the costs of equipment and to ensure that Australia's ability to be a player at the world's leading edge of research is sustained. The critical point that he made was that there was a need for some lead time in making orders for new equipment, which involves negotiations with international bodiesâand time is very short if all this is to be in place next year. </para><para>The bill also proposes to increase funding for the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council grants, which are now at risk because of the ALP and Democrat blocking tactics. In this bill is a whole range of new measures that are being put in place for the first time. Universities have to set up new administrative systems, new procedures, and the time is very short and has been made even shorter by these irresponsible tactics.</para><para>Evidence provided at the hearing yesterday also described the effect that a delay of this bill would have on schools. The bill provides for additional establishment grant funding, which is very important for the financial security of new schools. What was underestimated in the original bill was the number and size of new schools that were going to start up. So there is no additional funding per head; it is just that there are more people and more schools involved. That is why the funding has increased. But the ideologically driven Senator Lyn Allison and Senator Kim Carr are determined to block this, making the erroneous claim that this money is going to wealthy schools, which it is not.</para><para>Let me give you an example of a school in the Kimberleys that is going to be held up because of this. The Nyikina Mangala School will not receive the establishment funding to which it is entitled because of the bill being blocked. I have travelled extensively in remote areas, looking into indigenous education, and I am appalled that the funding for the school will be stopped. The school does not deserve to have its educational future tampered with in this way. The school itself cannot get on with the job because its funding is now so uncertain.</para><para>Other schools have been held up that are certainly not in any sort of wealthy category. Murray Bridge Christian School, the Steiner schools and the Montessori schools have all had their funding threatened, and for what reason? For some months now, we have seen the ALP threaten to take funding away from the schools that they claim are wealthy to fund their election promises, but Labor and now the Democrats are threatening funding to new schools that are in poorer communities serving low income groups, when parents just want to exercise some sort of right of choice in education. It all adds up to a very grubby picture in terms of the way Labor are treating education, from the school system right through to universities. What a joke that they claim to be supporting a knowledge nation! <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>23:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>25157</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 11.08 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>25158</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>25158</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><quote><para>Australian Horticultural CorporationâReport for the period 1 July 2000 to 31 January 2001 (Final).</para><para>Australian National UniversityâReport for 2000.</para><para>Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety AgencyâQuarterly report for the period 1 January to 31 March 2001.</para><para>Human Rights and Equal Opportunity CommissionâReportâNo. 13âInquiry into a complaint of acts or practices inconsistent with or contrary to human rights.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>25158</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Goods and Services Tax Ruling GSTR 2001/4.</para><para>Navigation ActâMarine OrdersâOrder No. 6 of 2001.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>25159</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Fuelling of Aircraft</title><page.no>25159</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2772)</subtitle><id.no>2772</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25159</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 21 August 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Do Civil Aviation Orders (CAOs) require certain procedures to be followed when refuelling an aircraft when passengers are on board.</para><para>(2)	What are the penalties imposed on an operator who breaches the above CAOs.</para><para>(3)	Were all these procedures followed during the refuelling of aircraft VH-EWB, while operating flight AN7221 at Gove airport on 2 August 2000; if not: (a) what action has been taken in response to the breaching of CAOs by this aircraft; (b) who has taken that action; and (c) what are the consequences for the operator of the aircraft.</para><para>(4)	How many passengers were on the aircraft at the time of its refuelling at Gove Airport on 2 August 2000.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25159</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has provided the following advice -</para><para>(1)	Civil Aviation Order (CAO) 20.9, sections 4.1 to 4.7 - Fuelling of Aircraft - documents the procedures to be followed when refuelling an aircraft with passengers on board.
