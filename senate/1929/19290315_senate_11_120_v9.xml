            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir WILLIAM</inline>GLASGOW.The replies to the
            senator's questions are as follow : - 1. (a) An area of ground near Duntroon has
            been selected as suitable for a landing ground and marked. Negotiations are now taking
            place between the Department of Defence and the Federal Capital Commission to make this
            land definitely available for aviation purposes under a suitable lease; (b) a pole was
            erected at the aerodrome for the purpose of carrying a wind-vane, and a wind-vane was
            fitted. If there is not one there at present it has been destroyed by the wind, and will
            be replaced immediately; (c) the Defence Department has no knowledge of any particular
            instance of a machine of this value having been tied to a telegraph post on the
            aerodrome at Canberra, but any machine arriving there, and staying over night, must
            necessarily be pegged down, as no hangar accommodation exists at present. The question
            of the provision of bandar accommodation will be considered when civilian aviation
            traffic justifies it and/or in connexion with the development of the Royal Australian
            Air Force. </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="2.">
              <para>Arrangements were originally made for a landing ground at Wangaratta with the
                owner of an area of ground convenient to the town, and which was perfectly suitable
                as a landing ground, and a. number of machines used it without accident. Later, the
                landowner took exception to machines landing there, and steps wore taken to find
                another suitable area. In the meantime, however, aircraft used the original ground.
                It took some time to find another suitable ground, and the owner of the original
                ground erected posts so that machines could not land on his ground without accident.
                Another area of ground possible for use as a. landing ground, but not entirely
                suitable for all types of machines, although the best available at that time, was
                then taken. This is the area upon which the accident occurred last week. Efforts were
                continued with a view to obtaining a more suitable place, and some six months ago an
                officer of the department visited Wangaratta and interviewed an owner of land which
                was quite suitable, near Bowser. The owner agreed as to terms, &amp;c., and an
                agreement was drawn up, but although the depart' tent made three efforts to get
                the agreement signed, up to the present these efforts have been without result. The
                area now marked as the landing ground is considered suitable for the type which are
                landing there, i.e., light aeroplanes, the type with which the accident occurred
                last week. </para>

            the producers in those industries. The production of wine in Australia exceeds the local

              </talker>
              <para>- Prior to 1924, when no bounty was paid on sweet fortified wine exported from
                Australia, the average quantity of wine exported yearly was about 800,000 gallons.
                The granting of the bounty resulted in a considerable increase in the quantity of
                wine exported. In 1925-26 Australia exported 1,700,000 gallons of wine, and in the
                following two years 3,077,000 and 3,770,000 gallons respectively. Those figures show
                the benefit derived by the industry from the wine bounty. The marketing of those
                large quantities of wine, most of which went to Great Britain, has in the past been
                carried out in a haphazard way. There has been no co-ordination of effort amongst
                exporters to regulate the exportation of wine, and the absence of any method of
                control has acted to the detriment of the wine exporters in particular, and in a
                general way to the growers. As in other measures of this kind, the organizing of
                export marketing operations is handed over to those engaged in the industry itself.
                The bill provides that a board of eight members shall be appointed, one of whom will
                represent the Government, and will be appointed by the Governor-General. As the
                board is vested with statutory powers, it is highly necessary that there should be a
                connecting link between it and the Government. The constitution of the board will
                consist of one member representing Victoria, one New South Wales and Queensland, two
                South Australia, one Western Australia, and two representing co-operative wineries
                and distilleries. In addition, there will be the Government representative to whom I
                have referred. </para>

              <para>- Not at the moment. In giving the co-operative wineries and distilleries two
                representatives the Government has in mind that, though growers are not directly
                connected with the making and selling of wine, their interests have to be
                considered. All the shareholders in the five co-operative companies operating in the
                Commonwealth are growers, and all the profits are divided among the shareholders,
                who number over 1,000. Their representatives on the board will see that the
                interests of growers will not be overlooked. The successful operation of the board
                depends on its personnel, and it is certain those concerned will see that only the
                very best men in the industry are elected to it. The Government representative will
                not in any way be connected with the viticultural industry. Of necessity, he must
                have had a wide commercial experience, and must be willing to give his time and
                energy in the interests of the industry. </para>

          <para>The export trade has had a set back owing to the heavy exportation of wine in 1927,
            between the time that the announcement was made of the reduction of the bounty by ls.
            per gallon and that when the actual reduction took place. The British market then became
            flooded with wine, which created a glut, and greatly reduced the previous demand. That
            glut has been very nearly cleared, and the exports of wine should again become active.
            The over-export of wine to which I have referred has had a very depressing effect on the
            industry. If a marketing organization such as the one proposed had been in existence at
            the time, exports could have been so regulated and controlled as to avoid over supply,
            and a greater stability in the English market would have been secured. At present,
            marketing is carried on with little or no system, and, if the wine export trade is to
            expand and flourish, organization is vital. The extent of the market open in Great
            Britain may be estimated from the fact that average imports of wine in that country
            reach approximately 1 8,000,000 gallons. The present consumption of Australian wine in
            Great Britain is about 2,250,000 gallons a year. It will therefore be realized that
            Australia's share of the trade is capable of considerable expansion. Without proper
            marketing organization it is very improbable that the export trade can develop to the
            full extent, and this bill provides the necessary machinery for the industry itself to
            place its overseas marketing on Â£ii organized basis, with statutory powers. </para>
          <para>The undoubted success of existing marketing boards in bringing about improved
            methods of distribution, moro stable prices, and considerable savings to freight
            reductions, has no doubt been a strong factor in convincing the wine industry that
            organization is very necessary to them. This was evidenced by the action taken at the
            conference of those connected with the viticultural industry which was held in Melbourne
            early in January. Every organization of growers, wine makers and distillers was
            represented at the conference, which unanimously carried a resolution that a marketing
            organization similar to those already in existence was highly desirable for the success
            of the wine export trade. The Minister for Markets met the representatives of the
            industry, who gave their full approval and support to this bill. It is unnecessary for
            me at this stage to dilate upon the different clauses of the measure, as that can be
            done in committee when the necessity arises. Perhaps I might be permitted to point out
            that, clause 14 is probably the most important in the bill, as it provides that nil
            exports of wine shall be prohibited by proclamation unless shipped in accordance with
            the conditions of a licence issued by the Minister for Markets. This is not a new
            principle, as a similar provision applies in other marketing organizations. Export by
            licence enables the Marketing Board to regulate shipments to overseas markets, and also
            to arrange for wine to be marketed through those channels which are considered most
            beneficial to the exporters. </para>
          <para>Clause 12 is also important, as it provides for the establishment of a London
            agency. Provision is being made in a bill which will follow this one for the machinery
            to collect the necessary fees to afford the board its revenue. The constitution of the
            London agency will be left entirely to the board, except that it will be necessary to
            appoint one member as a representative of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>Clause 16 contains penalties for contravention of the regulations, and enables a
            check to be exercised over the board by providing that the proclamation may be cancelled
            should its conditions be found unreasonable. That power is considered necessary if the
            board is to fulfil a useful purpose.- I remind honorable senators that the operation of
            this bill is contingent upon approval being granted by a poll taken of the wine-makers
            and distillers. A bare majority only is required. If the bill is approved its provisions
            will remain in force for three years, at the expiration of which time a fresh poll may
            be held if demanded by 30 per cent, of the wine-makers or distillers. That safeguard
            gives the wine-makers an opportunity to discard the Marketing Board if it is not giving
            satisfaction. It is proposed to make a levy of 5s. per ton on all grapes supplied to
            wineries, to supply the board with funds to finance its London agency, and for other
            purposes. </para>

                to which I have referred. I am aware that in some quarters there is a disinclination
                to approve any form of government control, but it must be realized that this measure
                leaves the marketing of wine entirely in the hands of the industry. The Government
                hopes and believes that the constitution of this board will assist in capturing a
                greater share of the British markets and consequently place the industry on a much
                sounder basis than hitherto. </para>

          <para class="block">Briefly, the object of the bill is to facilitate the work of the
            Tariff Board in many directions. It contains a provision under which discretionary power
            is given to the Minister to refer to the board certain questions such as the
            classification of goods and the determination of values under section 15. Another
            important feature relates to the manner in which the board should conduct its work.
            Authority is to be given to the board to divide itself for the purpose of making certain
            inquiries, so that, instead of the full board being engaged, two members of it may
            conduct investigations, whilst the remaining members give their attention to other
            matters; but the full board must accept responsibility for all recommendations. These
            are the general features. Among the other amending provisions is one empowering the
            Governor-General to appoint a person other than a member of the Public Service to be a
            chairman of the board. This is considered desirable in view of the possibility of some
            person being available of outstanding ability, capable of dealing with all the
            intricacies and difficulties of tariff board work, and especially gifted to analyse the
            various cross currents that are met with in tariff investigations. There also is
            provision authorizing the board, in certain circumstances, to confer with the Director
            of Economic Research. I may add that the Government contemplates bringing down a measure
            during the present session to establish such a bureau. </para>

            <para>.- The bill may be divided into three parts. The first part provides for increases
              in the salaries of members of the board, the second reduces the days of sitting, and
              the third alters the machinery provisions of the act so as to enable the board the
              more expeditiously to carry out its work. Despite the Minister's statement, I take
              the view that this measure opens up a wide field for discussion; but I shall confine
              my remarks to the three points which I have mentioned, and I shall be as brief as
              possible. The remuneration of the board was the subject of considerable argument when
              the original bill was under discussion in 1921. I have always believed that a good man
              should be paid what he is worth. </para>

              <para>- My honorable friend has put to me a very pertinent question. I freely admit it
                is difficult to discover the real worth of every man ; but the point I wish to make
                is that the efficient discharge of the duties of a member of the Tariff Board calls
                for the ablest men we can get, and I believe that their remuneration should be
                adequate. While on this subject I remind honorable senators that usually the
                Government is anxious to increase the salaries of higher paid officials, but is
                indifferent about the lower-paid public servants. The Secretary of the Defence
                Department, for example, is in receipt of Â£2,000 a year, whilst his predecessor
                received Â£1,150 or thereabouts. We have never been told what is the reason for
                this discrepancy. My view is that all grades of the Public Service should be well
                paid. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I come now to the method of payment of members of the board. The bill provides that
            the board shall receive sitting fees. I protest against that system. Members of the
            board should devote the whole of their time to the work and they should receive adequate
            remuneration. I consider it wrong that men who may be interested in private businesses
            should receive sitting fees as members of the Tariff Board, and be in a position to
            determine tariff requests which may indirectly affect their own business interests. I
            wish to make it clear that in saying this, I am not making allegations against any one.
            I am merely pointing to the danger that might arise under the system proposed by the
            Government. The Leader of the Senate, speaking in this chamber in 1921, said in reply to
            a suggestion that members of Parliamentshould constitute a Tariff Board - </para>
          <quote>

            board. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said in 1921 about
            members of Parliament applies to-day, with equal force, . to business men. The board, it
            will be noted, acts only in an advisory capacity. </para>

              <para>- I confessed in reply to an interjection by Senator 
                  R. H. S. Abbott just now, that I was not in a position to say what
                salaries should be paid ; but I have always been in favour of paying well ' for
                efficient services. I would have no objection if the members of the board sat only
                four days a week. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber have been condemned
                for supporting those who believe in a shorter working week; but in this instance the
                Government is adopting the principle which Ave have always advocated. I believe that
                some of the work now undertaken by the Tariff Board could be performed with equal
                satisfaction by departmental officers. In order to expedite inquiries by the board
                it is provided iu this bill that it may work in two sections each sitting
                separately; but that any decisions reached by a section of the board shall be
                confirmed by the full board. It will be interesting to see if this arrangement will
                have the effect of facilitating the work of this body which is so important to the
                producing interests of the Commonwealth. When a tariff board bill was before
                Parliament in 1924 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> said: "I
                trust that effect will be given to the opinion expressed in favour of all inquiries
                being held in public." If the honorable senator wishes to be consistent he
                should, when the measure is in committee, endeavour to give effect to the principle
                which he previously advocated. </para>

            <para>. - As I sponsored the legislation under which the Tariff Board was first
              appointed, I can claim some knowledge of the subject. The principal act was in the
              nature of an experiment, and there should be some satisfaction in realizing after this
              lapse of years, that the legislation, as originally introduced, has, with certain
              minor amendments, remained operative. The Government is wise in dispensing with the
              obligation which was placed upon the Minister to submit certain matters to the board.
              At the same time I understand from what the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> McLachlan) has said, that while the obligation
              lias been removed certain discretionary powers will still remain in the hands of the
              Minister. That is a wise provision, as some of these questions which appear to be of
              minor importance may ultimately prove to be of major significance. As it is impossible
              for Parliament to deal with every possible contingency arising under the tariff, it is
              essential that a certain amount of discretionary power should be placed in the hands
              of the administration. The Government is very fortunate in having in the department of
              Trade and Customs the highest possible type of public servants; but it is to be
              regretted that the devotion to duty of some of the men of exceptionally high calibre,
              with whom it was my pleasure to work for several years, has in some instances caused
              their death. </para>

              <para>- The inquiries themselves are held in public, but there is a provision availed
                of by the board, under which a witness may submit confidential information. It would
                be unreasonable to ask manufacturers and others to disclose the whole of the details
                of their businesses. To enable the Tariff Board to obtain a clear conception of the
                problems with which it is dealing, it is essential that it should have complete
                information, and that witnesses appearing before it should be encouraged to disclose
                the fullest particulars concerning the industries in which they are interested. Thy
                only way in which that can be done is to provide the board with statutory authority
                to obtain certain information confidentially. It has been my pleasure to give
                evidence before the Tariff Board in connexion with two businesses with which I am
                associated, and on those occasions I submitted the most complete costing details
                that it was possible for the accountants to compile. The members of the board stated
                that the tables I tendered were the most comprehensive they had ever studied. It is
                only by permitting witnesses to give information of a private nature <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> that the board can analyse the actual
                position of an undertaking. Nothing would be more prejudicial to the interests of
                the country and the work of the board than to discourage witnesses from submitting
                confidential information. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>A clause in the bill provides that the board shall have power to confer with a
            director of economic research, who, I understand, is to be appointed under another
            measure which has not yet come before the Senate. As I may not be present when that
            measure is under discussion, I should like to record my hesitancy in supporting any
            proposals for the establishment of further bureaux or boards. All the information
            required car I think be obtained by such bodies as the Development and Migration
            Commission and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which, under their
            very wide charter, can inquire into and report upon a variety of subjects. We also have
            the Tariff Board itself, as well as the Statistician's Department, which should be
            able to render efficient service in this regard. In view of our financial position the
            Commonwealth should hesitate before setting up another entirely new body, which, if
            established, will soon lie costing the country from Â£60,000 to Â£S0,000 a year.
            There is an old saying, that when a public servant has been supplied with an ink pot and
            blotting pad it is not long before he has a department around him. If the measure to
            which I have referred receives the approval of Parliament, it will not be long before
            the director will be surrounded by a highly-paid staff. </para>

                deficit of over Â£4,000,000 at the end of the financial year, the Government
                should not appoint a new body such as that contemplated under another bill. As the
                provision in this measure relates only to conferences with a Director of Economic
                Research to be appointed it is innocuous, but the Government should call a halt, and
                endeavour to devise means to save money rather than establish a new organization,
                the usefulness of which I very much doubt. I am not opposed to research into
                economic subjects. </para>

                is, in my opinion, less reason than ever for the appointment of this bureau, because
                if the great majority of members of this Parliament hold that the tariff, as a
                whole, should be reduced, it can be done. Is this proposal merely a bit of
                camouflage to satisfy the consciences of a few people? </para>

                is the worst possible time for setting about the appointment of such a bureau. Now
                that Senator R.H.S. Abbott has raised this
                issue by his interjection. [ arn reminded of a long series of resolutions
                appearing in this morning's press, and for which I imagine he is partly
                responsible. These are resolutions which have been adopted by the Country party. I
                have no desire to read them all, but they start off by asking for a scientific
                re-adjustment of the tariff so that production costs may be led need. </para>

            a duty has been proposed. Let me point out that there are already duties on sugar, wine,
            butter, wheat, onions, potatoes, and a long list of primary products. In fact, the only

              <para>- My friend is one of those fiscal troglodytes - one of those fiscal atheists -
                who believe that the farmers of Australia would get cheaper machinery if the
                Australian agricultural implement making industry were wiped out. But once that was
                done and, incidentally, to the detriments of the country, I venture to say, it would
                not be very long before the honorable senator changed his opinion. There are,
                practically, no duties on agricultural machinery in New Zealand, but in nearly every
                case its cost is greater there than it is in Australia. There is a vast agricultural
                industry in the Argentine - the American implement makers have so firm a control of
                the market in that country that no one else can get in - and there is no duty on
                agricultural machinery there, yet it costs 50 per cent, more than it docs in
                Australia. That is the position Senator R. H. S.
                Abbott would bring about in Australia. So long as I have breath in my body it will
                never be done with my approval. I do not want to see the Australian farmers held to
                ransom by great combinations of capital in America. </para>

            <para>. - I had hoped that the Minister would give us a little more information of the
              kind that the manufacturing industries would appreciate. I agree with him that the
              Tariff Board has done, and is doing, useful work in making inquiries into various
              industries with a view to determining the amount of protection which should be
              afforded to them. The great trouble with the Tariff Board is that sometimes long
              delays occur in dealing with the applications which come before it. An industry might
              be languishing, and in need of protection, but those engaged in it might not desire to
              rush in too early with an application to the Tariff Board for assistance. In such a
              case, should a long delay occur in dealing with their applications they might be
              forced out of business before the increased protection they sought was granted to
              them. The Minister said that this bill would, to some extent, remove that objection;
              but, unfortunately, it cannot be removed entirely. I welcome the proposal that the
              board may be divided, but even under the new system I fear that it will be unable to
              handle applications with the necessary despatch. </para>

                relation to another body which the Government proposes to set up. The bill for the

                bureau will be closely scrutinized in this chamber. There is something about the
                proposal which is difficult to understand. The bill before us will not end the delay
                in dealing with applications which come before the Tariff Board, or remove all the
                existing difficulties, but as it will go a long way towards doing so, I welcome it,
                and shall support the second reading. </para>

            <para>.- In speaking on the Address-in-Reply some weeks ago, I mentioned that, at times,
              applications for higher duties have been favorably considered by the Tariff Board, and
              additional protection given to industries, which, nevertheless, have soon ceased to
              exist, leaving the increased duty still in operation. The Tariff Board should watch
              the results of the applications that come before it, with a view to ascertaining
              whether the industries to which additional protection is given develop as the persons
              who apply for the assistance say they will when presenting their case to the board.
              Should it find that an industry thus protected has not been successful, and is no
              longer being carried on, Parliament should be notified so that, if thought desirable,
              the duty may be removed. </para>

              <para>- The average user of dutiable articles does not know the conditions in the
                industry which produces them. Those who establish new businesses are frequently
                unduly optimistic as to the result of their efforts. They place before the Tariff
                Board glowing prospectuses, which probably influence the board into recommending
                higher duties. Should their anticipations not be realized, there is danger that the
                duty imposed will remain, not to protect any Australian industry, but merely as a
                revenue duty. </para>

                duties were placed on imported goods which competed with the Australian-made
                article. The manufacture of fibre mats in Australia has ceased; but the duty of 5

                industry. The Tariff Board should not recommend duties and take no account of the
                result of their imposition. The other instance to which I referred was a duty on
                furs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> after strenuously opposing
                other proposed duties, advocated a higher duty on certain goods which competed with

              <para>- I gave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> all credit for
                endeavouring to build up the industries of Tasmania. He has certainly done much, in
                his very able way, in that direction. But I understand that the Tasmanian fur
                industry is now in liquidation, and if that is so, it is an anomalous position that
                the duty on certain classes of furs should be permitted to remain in force. It now
                acts purely as a revenue producer for the Commonwealth, and the general public are
                penalized by its operation. The Tariff Board should investigate the matter with a
                view to abolishing that duty. I do not believe in revenue duties, but unfortunately
                Australia has reached a stage when they are practically unavoidable. The Customs
                House is practically our chief tax collecting machine, and directly action is taken
                to reduce duties our revenue will bc seriously curtailed, and the country generally
                embarrassed. </para>

              <para>- That' ma.y, be the opinion of the honorable senator, but the perpetuation
                of a system of purely revenue duties would nullify the protectionist policy for
                twhich Australia has declared. During the last twelve or fourteen years we have
                placed ourselves in such a position that it is impracticable to reduce our customs
                revenue; but the Tariff Board should closely follow the life of an industry, and
                take action to withdraw a duty, when it is no longer of any use. I believe that
                  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> was Minister for Trade and
                Customs when the Tariff Board was established, and that the idea of the Government
                and of the honorable senator at that time was that the board should act as a sort of
                foster-father to our industries and see that they were adequately protected. I hope
                that, in future, it will be their policy to give some consideration to the needs of
                the general consumer. The policy of the board has been to call before it only
                representatives of manufacturing and importing sections of the community. </para>

              I know of a gentleman who, representing certain industries, went before the Tariff
              Board and submitted seemingly irrefutable evidence to show that duties should be
              increased on certain articles. A few mouths after he was dismissed from his position
              and joined an importing house. He was again called before the Tariff Board, and this
              time he submitted irrefutable evidence in favour of the withdrawal of the duty for
              which he had previously pleaded. I hope that this bill will usher in a different and

              be very helpful in assisting the Tariff Board to do even better work than it has done.
              Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> I am led to make this remark
              because of the statement uttered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline>
              to-day. All sections of the community are not represented before the board. In
              addition to the manufacturing and importing sections there is a third and very
              important section of the community, the consuming public. That section is not at
              present receiving any consideration. In this Parliament there are three distinct types
              of representatives, fiscal fanatics, fiscal atheists and moderate protectionists-

                intend to deal with the proposal to confer wider powers upon the Tariff Board by
                enabling it to operate by means of sectional committees, thus expediting and
                enlarging its sphere of activity. I believe that it has been hampered in its
                operations by the fact that heretofore only two sections of the community have
                placed their views before it. The general community does not receive a hearing.

              <para>- Parliament should, of course, represent the people, but unfortunately the view
                of the people, at all events concerning the probable effect of tariff duties, is not
                often heard in Parliament, and as I have pointed out on other occasions, many
                members of Parliament have given pledges to their constituencies that they will vote
                for the highest possible tariff duties evidently regardless of their effect upon the
                people generally. Parliament has accepted recommendations for the imposition of
                heavy duties on undertakings given by certain people to the Tariff Board that they
                were in a position to supply Australia's needs. Naturally, any one interested in
                a manufacturing industry will undertake to supply Australia's needs if he can
                have a guarantee of a sufficiently high duty. The best interests of the community
                are not served by the imposition of high tariffs, because high protection so often
                imposes on the people burdens which they are not able to bear. It cannot be denied
                that the exceptionally high cost of living in Australia is due largely to our
                present fiscal policy. What happens ? If a man on the basic wage finds it difficult
                to meet his engagements, he appeals, through his organisation, to the Arbitration
                Court for an increase in wages, so that he may be able to maintain his wife and
                family in reasonable comfort. In the majority of cases the court grants an increase.
                Then because of the higher scale of wages demanded, industries generally advance,
                prices and the position of the wage earner is worse than before. Let me give a
                concrete illustration in support of my contention. In normal circumstances a
                certain commodity can be manufactured for, say, Â£1, but to ensure an efficient
                distribution of the article the manufacturer has to arrange with middlemen or
                retailers who must invest a fair amount of capital so as to keep in stock a
                sufficient quantity of the commodity to meet the demands of their customers. If the
                cost of the distribution, including a reasonable return to the retailer on his
                capital invested, is 25 per cent., the consumer who in the main is the worker, pays
                25s. for it. Then if an Arbitration Court award in that particular industry has the
                effect of increasing the cost by 25 per cent., as happens so often, the cost of the
                article must rise, and the worker, instead of paying 25s. for the article will have
                to pay 31s. 3d., because 25 per cent, on 25s. is 6s. 3d., so he is worse off to the
                extent of ls. 3d. owing to the increased cost of production. In this way increases
                in the tariff affect the whole range of production. It is argued that increased
                customs duties encourage Australian industries and provide more employment for the
                people. Let us examine the facts. As a result of the imposition of increased tariff
                duties a large number of small industries spring up from time to time in our capital
                cities and larger centres of population. At the outset, no doubt, they do provide a
                fairly large field of employment, but in not a few instances because of their
                unsound economic basis, they are obliged to close down and the people engaged in
                them lose their employment. But what is worse, thousands of small investors who
                subscribe to the capital of these concerns, lose everything. This unfortunate
                experience can be multiplied times out of number in all our capital cities and
                larger centres. I do not say that the best method that can be devised to protect the
                small investor is to seek advice from the director of the proposed Bureau of
                Economic Research, but some action should be taken to ascertain what is likely to
                happen whenever a tariff alteration is contemplated. If I had the time I could give
                many illustrations of the adverse effect of tariff increases. I do not wish to cast
                any reflection upon members of the Tariff </para>

            <para>. - I support the bill as far as it goes but it seems to me that it might well
              have included many provisions that have been omitted. In the first place I direct
              attention to the fact that it contains no accurate definition of the relations that
              should exist between the Tariff Board and the Minister, and between the Minister and
              Parliament. This, I think, is to be regretted. It is also regrettable that there is no
              provision that the board's reports shall at once be presented to Parliament
              instead of going first to the Minister who later, lays them on the table. If they came
              to Parliament direct, Parliament, if it thought fit, could take the action recommended
              by <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> board. At present, so I understand - if I
              am in error the Minister will correct me - it is in the Minister's discretion
              whether or not Parliament shall be given an opportunity to consider the reports of the
              Tariff Board. As a matter of fact the Minister for Trade and Customs, has power which
              few Ministers for Customs in other countries possess. In this connexion I wish to
              bring under the notice of honorable senators the action of the Minister in relation to
              a certain recommendation of the board. A request was made to the board for protectiion
              for a certain industry - the production of peppermint oil. It was considered by the
              Tariff Board and reported upon favorably, but the Minister, so I understand, rejected
              it. The application, I may add, was made by a man who spent thousands of pounds in
              connexion with the industry and he had demonstrated that it could be carried on
              successfully with tariff assistance. Although the Tariff Board reported favorably upon
              his request the Minister, exercising the power which he possesses, has not adopted
              that recommendation and under the act there is no opportunity given to Parliament to
              consider it. If the procedure which I advocate were adopted and if the bill provided
              that recommendations made by the Tariff Board should be presented at once to
              Parliament, we should have an opportunity to express our views upon them. In this way
              a great deal of indecision would be avoided and a number of requests which to-day are
              refused by the Minister, would probably be granted by Parliament. I have also a word
              or two to say about clause <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> of the bill, which
              provides that the board may confer in respect of certain matters with the director of
              the proposed Bureau of Economic Research. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I should like to hear from the Honorary Minister why the Tariff Board cannot at
            present call witnesses, expert or otherwise, to give evidence either in favour of or
            against a proposal submitted to it. Is it not its privilege to call such experienced
            witnesses and examine them on the subject with which it is dealing? I am sure the answer
            will be in the affirmative ;" if that is so, this proposal to legalize a
            consultation which, I think, needs no legalization should not find a place in this bill.
            It is out of order, </para>
          <para class="block">I know, to impute motives, even if the motives are good; but perhaps
            the Government in its search for information embodied this clause in the bill in the
            endeavour to elicit information from honorable senators concerning the proposed Bureau
            of Economic Research. Whether it was done with that intention or not, it has already
            drawn fire from two or three points in this chamber. While I recognize the value of
            economic research", I consider that there are already in existence sufficient
            governmental bodies to carry out any research that may be needed. I repeat that expert
            evidence can be obtained as expeditiously and as cheaply by calling witnesses as by
            retaining men permanently, or at least, for the greater part of their time. The
            Government will get the same result with less trouble, in a shorter time, and with a
            smaller expenditure. In these circumstances, I do not feel inclined to support such an
            unusual proposal as has been adopted in this instance of mentioning in an act of
            Parliament a Director of Economic Research who has not yet been appointed. There is no
            need to burden the Estimates with the salaries of men who would be highly remunerated,
            when by following the course I have suggested the Government would be saving time and
            money. I commend these facts to the consideration of the Minister in charge of the bill,
            and I trust that the few small but important points I have raised concerning the rights
            of Parliament will receive his earnest attention. They are important, because they
            render possible a more expeditious and more efficient working of this necessary body,
            about whose failures we know nothing or, at least very little, and which has to act as a
            guide to the Government. The recommendations of the board are not always followed, and
            when they are not, reasons should be given. I think that the course I have advocated is
            better than that for which provision is made in clause 7 of the bill. Some of the other
            provisions are admirable. With the system of payment to members of the board I have no
            fault to find. I think it is- a good system and quite generous enough to men who are
            simply to carry out the functions of the Tariff Board, and, if necessary, those other
            functions which I have vaguely outlined. With these exceptions, I support the second
            reading of the bill, but I regret the measure has been brought before this chamber at a
            time when there is little opportunity - if the feelings of the Government are to be
            considered, and I believe that is the desire of the Senate - to frame amendments such as
            those which I have mentioned. </para>

            <para>. - I intend to support this measure, and I am rather surprised at the opposition
              shown this morning to a certain provision in it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                Greene,</inline> who I understand sponsored the principal act, admitted that it was
              introduced with the object of bolstering up and supporting the high protectionist
              policy under which we are operating. In my opinion, the Tariff Board has to a certain
              extent failed to achieve one of the objects for which, in my opinion, it was
              appointed, and that is to hold the balance evenly between all sections of the
              community. There are two important sections equally interested in the decisions of the
              Tariff Board and which have the right to be heard before it. There is also a third
              party whose interests should be considered, but which, up to the present, has had very
              little consideration. I refer to the unfortunate public, which up to the present has
              always had to pay. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> referred to
              the proposed appointment of a Bureau of Economic Research, and for the information of

              which appeared in the speech with which His Excellency the Governor-General opened
              this Parliament. It reads - </para>

              is proposed to establish a Commonwealth Bureau of Economic Research and to extend the
              scope of the Bureau of Census and Statistics. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I cannot recall any strong exception being taken at the time to the
            Government's proposal in that regard. The intention of the Government is to
            establish a Bureau of Economic Research to assist the Tariff Board, and whilst I agree
            with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> that at present the board
            has power to call expert witnesses on the economic aspects of any request it is
            considering, I do not think that by following the course he has suggested the object
            which the Government had in view in submitting this proposal would be achieved. It seems
            to me that the main reason for appointing a Bureau of Economic Research is that we
            should have a body that is able to deal with industry as a whole and not in a piecemeal
            manner. The absence of such a bureau possibly has resulted in the work of the Tariff
            Board not being as effective as some desire. It is, however, not the fault of the board,
            because it can deal only with requests submitted to it. The bureau, if established,
            would be able to survey the whole industrial field and prove to the board that whilst a
            proposed duty might be beneficial to one industry, it might injuriously affect others of
            equal, if not of greater importance. Whether the results obtained by such a bureau would
            be worth the expenditure incurred, is entirely another matter. In my opinion they seldom
            are. At present the Government has delegated its powers to numbers of expensive boards,
            but we do not seem to be getting any further forward. The Tariff Board itself in a
            recent report drew attention to the fact that our protective system had reached such an
            impossible position that we could not carry on much longer in the present way. </para>

            I learned, recently, that the drills used in Canada have only one set of machinery in
            them : that used for sowing seed. They are not equipped as the Australian drills are
            with double machines for sowing seed with superphosphates. </para>

              <para>- The strongest argument that can be advanced in asking for an increased duty is
                that the existing rate is not sufficient to enable the manufacturer to compete with
                imported goods. When applicants for increases are asked to show that they are not
                getting a sufficient reward from their industries, they claim that they cannot give
                their figures in public and they are permitted to tender that portion of their
                evidence in secret. But if I offer to give evidence as one who may be affected by an
                increase in duty, I must say what I have to say in public without knowing what has
                been submitted to the board in secret. I have been placed in that position when
                appearing before the board as a representative of the primary producers of Western
                Australia. I support the bill and I shall deal with the further legislation
                foreshadowed in clause 7 when it comes before the Senate. </para>

            <para>. - I feel somewhat relieved on this the first occasion on which I have
              represented the Minister for Trade and Customs in this chamber that it is not a debate
              on a tariff schedule because, judging by the vigor of the exchanges between honorable
              senators, I can imagine the conflicting points of view that would be taken if a tariff
              schedule were under discussion. The method of remunerating the members of the Tariff
              Board has been criticized by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> but it is the method adopted in past legislation and is,
              I think, the only possible one in the circumstances. The chairman of the board is, and
              will continue, so far as Ministers can see ai present, to be an officer of the Trade
              and Customs Department. His remuneration is to be increased by Â£200. Although the
              other members of the board are to have an increased fee for each day of sitting, it
              will not give them any additional remuneration over the twelve months. They are
              limited to Â£1,500 a year. I think it would be very unwise to make the members of
              the Tariff Board permanent officers of the Government. We occasionally need fresh
              blood, men who are familiar with the ever-changing conditions of trade and commerce
              and manufacture all over Australia. If we were to standardize the work of the board,
              making it a sort of bureaucracy, I think it would be detrimental to the proper
              administration of the act. To shut out men who are interested in current affairs would
              be to deprive us of the class of persons we need - men who are capable of dealing with
              commercial questions. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I welcome the encomium passed by the Leader of the Opposition on the members of the
            Tariff Board when he said that they were beyond reproach or suspicion. The Government is
            fully sensible of the immense and valuable work done by the board during the past few
            years. It has rigidly adhered to the parliamentary direction that none of its members
            shall have a voice in a matter in which he is personally or pecuniarily interested. If
            the board is to function as Parliament hopes it will, hours of sitting should not count.
            No judge finishes his day's work when he steps off the bench. Then comes the time
            for reflection, consideration and weighing of evidence, and it is these things, which
            cannot be done until the judge does step off the bench, that turn his hair grey. It is
            wrong to suggest that the members of the Tariff Board are over paid. We could not do
            less than we are doing. I almost think that our duty demands that we should do more. I
            am satisfied that those who are vitally interested in the tariff would rather have their
            cases determined by competent men than by those who would accept positions on the Tariff
            Board merely for the remuneration provided. The scheme outlined in 1921 and endorsed
            when the act was amended in 1924, is the most effective for dealing with tariff problems
            that has occurred to any one in Australia up to date. </para>
          <para>When the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, I made it clear that inquiries are
            not conducted in private and that it is only when confidential information is sought
            from witnesses that they are heard <inline font-style="italic">in camera.</inline> It
            was provided in the amending bill of 1924 that when the board considers it desirable in
            the public interest that certain evidence should not be disclosed, it may be kept
            secret. I am informed that only once in one period of nine months, during which one
            officer of the department filled the position of the Chairman of the Tariff Board, was
            there an instance of a witness having the same experience as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll.</inline> Several honorable senators have suggested that insufficient
            opportunity is afforded third parties to make themselves heard before the Tariff Board.
            Ample provision was made in the bill of 1924 for broadcasting the time and place of
            sittings of the board. Advertisements have to be inserted in two newspapers circulating
            in the place where an inquiry is to be held. Reasonable notice is given of the intention
            of the board to hold an inquiry, of the subjects to be investigated and of the times and
            places of meetings. Ample opportunity is afforded to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Lynch's</inline> friends, the Housewives' Association, or any other estimable
            association of citizens, to appear before the board. Honorable senators have accepted
            the basic principle underlying this measure, although they may wish that something more
            should be done. The proposals of the Government, if agreed to, will result in a
            considerable saving of time, so that the arrears should speedily be overtaken. </para>
          <para>Practically the only other matter that calls for discussion is clause 7. We have
            prided ourselves that in 1921 this Parliament displayed great wisdom when it appointed a
            Tariff Board. In the United States of America, a country which has made great progress
            under protection, the Tariff Board does not rely upon spasmodic assistance from
            untrained sources. Instead, it calls to its aid men trained in the particular subjects
            with which it has to deal from time to time. On its own staff there are 27 trained
            economists. In Australia, on the other hand, the Tariff Board has no one to whom it can
            appeal for an authoritative opinion as to the effect of certain duties. Unfortunately,
            little or no research work in the field of economics is undertaken in Australia, either
            by the Commonwealth or State Governments, or the universities. On the evidence placed
            before the Tariff Board it is difficult for one not trained in economics to say what is
            right in certain circumstances. </para>

              <para>- Newspaper economists might satisfy some people; but the Government feels that
                if the policy of protection is to be worthy of respect and is to operate in the
                interest of Australia, it must be thoroughly investigated from the economic
                standpoint. We ought to know the effect of the imposition of certain duties, or of
                the refusal to impose them. Australia is passing through a period of economic
                depression. There must be some cause for the unemployment which is rife. The Tariff
                Board is doing the best it can - and, generally, it is doing remarkably well - but
                it has insufficient information at its disposal. As in the various spheres of
                industry it is useless to go for advice to men not trained in the industry, so in
                tariff matters we should seek the advice of trained economists. </para>

                the report of the Tariff Board on peppermint oil, and asked that it be laid on the

              the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> that it is
              necessary for them to consult with an economic expert. That could be done without
              incorporating this provision in the bill. The Opposition will oppose its insertion.

            without delay unless the matter has been one of urgency. The Leader of the Senate has
            not suggested urgency in connexion with this measure, which is merely an amendment of
            the Tariff Board Act. The Tariff Board will continue its activities whether the bill is
            read a third time now, or this time next year. I suggest to the Leader of the Senate
            that the measure be allowed to remain at its present stage, and that it be read a third
            time next week. Honorable senators on this side will not support the suspension of the
            Standing Orders in order to allow the remaining stages to go through without delay.

            <para>[3.31]. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - Because of
              the vicissitudes of political warfare and the Constitution under which we are working,
              certain honorable senators will not be members of this chamber when it reassembles in
              July next. The remarks which I intend to make now would have been postponed until next
              week, but for the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> and
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graham,</inline> two of our retiring members, are
              leaving this afternoon and will not be with us next week. Senators P. P. Abbott,
              Findley, Graham, Needham and Thomas, having been defeated at the election in December
              last, will not be members of the Senate after the end of June; and Senator R. H. S. Abbott, who was chosen by the
              Parliament of Victoria to fill a casual vacancy in the representation of that State
              will also retire then. It is pleasing to reflect that if political warfare is
              conducted as it should be it is possible for all who take part in it to retain their
              personal friendships. Both parties are represented in the list of defeated candidates
              which I have just read, and I feel sure that I am voicing the feelings of all
              honorable senators when I say that whilst we all have done our best to bring about the
              downfall of political opponents, we deeply regret the severance, for a time at all
              events, of personal friendships. Some honorable senators who are about to leave us,
              have had a long career in federal politics. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                Thomas</inline> has been a member of the Federal Parliament for many years. He has
              been a member of both Houses, and has rendered useful service to this country, both as
              a Minister of the Crown and also as a private member. We all regret that he is leaving
              us, but we wish him good fortune in the future. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                Needham</inline> has been a member of this chamber for over twenty years, and for a
              considerable portion of that time he has been Leader of the Opposition. We all have
              admired his industry, his pertinacity and his conscientiousness in the discharge of
              his duties. As a critic he has never spared the Government or its measures, if they
              have not met with his approval, and at all times, he has shown an industry which, I
              feel certain, his successor will find it hard to emulate. But while we have admired
              his industry and his pertinacity we have appreciated, perhaps, more highly his
              qualities as a manly fighter. In all his criticisms of the Government and its
              proposals he has never been personal and never hit below the belt. And so we have
              learned to respect and honour him. There is a well-known saying, that you cannot keep a
              good man down, and since the honorable senator is still comparatively young, I have a
              feeling that we are not now signing his requiem, but that we shall soon hear of him
              again. All honorable senators will join with me in the sincere wish that his
              indisposition is but temporary, and that he will soon be completely restored to good
              health. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graham</inline> in his capacity of
              Opposition Whip has shown the possession of a quality which must particularly commend
              itself to a Minister, and that is his unswerving obedience to his leader. 1 have often
              admired the way in which the honorable senator has carried out <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham's</inline> instructions in the conduct of the
              debates. We all like him personally, and as in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> we wish him well in the future. Of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> I can say that he is a political
              fighter of no mean order. The honorable senator has the saving grace of humour which
              is the spice of politics. He is, I believe, the champion " leg puller " of the
              Senate. This is a quality which we all appreciate, when it is not used against us, but
              the honorable senator has developed the wicked habit of directing his shafts mainly at
              the Government with the result that on many occasions we have suffered from his
              facetiousness. But with it all, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
              never became personal, and his shafts of witticism left no sting. He is, personally,
              well liked by all honorable senators, and I am sure we hope that he will enjoy good
              health and success in the future. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator P.</inline> P.
              Abbott has been a member of the Senate for only one term, but we have learned to
              respect and like him, and we are confident that he is by no means at the end of his
              political life. We trust that he, too, will meet with success in the future. As for
                Senator R. H. S. Abbott, I have no doubt that he
              has enjoyed his brief stay in this chamber. We regret to part with him, but wish him
              good luck. We are parting with the retiring senators with a feeling of regret for the
              severance of our personal friendships, but we sincerely wish them all health and
              success in the future. </para>

            <para>.- It is my privilege to add a few words to those uttered by the Leader of the
              Senate. I endorse all that the right honorable gentleman has said. In political
              warfare, we have our ups and downs; but some honorable senators are more fortunate
              than others in that they never seem to have any " downs ". My experience has
              been such that my sympathy goes out to the man who is down. I have been there myself.
              I am sincerely sorry that these honorable senators are about to leave us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is a very old personal and political
              friend. I have not known <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graham</inline> so long,
              but I love him none the less. I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Thomas, who is not here to-day, longer, perhaps, than any other
            honorable senator. As a matter of fact, I am egotistical enough to claim that I was
            responsible for putting him into the Federal Parliament - many years ago. I am sorry
            that the other honorable senators also arc leaving us, because, while we have our
            political fights in this chamber, there are in most of us generous impulses and
            something that appeals. Although in the heat of debate we may give expression to bitter
            thoughts, it is good to know that even in the worst of our political enemies there is
            something that we can like. And so we regret to part with them. I am sorry indeed, that
            an occasion like this arises. It would be much better if, when we were -elected to a
            place like this, we had no need to worry about the future. If only we could rest assured
            that we should be here for the rest of our lives we could wax fat in great content. I
            confess it is somewhat difficult - and also unusual - for me to sit on a rail and make a
            speech to suit honorable senators on both sides of this chamber; but I can honestly say
            that I regret the occasion to say good-bye to those who are leaving us. I hope, however,
            that when the next political fight takes place in the country, the Ministry and its
            followers will need more stretcher-bearers than we on this side will require. I hope
            there will be more casualties in the ranks of our opponents than in our own, and that we
            shall come back to power. If we do, the Senate may rest assured that the members of our
            party will sympathize with the poor fellows who may have fallen in the struggle. </para>

            kindness and courtesy that you have always extended to me- during the time I have had

            have never met better men, and for their assistance, courtesy mid kindness, I thank
            them. During the time I have been here, every officer of this Parliament has always met
            me as a man, a: id I, in return, have treated them in The same way. Yesterday, I had the
            honour of a visit from a gentleman representing the press in the gallery, who called to
            express their regret on my leaving the Senate. I thank those gentlemen for the kind
            message they sent me. Above all, I have to express my sincere appreciation of the
            capable assistance rendered to (me by my secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Tonkin.</inline> The right honorable the Leader of the Senate was good enough to say
            that I had been industrious and assiduous in the performance of my work as Leader of the
            Opposition. I have always realized my responsibilities and recognized my limitations,
            and in whatever I have done in handling the various measures that have come before us, I
            have been, greatly assisted by my secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Tonkin,</inline> who is an able and reliable man. I fully appreciate all he has done

            epitaph has yet to be written. I leave this Parliament confident of the fact and happy

                that during our controversies, which have been many, I have never hit below the
                belt. I can also say the same of honorable senators opposite, who have always
                treated me fairly. There are some honorable senators who, until recently, wore
                strangers to me, but I hope I leave them as friends. I thank honorable senators for
                the good wishes they have expressed to me personally concerning my future. I shall
                not attempt at this stage to lift the veil that hides the future, but whatever it
                holds in store, I shall always be proud of the fact that I have had the privilege of
                being a member of the National Parliament, and have in some humble way assisted in
                guiding and shaping the destinies of this great Australian nation. </para>

                Like my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> I am not yet
                over 80, and still have a chance of being in another political " rough-up."
                Very likely, after the next political battle, I shall be as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> suggests, not one of those brought in
                by a stretcher-bearer; but among those rendering first aid to the fallen. I am
                delighted that I have had the honour of representing the people of Western
                Australia, and to assist to the best of my ability in legislating on their behalf. I
                have done my best; I could do no more. Although defeated, like the Australian
                soldier I am not downhearted, and I trust I am leaving this Parliament for a time
                with the respect and goodwill of honorable senators, irrespective of party. If I
                have the good fortune to again be returned to this Parliament, I trust I shall have
                the opportunity of renewing acquaintances with all those honorable senators who are
                now here. I am now going out into the world to fight life's battles in another
                sphere and I do not know what my lot will be. I wish to thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> for the courtesy you have always
                extended to mp, particularly when T was u new member of this chamber. Old
                campaigners such as the Leader of the Government in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> have long since served their
                apprenticeship; but the new members have to be trained. At times I came into
                conflict with your predecessor, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                  Givens;</inline> but I have been told that the only way in which to learn the
                rules of procedure is to break them. I have never laid myself out to do that; hut
                have always endeavoured to keep within the four corners of the Standing Orders. I
                thank all the officers of this Parliament, including the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, for the consideration they have shown me, and also you,
