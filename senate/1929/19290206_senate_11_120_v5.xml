            <para class="block">VERNOR-GENERAL entered the chamber and, being seated, with the President
        on his right hand, a message was sent to the House of Representatives intimating that His
        Excellency desired the attendance of honorable members in the Senate Chamber who, being come
        with their Speaker,</para>
            <para>HIS EXCELLENCY was pleased to deliver the following speech: - </para>
            <para>Gentlemen of the Senate, and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives - </para>
            <para>You are called together to deliberate upon matters of importance to the welfare of the
        Commonwealth.</para>
            <para>The illness of His Majesty the Bang aroused the deepest anxiety throughout Australia,
        and evoked a universal expression of those sentiments of enduring loyalty and affection
        which unite our people to the Crown. The intelligence concerning His Majesty&#39;s
        prospective restoration to health has been received with feelings of profound relief and
        thankfulness.</para>
            <para>My Advisers welcomed the opportunity afforded to Australia to become one of the original
        signatories to the Treaty for the Renunciation of War. They earnestly hope that this
        agreement will diminish the obstacles which have hitherto prevented further limitation of
        armaments.</para>
            <para>Owing to unfavorable seasonal conditions, and other temporary factors, there has been a
        period of diminished activity in the commercial and industrial life of certain parts of the
        Commonwealth. Notwithstanding these adverse circumstances, which have necessarily affected
        public revenues, the financial position of the Commonwealth is sound. Conditions have
        already improved, and there are encouraging indications that the coming year will witness a
        return to normal prosperity.</para>
            <para>My Advisers are watching with sympathetic interest the conference which is taking place
        between the representatives of those engaged in industry, and sincerely hope that as aresult
        of the conference an agreement for co-operation may be reached which will help to solve the
        industrial and economic problems which confront the community.</para>
            <para>My Ministers have received the report of the Economic Mission which, at their request,
        was nominated by His Majesty&#39;s Government in Britain. This report has been discussed
        with representatives of the States, together with the members of the Mission. The people of
        Australia fully recognize that the members of the Mission undertook their task at the cost
        of considerable personal sacrifice, and with the desire to assist in the development of
        Australia, and to promote inter-Empire trade. It is confidently anticipated that great
        benefits will accrue from the conferences that took place between the Mission and
        representatives of industry, commerce and finance.</para>
            <para>The Economic Mission, in their report, have dealt exhaustively with the &#163;34,000,000
        Migration Agreement, and they have made suggestions for modifications in the Agreement which
        are now receiving the careful consideration of my Advisers.</para>
            <para>The special circumstances of the war and of post-war reconstruction resulted in meetings
        of the Commonwealth Parliament being held at irregular intervals. The removal of the Seat of
        Government, and the establishment of the Parliament at Canberra, necessitated a continuance
        of this practice. It is proposed by my Advisers that Parliament should now resume a system
        of regular sessions. This, it is considered, will facilitate the conduct of public business.</para>
            <para>The proposals submitted by way of Referendum for the alteration of the Constitution,
        giving the Commonwealth power to make agreements with the States in respect of their public
        debts, were approved by large majorities of the electors in every State. The amendment of
        the Constitution will enable the Commonwealth Parliament to validate any agreement already
        made. The Financial Agreement, which was made between the Commonwealth and the States on the
        12th December, 1927, has been ratified by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and the
        States. It cannot, however, become fully operative until validated&#34; under the
        Constitution as amended. Legislation Will be introduced in this session to give the
        Agreement permanent effect, and thus retain to the Commonwealth and States the advantages
        which result from a co-ordinated system of consolidation, management and redemption of the
        public debt.</para>
            <para>The question of special financial assistance to certain of the States is receiving
        consideration.</para>
            <para>
                My Advisers will continue their policy of making provision for the defence of Australia.
        The cruisers and submarines constituting the new naval unit have arrived in the
        Commonwealth, and the seaplane carrier
                <inline font-style="italic">Albatross</inline>
                has
        been commissioned - thus completing the five years&#39; naval programme approved by
        Parliament. In framing the financial proposals for the coming year, consideration will be
        given to the recommendations contained in the report of Air Chief Marshal
                <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline>
                Salmond on air defence.
            </para>
            <para>There are many departments of Commonwealth activity the work of which would be greatly
        facilitated if an Economic Research Service were available. For this purpose, and to provide
        fuller information for the public upon many subjects of importance, it is proposed to
        establish a Commonwealth Bureau of Economic Research, and to extend the scope of the Bureau
        of Census and Statistics.</para>
            <para>A careful investigation of the work and functions of the Tariff Board has been made.
        Proposals will be submitted to you to bring about a more expeditious and effective working
        of the Board, .so that Parliament may be fully and accurately informed as to the operation
        of existing customs duties and bounties, and may also be in a position to consider the
        probable effect of new proposals for the encouragement of primary and secondary industries.</para>
            <para>My Ministers propose that the coastal clauses of the Navigation Act should be repealed,
        and that in lieu thereof protection should be given through Tariff provisions to vessels
        complying with Australian standards of wages and living conditions. The question of the
        method and measure of protection to be afforded has been referred to the Tariff Board- for
        report.</para>
            <para>In view of the importance to Australia of sea transport, my Advisers have convened a
        conference representing oversea shipping companies and Australian interests directly
        concerned in oversea trade, for the purpose of considering matters which affect oversea
        transport to and from Australia, with the object of ensuring the provision of the most
        economic and efficient service.</para>
            <para>My Advisers, in accordance with a promise made to the electors, will submit a measure
        embodying the substance of the regulations already made under the Transport &#34;Workers
        Act.</para>
            <para>You will also be asked to approve of proposals for the establishment of a War Pensions
        Appeal Board.</para>
            <para>My Advisers propose to introduce a Bill establishing a Wine Export Board for the purpose
        of assisting the marketing organization of the industry.</para>
            <para>The progressive policy of the Post Office will be continued, and its facilities will be
        extended to enable telephonic communication to be established with Tasmania and Western
        Australia. The Wireless Broadcasting Advisory Board has been established, and arrangements
        are well in hand to give effect to the policy of my Ministers for improving broadcasting
        facilities.</para>
            <para>In pursuance of the policy of the development of North Australia by improved transport,
        my Advisers have accepted a contract for an aerial service between North Australia and other
        parts of the Commonwealth, and have proceeded with the construction of the Oodnadatta to
        Alice Springs Railway, which will give communication between Central and South Australia in
        June, 1929.</para>
            <para>My Ministers, in pursuance of the policy of extending air communications, have made
        arrangements for new services between Adelaide and Perth; Brisbane and Charleville ; and
        Camooweal and Daly Waters. At an early date the services from Perth to Derby will be
        extended to Wyndham.</para>
            <para>My Advisers propose, on the adjournment of Parliament, to invite representatives of the
        Governments of the States to confer with them upon questions closely affecting the
        development and progress of Australia which can best be dealt with by co-operation between
        the Commonwealth and the States.</para>
            <para>Included in the subjects which the Commonwealth proposes to submit for consideration are
        transport, social legislation, unemployment, national health, and development of our power
        resources. At this conference my Ministers will again submit for consideration the question
        of the unification of the gauge of our railway systems.</para>
            <para>A Bill was submitted to the last Parliament providing a comprehensive scheme of National
        Insurance against sickness, invalidity and death. Parliament was not asked to proceed with
        the</para>
            <para class="block">Measure at that time. This course was adopted so that the fullest details
        of the scheme might be available to the general public, the employers, the employees, the
        Friendly and Insurance Societies and the medical profession, from whom suggestions and
        criticisms were invited. This course was also desirable in order to secure the co-operation
        of the States with the object of removing duplication and unnecessary costs, where the
        social legislation of the States overlapped the benefits provided by the National Insurance
        Scheme. This question will also be submitted to the proposed Conference between the
        Commonwealth and the States.</para>
            <para>Any necessary legislation arising out of the deliberations of the Conference will be
        submitted to you for your consideration in a later session.</para>

                        - Since the
            representatives of the people in this chamber last met, an event has occurred that has
            occasioned profound concern not only throughout Australia but also throughout all other
            portions of the British Empire, and, I think I may add, throughout the civilized world.
            I refer to the serious illness of His Majesty, King George V., which, as honorable
            senators are aware, has now extended over several weeks. For many days His Majesty was
            dangerously ill and his life was almost despaired of, but we have noted with the
            greatest satisfaction from the more recent reports received that there has been a
            considerable improvement in his condition.

                <para>The people of Australia, in common with the rest of the Empire, have watched, with
          feelings of grave anxiety, the progress of His Majesty&#39;s illness, and their deepest
          sympathy has gone out to Her Majesty the Queen and the members of the Royal family in
          their hour of trial. I feel sure that every honorable senator will agree with me that it
          is the first duty of the Senate, on assembling for the opening of the eleventh Parliament,
          to express its sympathy with His Majesty in his illness, and its gratification at the more
          reassuring news as to his progress that is now coming to hand. I accordingly move that
          the following message be conveyed to His Majesty the King: -</para>

                    <para>, - On behalf of honorable senators on this side of the chamber, I second the
            motion. Without doubt the illness of His Majesty for many weeks has caused his subjects
            a vast amount of anxiety. Just as they were deeply concerned with the gravity of His
            Majesty&#39;s illness, so are their minds relieved to-day by the news that he is on the
            road to recovery, and it is hoped that, with the blessing of Divine Providence, the
            improvement will continue and that His Majesty will long be spared to reign over the
            Empire. Her Majesty the Queen and every member of the Royal family, have had a most
            trying and anxious time, and I am sure that their anxiety has been shared in every home
            throughout the British Empire. His Majesty, throughout his reign, has endeared himself
            to his people, and it is only in accord with the fitness of things that we as duly
            elected representatives of the people in this far-flung outpost of His Majesty&#39;s
            dominions, should avail ourselves of the first opportunity to express our deep regret at
            his illness and our thanks that he is now on the road to recovery. On behalf of the
            Opposition in this chamber, I voice the hope that the improvement in his condition of
            health may continue.</para>

                    I submit this motion with strong personal feelings because I had the
            honour to be associated with the late Right Honorable Andrew Fisher in the first
            government that he formed. To work with him and to know him personally was to entertain
            for him the most profound respect, for he was a man of the highest integrity; a man of
            sterling character and one of nature&#39;s gentlemen. A true patriot, he was proud both
            of the land of his birth, and of Australia, the country of his adoption.

                    was born in Scotland but no native Australian
            could have had for Australia a more intense love than he had. Arriving in this country
            in 1886 he settled on the Gympie goldfields, Queensland, in 1888. In 1893 he became a
            member of the Queensland Parliament and remained a member of it until 1896. He was
            elected to the House of Representatives in 1901, and in the first Labour Government of
            the Commonwealth, that formed by the Honorable J. C. Watson, held the portfolio of
            Minister for Trade and Customs.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline>
                    was Prime Minister of the Commonwealth
            during 1908-9 and again from 1910 to 1913, as well as during 1914 and 1915. I venture to
            say that during those years he made an indelible mark on the history of Australia.
            During his last term of office as Prime Minister he suffered the greatest trial that
            could come to any man in charge of the affairs of a nation, since the empire of which
            Australia forms a part was involved in war. That world catastrophe occurred when the
            Commonwealth was in the throes of a general election campaign. The Labour party, of
            which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline>
                    was the then leader, at that time
            formed the Opposition in this Parliament.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline>
                    had no difficulty in deciding where he stood in connexion with the war and what should
            be the attitude of Australia. He realized what it meant to this great continent of ours,
            and that it was the duty of this country to do all it could to ensure that the empire
            should emerge successfully from the conflict. In the course of the campaign he coined a
            phrase that will never be forgotten. He said in a sentence what others had taken hours
            to express, when he declared that Australia was .&#34;in the war to the last man and the

            was confronted. He was sincere, he was thorough, and having made up his mind that a
            certain course of action was the only right one to follow he went straight ahead
            regardless of whether the goal at which he was aiming was popular or not. It was his
            integrity, his sincerity, his obvious honesty of purpose rather than any great
            intellectual attainments that gained for him the respect of his colleagues, and the
            confidence of his party and the people of Australia. When

              Fisher</inline>
                    became the High Commissioner for Australia in London, he was somewhat
            removed from the ken of the Australian public, for, during the war period, the work of
            that- office was largely of a routine nature, but all that came to his hand he did well.
            I met him on several occasions after he left Australia and again on his return to this
            country. On my last visit to England his powers were failing, but I found that he was
            still keenly interested in the progress and development of the Commonwealth and in all
            that appertained to its well-being.

                    It is fitting that we should place on record this expression of our appreciation of
            the great services which the Right Honorable Andrew Fisher rendered to Australia, and,
            indeed, to the whole empire. It is fitting also that we should tender our deepest
            sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.

            him in his home know of the strong ties of affection that existed between him and his
            wife and children -and realize to the full how keenly they will feel their loss. No
            words that we might utter can adequately express that loss, but I am sure that in the
            heart of every honorable senator there is a feeling of sincere sympathy with his widow
            and family in the bereavement they have sustained.

              remarks. The name of Andrew Fisher is a household word, not only in Australia, but
              also in every part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. For three successive
              periods he held the very high and responsible office of Prime Minister of Australia,
              and carried out his many onerous duties with fidelity and sincerity. Andrew Fisher was

              times in coming to a decision, but once that decision was reached nothing could stop
              him from carrying it to its conclusion. Despite that characteristic determination, his
              demeanour was always courteous and dignified, and won him many friends throughout the
              Commonwealth and, indeed, the British Empire.

            fellowmen During the period that he had the honour to be Prime Minister of Australia, he
            established a unique record, inasmuch as he was instrumental in the years 1910 to 1913
            in having placed on the statute-book of the Commonwealth every plank of the platform on
            which the Labour party went to the electors in 1910. In the intervening years that
            legislation has withstood the test of time and, with the exception of that which related
            to the Commonwealth Bank, not one section of it has been altered. Could there be a more

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>
                    Higgins had a
          distinguished career as a legislator and as a Justice of the High Court of Australia. He
          was a former member of this Parliament, and in the first Commonwealth Labour Government
          held the portfolio of Attorney-General. On the 13th October, 1906, he was appointed a
          Justice of the High Court, and held that office until his death. For some years, whilst a
          Justice of the High Court, he was also President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation
          and Arbitration, and brought to bear upon his work a zeal, sincerity and enthusiasm which
          it would be difficult to rival. While holding that office he laid down the principles on
          which the basic wage judgments of the industrial tribunals of Australia have been framed
          up to the present time. It is not too much to say that, in doing so, he enunciated maxims
          which then, to a great many people, appeared to be revolutionary. They were, however,
          based on humanitarianism and have come to be accepted as just and equitable principles to
          be observed in the assessment of what should be the basic or living wage of a community.
          In Australia and elsewhere, wherever industrial matters are discussed, the principles
          enunciated by the late
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>
                    Higgins, as
          President of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, have received
          considerable attention from every student of economics. The late Justice was a man of
          strong character and opinions, with a high sense of public duty. During his life-time he
          filled many important positions and he has left behind him a record of honorable and
          faithful service.

                    Higgins came as a very great shock to the
          people of Australia. For a very long time, in the legal and political arenas, he had
          played an important part in the public life of Australia and had rendered yeoman service
          to its people. He was a man of a very lovable disposition, of high scholastic attainments,
          and an eminent jurist and publicist. The outstanding feature of his long and useful career
          was his presidency of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Entering that
          office without the advantage of having precedents to guide him, he had to travel a
          difficult and uncharted sea; but no one can question the good work that he did in that
          industrial tribunal. He laid the foundations upon which it has been built up, and all his
          decisions were characterized by the utmost impartiality. By his death Australia has lost a

                    whose death occurred on the 18th
          November last, subsequent to the adjournment of the Senate, was elected to this chamber as
          a representative of Victoria in 1925. During the time that he spent with us he exhibited a
          high sense of public duty, and by his genial disposition and kindly manner endeared
          himself to all his fellow senators. The circumstances surrounding his illness, and the
          death of his wife a few months prior to his own demise, were most tragic, and evoked
          universal sorrow. He was a popular citizen of the city of Bendigo. Those who had occasion
          to visit that city while he was an honorable senator know how highly he was respected by
          his fellow citizens, and what valuable services he rendered to them. He threw himself
          whole-heartedly into the many activities connected with the civic life of Bendigo. His
          work in connexion with the Country Fire Brigades Board was exceptionally fine. He was
          always an energetic worker in the cause of charity, and during the war period assisted
          materially the appeals for funds that were launched by the Red Cross. In every respect

          The remarks of the Leader of the Senate with respect to his activities in his home town of
          Bendigo can be supported by many of us. During my short acquaintance with him I learned
          not only to respect but also to love and revere him. He performed many acts for the good
          of his fellows, but in such a manner as to avoid publicity. Had he been spared, he would
          have been of very great assistance to the members of this chamber in dealing with the
          legislation of the Commonwealth. We are sorry that he has been called so early to his
          reward and his usefulness thus brought to a close. Doubtless, the loss of his partner in
          life accentuated his trouble and hastened his end. My colleagues and I join with honorable
          senators opposite in expressing regret at his death, and sympathy for those who have been
          left behind.</para>

                        &#91;4.1&#93;. - Filling, as I do, the vacancy which
          was caused in the representation of the State of Victoria in the Senate by the lamented
          death of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Andrew,</inline>
                        and having been associated
          with him in the city of Bendigo during practically the whole of my life, I desire to say
          how greatly the people of Bendigo and, indeed, of the whole of Victoria feel his loss.
          Although his death was not altogether unexpected, it nevertheless had all the poignancy of
          a sudden blow. For very many years the late honorable senator occupied the highest
          positions in the gift of the citizens of Bendigo. He was a member of the City Council, and
          upon several occasions held office as Mayor. During the war period he rendered signal
          service to the different associations for the raising of money for the alleviation of
          distress, and particularly to the- Red Cross movement. His efforts to promote the
          collection of. funds for charitable purposes, particularly for the Bendigo Hospital, made
          his name a household word in that city. One of his most notable achievements was the
          establishment of the Country Fire Brigades Board, which throughout the length and breadth
          of Victoria has rendered yeoman service. During his captaincy of the Bendigo Fire Brigade,
          which extended over a period of from twenty to 25 years, he exhibited a knowledge and an
          ability in the fighting of fires that made him an outstanding figure.

                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Andrew</inline>
                        felt keenly his inability to contest the
          last election, and his disappointment was shared by everyone with whom he was acquainted.
          There is not the slightest doubt that had he been well enough to take part in that
          campaign he would have been returned with a substantial majority. Fate, however, ordained
          otherwise.
