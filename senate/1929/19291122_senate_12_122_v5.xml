                <para>It will be convenient at this stage briefly to outline to honorable senators a few details relating to the Budget and the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure. Since the new Government assumed office there has not been sufficient time to call for fresh estimates in detail from all departments, and to construct an entirely new budget based upon the policy of the new administration. Therefore, the major portion of the estimates of the late Government has been adopted. It was the duty, however, of the new Government to examine the estimates of receipts and revise and amend them so far as was necessary to disclose the true position of the Commonwealth finances. The examination revealed that, in some important instances the late Government had greatly understated the expenditure requirements and overestimated the probable revenue. The late </para>
                <para class="block">Treasurer has grossly miscalculated both the cost of definite commitments of the departments and services for the year, and also the probable revenue. </para>
                <para>It is now apparent that if the actual requirements of the year had been provided for in connexion with war pensions, repatriation and war services, old age pensions, iron and steel works bounty, prospecting for oil and sundry other items, for all of which definite commitments had been entered into, the estimates of expenditure should have been increased by approximately &#163;500,000. </para>

                        <para>- No.I am quoting facts, not. opinions. It is also apparent that the customs and excise revenue, land: tax, and income tax. and other receipts, would have fallen short of the estimate by at least &#163;1.050,000. The late Treasurer would, therefore, have finished the year with a deficit of about &#163;1,200,000 instead of a surplus of &#163;360,000 as promised by him in his budget speech. </para>

                <para>The Commonwealth general elections, of course, were not foreseen when the budget was being prepared, but the responsibility for the expenditure involved rests with the late Government. The cost of these elections was &#163;105,000, for which provision is now made in the new Estimates. </para>
                <para>Moreover, it has been found that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Pike&#39;s recommendations relating to soldier laud settlement loans are accepted by the Commonwealth and the States, the Commonwealth will be involved in a liability of &#163;284,135 for interest overpaid by the States during the period 1st July, 1927, to 30th June, 1929. No provision for this liability was made in the late Treasurer&#39;s budget, although his Government was prepared to accept the  recommendation. The present Government is of opinion that, whilst there may be objections to the whole of the liability being charged against the accounts of the present year, provision should be made in this financial year to meet some proportion of the liability which falls upon the Commonwealth, and 1:100,000 is being set down for that purpose, and is included in the item &#34; Other war services &#34;. </para>
                <para>The increased expenditure provided for in the new Estimates in respect of Departments and Services (Part T.), for which either no provision or inadequate provision was made in the late Treasurer&#39;s budget, can be summarized as follows : - </para>

                <para>The Government proposes to reduce the Defence Department expenditure by &#163;150,000 for the year. The net increase in expenditure, therefore, to be provided for in the new Estimates is &#163;657,340. </para>

                <para>For the year 192S-29 the corresponding expenditure was &#163;51,S99,077. </para>
                <para>The amended Estimates disclose an increased expenditure over the previous year of &#163;744,424. As has already been shown, this increase is almost entirely the result of the financing of the late Administration. </para>

                <para>The estimated receipts included a sum of &#163;300,000 to be derived from an adjustment of charges for telephone and parcels post services.

                <para>We heard yesterday from the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition that the Government proposed to relieve the big American combines of the payment of taxes and throw the burden on industry generally. It is therefore meet that I should emphasize that the previous Treasurer expected to derive &#163;300,000 during the present financial year from an adjustment of the charges for telephone and parcel post services. The estimated expenditure of &#163;13,060,839 was arrived at after making a cut of &#163;123,000 in the departmental Estimates arising out of the proposed reductions in allowances to officers to which reference has already been made. After reviewing the position, the Estimates have been increased by &#163;50,000 and the revised amount of &#163;13,110,839 will it is anticipated, be sufficient to carry on the services satisfactorily and at the same time enable the present rate of allowances to officers to be continued. </para>

                <para>This is the first year iu which a proposal is put forward to give assistance to South Australia by means of a special grant. The proposal arises from a claim by South Australia which was investigated by a royal commission. The royal commission recommended a grant of &#163;1,000,000 to be spread over two years. In his budget speech the late Treasurer announced that his Government proposed to give assistance to that extent to South Australia, but it was to be spread over three years instead of two years as recommended. The amount of assistance was to be &#163;360,000 for the current year and &#163;320,000 a. year for each of the two succeeding years. </para>
                <para>The amount of &#163;60,000 for relief in connexion with the Port AugustaSalisbury railway represented the annual liability for interest and sinking fund in respect of that railway and the relief was to be conditional on South Australia transferring to the Commonwealth the control of the railway. It was claimed by the late Government that this proposal represented permanent assistance of &#163;60,000 to the revenue of South Australia. </para>
                <para>The Premier of South Australia has indicated that his Parliament would not agree to this railway being handed over to the Commonwealth. The present Government, after considering the matter, proposes to make a special payment of &#163;360,000 for the current year. </para>

                <para>Owing to the continuation of adverse monetary conditions in Australia, and abroad, the Australian Loan Council has found it necessary to curtail drastically the public- works programmes of the Commonwealth and State Governments for the present year. Each of the governmental authorities affected has a large amount of urgent developmental work of a thoroughly sound character already planned and ready to be put in hand, and in every State there is a large number of unemployed workers eagerly seeking employment. </para>
                <para>So far as the market in Australia is concerned, the decline in the prices of our principal primary products, combined with diminished production owing to adverse seasonal conditions in certain parts of Australia, has resulted in a considerable reduction of the national income with its inevitable effect on the amount of money available for investment in Government loans. The high rates of interest obtainable in investment markets abroad has also had the effect of drawing funds from Australia, and in that manner further depleting our diminished resources. </para>
                <para>It is unfortunate that coincident with adverse seasonal conditions and business depression in Australia, financial conditions overseas should be so stringent. With easier conditions abroad the Loan Council would have been justified in raising external loans in order to. meet the pressing requirements of the States and the Commonwealth, and by the increased activity, contribute to the reduction in unemployment. </para>
                <para>Some honorable senators may take the view that having regard to this fact there should be no tinkering with the &#163;34,000,000 migration loan agreement. We should remember, however, that all expenditure under that agreement will be by loan raised by the Commonwealth Government, and become part of the States&#39; loan programme. It is not merely a question of cheap money. We shall have to raise the loan and the British Government will contribute towards payment of interest. </para>
                <para>One of the factors making for instability of employment, is irregularity of public expenditure by central and local governing bodies. The most variable element in this is loan expenditure, which tends to grow in times of prosperity and to diminish in times of depression. The direct effect of this is to increase the fluctuations in unemployment, not only through the restriction of employment by public authorities but also by its reactions upon business activitiy in general. </para>
                <para>Activity on public works should be reduced to a minimum when other employment is abundant, and should be accelerated to its greatest capacity when the general industrial situation is stagnant. </para>
                <para>The present Government will endeavour to work in accordance with this plan and will seek the co-operation of the State governments to the same end. </para>
                <para>The last loan for new money in the London market was in January of the present year when &#163;8,000,000 was raised at 5 per cent., the issue price being &#163;98. Since then there has been acute financial stringency. The Bank of England rate reached 6&#189; per cent., interest rates generally increased, and the market prices of all government stocks declined. As a means of temporary finance, twelve months&#39; treasury-bills to the amount of &#163;5,000,000 were discounted in London in September, the average rate of discount being &#163;6 3s. per cent, and the effective rate of interest &#163;611s. per cent. </para>
                <para>The last Australian loan in New York was raised in May, 1928. Adverse conditions in that market have been in evi dence for many months and the raising of a further loan has been quite impracticable. </para>
                <para>In the Australian market the last loan to be floated for new money was in February of this year when &#163;7,600,000 was raised at 5&#188; per cent., the price of issue being par. The market conditions continued to be satisfactory for some months, but in the last three months there has been a decided drop in the prices of government stocks, due partly to the adverse local conditions to which I have already referred, and partly to the reflection here of the stringent money position overseas. </para>
                <para>When the Government assumed office it was faced with a depleted treasury and the necessity of raising an immediate loan for the needs of the Commonwealthand the States. The earliest opportunity was taken by the Government to meet the chief officers of the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks, when a profitable discussion took place on the general financial position. As a direct outcome of the discussion, the Treasury immediately issued in Australia a loan of &#163;10,000,000 bearing5&#188; per cent. interest withanissue price of &#163;98, and a currency of five years, the yield to the investor being &#163;5 14s. 4d. per cent. The banks unanimously agreed to underwrite the loan. </para>
                <para>Further temporary finance has been arranged for in London by the issue on 20th November of treasury-bills for &#163;5,000,000. The bills willmature on 30th June, 1930. They are being discounted at an average rate of &#163;5 7s. 6d. per cent., the effective rate of interest being &#163;511s. </para>
                <para>The Bank of England rate has recently been reduced from 6&#189; per cent., and it. is hoped that we may experience better financial conditions generally in the near future. </para>

                <para>We find on examination that this figure does not include a sum of &#163;5,000,000 which the late Commonwealth Government agreed to write off the indebtedness due by the States in respect of soldier land settlement loans. Separate agreements were entered into between the Commonwealth and respective State governments subject to ratification by the respective Parliaments. Four States passed ratifying acts, but before the other two States could ,do so the whole subject was re-opened at n conference between the Commonwealth and the States in 1927. The ratification of the agreement was accordingly deferred; but the Commonwealth agreed, without prejudice to its rights, to defer collection of interest from the States. </para>

But I do say that it was the duty of the Treasurer, and also the duty of the then Leader of the Senate, to explain to honorable senators that it was a contingent liability.

                <para>The Government is convinced that the present system of credit control in Australia has many defects which militate against, the best use being made of the credit resources of the nation. These defects mostly arise from the fact that the private trading banks have in recent years almost exclusively arrogated to themselves the power to determine the bank discount and exchange rates, and the extent to which credit shall be expanded or restricted ; and, equally important, the classes of business or industry to which credit facilities shall be extended. </para>
                <para>The organization of credit and its use should more and more be regarded as one of the great services of the nation to be controlled by national institutions. </para>
                <para>With that object in mind, the Government will shortly give consideration to the question of remodelling the Commonwealth Bank and increasing its scope and functions. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is well aware of the fact that although Labour Governments have been in office in the States they have not been in power. A rural bank was established by a Labour Government in South Australia, but its efforts were frustrated by the representatives of vested interests in the Legislative Council, which whittled away the powers of a bank, established to assist the farmers. </para>

                <para>The estimate of &#163;43,750,000 for customs and excise included &#163;41,000,000 on the basis of the old tariff and &#163;2,750,000 to be received from the new duties which were imposed on 22nd August. The Customs Department, after careful review, now estimates that on the basis of the present tariff the new duties will produce &#163;250,000 more than was originally anticipated and the old duties &#163;750,000 less. The revised estimate by the department is, therefore, &#163;43,250,000, or &#163;500,000 less than the budget estimate. </para>
                <para>In view of a recent adverse decision of the High Court on the matter of Crown leaseholds, there will be a loss on land tax of &#163;200,000 compared with, the budget, estimate of &#163;2,800,000. </para>
                <para>The revised estimate of income tax by the Commissioner of Taxation is &#163;9,700,000, or &#163;300,000 less than the budget estimate. This reduction is due in part to inability to pass legislation tightening up taxation laws in time to obtain any appreciable benefits in the assessments of the current year. </para>
                <para>The estimate of &#163;1,000,000 for amusement tax included &#163;360,000 from the entertainment tax at present in force, &#163;600,000 from a proposed tax of 5 per cent, on gross receipts from charges of admission to entertainments, and &#163;40,000 which was not explained in the budget but which was probably intended to represent further entertainments tax consesequent upon a re-adjustment of charges of admission. The present Government does not intend to levy the proposed 5 per cent, tax on gross receipts. </para>

                <para>The revised estimate of customs and excise revenue is &#163;44,450,000, or an increase of &#163;700,000 over the budget estimate. I have already stated that according to a recent estimate by the Customs Department the collections to be realized if the present tariff remained in operation would fall short of the budget estimate by &#163;500,000. The amendments of the tariff which it is now intended to impose are thus expected to yield this year a net increase of &#163;1,200,000 above the present tariff. </para>

The import duty on cigars will be increased, in order to give the local cigar manufacturer a larger margin of protection against the imported cigars. In addition, it is proposed to reduce the excise duty on hand-made cigars to 3d. per pound, and on machine-made cigars to ls. 3d. per pound - rates which were recommended by the Tariff Board. </para>
                    <para>The Government has felt that with the vast number of workers who are unemployed, every avenue should be explored whereby the production of goods necessary for the domestic markets of Australia should be conserved to Australian industries, and that where consumers will insist upon having imported goods they must pay for that privilege. </para>

                <para>With regard to income tax the late Government announced its intention to impose a super tax of 10 per cent, in the rate of tax on individual taxpayers whose taxable incomes exceed &#163;2,000. The amount to be realized from this super tax was not stated in the budget speech, but since it has been ascertained that it was &#163;400,000, and this amount has been included in the revised estimate of &#163;9,700,000 furnished by the Commissioner of Taxation. </para>
                <para>The present Government proposes to raise &#163;10,585,000 this financial year from income tax. The existing rates of tax will be increased by the imposition of a super tax as follows: - </para>

                </para>
                <para>The super tax is estimated to produce this year &#163;1,285,000. Of that amount &#163;4&#39;00,000 was included in the budget estimate of the late Treasurer. The additional taxation proposed by the present Government is, therefore, designed to produce &#163;885,000 more than the amount proposed to be collected by the late Government. Although the super tax is expected to yield &#163;1,285,000 in the present year, the total yield from income taxes for the year will be only &#163;743,000 more than the actual receipts of last year. </para>
                <para>I think it can be asserted that taxation of every description falls ultimately upon the wages and incomes of all who labour by hand or brain ; or upon rent, interest, and profits derived from land and property. Where the taxes are imposed in the first instance upon commodities they are ultimately a charge upon the income of the consumers, who pay in increased prices for such commodities. </para>
                <para>To comprehend clearly the relative burden of taxation and the real incidence of its varying forms, it is necessary to treat all taxes as being deductions from income, as indeed they always are in the last resort. By this means our interest can be sharply focussed upon the crucial issue: namely, what incomes have and what have not an &#34; ability to pay &#34;. </para>
                <para>The Government has kept this . doctrine clearly in mind in formulating the super tax upon incomes which I have just outlined. The taxes which can be applied most equitably to the varying capacities of the individual taxpayers are unquestionably direct taxes. </para>
                <para>The administration of the present income tax law in the last few years has brought to light many anomalies and defects. In order to cure these, and to simplify the law as far as practicable, it is intended to submit to Parliament early nest year an amending Income Tax Assessment Bill. </para>

                <para>At the 30th June, 1929, the accumulated deficit stood at &#163;4,987,718. Towards the liquidation of this deficit the late Government proposed to apply the sum of &#163;1,200,000, representing the accumulated income arising from liquidations of exenemy properties, in addition to such surplus on the year&#39;s transactions as they had hoped to achieve. </para>
                <para>I have already shown that, on the basis of the late Treasurer&#39;s budget, there would have been no surplus at the end of the year to apply to this purpose; but, on the contrary, there would have been a further heavy deficit. </para>
                <para>The present Government sees no prospect, in the present financial year, of paying off the deficit bequeathed to it by its predecessors, nor, indeed, of making any substantial contribution towards its reduction. As to whether the deficit will be liquidated from Consolidated Revenue in the near future, or whether provision will be made to fund it, will be considered and determined at a later date. </para>

                <para>I think it will be generally realized that the new Government has assumed control at a period of extreme difficulty.

Australia has wonderful recuperative powers, and a stouthearted and industrious community. If we are blessed with good seasons, our troubles will soon disappear, and we shall commence a new era of progress and prosperity. </para>

                    PEARCE (Western Australia) &#91;12.9&#93;. - Under ordinary circumstances I would have sought the adjournment of the debate on the motion submitted by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, but in view of the extraordinary nature of the budget statement delivered in another place, I propose to say a few words at this stage and then ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Since the inception of federation, the annual budget statement delivered by the Commonwealth Treasurer has generally been, I am glad to say, an unimpassioned and businesslike- account of the actual financial position. On this occasion, however, and for the first time in the history of federation, the Treasurer&#39;s statement has been 25 per cent, a businesslike account of the financial position of the Commonwealth, and 75 per cent, bitter political propaganda. It is, furthermore, an absolutely misleading statement of the financial position. With other honorable senators, who were members of the late Government, I have recently had an opportunity to review the facts set out in the budget. It is the duty of Ministers to review departmental estimates to see whether they will accept them or not, and in accordance with that practice, and particularly in view of the financial position of the Commonwealth, Ministers in the late Government refused to accept the departmental estimates of expenditure submitted to them. On the contrary, they went through them with a pruning knife cutting off large items of expenditure which the departments said were required. But now, for the purpose of swelling the figures of expenditure as much as possible, those items have been re-inserted in the Estimates which have just been submitted to this Parliament. We all agree that it is necessary for Ministers to give great consideration to estimates of revenue submitted by departments. Years of experience enable Treasurers to acquire a certain amount of knowledge in regard to revenue estimates, in fact to form a judgment which compares very favorably with that of their departmental experts.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline>
                    Page having had a longer experience of budgeting than any other Commonwealth Treasurer, was clearly in a position to estimate revenue with considerable ability; at any rate with an ability equal to that of departmental experts. On the present occasion, however,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline>
                    whilst accepting every estimate for increased expenditure that any department chose to put up, in order to unduly - I might almostsay improperly - swell the estimated expenditure of the Commonwealth, has, wherever possible, grossly and wrongly cut down estimates of revenue in order to justify a policy - I weigh my words when I say this - of vindictive taxation upon the people and industries of the Commonwealth. The statement we have had presented to-day will go down to history as an innovation in Australia.I hope that it will be the last of its kind. It is a commencement of a practice of issuing political propaganda of a grossly improper type - under cover of a presentation of a statement of the financial position of the Commonwealth - which,I venture to say on thisoccasion, is perilously approaching the region of a dishonest statement, beca use it grossly inflates the proposed expenditure whilecutting down any possibility of revenue to meet, that expenditure. There is an amount of &#163;1,200,000 which the Government admits is in its possession, and which is legitimately available for use, but while Ministers propose to impose on the people and on the struggling industries of the country taxation amounting to &#163;1,200,000, they will not tell Parliament or the country what they propose to do with this money which is already in hand. To me it seems to be something in the nature of a confidence trick, and I venture to say that this Parliament and the people will not tolerate it - that before the Government&#39;s taxation proposals are approved Parliament will want to know the use to which this &#163;1,200,000 is being put. Ministers will not receive blank cheques from Parliament. I ask leave to continue my remarks at some future date.

                    PEARCE ( Western Australia) &#91;12.30&#93;. - My object in calling &#34; not formal &#34; to this motion was to draw the attention of honorable senators to the contemplated inclusion of Tuesday as a sitting day. I can .see no reason for that. So far the Senate has before it only the Address-iu-Reply and the printing of the budget-papers, and, in view of the nature of the business that the Government indicates it will proceed with, it is extremely unlikely that any bill will come before this chamber until after next week. There seems to be no necessity to bring honorable senators back here on Tuesday next. Should it be found necessary for the Senate to sit on Tuesday of the following week, the Vice-President of the Executive Council could on Friday next move that the Senate at its rising adjourn until the following Tuesday.

                    <para>. - While I have no serious objection either, to the motion or the amendment, I point out. that it has not been customary for the Senate to sit on as many days as the House of Representatives has sat. The Senate contains fewer members than does another place, so that it is not necessary for it to sit the same number of hours to deal with the same volume of business. The proposal to ait on Tuesdays is one of the first results of the Government&#39;s neglect of the Senate. With the ministerial representation in this chamber limited to two Assistant Ministers, it is obvious that they will be overworked. The previous Government, recognizing the importance of the Senate, was represented in this chamber by four Ministers. Unfortunately, there is a desire on the part of a section of the community to disparage the Senate. Seeing that the Senate springs from the people, and is of their creation, it should be treated with greater respect. Indeed, its claim to the respect of every citizen of this country is pre-eminent. I feel that we should stand up for the rights and privileges of the chamber to which we belong. The two Ministers in the Senate must be disgusted with the lack of comradeship which their party displayed when it forced them to bear a burden which previously was shared by four Ministers. The volume of business transacted to-day is much greater than it was fifteen years ago, yet the present Labour Government has not treated this chamber so generously as did the Fisher Government, which was represented in the Senate by three Ministers. The action of the Government is an affront to the Senate, for not only is the numerical strength of its ministerial representation here less than it has ever been, but the status of Ministers has also been reduced. There is, in the Senate, no Minister with a portfolio; the nine plums of office are held by men in another place. Now the Ministers in this chamber are to suffer a further indignity in that they are asked to work on four days instead of three each week to transact the business of the country. The Government has offered a gratuitous insult to the first council in the land. What has the Senate done to be treated in this way? The Labour party in Australia will not even follow Soviet precedent; even under the Soviet system of government in Russia the federal scheme is maintained. I look to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to support my protest. I well recollect the strong stand taken by the honorable senator when the selection of a site for the Federal Capital city was before the Senate. On that occasion he stubbornly resisted all appeals to vote against the dictates of his conscience. </para>

                        that the action of the Government in not allotting to the Senate at least one Minister with a portfolio is a reflection on this chamber. It would appear that the Prime Minister

It would be unfair to the two half-Ministers to expect them to meet the Senate four days weekly. I support the amendment as much on their behalf as on my own. Among the Government&#39;s supporters in this Chamber are men who have sufficient ability to hold ministerial rank. I am hopeful that, before long, the Government will see fit to increase the number of Ministers in this chamber. </para>

I remind honorable senator? that as their statements are recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and are published in the public press, it is unwise to reflect on our Parliamentary institutions by referring to any honorable senator as a&#34; half-baked Minister &#34;. Personally, I regard the position of Vice-President of the Executive Council as a high and honorable one. Members of the Labour party, like the members of other parties, express themselves freely in the party rooms; but when a decision has been arrived at there, they loyally abide by it. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I shall endeavour to fulfil the duties of that office as worthily as did my predecessor; 1 should have been the last man to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce as a &#34; half-baked Minister &#34;. In appointing the Leader of the Senate to be Vice-President of the Executive Council, the Government has followed the precedent set by the government which preceded it.

                </para>
                <para class="block">Address-in-Reply, I desire to approach consideration of the issues that are raised in the Speech of  His Excellency  the Governor-General from an angle slightly different from that taken by honorable senators who have preceded me. Whether it be pleasant or otherwise to the majority of members of this chamber, I propose, at the outset of my remarks, to state what to me is a clear and undeniable fact, namely, that the Governments, both Federal and State, which have been in power ever since the war, have not succeeded in keeping Australia out of very serious trouble. If the present Labour Government, now that we are unquestionably in difficulty, can succeed in getting us out of it, they will deserve well of the people. It is not unusual for those who are in trouble to attach the blame to occurrences which they could not help. In the present instance it is convenient to attribute Australia&#39;s present financial position to indifferent harvests, falling price levels, or the difficulty of raising loan moneys abroad. I do not for one moment wish to discount the influence which the peculiar circumstances mentioned have had upon our present position ; but I suggest that we should direct our attention to those things which we could have avoided, and can avoid in the future, rather than speak at length concerning those things which are entirely beyond our control. </para>
                <para>It would be well, therefore, if the present government learned a lesson from our political and industrial mistakes, which, to my mind, have played a far bigger part in bringing Australia into its present unfortunate position, than the incidence of indifferent seasons or falling price levels in the world&#39;s market. Indifferent seasons are not peculiar to Australia. Indeed, they are experienced by all countries that depend on agricultural production. No country can claim to be in anything like a sound position unless during its good seasons it builds up sufficient reserves to carry it over those periods of indifferent harvests that are common to all. For many years there has been ample evidence of falling price levels everywhere, and only those who were blind to economic truths could have thought it was possible for Australia to ignore the fact that prices for our exportable surplus, upon which we depend so largely, were bound to decrease in the world&#39;s markets. I say, therefore, that there is nothing extraordinary about what has happened to Australia - nothing that we were not entitled to expect, and certainly nothing that should not have been foreseen, and to some extent provided for. </para>
                <para>Before I proceed further I wish to tilt a lance against a statement made by the mover of the motion concerning what he termed the high standard of living in Australia. The honorable gentleman boasted about it, and declared that it was something that we should always strive to maintain. I am not particularly proud of our standard of living. Speaking with some knowledge of other countries, I can say without the fear of successful contradiction, that we have natural opportunities that are unequalled - that we have fewer natural difficulties than probably any other country. What troubles we have we have made for ourselves. I believe that our people, springing as they do from the finest stock in the world, and reared in a wonderful environment, should attain to a. high standard of living. When I hear people boasting about our enviable social and industrial conditions, I ask myself what does it all mean. It is true that in certain industries a considerable number of people are employed for short hours at high rates of wages. It is true also that in many of our cities, because of enormous appreciation iti land values, certain people who took advantage of a temporary financial boom resulting from over borrowing are rich beyond the dreams of avarice without having done a great deal by way of service to the community. But when we look further afield we find that even in our cities there is a large percentage of our people living in houses scarcely fit for human habitation, and under conditions that certainly do not justify us in boasting about our high standard of living. Only a small percentage of our. people are decently educated because State Governments declare that they cannot afford the necessary money to improve the educational standard of their citizens. In all our country districts there are people on the land toiling from daylight till dark, and many, unfortunately, are faced with a very uncertain if not a decidedly black future. </para>
                <para>I am not content to tall? about the high standard of living in Australia. I hope that instead of boasting about it the Government and its supporters will endeavour to insure to all our people a really high standard of living and comfort. </para>
                <para>To my mind there are four main causes for our present trouble. The first is our policy of borrowing money at high rates of interest for expenditure on public works costing a great deal more than they should. The second is the constant industrial turmoil and the restriction of the output of labour. The third is the persistence of government after government, encouraged all the time by a large section of the people, in endeavouring to formulate schemes for the expenditure of the people&#39;s money instead of allowing the people to spend it for themselves; and the fourth is the unwise policy of bolstering up certain industries without sufficient regard to the consequences of such action upon other industries. Obviously, the time at my disposal is quite inadequate for more than a fleeting survey of these four main causes of our present industrial and social trouble. </para>
                <para>The first cause cuts right across the &#163;34,000,000 migration agreement. In my opinion, that arrangement, was a bad one from the outset, because it represented an attempt on the part of the Imperial Government, the Commonwealth and State Governments to substitute schemes for sound economic principles. It is supposed to provide cheap money to be expended in Australia. Actually it will be the dearest money that Australia has ever borrowed. One has only to consider for a moment the cost of public works recently carried out to realize the truth of this statement. The facts relating to the cost of the River Murray irrigation scheme are somewhat startling. The estimated cost of those works - I am speaking without my book, but I am not far from the mark - was about &#163;4,000,000.  Up  to date, although three times that amount has been spent, they are still uncompleted, and experts are in doubt whether it is worth while going on with the scheme, because of the uncertainty that it will achieve the desired end. </para>
                <para>As regards soldier settlement, we had an illuminating statement this morning from the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly).</inline> We are all aware that our soldier settlement schemes have been extremely costly, and that the money spent on them has not gone as far as was expected. </para>
                <para>The Speech of His Excellency the Governor-General makes mention of railway construction proposals, and the unification of railway gauges. In 1921-22, when experts inquired into the proposal to construct the Grafton to South Brisbane railway - one section of the unification scheme - the cost was estimated at &#163;3,000,000. We have already appropriated &#163;4,000,000 for that work, and the Government is making provision for an additional &#163;350,000 to complete it. </para>
                <para>To give honorable senators some idea of the line of argument which I wish to follow, I remind them that in 1898 the people of Western Australia approved of the proposal to build what is known as the Coolgardie water scheme, at a cost of about &#163;3,000,000. That great undertaking was completed for about the sum mentioned, and since then extensions to important agricultural districts that were not contemplated at the time, have brought the total cost up to &#163;3,750,000. The interest charge on the first loan was 3 per cent, per annum, and the total interest charge on that great undertaking was &#163;90,000 per annum. Contrast that with a later public work undertaken in Sydney. In 1924, Sydney decided to build the North Shore bridge, estimated then to cost &#163;4,200,000. It is important to note that between 1898 and 1924 the general price levels had appreciated by about 64 per cent. Therefore, it may fairly be argued that had those two works been constructed at about the same time, the Coolgardie water scheme would have been the more costly undertaking.  But different  industrial methods are now in operation, and the Sydney Harbour bridge is now estimated to cost about &#163;6,000,000. In the case of the Coolgardie water scheme, the contractor took all the risks. He gave a price for the job, and had to see it through. Not so in the case of the contractor for the Sydney Harbour bridge. His contract protected him from any increase in wage costs. All additional charges due to the advance in wages have been thrown On the general community. I am not arguing that it would be possible in these days to induce contractors to tender for public works under conditions that obtained, say, 25 years ago. I am merely pointing out that in these later years we have to meet entirely different industrial conditions, and am endeavouring to show the consequences of these alterations. The two public works I have mentioned may be regarded as comparable undertakings, the Coolgardie water scheme being, if anything, the more costly. Yet the annual interest on that great work was only &#163;90,000, whereas the Sydney Harbour bridge, costing &#163;6,000,000, with rates of interest varying from 5i to 5&#163; per cent., will involve in interest alone about &#163;325,000 per annum. The smaller work having regard to comparative price levels cost three and a half times as much. Possibly the people of Sydney can afford to pay practically &#163;1,000 a day, which represents the interest cost of that huge undertaking; but I am certain that, although there are three times the number of people in Western Australia to-day that there were in 1898, and although the wealth and resources of that State have been substantially increased since then, an undertaking such as the Coolgardie water scheme would be utterly impossible at the present juncture. It would not stand a moment&#39;s investigation. It is important to realize that we have set up in Australia a  condi-  - tion of affairs under which it is impracticable to do that which is essential for the effective development of the Commonwealth. To me it is inevitable that a big inflow of money for the construction of public works all over Australia must have the effect of increasing the cost of such works. We cannot avoid it. It isone of the inevitable results of the law of supply and demand - that most beneficent law which, if left alone, compels the people to do that which they should do. It is a law which governments cannot put: out of office except at their peril. 1  referred just now to what some regard as the cheap money provided under the migration agreement, but which is, in effect, very dear. The money contributed to the States by the Commonwealth constitutes no element of cheapness, because in the end it has to come from the same source. It is the people who have to pay, and if the Commonwealth Government did not have to make these particular contributions to the States it would not have to. impose such oppressive income taxation as is now proposed. This so-called cheap money is not worth a snap of the fingers to the States. The arrangement under which we are now working has the effect of making the State authorities believe that they are receiving capital under easy conditions, and inducing them to put in hand works the construction of which they would otherwise consider very carefully. The cream of this scheme is soon skimmed off, and we are back to the position of borrowing money at high rates to pay for works at an abnormally high cost of construction. The only contribution we receive in the direction of making this money cheap is that received from the Imperial Government. In the original agreement, a sum of  &#163;130,000  was set down for each capital sum of  &#163;725,000  loaned to the States for expenditure on approved undertakings. In  1926  the British Government very generously, I think, increased this contribution from  &#163;130,000  to  &#163;150,000  for each capital sum of  &#163;725,000  advanced. What return does the Imperial Government receive for this gift to Australia? There is an undertaking on the part of Australia that each State will take one migrant in respect of every capital sum of  &#163;75  advanced by the Commonwealth to the States. It simply means that the Imperial Government makes a free gift to Australia of  &#163;15.  for each assisted migrant settled in Australia. Our obligation is to bring out a specified number of migrants within ten years, making a total, I think, of approximately  450,000  persons, of whom it is agreed that a little more than one-third shall be members of families without capital. We are not living up to our obligations. The year after this agreement was entered into there was a small increase in the number of assisted migrants; but in  1928  the number received was not one half of what it should have been under the agreement. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said yesterday that during the first nine months of this year there was an excess of immigrants over emigrants of about  3,000.  It is interesting to note that during that period only  9,000  assisted migrants were brought to Australia, or one-fourth of the number which should have been settled here. Apart from those  9,000  assisted migrants there was an actual increase of emigration over immigration during the first nine months of this year. If it had not been for the arrival of those  9,000  assisted migrants there would have been an excess of departures over arrivals. </para>
                <para>This agreement was framed under an act passed by the Imperial Parliament to assist overseas settlement. It had two principal features, one of which was the provision of cheap money and the other the settlement of migrants overseas. It is very easy for us to satisfy ourselves that the money will not be cheap, and equally easy to see that migration is not being stimulated. At a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held in May of this year it was decided to ask for a further amendment of the agree-, ment under which the Imperial Government should continue to make its contribution, and Australia would be relieved of any positive obligation in the matter of receiving migrants. That was a shameful proposition to be made by any country such as Australia. We entered into a bargain with the Imperial Government, which agreed that for every migrant settled in Australia it would give us  &#163;15;  if we cannot carry out our portion of the agreement why do we not say so? In the agreement itself provision is made for circumstances such as actually have arisen. It is stipulated that at the end of three years and of six years the position shall be reviewed and, if necessary, the Commonwealth shall return, with interest, any money it has received from the Imperial Government in excess of that to which it is entitled. Why cannot we hand back the amount we have improperly received? The Government should realize that this is not cheap money, and rather than continue as at present it should adopt an honorable course and say thai <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> it cannot carry out its part of the agreement, it does not expect the Imperial Government to he bound by it. 1 cannot understand any self-respecting country such as Australia, which boasts of a high standard of living, seeking to sponge upon the Imperial Government by asking it to carry out its obligations under the agreement and at the same time shirking its own responsibilities in that respect. 1 trust that this Government will study the subject from that viewpoint. </para>
                <para>Another reason for our present unfortunate position is industrial turmoil and the restriction of output. I do not wish io repeat what has been said concerning the cost of strikes; but. will place before i lie Senate a few facts which may be of interest. During the three and a half years in which I represented Western Australia as its Agent-General in London, 1 was consulted by many persons, many of whom were not directly interested in Western Australia, in regard to certain business proposals, for the further development of Australian resources. I admit, that in some cases the propositions were fantastic and entirely unsound. There were others&#39; that appealed to me and concerning which I was able to give prospective investors some useful information. During that period I was frequently confronted with the fact that strikes were occurring in Australia and that because of the uncertainty of a regular output there was a disinclination on the part of investors to invest capital here. Some will say that that is a libel on Australia, and that, as a matter of fact, there are fewer industrial disputes in this country than in others. But it is not outside investors alone who hold this view; the report was confirmed a fortnight ago that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> who is now in control of the Sunshine Harvester Works in  Victoria, has determined to remove the export branch of his business to Canada. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> is not adopting this course because the wages in Australia are higher than they are in the Dominion of Canada, but because of the industrial conditions which prevail here. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> after explaining the circumstances, said that his operations were not affected by strikes in his own industry, but by industrial disturb- ances on the waterfront, in the coal-mine-*, in the timber mills and other industries. He further said that his organization had been waiting for years in the hope of firmly establishing the export branch of his business in Australia; but  had eventually decided to transfer it to Canada, where the industrial conditionsenabled him to secure a regular output. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> is not transferring his works to a cheap-labour country; but to a sister Dominion where the wages of skilled workers are higher than they are in Australia. The transfer is- being made because there is some industrial certainty which is not available in Australia. </para>
                <para>The restriction of output is one of the worst features .of our industrial system. I am firmly convinced that the only way in which to make our country prosperous is by increasing the spending power of the whole of our people. That can bt achieved by increased production of wealth and by no other means. Let me cite an instance in point. I am not going to express an opinion as to whether the industrial trouble on the northern coalfields is due to a strike or to a lockout; but I know that there are probably 5,000 more miners engaged in that industry that can be profitably employed on full time, that the wages in some cases are high and the hours unnecessarily short. In the evidence given before the royal commission inquiring into the coalmining industry, it was stated that miners were being paid &#163;2 2s a day, although they were able to get through a day&#39;s work in from three and a half to five hours.&#39; The spending power of miners who receive full payment for a half-day&#39;s work is not any greater than when they -receive full pay for a whole day&#39;s work. But the community is robbed, and when they are not working full time the spending power of those engaged in the industry is reduced. If the whole of the Australian people were working full time we would soon be able to remove the economic difficulties which we are now experiencing. If the coal-miners received as much for producing a large quantity as for a small quantity the benefit would be distributed over all the industries of the country. I use coal-mining merely as an illustration, and &#39; I do not care what industry it is  applied to. Any industry in which production is artificially restricted becomes a burden on others - one which falls almost entirely on the working men and working women of this country, and with the greatest and cruellest severity on those who are unemployed. The worker has no greater enemy than the man who tells him that by restricting production he can leave a job open to some one else. The worker has no chance of prosperity except by the large production of wealth, and although he may think that he is hitting ut the capitalist or the fat mau when he takes steps to decrease the production, he never does anything of the kind. The capitalist or the fat man always passes? things on. It is always the worker that is hit. There is no more potent cause of unemployment in Australia than the slowing down of industry or the failure of industry -to produce the maximum amount of wealth. It is not without, significance that in Russia, where some of the leaders have at last studied economics, they have recently increased the hours of labour in factories in order to get rid of unemployment. It has always been the case that more work creates more work,, and idleness or partial employment always has been, and always will be, the most fruitful cause of unemployment. </para>
                <para>The third cause I give for our present position is the helping of people by government schemes, avid I think that the downfall of the late Government could be directly traced to- its helping the people by schemes. The late Treasurer, having year by year more money than he required or knew what to do with, was always casting round to see what he could do that would benefit the people. He saw that they wanted better roads. He did not concern himself with the fact, that road-making is no part of the functions of the Federal Government in accordance with the Federal Constitution. You may remember reading, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that in the final paragraph of his farewell message to the people of the United States of America, Washington, when he was retiring from the position of  President,  urged that the people, whatever they did, should remember that each government must, do its own job, and stick to its own job. The Treasurer of the last Commonwealth Government differed from Wash ington in that respect. He saw that roads were wanted and that the Commonwealth had the money, and so the Commonwealth Government started out on a Federal Aid Roads scheme under which the Commonwealth gave the States &#163;2,000,000 per annum on condition that the States provided <inline font-style="italic">&#163;&#38;,</inline> 500,000 per annum. What happened? In a year or two, under conditions that might very easily have been foreseen when money was no longer available, the Federal Treasurer, who had been so anxious to do things to help the people and had freely given them money, was obliged to turn round to them and say. &#34; You must give me some of it back.&#34; We know the result. </para>
                <para>The money expended under the Federal Aid Roads Scheme can be divided into four, perhaps not equal but very distinct parts. One part of the money lias been wasted - I make the statement, deliberately - in excess costs, just as money thai looks cheap or money that is easily goi always will be wasted to a large extent, whether it is obtained by the State or by the individual. It is open to demonstration that in a great many cases money has been extravagantly spent upon the construction of roads. I do not mean that a road has cost- a few hundreds of pounds more than it should have, but that it has cost thousands of pounds per mile more than should have been the case. A very distinct portion of the Federal Aid Roads grant has been wasted. </para>
                <para>A second part has been spent in providing quite unnecessary facilities in competition with existing facilities. T do not for a moment suggest, that we ought to stop building roads or that we should not take advantage of the most modern methods of transport, but I say that in the present position of Australian finances the construction of a road that to a large extent competes with an existing railway must be considered from a strictly economic aspect before it is undertaken. That has not always been the case in regard to the Federal Aid Roads scheme. </para>
                <para>The third part of the money has been used to provide means for luxury motoring in imported cars using imported spirits. It is the crowning extravagance of Australia to-day that so much money is spent in motoring, just for the sake of motoring; yet no one seems to have seen the humour of the situation when a Treasurer declared that the people must pay more for their whisky, tobacco and their amusements, in order that there should be no stoppage of luxury motoring on the roads. It may be a very fine thing to tax luxury, but to .tex one luxury in order to keep another going seems humorous to me. </para>

                    COLEBATCH.&#91;f the honorable senator would go to Sydney or any other city where motors are freely used, he would be amazed by the extent of luxury motoring on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Indeed,  Lt  is amazing that in a country like this - and it is the same in the Old Country where labour difficulties are so acute and where unemployment and suffering are so intense - that so much money should be available for expenditure in that direction.

                        <para>- I do not care how it is raised. We always come to the basic fact that all taxes fall on the industries of a country. There is no mysterious fund out of which we can raise money other than by taxing the industries of a country or by borrowing, and &#91; say that the present is an inopportune time for doing either of these things. </para>

                <para>Some remark has been made about the insistence of the late government on the building of roads under the Federal Aid Roads scheme by contract instead of by day labour. At every opportunity I have denounced this insistence, because I do not think that any Federal Government has the right to dictate to a State government how it should spend its money. If a State government, with its greater local knowledge, does not know the best way of doing work it should not have the money at all. Beyond that I hold for the strict letter of the Constitution : that whatever surplus revenue the Commonwealth has should be distributed among the States. I hope that the present occupants of the federal Treasury bench will not retaliate by insisting that, instead of the work being&#39; done by the contract system, it must be done by day labour, possibly on a 44-hour week, and also, possibly by the exclusive employment of trade unionists. That would merely be retaliation. I trust that the present Government will prove too big for an action of that kind. </para>
                <para>Another scheme to help the people which the late Government initiated was that of Commonwealth housing. Surely it was a splendid idea to help people to build homes to the extent of &#163;1,800 a house. But let us view the facts. The other day the  president  of the builders and contractors organization made a statement that the house which cost &#163;600 before the war now costs &#163;1,500. He was just about right. It is a far greater increase than the ordinary increase in price levels and it has been brought about largely because governments have been helping the people to build houses. Ever since the British Government started on housing schemes and began to help people to build houses the cost of building has increased. It was inevitable. It is like having a great big bran pie and. asking everyone to put in his hands and have a dip. In this case all have had a dip, the contractors, the men who have supplied material, and the workmen. The number of bricks laid per day has been reduced. All sections of the industry have combined to force up the cost of building. Years ago in the different States we had our little carefully-controlled workers&#39; homes schemes kept to a small level which was not of sufficient magnitude to disturb the ordinary position of the building industry, and they did an immense amount of good. But then the war service homes scheme came along. If some good had been done to the soldiers I would not have cared what it cost the country; but the soldier is the last man who ought to be thankful for the war service homes scheme because to-day he is paying for a house which cost double what it is worth. The further we go the higher the price we find we pay under this system of government assistance in the matter of housing, and the less value we receive for the home in which we live. Again I say that this helping of the people under the belief that the Government can do better for them with their own money than they can do themselves is a very fruitful cause of the trouble in which we find ourselves to-day. </para>
                <para>The fourth cause for our present position is the bolstering of industries. We are told that &#163;350,000 is to be given to the State of South Australia this year, and further sums in the next year and the year after. It is far less than the amount South Australia is entitled to receive, not as a gift, but as a right. This matter has been investigated by no less than five independent commissions, each of which has come to the conclusion that the fiscal policy of Australia by discriminating between industries, and by bolstering secondary at. the expense of primary industries, has cast an overwhelming burden on Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. This is not an appropriate occasion to deal with this matter; we can discuss it better on the budget, but having had an opportunity to follow carefully the whole of the investigations of all these commissions, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the annual loss that each of these three States has sustained has been more than double the highest amount that any one of them has received in any single year by way of a special grant from the Commonwealth. People say that Western Australia is to-day in a very prosperous condition. It is, and I hope that it will always remain prosperous, but those of us who are familiar with the conditions of the State know full well that if it had not been for the drought in the Western Hemisphere - in America, Canada and the Argen tine - which fortunately kept up the price of wheat for us, we should have been in difficulties this year. And if the price of wheat falls much lower than it is to-day we shall be in difficulties next year. We are told that in Western Australia we are extending our wheat-growing too far into unsafe rainfall areas. Are we going to accept the position that in Australia we can do these things only in the most favorable localities and that we must not go a step further because it is unsafe? Surely if our industries are to be sound they must be on such an economic basis that we can face seasonal variations - that we can make sufficient profit during good seasons to enable us to build up an adequate reserve to tide over bad times. If we are going to adopt the policy that we should not penetrate beyond a certain point because of scanty rainfall and the knowledge that we would strike an occasional bad season, we shall bring our industry down to such a level that the development of Australia will be retarded. </para>

                    COLEBATCH.Certainly not, because that could never be made to pay. But mention was made about the areas around Southern Cross. There, except during occasional bad seasons, farmers reap fine returns, and I dare say that there are similar places in South Australia from which excellent returns would be received in good seasons. If we are going to restrict our activities to the most productive areas, we shall minimize the progress of our people, and retard the development of Australia.

                <para>Mention was made of the wine bounty and we were told that it should be continued until the industry is able to stand on its own feet. I should like any honorable senator to tell me of a single Australian industry that has been protected or bonused and now stands on its own feet. Is there one? Is it not a fact that every time you begin to protect or bonus an industry you decrease its capacity to look after itself, and continue to be greeted with the cry, &#34; More bounties, more protection.&#34; Honorable senators may review every industry in Australia that is protected or bonused, and, whether the industry is primary or secondary; whether it be sugar, butter, or wine, they will find the one result. So, instead of this system setting an industry on its feet, it knocks its feet from under it; in fact, such industries never have any feet to stand on except bonuses, and invariably the heavy bonuses have to be borne by the non-bonused industries. </para>
                <para>I want to say a word or two about unemployment, and to quote a resolution carried yesterday at the conference of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. It reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Recognizing that unemployment is the most important question affecting the social and industrial life of the Australian people, this conference calls upon the Federal Government to introduce immediately an unemployment insurance scheme which will provide for every unemployed person getting at least the Commonwealth basic wage whilst unemployed, and resolves that this request be forwarded to the Prime Minister. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I know perfectly well that the Prime Minister will not accede to that request. I am not inferring that this Government will take such a rash step. But what an example of extraordinary ignorance of the first principles of economics ! What would be the unhappy fate of those who were in work if all those out of work received award wages? Out of what fund could those award wages come except out of the pockets of those who were in work ? The inevitable consequence of a provision of that kind would be an increase of unemployment, and the lot of the worker would be made far worse than it is to-day. </para>
                <para>The passage in His Excellency the Governor-General&#39;s Speech in reference to the gold reserve is not sufficiently clear to justify much in the way of comment, but. I take it that it is in some way associated with the note issue which certainly should be regulated by the requirements of industry. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that there is any great harm in the present percentage rates of the gold reserve being decreased, or with having a larger note issue in comparison with our gold reserve, provided that it is done in the natural way - in accordance with the requirements of industry. These requirements of industry fluctuate, and will direct the proper course to be followed. But if any Government is going to interfere and try to force an artificial increase in thenote issue, we shall soon find ourselves in a peculiar position. For many years Governments have been borrowing money which they really did not need, and I do not think that it would be really surprising if they began to lend money that they do not possess. </para>

                <para>I wish to make reference to the remarks that have been directed to the employment of Southern Europeans in Australia.I do not mind much what steps a Government takes to exclude Southern Europeans provided that, at the same time, provision is made for the admission of a sufficiently generous flow of Britishers to enable us to build up our population. But I most definitely take up the attitude that when a Southern European or anybody else is admitted to the country, he is entitled to fair treatment. It is utterly wrong to discriminate against them. There was atime when people said that they did not mind the admission of Southern Europeans provided that they did not congregate in our cities. Wow there is a protest because Southern Europeans are working on our roads, and developing our farms. There is not one city in Australia in which the fruit and fish shops are not almost wholly conducted by Southern Europeans. Australians have been driven entirely out of the business by industrial conditions which are entirely unsound and false economically. That is an illustration of where you land yourself when you set out to defy the laws of supply and demand. Apparently those who look askance at Southern Europeans are reconciled to their having nice &#34;cushy&#39;&#39; jobs in the cities. But that does not mean that we are able to purchase cheap fruits as the foreigners charge top prices for their wares. And now people are starting an outcry that Southern Europeans are working on our roads and opening up our land. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not argue whether they cut wages or not, but without fear of contradiction, 1 say that if they work the community and other workers reap an advantage. My only objection to the Southern European as a migrant, is that it is difficult to get him to become assimilated into our community. That is especially so of the Italian, who always has his eye on his own country and is anxious to return to it. I have spent a great deal of time in Italy, and some time in Scotland. I can understand why the Scotsman never wants to go away from Australia, and why the Italian always desires to return to Italy. Italy is just as beautiful as Australia; more attractive, indeed, to the Italian, because there he has his own people; it is his own land. </para>

                <para>The subject of defence has been treated by the experts, and I shall not touch upon it except to say that, as a father, my impression of compulsory military training is that it makes better chaps of our boys. A little bit of discipline is good for everybody. Discipline is really the foundation of an independent spirit. I do not think that any undisciplined person ever has a really independent spirit. You cannot control others until you have learnt self-control. Compulsory training taught young fellows to stand upright, and to look their fellow men in the face. T must admit that I was not impressed with the statement on behalf of the late Government by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Glasgow that it discontinued military training in country districts because it cost a little more than similar training in the cities. That is not giving a fair spin to the country towns, and it is setting a bad example to those who come after. </para>
                <para>We have heard a lot of talk about Russia. I know so little about my own country that I would not dare to dogmatize about another, but I have had some opportunity to study the constitution of Russia, aud I commend two principles of that constitution, not merely to the present occupants of the treasury bench, but to the people of this country generally. The first of those principles is that it is not merely the responsibility, but the privilege, of every worker to be trained in arms so that he may defend his country. The second principle is expressed, so far as the accuracy of the translation can be trusted, in these words, &#34; It is the duty of every citizen of the Soviet to work, under the principle that he who does not work, neither shall he eat.&#34; The present condition of Russia is probably not much worse than it has been for many centuries. That unfortunate country may be on the way to something better. We all hope that it is. If it. is to achieve something better, I firmly believe that that will be done by insistence on those two principles : work, and a feeling of responsibility and privilege, and the need to prepare oneself for the defence of one&#39;s country. With us there seems to be an inclination to rely entirely upon the League of Nations. 1 am a great believer in the League of Nations, but I cannot close my eyes to the fact that, right, through the centuries, all wars have had economic causes. Is the world to-day removing the economic causes of war? The United States of America is the country from which peace pacts come. That country is insisting upon the payment to the last farthing of war loans which were, shall I say, rather usuriously lent to the Allies. The United States of America is building its tariff wall higher and higher against trade with other countries, and it is increasing its policy of excluding other peoples from its shores. Do we find in the United States of America, the great protagonist of peace pacts, such a revision of economic policy as would suggest to us that there is no danger of wars in the future? And what are we doing? We are talking about relying on the League of Nations and at the same time flying in the face of the very things that that league is asking us to do. We are building up higher tariffs and granting higher bounties, while the League of Nations pleads for a tariff holiday and the cessation of government bounties on all articles. We refuse to do what the league requests. We continue to do &#39;exactly what we like, aud yet rely upon that league to save us from getting into trouble. We insist, and quite properly so,on the absolute control of our own affairs, particularly in regard to that splendid ideal, the White Australia policy, from which I firmly believe no party in this country would ever depart. But it is inconsistent for us to ask the League of Nations to give us any help while at the same time we ignore its requests, and, with a population of but 6&#188; millions, and an enormous country with tremendous potential wealth and resources, declare that we have no room for more people, even those of our own kith and kin. I do not deny that we should work for the League of Nations and for peace, but we have to remember that the poet&#39;s conception is not yet complete. While we have - </para>

In no partisan spirit, in no spirit of criticism for what it has done, I beg the Government to recognize, and to live up to the recognition, that the first obligation of any government is to make adequate provision for its country&#39;s defence. </para>

                GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia &#91;3.19&#93; .   -  Although I realize that Ministers are as yet new to their duties, I must say that in my parliamentary experience, which dates back to the inception of the Federal Parliament, to-day is the first time that I have known Ministers so to disregard their duty as not to remain in the chamber during a debate. Just now, when the debate on the Address-in-Reply was adjourned, we were in the extraordinary position of having no Minister in the chamber to fix even so small a matter as the date of the resumption of the debate. I thought that in moving the adjournment the Vice-President of the Executive Council would have given some explanation of his absence from the chamber, as otherwise that absence can be regarded only as an act of discourtesy.

                    <para>The Labour Council last night decided to declare &#34; black &#34; the industrial peace conference convened by the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scull</inline> in. It was agreed that the council should not be represented at the gathering. Instructions will be forwarded to the delegates from the council at present attending the executive meeting of the All-Australian Council of Trade Unions in Melbourne, Messrs. J.  Kavanagh and J. Hooke, to more for the rescission of the motion recently carried by the executive agreeing to representation at the conference. The decision of the council represented a victory for the Communists, who have been uncompromisingly opposed to aims and ideals of the peace conference. Its determination is likely to place the Assistant Minister for Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beasley,</inline> in an embarrassing position. He will be compelled to choose between allegiance to his chief, who convened the gathering, and the Labour Council, whose influence was largely responsible for his elevation to the Cabinet. </para>

I hope that he and his colleagues will not allow themselves  to be  dictated to  by  any outside organization. </para>

If honorable senators desire to assist the Government to bring about permanent industrial peace and better relations between employers and employees, they will refrain from quoting articles of the nature of the one just read. The Government owes no allegiance to any body outside the body politic that elected it. It will shoulder its responsibilities, irrespective of the opinions of any section of the community. </para>

                        <para>- The Government will go on with the conference, if it can be arranged. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> must recognize the right of any trade union organization, such as the Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales, to express its opinion as to the probable results of any conference that may be held. The Government can do no more than invite the representatives of employers and employees to meet. It must leave it to the good sense of both sides in industry to decide whether or not they will attend the conference. Should the Employers Federation decide not to attend the conference, the Government could not compel them to do so; but it believes that if if can get the parties together, it will have gone a good way towards bringing about those relations in industry which we all desire. It is anxious to secure the cooperation of all sections in framing its industrial legislation. I ask honorable senators not to be scared by headlines in the press, or even to seek cheap notoriety by drawing attention to them ; but to assist the Government in its endeavour to bring about industrial peace. Until they have reason to believe otherwise, they should give the Government credit for sincerity of purpose. If they do that, I feel that they will realize before long that their confidence in the Government has not been misplaced. </para>
