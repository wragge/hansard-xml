                <para>My reason for doing so is that the Life Insurance Bill at present before the Senate is of a technical character,  and  of such importance that the societies and. organizations affected by it have made representations that they desire further time to consider its provisions. The Government has consulted those institutions very freely, and has no desire to overlook any further representations that they may wish to make by pressing the measure through at this juncture. It is, therefore, proposed to adjourn the Senate now. I have given notice of motion today for leave to introduce a bill relating to arbitration in the Commonwealth Public Service, and I propose to ask the Senate to-morrow to agree to the suspension of the Standing and Sessional Orders to enable me to make my second-reading speech on that bill forthwith. The debate &#39;can then be adjourned. The suggestion* is that the. Senate should deal with that measure next week, the Life Insurance Bill being allowed to stand over for a time. I make an appeal to those interested in the Life Insurance Bill to bring their considerations to a conclusion and. to make their representations so that the Senate may be able to proceed with that measure towards the end of next week, or during the following week. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Leader of the Senate will reconsider the order of business for next week. The right honorable gentleman is rightly giving those interested in the Life Insurance Bill every opportunity to consider that important measure, but I am confident that honorable senators also realize that the proposed legislation in connexion with Public Service Arbitration is of vital importance to Commonwealth public servants. The bill will be introduced tomorrow, and Commonwealth public servants throughout Australia are expected to make themselves familiar with its contents by the time that the debate opens next Wednesday. I respectfully suggest to the right honorable the Leader of the Senate that we might conveniently discuss the budget next week, thus allowing members of the Commonwealth Public Service another week in which to study this proposed legislation which so vitally affects them. </para>
