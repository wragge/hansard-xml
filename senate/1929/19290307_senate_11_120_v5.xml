The payment of a war pension to a member of the forces within the meaning of the War Pensions Act or the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Act constitutes income for the purpose of determining a claim for invalid pension, but does not constitute income for the purpose of determining a claim for old-age pension. A war pension to a dependant of a member of the forces does not constitute income for the purpose of determining a claim for either invalid or old-age pension. The amount of war pension is also taken into account in connexion with the adequate maintenance provisions contained in section 22 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. </para>

            <para>. - I listened with a great deal of interest to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> when moving the second reading of this bill. During his speech the right honorable gentleman attempted to place upon the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, and to some extent upon the members of the Opposition the responsibility for pillaging which he said had decreased considerably since the Transport Workers Act had been in operation. The inference to be drawn from his statement was that the members of the Waterside Workers Federation were dishonest, and that because honorable members on this side of the chamber opposed that act, they were also involved. All I have to say in that regard is that the right honorable gentleman would not dare to make that statement outside the chamber. </para>

              <para>- I am not saying that the right honorable gentleman made the statement in those definite terms, but I contend that the inference to be drawn from his remarks was that the Labour party approved of what had been done. However, since the Leader of the Senate denies having used those words, I accept his assurance. In the course of his speech he quoted from an award given by Judge Beeby which, we contend, was responsible for a great deal of the trouble on the waterfront last year. Honorable senators will recall that Judge Beeby made provision for two pick-ups instead of one, although the employers had not asked for the second pick-up. It was this provision in the award that led to the trouble on the waterfront. The Leader of the Senate referred also to the provision in this bill for the cancellation of licences, and instanced, in support of his argument, a number of assaults individually and in company, that had been made on volunteer workers last year. Clearly the inference to be drawn from his remarks was that the Waterside Workers Union and the members of that organization were responsible for these acts of lawlessness. The right honorable gentleman went on to argue that in view of all that had happened, it was only right that mcn engaged on the waterfront should be obliged to take out licences. </para>

          <para>The act passed towards the end of last session authorized the Government to make regulations to deal with the troubleon the waterfront, and it is proposed now to give those regulations the force of statute law by including them in this bill. I have no doubt that other honorable senators remember the time when the Leader of the Senate subscribed to the view that membership of a union should be the only qualification required of a man seeking work in Australia. He then had no thought of licences for workers. I remind him also that the question of preference to unionists was responsible for the only double dissolution that has taken place in the history of this Parliament, and that whilst he was a member of the Labour party he was always a staunch supporter of that principle. The right honorable gentleman had a good deal to say in regard to the Preference Prohibition Bill, when that measure was before this chamber in 1913. It is hardly necessary for me to remind honorable senators that that was before the Minister was in his present company. He was not then a member of a Government, which, during the last four or five years, has introduced so many legislative measures of a most provocative, repellant and repulsive nature. When speaking to the Preference Prohibition Bill on the 11th December, 1913, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce said - </para>

            <para>I have myself been the recipient of that treatment. Before the Arbitration Act came into force in Western Australia I was victimized and refused employment, not because I was an inefficient workman, since I was always able to get more than the average wage which other workmen in the same employment were receiving, not because of anything against my character, but simply because I, as a trade unionist, had voted publicly the feelings of those who worked in the trade with which I was associated. </para>

            <para>When employment is offering, we have on the one hand the man who has sacrificed his time and his money to build up a union which will enable our arbitration machinery to work satisfactorily, and which will prevent strikes and industrial disputes by availing itself of the legislation which Parliament has enacted for that purpose. On the other hand, we have the non-unionist, of equal ability as a workman, but one who has done nothing to provide machinery to make our arbitration legislation work satisfactorily. In all justice, which of these two should be granted a prefer.ence by the Commonwealth? Surely it is the man who, recognizing the law that the Commonwealth has enacted, spends his time, his money, and his energy, to provide the machinery which will enable that law to work rather than the individual who, by the fact that he is a non-unionist, would make the law absolutely useless and unworkable. </para>

              <para>- The right honorable gentleman did not on that occasion suggest that licences should be issued to permit men to go to work. He stressed the need for a man to possess a union ticket, and the desirability of giving preference to those who had spent their money and energy in building up their unions. To-day he states that members of the waterside workers&#39; organizations must not be granted employment unless they possess licences to work. The Leader of the Senate has somersaulted and now asks that preference should be given to volunteers, and not to members of an organization. </para>

          <para>In his speech yesterday, the right honorable gentleman quoted certain results of volunteer labour, and alleged that, on the waterfront, the volunteer had done more work than the union member. As a contrast, I shall read a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Duckham, the  chairman  of the &#34;Big Four,&#34; the British Economic Delegation, which recently visited Australia. It reads - </para>

          <para class="block">Compare that with another statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> yesterday, wherein he endeavoured to lead the people- of Australia to believe that the Australian workman, and particularly a member of the waterside workers&#39; organization, was the worst in the world. The Leader of the Senate inferred that members of that organization were parties to the dastardly bombing outrages that have occurred in Melbourne. Let me compare that with a statement made by the Victorian Commissioner of Police,&#34; General Blarney, who, appealing to the men on the waterfront and the public generally to assist the police in detecting the bombers, said - </para>

The bill should be withdrawn. There exists to-day a desire for peace in industry, and the Labour party and industrial organizations of Australia have shown their bona fides by meeting the employers in conference. The management committee of the peace conference is still functioning. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> (Honorary Minister) said recently in this chamber - </para>

          <para class="block">I echo the sentiment. And just as there is a deep-seated feeling among the people of America to further the coming of world peace and to prevent another world war, and its shambles, so there exists in Australia to-day a deep-seated desire to inaugurate and preserve industrial peace. But legislation of this nature will destroy rather than stimulate that feeling. Why should the Government sabotage our peace machinery by throwing into it this spanner, the Transport Workers Bill? No specific dispute exists on the waterfront and, that being so, why should we perpetuate the folly of last year? By doing so we may destroy the desire for industrial peace. Are honorable senators opposite sincere in their desire to bring about and maintain industrial peace ? If they are I urge them to purge the statute-book of legislation of this nature. It is not necessary. The measure deals entirely with transport workers and the men engaged on our waterfront. The original act was introduced in a moment of hysteria by the Government of to-day, and it might be worth while directing our memories back to that occasion. It is true that there was at the time an upheaval on the waterfront and that the political and industrial leaders of labour were doing their utmost to bring about its settlement. It is also true that that dispute was about to be settled, as a result of the deliberations of the political and industrial leaders of labour. Then this piece of legislation was thrown upon the table of another place, and all chance of ending the dispute immediately vanished. At that time a general election was imminent. The Government introduced that legislation, not to promote peace on the waterfront, but as political propaganda, in order to ensure its return to the Treasury bench. Now, safely entrenched there, it has introduced this legislation. </para>

              <para>- The legislation introduced by this Government will not. tend towards industrial peace. In August, 192S, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham,</inline> at that time Attorney-General, but now also Minister for Industry, said that it was a mistake for either side to look to parliament to settle  its differences. Yet he now claims that a measure of this kind will tend towards industrial peace. Sooner or later the Government must realize that it cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. It cannot insist on awards being observed by outside employers and refuse to honour awards applicable to its own employees. Let us consider the position in the coal industry to-day. An award given by a special industrial tribunal is in existence, but it is not being obeyed by the employers, .who only last week dismissed 17,000 miners from their employ. The reason given by the employers for those dismissals was that the industry was no longer profitable to them. </para>

              <para>- They said that they could not run the mines at a profit, and that consequently the men must be dismissed. Although those men were working under an award, the Government did not introduce legislation to penalize the coal-owners, but it did not <inline font-style="italic">hesitate</inline> to legislate to penalize men on the wharf who, dissatisfied with the Beeby award, determined that they would not work under it. The coal-owners can with impunity dismiss their employees when it  suits them to do so,but the waterside workers must abide by the award of the court willy-nilly, or be dismissed, and the men who take their places must be licensed to work. Where is the consistency of a Government that came into power six years ago on the slogan that it was a Government for the poor and not the rich? Can anyone point to a single piece of legislation it has placed on the statute-book that has improved the position of the workers of Australia? As a matter of fact all its industrial legislation has served to make their position worse. I contrast the attitude of the Government towards the transport workers with its attitude towards the coal-owners who are permitted to dismiss their employees on the ground that they are unable to continue operations under an industrial award. </para>

          <para>The Government claims that at the last election it was given a mandate to pass this bill. Let me show what sort of a mandate it was given. At the 1925 general elections 1,262,912 votes were cast for Labour candidates and 1,542,090 for anti-Labour candidates, the antiLabour majority being 279,178. At the general elections held last year, while the anti-Labour vote decreased to 1,449,169, the Labour votes increased to 1,422,418. The anti-Labour majority dropped to 27,039. If that drop continues over the next elections, it will mean good-bye to the present Government. The people of Australia gave a quarter of a million votes more to Labour candidates in 1928 than they gave to them in 1925. If my friends think that they have a mandate for this legislation because they secured a majority of 27,039 votes, I wish them luck. </para>

              <para>- It may be allowed to remain in abeyance. In any case, if the honorable senator does not think my amendment goes far enough he or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> can move so to amend it as to include the principle act also. It is time to call a halt. Instead of passing provocative legislation, let the Peace in Industry Conference function in the knowledge that not only the people of Australia but also the Government which glibly preaches the doctrine of peace in industry, but departs from its pledges immediately after an election, is desirous of bringing about industrial peace. Honorable senators of the Opposition cannot agree to the bill. It is tyrannical and opposed to the best interests of Australia. It is an attack on the workers of Australia, and will defeat all attempts to preserve industrial peace. For these and other reasons which I could adduce it is my intention, if my amendment is defeated, to vote against the second reading. </para>

            <para>.- This bill is&#39; unlike any that has been introduced into this or any other Parliament in Australia since the establishment of responsible government. It is alien to Australia, and is bitterly resented by the working classes of this country. Time and again the Opposition have emphasized the fact that the present Government has declared war on organized labour, and is determined, with the help of its supporters, to weaken unionism, industrially and financially, as long as it remains in possession of the Treasury bench. One would gather from statements made by responsible members of the Government that industrial unrest and industrial disputes are confined to the Commonwealth. That is not so. As a matter of fact, they are world-wide, yet in no other parliament, so far as I am able to ascertain, has legislation similar to that now before us been submitted. To the Australian workmen, unionism is a sacred principle. Without unionism there would be no Arbitration Court. It is because we have organized labour and organizations of employers that official representatives of Labour from time to time file plaints in the Arbitration Court, and the court makes awards that are binding upon the unions. No one can deny that the licensing provisions of this measure absolutely disregard the Arbitration Court and its awards, and to that extent it is a direct attack upon trades unionism. </para>

          <para>Interesting speeches on this bill have been made in another place. I share the views expressed there by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> who is better qualified than any other member of the Nationalist party to speak on such a measure as this, for the reason that he was for years closely associated with trade unionism. For many years he played a prominent part in the settlement of disputes on the waterfront in Australia; for years be advised the Australian workers, particularly those employed on the waterfront to join trade unions, to strengthen their organizations and to win by these means the rewards to which they are entitled. When speaking on this measure in another place, the right honorable gentleman said - </para>

              <para>- It is amusing to hear the childlike arguments advanced by the Minister in an attempt to strengthen his weak case for the licensing of waterside workers. He seeks to draw an analogy between the licences for which this bill provides and those issued to doctors, plumbers, electricians and others. Licences are issued to plumbers and electricians in order to safeguard the community. </para>

              <para>- Licences are issued to doctors to safeguard the interests and health of the community, and that form of licensing or registration, unlike that for which this bill provides, is not partial in its application. Licences are issued to those engaged in particular professions and callings as a guarantee to the community that licensed persons are competent and efficient, but in the case of the waterside workers, they are issued to men whether they are efficient or  incompetent; whether they are physically fit or unfit. There are working on the waterfront of Australia to-day men who are licensed, there are others who are not. I did not think that in my day and generation a Federal Government would introduce legislation under which it would be compulsory for any human being to take out a licence in order to have the right to work. A licence having been  isued  to a worker, he is to obey lawful commands. Commands by whom? Not a judge of the Arbitration Court, or an award made by a judge, but the lawful commands of his employers. </para>

Why should we give such a person authority toorder men to do certain things that may not be provided for in an award of the Arbitration Court ? If a man is unable to do what he is commanded to do he is forthwith to lose his licence and to be deprived of his means of livelihood for a lengthy period. To deprive a man of his livelihood for twelve months or for a longer period is not only wrong, it is inhuman.&#39; Then again preference is to be given to those who take out licences and priority of employment is to be given to so-called volunteers who are not members of the Waterside Workers&#39; Federation. </para>

I have perused the report of that commission and have failed to find in it any words in support of the Minister&#39;s statement. It is true that there has been pillaging, but it is also true that there has been much pillaging of cargoes before the ships have arrived in Australia. That is shown in the report furnished by the commission. According to the evidence taken by the commission in Melbourne, there has been pillaging of overseas cargoes -to a serious extent, and to a considerably lesser extent of interstate cargoes.

            <para>Conclusive evidence has been furnished as to the stealing of cargo taking place prior to shipment in the country of export, by the arrival of cases in a sound and apparently untampered-with condition and by the discovery of rubbish in the place of goods in the cases when opened, also by the substitution of cases similar in appearance also containing only rubbish. The following are a few instances out of many similar cases where it is improbable that pillage took place elsewhere than prior to shipment, namely : - </para>
            <para>In February, 1920, three cases invoiced as containing wood drills, <inline font-style="italic">em</inline> s.s. <inline font-style="italic">City of Madras,</inline> from New York, were found to contain sash weights and bags. </para>
            <para>In June or July, 1920, three cases invoiced as containing Cleveland twist drills, <inline font-style="italic">exs.s. City of Madras,</inline> from New York, were found to contain scrap iron, straw, and a New York newspaper dated between the date the goods left the warehouse and the date of shipment. The consignees stated that the cases were not the original cases, as the wood and binding differed from the cases used by the exporter, and that the ones received must have been substituted and the marks imitated. It was also stated that the cases must have been weighed, as weights were marked thereon which tallied with the weights shown in the invoices. </para>
            <para>About October, 1920, a case invoiced as containing motor accessories, <inline font-style="italic">exs.s. Caroline,</inline> from England, was found to be filled with paper. </para>
            <para>On the 1st December, 1920, a case invoicedas containing 100 dozen pairs of ladies&#39; hose, <inline font-style="italic">exs.s. City of Edinburgh,</inline> from New York, was found to contain only rubbish, empty boxes, old clothes, and sacks branded &#34; New York.&#34; The case appeared to be light in weight. </para>
            <para>On the 2nd December, 1920, a case invoiced as containing hosiery, <inline font-style="italic">exs.s.</inline> Port <inline font-style="italic">Stephens,</inline> from New York, was found to be filled with stable manure and old clothes. </para>
            <para>In December last, three cases invoiced as containing silk gloves,exs.s. <inline font-style="italic">Somerset,</inline> from New York, were found to contain leather clippings, bricks, wood, old American railroad weighbills, and old American magazines and newspapers. </para>
            <para>Also, in December last, one case invoiced as containing cotton voile, <inline font-style="italic">exs.s. City of Edinburgh,</inline> from New York, was found to contain straw packing and stones. </para>

            <para>The evidence shows that a large amount of what may be termed scientific thieving of cargo takes place prior to shipment in the country of export, especially in America, where probably gangs of thieves carry on the work as a remunerative business proposition..... </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That does not confirm the statement made by the Minister. On the contrary, it disproves it. </para>
          <para>The report states that thieving takes place in most countries, and that there is extensive pillaging on board vessels before they arrive at Australian ports. It is true that the report mentions evidence of pillaging at Australian ports, but does any one believe that the licensing of men seeking employment on our waterfront will prevent that in future? The Minister has admitted that, since the issue of licences there have been seven cases of pillaging and a number of assaults. He states that those responsible for these acts of lawlessness represent a minority associated with organized Labour, and that80 per cent. of the members of our waterside workers&#39; organizations welcome this class of legislation. I wish the Leader of the Senate would go down to the waterfront at any of our principal capital cities and say to this 80 per cent. of our waterside workers: - &#34;I am glad to know that you see eye to eye with me and the Government in this matter. I am glad that you are as anxious as we are to have the licensing system introduced at the different ports of Australia, embodied in an Act of Parliament, which provides that you may hold your licence to work during good behaviour.&#34; I should like to hear the right honorable gentleman speak to the waterside workers in that fashion. I know what kind of a reception he would get. </para>
          <para>I know also what were the views of the right honorable gentleman many years ago, when he lived in a political atmosphere entirely different from that in which he finds himself in to-day. In those days he, like myself, was a unionist. I still am, whereas he to-day is not a believer in the principle of unionism. I still believe in the cardinal principle of democracy - majority rule. It is impossible to govern organizations by any other rule. I have been associated with trade unionism for a great number of years, and have played my part in industrial disputes, some of which it has been my good fortune to assist to settle. There have been times when I could not see eye to eye with my fellow trade unionists, but as a true unionist myself, and a firm believer in majority rule, I always gave unswerving loyalty to that principle and at all times was prepared to cast in my lot with the majority. What would be the position of the Leader of the Senate if he were associated with the waterside workers to-day? If one may judge by his speech when moving the second reading of this bill, he would have to say to his fellow unionists, &#34;I am with you up to a certain point. I shall go with you for a certain distance but no further. I intend to forsake my lifelong principles and become a volunteer worker, so that I may go out of the union and fight against you.&#34; That would be his position to-day if he acted up to the views he expressed in his second-reading speech. He would be a believer in the principle of trade unionism up to only a certain point. But may I remind honorable senators that the whole-hearted support of its principles is necessary for the success of any organization. </para>
          <para>I understand that even members of the Nationalist party have serious differences at times in the party room, and that occasionally a good deal of bitterness is engendered in the family circle. I understand also that one or two members of the party sometimes take an independent stand because they conscientiously believe that the course mapped out by the majority is not the right one, and, in their view, will lead the party to disaster. But as loyal party supporters in the end they are prepared to sink their individuality, to set aside their personal convictions, and work with the majority. Occasionally there is a breakaway; sometimes I believe there are &#34;wigs on the green,&#34; and there are some in the party who would like to ostracize those who break away. We know, however, that in the end they realize that is is better to work as a united party than to be disunited. And so it is with trade unionism. Many years ago the conditions of men engaged on the waterfront were damnable. By means of organized effort some improvement has been secured and the men have determined to hold fast to whatever privileges they have enjoyed in more recent years. Whatever may be the views of honorable senators opposite concerning the dispute on the waterfront no one will for a moment believe that the waterside workers took such . a definite stand against the Beeby award out of sheer cussedness. They know only too well the suffering that is their lot whenever industrial troubles occur, that it goes without saying that they did not enter blindly into this fight. They were prepared to take their chance. They and their families are now suffering greatly, but the wives are just as determined as the men. </para>

              <para>- While these men and their womenfolk are enduring privation, the Government comes along with this measure and literally says to the men who have brightened the work on the waterfront by their sterling service and self-sacrificing efforts : &#34; You took a wrong course by disobeying the award of the court and you have been very badly beaten. We will show you no mercy. We have the big stick and will wield it unmercifully on you and all those who profess friendship towards unionism. Although you have undergone privation and suffering, and although you may he highly efficient and model citizens of Australia, you shall no longer have preference on the waterfront. Preference shall be given to those who do not belong to an organization, although they may be absolutely unfit for their task.&#34; Because it suits, for the moment, the convenience of the employers, these licences are being issued to volunteer workers and every encouragement is given to these men - who are really strike-breakers - in order to weaken organized labour and multiply the privations and sufferings of the unionists engaged in waterside work. </para>

          <para>The Labour party is not anxious to bring about industrial strife. It seeks to establish industrial peace. Strikes are a last resort, and men are at times goaded into them. The trouble which precipitated the Government into introducing this bill could have been settled very easily. But the Government was not anxious to have peace in industry. At a time when conciliatory action was essential it introduced legislation the only effect of which was to inflame and embitter the workers. At the time of its introduction the shipowners and employees, under the aegis of the then Victorian Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hogan)</inline> were negotiating to bring about a settlement, and a settlement would have been arrived at in a few days. </para>

          <para>I admit that the Government temporarily has a majority in this Senate, but figuratively speaking, it may be in a minority on the morrow. We know that the whirligig of time brings its revenges. Time marks many changes in human activity politically, industrially, commercially and financially. A change has taken place in the industrial outlook. The world has awakened. The workers are realizing that they are not obtaining that reward to which they are justly entitled. There is no gainsaying the fact that those who perform the world&#39;s heaviest tasks are the least rewarded. True, their hours have been shortened. But by whom? Not by the party opposite, which has placed every obstacle in the pathway of industrial progess in Australia. In days gone by that party regarded unionism as anathema. Its followers then said, and some of them are saying it to-day, although they dare not voice their condemnation so vigorously, that labour should be governed by the law of supply and demand; that it should be treated as a commodity; that if there is an excess labour market those seeking work should accept what the employer offers. Such individuals seek to weaken, and, if possible, to force unionism into a moribund condition. </para>
          <para>This bill seeks to inflict punishment of the worstkind upon unionists. Already fines have been inflicted upon men who have done their utmost to prevent the spread of industrial trouble. If the measure is placed upon the statute-book it will afford a very bad advertisement for Australia, which is supposed to be ahead of most other countries in the world in the matter of legislation. Certainly it will be in the backwash of nations if the Government passes this bill&#39;. The Leader of the Senate said yesterday, that licensing systems of a similar nature prevailed in other parts of the world. That is a gross exaggeration. There is a mighty difference between an act of Parliament and a mutual agreement entered into between employer and employee. This licensing will be compulsory. I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> was in a measure responsible for the document that was placed on the table of the Senate yesterday, and used by the Leader of the Senate to advantage the Government and strengthen the right honorable senator&#39;s advocacy of certain provisions in the bill. That document indicated that in certain ports of Great Britain, and with the aid of the Board of Trade, agreements had been entered into between employers and employees. But they were mutual agreements between organized employers and organized workers. Can any honorable senator opposite, particularly one who has had experience of industrialism, by any wild stretch of imagination, seriously contend that there is any analogy between that procedure and the licensing proposed in this bill? This is a Government measure, antagonistic to the workers. Let the Government withdraw the bill and propose a form of mutual agreement similar to that referred to by the Leader of the Senate, and it will be moving in the right direction. </para>

          <para>During the last election campaign the Government and their candidates declared that if they were elected they would convene a conference between employers and employees. That conference has been held, and its proceedings have been published. Those proceedings indicate that it was the opinion of the conference that the passing of tyrannical legislation is not conducive to peace and harmony between employers and employees of the Commonwealth. </para>

It was desired that a better relationship should exist between employers and employees. After many sittings, the conference unanimously expressed the opinion that penal laws were not conducive to industrial peace. This bill is of a penal nature. Indeed, it penalizes the workers as they have never previously been penalized. </para>

              <para>- It protects the non-unionist, the incompetent and the inefficient. Every other licensing system has as its object the promotion of efficiency and competency, and moreover, is of general application. All plumbers, electricians, and doctors, not only a few of them, are licensed, but under this legislation workers in some ports are to be licensed, while elsewhere men engaged in similar occupations are not to be licensed. </para>

          <para>We are told by the Government and its supporters that the licensing system will safeguard shippers against pillagers and evil-doers so that in effect we are told by them that where there is to be no licensing there is no pillaging or evil-doing. It would be as reasonable to say that in certain suburbs plumbers ought to be licensed because in those suburbs some plumbers have been guilty of pillaging, whereas in other suburbs, where there has been no pillaging, there is no necessity to license plumbers. I suggest that even in financial and banking circles pillaging sometimes takes place. I am reminded that the Treasurer once advised a government of which he was not then a member to &#34;drop the loot.&#34; Does any honorable senator suggest that because in some financial institutions, men have at times been guilty of embezzlement, all the employees in those institutions should he licensed? In the big emporiums of Australia as well as in various services thousands of men and women are employed, and at times some of them are guilty of pillaging. Do honorable senators suggest that before  any person can obtain employment in those establishments or services he should take out a licence? </para>

          <para>I rose to enter my protest against the bill and to give my whole-hearted support to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I hope that his amendment will be given serious consideration by all honorable senators. If it is agreed to it will do a great deal to show the workers that Parliament is not unmindful of current events. All sections of the community desire peace in industry. Australia is passing through a period of depression. The workers know to their cost what suffering these periods of depression, as well as strikes, and industrial disputes involve. At best the income of the workers is small. It is true that their working hours are less and their salaries and wages higher than they were some years ago, but it is doubtful whether the purchasing power of their earnings is greater than it was then. The struggle of the workers is severe enough without the Government adding to it by wielding unmercifully the big stick which its majority has placed in its hands. Should the Government take advantage of its power to injure the workers its action will not be forgotten by them. At the next general election a new government will be returned, and one of its first acts will be to repeal the tyrannical and provocative legislation introduced by the present administration - legislation which has embittered and inflamed the workers throughout Australia. </para>

            <para>. - I do not propose to follow the tortuous arguments of the Leader of the Opposition in his attempt to attribute to the Leader of the Government in this chamber statements for which he was not responsible. Neither I, nor any other member  of the  Government, at any time suggested that members of the Opposition have been guilty of pillaging, although, perhaps, it has been suggested that in the administration of the affairs of the country they are prepared to &#34; pillage &#34; the taxpayers. The Leader of the Government pointed out yesterday that under this system for the licensing of waterside workers, seven persons had had their licences forfeited because of convictions for pillaging, and the licences of thirteen others had been cancelled because they had assaulted their fellow licensees. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This measure is not going to be defeated by threats such as have been uttered by the astute and experienced honorable senator who has just resumed his seat. I desire to assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that threats will not cause the Government to depart from a course which it is convinced is in the best interests of Australia. The honorable senator suggested that in the future the Labour party will again be in office in the Commonwealth, and that legislation of this kind would only lead to reprisals when that time came. No legislation has been introduced by the present Government as a reprisal for anything that has taken place, excepting disobedience of the law. We are too near the events of last year to lose sight of the benefits which the Transport Workers Act has already conferred on Australia. For many years the people of Tasmania have been in a state of turmoil during every Christinas season because of the uncertainty that existed regarding shipping services to and from the mainland; but the legislation of last session ensured peace on the entire waterfront during the last Christmas vacation. The waterside workers recognize that things could not continue as they were. They realize that they cannot have arbitration and at the same time continue to disobey the awards of the court. It has been suggested that this measure has no relation to arbitration awards, but I direct attention to proposed new section 12 which contemplates compliance with awards of the Arbitration Court. A licence may be cancelled because a worker has refused to comply with an award of the Court. The Government stands for obedience to the awards of the courts - an obedience which the waterside workers haverefused  to show. Having sought an award from the Court, and failing to get what they wanted, they decided that they would neither work themselves nor allow others to pursue their lawful avocations on the waterfront. This measure has been condemned because it does not apply necessarily to every port in Australia. That it does not so apply indicates the desire of the Government to deal with a vexed question in a reasonable manner. Where there is no need for its application the Transport Workers Act and the regulations thereunder will not be applied, but where a need exists, as it did in one or two places recently to the detriment of many in the community, the regulations have been made to apply, and with beneficial results. </para>
          <para>It is absurd for honorable senators to say that this is tyrannical legislation, that it is scandalous and that it will put chains of slavery on the workers. It is all &#34;tosh&#34; to say that it is an insult to the men who work on the waterfront. Honorable senators have their tongues in their cheeks when they say that control and discipline are unnecessary. What exception is taken when the Australian Workers Union or the Waterside WorkersFederation insists that before a man can shear sheep or work on a wharf he must be in possession of a union membership ticket. The men readily submit to this tyrannical control by their organizations and all that this bill does is to ask certain workers to submit themselves to the control of the Crown, the highest authority in the land, so that the whole community may he protected. No man. can work on the waterfront without a ticket granted by his union. All that the Government says in this hill is that in ports where men have refused to obey an award of the Arbitration Court no one can be employed as a transport worker unless he has first taken out a licence which is liable to cancellation under certain conditions to which I do not think any one can take objection. </para>
          <para>The suggestion has been made that the honorable the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce)</inline> was unduly severe on the waterside workers when he was speaking about the pillaging of cargo. During <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> speech I had an opportunity to peruse the report of the Royal Commission on the Pillaging of Ships&#39; </para>
          <para>Cargoes, which was presented to Parliament on the 12th July, 1921. Certain questions had been submitted to the royal commission and the report contains its replies. I quote from the report the following questions submitted to it together with its answer - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whether persons convicted of offences involving dishonesty are employed on the wharfs; and, if so, under what authority, by whom, and to what extent. </para>
            <para>There is ample evidence that such persons are employed on the wharfs. Indirectly, they are employed under the authority of the unions to which they belong. At the Port of Melbourne there is no preference to unionists. Still, if nonunion labourers were engaged while there were union labourers available, there would at once be trouble. If there is plenty of union labour available, there is no necessity to engage a labourer known to have been convicted of dishonesty, but if there is a shortage of union labour, those known to have been convicted of dishonesty must be engaged. </para>
            <para>Carters have to be licensed by the customs authorities for carting goods under the control of the customs, and all carters have to be licensed by the Town Hall authorities, and coopers have to be licensed by the Harbour Trust, so there is a proper check so far as they are concerned. </para>
            <para>As to what extent convicted persons are employed it is difficult to ascertain. One witness stated - &#34;I should say that waterside workers are from 20 to 30 per cent. criminals.&#34; </para>
            <para>This statement cannot be accepted as definite, it is too general; and the witness was not cross-examined as to his statement. </para>
            <para>Another witness stated that persons convicted of offences involving dishonesty have to be, and are, employed on the wharfs. </para>

          <para>Honorable senators opposite seem to think that Ministers rejoice in having to introduce legislation of this character, and they talk as if they were the only people who are anxious to have industrial peace in this country. I can assure them that there are others just as earnest in their desire for it, because industrial turmoil can do more harm to Australia than anything else. But how did honorable senators meet the gesture made by the Prime Minister last year when he attempted to convene an industrial peace conference? They made a sort of political football of his suggestion. They made no attempt to treat it as a non-party question, as a matter of such vital importance to Australia&#39;s future should have been treated. They dragged it into the political field and endeavoured to prevent the Prime Minister from convening the conference. The Prime Minister had no other interest to serve than that of Australia&#39;s future welfare, and his suggestion could readily have been accepted if honorable senators opposite had ranged themselves behind him; but it was met by attack and criticism, which, of course, is the stockintrade of the political life of honorable senators opposite. It is their object to keep trouble going. They talk of the disabilities and hardships of the workers, but they do not avail them selves of the opportunity afforded to bring the workers and the employers together. I was delighted to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> read the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall</inline> as to the attitude adopted by the recent peace conference held in Sydney. We have at last secured from the honorable senator and those whom he leads an expression of opinion that they think that the penal provisions of the Arbitration Act should be abolished. Now we know where they stand. For months past the Attorney-General has been endeavouring to secure replies from the leaders of organized labour in Australia as to whether or not they favour the repeal of the whole of the penal provisions of the Arbitration Act. </para>

              <para>- A committee is certainly functioning after a fashion, but the adjournment <inline font-style="italic">sine die</inline> is sufficient to tell us of the difficulties that were encountered at the conference. What hope could there be for this conference when these two great industrial bodies were not taking part in it? What good purpose can be served by waiting as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition for something which may possibly happen? Notwithstanding the thunder of the Leader of the Opposition concerning what he terms our desire to wage war aginst organized labour, the truth is that we are only giving statutory effect to the regulations framed under the Transport Workers Act and which, by laying on the table of the House, have had the tacit approval of Parliament. It is idle to suggest that this measure will in any sense have a disturbing effect upon industry. All the Government desires is to make an earnest attempt to terminate industrial strife in Australia. The Government has to discipline members of the community who will not discipline themselves, and to see that the laws of the country and the awards of the Arbitration Court are respected. The power which the Government possesses under the Transport Workers Act, and the regulations framed under it, has not been used in a tyrannical or merciless fashion as some suggest, but only in a way that will enable industry to be carried on successfully for the benefit of the whole community. It is the desire of the Government that essential services shall not be interrupted, that industry shall be carried on peacefully and that law and order shall be preserved. If the Government allowed one section of organized labour to disregard the awards of t&#93;&#39;e Arbitration Court, industrial chaos would very soon result. Perhaps the Government should have acted earlier than it did in this matter, but definite steps were taken last year - not in a spirit of antagonism nor ill-will as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition - to protect the interests of al&#93; sections of the community. </para>

          <para>Unfortunately many reasonable working men have been- sadly misled and preyed upon by certain Labour leaders. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber have as much respect for working men as they have for others, and it is the  vapourings  of speakers in the Domum in Sydney, on the Yarra Bank in Melbourne, or the Botanic Park in Adelaide, that inflame the minds of many of these men. Why should it be said that it is the desire of the Government to destroy trades unionism or to do anything detrimental to the interests of the working man? !N&#34;o attempt has been made by us to interfere with an award of the Arbitration Court. The waterside workers are working under an award of the court. </para>

          <para class="block">Government acted, in accordance with the law. It is mere cant and hypocrisy to say that those who are supporting this legislation in the interests of the whole community are tyrannical monsters. Honorable members opposite have spoken of the necessity for co-operation, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> I think, said this bill was provocative, repulsive, reactionary and tyrannical. Is it provocative? At present the men are working under the conditions to which exception is taken by honorable senators opposite. In giving statutory effect to the regulations the Government is only carrying out its promise to the people. The Government&#39;s action in this connexion is no more tyrannical than are some of the actions of the labour organizations of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> is such a prominent member. Should the trade union leaders or the Government have power to control industry in this country? If the awards of the court had been observed there would have been no necessity to introduce legsilation such as this, and although we have virtually been charged with attempting to destroy unionism, our only desire is to assist in securing industrial peace. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> referred to the power that is placed in the hands of licensing officers, but the power possessed by those officers will not be any&#39; greater than that at the disposal of vigilance officers who virtually control the unionists. The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, to which I have addressed my remarks more particularly, is worthless inasmuch as it is asking the Senate to suspend what is now the law, until the Peace-in-Industry Conference, which, as the Leader of the Senate said, is at present in a state of suspended animation, has concluded its deliberations. From the opinions expressed by members of the commercial community, and by a large number of the workers, this measure should be acceptable to the Senate as it provides a means of securing industrial peace, which is so essential to the progress and prosperity of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>. - Since I have been a member of the Senate representatives of the Government have on every possible occasion said that they are earnest and sincere in the desire to make the lot of the worker better than it is to-day. But what steps have been taken by the Government to secure industrial peace in the community? I invite honorable senators to study what the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> said and consider whether the word &#34; honour &#34; which he used bears the definition of the equivalent word in the Greek or the English definition. Shakespeare epitomized the English definition in these words : &#34; To thine own self be true.&#34; To paraphrase that, he who uses the word in the English sense means that what he says he believes in his own heart to be true. One of the worst phases of our industrial history is the extent to which industrial disputes have increased since the Bruce-Page Government has been in office. &#39;The official statistics establish beyond all doubt that industrial unrest has been more pronounced in Australia since the Bruce-Page Government has been in power than it has ever been before. The records also show that during the same period more panicky legislation has been introduced to bring about industrial peace than during the regime of any other Government. </para>

          <para>I have no desire to traverse the ground covered by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> but bearing in mind what I have said concerning the word &#34;honour,&#34; I invite honorable senators to study this measure from the viewpoint of the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> and the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan).</inline> We have been told that there is no distinction between the licences issued to waterside workers and those possessed by railway porters or plumbers, who have also to be licensed. By interjection, I said that honorable senators opposite should carry their analogy even further and suggest that there is no distinction between the licences mentioned in this bill and marriage licences. The Leader of the Government in the Senate said that legislation of this character is not new, and that in Great Britain the employers and employees, after consultation, decided in favour of the licensing system. Tn other words, the inspiration which led to the drafting of this legislation was received from Great Britain; but no one realizes more than the members of the Government that statutes have been passed by this Parliament which are foreign to the principles of British jurisprudence. I asked the Leader of the Government if he would lay upon the table of the Senate the document from which he quoted yesterday. He did so, and I find that it is a &#34; roneo &#34; which has evidently been distributed amongst a certain section of members. It is dated 13th February, 1929, and the first page gives a summary of what it is alleged to contain. If honorable senators opposite, who, I suppose, have been supplied with a copy, read only the first page they will come to the conclusion which the Minister doubtless desires. I invite them, during the dinner hour, to study it and ascertain for themselves really what is the position with regard to wharf labourers in the Mother Country. In the first place, they are not required to take out licences. The Leader of the Senate may argue that they have to be registered. </para>

              <para>- It is true that they cannot get a job until they are registered. In this respect they are in the same position as men who seek work on the north south line - they must apply to a labour exchange. But where is the analogy between registration of wharf labourers in London and this system of licensing .which the Government has included in the bill? The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> has suggested that the Senate is being asked to pass a law which really is already on the statute-book. To me it seems that the Government is endeavouring to force Parliament to accept a responsibility which properly belongs to the Administration itself, and that it is endeavouring to compel its supporters in this chamber to stand behind it in passing the measure. I regret that the Standing Orders of the Senate will not permit me to say what I think of such tactics. The right honorable the Leader of the Senate omitted to tell honorable senators that one of the provisions included in the document from England was introduced as a war measure for the specific purpose of determining how many men could be released from military duty. </para>

              <para>- If an industry requires 500 permanent hands and, say, 300 casual labourers, it is obvious that if the latter number is increased to 500, some steps should be taken to prevent the labour reservoir from overflowing and thus cause hardship to the men permanently employed in the industry. That system operates to-day on our waterfront. Waterside workers, by internal control of their organization, have limited the number of men offering for the available work and the Government, by means of this bill, is attempting to open wide the flood-gates so as to increase the supply in the reservoir of casual labour. </para>

              <para>- I suggest that honorable senators should study the statistics on this point. The figures show that less time has been lost in industry and that there has been less unemployment and industrial unrest in Australia under Labour rule than under anti-Labour Governments. In my own State the restraining influence of a State Labour Government was responsible for a considerable improvement in the industrial situation. There was a marked change when the present State Liberal Government came into power. Honorable senators should study the bill carefully to see whether, under it, the Government proposes to give the workers a fair deal. It cannot be denied that it will create an industrial dictatorship. It gives to the permanent head of the department, subject to the direction of the Minister, authority to appoint a dictatorial staff known as licensing officers. Parliament will not be consulted. This industrial dictator will not be answerable to Parliament or to Cabinet for any appointments he may make. </para>

              <para>- Some Parliaments do make appointments, but it is not the practice of British Parliaments to create dictatorships. This is what I am now protesting against. The appointment of an industrial dictator will relieve the Government of all responsibility. The dictatorial staff appointed will have in its hands the issuing of licences to all men engaged on the waterfront. Not only will this industrial dictator have authority to appoint licensing officers, but he may also fix a group of ports for which licences to work will be required. It has already been decided that Sydney shall be exempt and Port Adelaide shall be a licensing port. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> the Honorary Minister, is not in the chamber, because I should like to direct his attention to this anomaly. There has been less industrial unrest at Port Adelaide than at Sydney during the last ten years and yet Sydney has been declared an exempt port, and men working at Port Adelaide are forced to take out licences. Port Pirie, in South Australia, is also exempt. There has been no pillaging of cargo there and comparatively little industrial unrest. At Port Adelaide, if a man wishes to secure employment on the waterfront, he must apply to the licensing officer for a licence, and the licensing officer may refuse to issue one without giving reasons for his refusal. </para>

              <para>- I have heard much from the right honorable gentleman and those behind him to the effect that this should be a House composed of men of principle. It does not concern me whether there has been a refusal to issue a licence or not. My concern is that every British principle of justice should be maintained by this Senate. But the principle of this bill is foreign to British justice. It gives a power to be found only in the laws of one nation - that little province of Australia known as Italy. There is no provision in laws of the British Empire which gives a dictator an unfettered discretion to say whether a man should or should not have a licence to work. Mention was made about marine store dealers being licensed. It must be remembered that those people have the right to go to a British court and ask for a writ of mandamus to compel the issue of such a licence if it has been refused. Here no such provision is made, and the men will he absolutely dependent upon the caprice of members of a dictatorial staff. That is entirely foreign to British justice. I ask honorable senators to examine proposed new section 12 and see the type of British justice that will be meted out to Australian workers. One of these dictators may cancel a licence issued to a waterside worker in any case as to which he is satisfied that the worker has done certain things. No provision is made for a trial to discover whether the man concerned has been guilty, of doing those things. Mention has been made about licences to pillagers being cancelled. Even the man who throws a bomb is entitled under British law to a trial by jury. </para>

              <para>- The right honorable gentleman is incorrect. If he were conversant with matrimonial causes he would know that, in a maintenance case, a son may be called upon to show cause why he should not contribute to the support of his father. The onus is upon the father to prove that the son has the means to pay, and the son is called to show cause why he should not pay. Once the son is summoned to show cause the onus is on the father to show facts which will place the son in the position that he has to answer the charge. Here a licensing  officer  may cancel a man&#39;s licence and that man has to go before this so-called appellant tribunal and satisfy the court that he is innocent of the charge upon which his licence was cancelled. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps that is the best description that can be applied to the procedure. It has been claimed by the Government that this system of licensing is not at all one-sided, and a reference was made to a system of licensing in operation in the United Kingdom. I ask the Leader of the Senate whether, under that or this scheme an employer has to be licensed? An employer on the waterfront may commit a breach of the Commonwealth award, as he does every day, and he is still allowed to continue in his job as stevedore. Yet it is claimed that this law is not one-sided ! If the Government has the interests of the workers at heart let it, by licensing the employer, guarantee to them that they will have a decent employer. The Government will not attempt to license the employer, because it knows that it would not then be able to find sufficient support for the measure. Again, there is no language test. </para>

              <para>- I will explain why I call attention to the defect. The Leader of the Senate said that the licence is a guarantee of a man&#39;s efficiency. Does he seriously contend that a man who can neither speak nor understand English can work efficiently under an Australian supervisor? The reason why the Government does not insist upon a language test is that it wishes to protect men who have lived only for a short time in this country and do not spend their money in it. It does that rather than protect the interests of the Australian worker. </para>

Bankers restrict credit, and everybody goes  on  strike at one stage or another. The 20 |)er cent, of employers are just as much responsible for the trouble to which the Leader of the Senate referred yesterday as are the 20 per cent, of the workers. We must endeavour to bring about permanent peace, and not to pass panicky legislation of this nature. We must consider whether it is possible to eradicate the extreme element from both sides. That will never be done while the Government indulges in this form of legislation. </para>

              <para>- It could investigate the whole subject from a non-political stand-point. The peace conference has not been given a fair run. Honorable senators opposite must realize that it took a long time to bring the parties together, and that difficult problems were involved upon which both sides had to exercise considerable diplomacy. Every man who participated in the peace conference must admit that, in its initial stages, there was every possibility of its breaking down. I have spoken to a number of the members of the conference, including the <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Sir Wallace</inline> Bruce, and not one of them thinks otherwise than that the conference will resume in the near future and succeed in the task it has attempted in the interests of Australia. </para>

During the recent election campaign the licensing of waterside workers was mentioned at many of my meetings, and at Townsville I was asked definitely whether I favored the system. I gave an emphatic answer in the affirmative. I do not propose now to discuss the details of the bill, for they were explained clearly by the right honorable the Leader of the &#39;Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> yesterday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and other honorable senators opposite spoke of the hardships suffered by waterside workers and their families when the breadwinner is out of employment, but no member of the Opposition pleaded the cause of that section of the community which is, perhaps, the most vitally affected by disputes on the waterfront. I refer to the primary producers, who, for the most part, suffer in silence. Many of them have invested all their capital in the development of their holdings, and are entirely dependent for a livelihood upon the returns they receive for their produce. Trouble on the waterfront may result in their labours for many months being in vain, for when produce is allowed to rot on the wharfs, as was the case at Bowen during one tomato season, it brings them no return. Very little is said about the suffering of these people, yet they are workers who are as much entitled to protection as are other workers in the community. Indeed, they work harder and longer than do most of the workers in the industrial unions, and they have to accept for their produce, not what an Arbitration Court awards, but what they can get for it in the world&#39;s markets. Honorable senators opposite have emphasized the hardship caused to a waterside worker and his family if his licence is cancelled for some breach of the law, but what about the man who has done nothing wrong, t.nd yet has to suffer, because his produce will not be loaded by these men? It is true that the unemployed waterside worker receives no pay during the period of the cancellation of his licence, for during that time he does no work ; but the primary producer whose produce is left to rot receives no income, notwithstanding that he has laboured hard and long to earn it. Fortunately for the primary producers of Queensland, there was a willing response to the call for volunteer labourers during the trouble on the waterfront, and the men who thus came to the rescue of the country did good work in keeping the wheels of industry going. </para>

              <para>- I saw some volunteer labourers working at Bundaberg, where I learned that their daily output was double that of the members of the Waterside Workers Union. The whole of our produce might be held up on the  waterfront at the caprice of a few individuals, and the community caused inconvenience and suffering without our hearing from honorable senators opposite about the effect of the hold-up on any section other than the waterside workers. As a primary producer myself, I know that primary producers generally desire peace in industry. It is true that in the shearing industry there have been disputes in the past, but during recent years there has been very little dislocation of primary industries through disputes between employers and employees in that industry. The credit for that satisfactory state of affairs is not due entirely to the employees. Honorable senators should remember that the primary producer risks a great deal more than does the person he employs. Before he can employ others he must do a lot of spade work and incur considerable risk. </para>

              <para>- The majority of the producers whose interests are affected by trouble on the waterfront are small men who, probably through adverse climatic conditions, have not been able to earn even the basic wage which other workers can earn without any risk of capital and without hard work. I have recently paid a visit to the irrigation areas near Renmark. The dried fruits industry has been brought to a high state of perfection by the application of science; nevertheless, the vine-growers and dried-fruit growers are severely handicapped, and attribute the responsibility for this, not only to the low prices obtainable overseas for their produce, but also to the series of irritating strikes that have occurred during the last five years, and have materially affected the continually rising costs of production. The system of licensing waterside workers has been in operation about six months, and during that period there has been continuity of work on the waterfront. The strong stand taken by the Government, during this six months has at last given an opportunity to the primary producers and manufacturers alike to get a reasonable return for their produce or the output of their factories by keeping transport moving, and a continuation of this policy of licensing will afford protection to free labourers and unionists alike in carrying on their lawful occupations. </para>

            <para>. - The provisions of this bill are not  new to the  Senate. A measure em bodying the power to make regulations that are now to become statute law, was passed last session, and it &#39; is rather strange that it did not excite half the warmth that has been displayed in regard to this bill. The closer this legislation is examined by its critics the uglier it becomes to them; it does not improve on acquaintance. The supporters of the Government would gladly avoid creating so much discussion. They would gladly refrain from occasions like this that present so many opportunities for the imputating of motives. It is not pleasant to incur the censure of a responsible opposition, and that of its supporters in the country; but the Government had no option in the matter. The position was forced upon it. It has to do its duty. If a government is to govern, it must see that the people&#39;s interests, of which it is the custodian, are conserved, and that all citizens have a chance to follow their daily avocations without hindrance, or without any &#34;by your leave.&#34; That is the duty of the Government as I conceive it, and it is the right of every citizen to pursue his calling without fear of any person or section in the community so long as he respects the laws of the country. </para>

          <para>I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> is allowing some latitude in the discussion of this bill, because it deals with a problem of the greatest importance - that of bringing closer together the two elements in the industrial field. It is a problem that lies at the very root of the happiness, progress, and prosperity of this country. For some years these two . elements have been  coming into far too frequent collision for the peace and prosperity of Australia. They have been wrongly described as having diverse interests. If they stood together in reasonable amity, each serving its own interest, but at the same time jealous of the interests of the community as a whole - if they could be brought closer together - it would be to the everlasting benefit and prosperity of Australia; we should not have&#176; the industrial machine brought to a stand-still so often with consequential misery, suffering, hardship, and loss. It it our task on the present occasion to safeguard the interests of those people who suffer injury and loss because a section of the community has brought the whole industrial machine to a stand-still. Innocent people cannot be permitted to suffer injury in their business undertakings. Produce, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> has rightly said is the daily bread of the producer and which is grown by his sweat and toil, cannot be allowed to stand still on the way to market, or rot in front of the grower, as has often been the experience in Tasmania, Western Australia, and elsewhere. Actions which bring the whole industrial machine to a dead stop must cease, or the responsibility for them must be saddled on the right people. The &#34; scrap of paper, &#34; otherwise a licence, is merely a warrant that citizens of this country may engage in work without challenge. I cannot conceive of any party, which claims to be the advocate and sponsors of modern democracy - of freedom of action - interfering with men who hold licences. </para>

              <para>- Are they not? Then the reports we see in the newspapers must be false. We cannot handle this subject much longer with lavender gloves. I remind honorable senators that it was a &#34; scrap of paper &#34; that provoked a mighty conflict in Europe. As a matter of fact, it was a &#34;scrap of paper &#34; that stood across the pathway of the Prussian junkers and militarists and prevented them from accomplishing their designs in Belgium. Similarly, a &#34; scrap of paper &#34; in the shape of a transport worker&#39;s licence stands across the pathway of the labour militants of Australia and prevents them from accomplishing their designs. I pay them a compliment in calling them Labour militants, because if there is any suspicion of a lack of militancy on their part their days are numbered. Latter-day Labour in Australia requires its leaders to be everlastingly at war with their fellows. I am also paying them a compliment when I compare them with the Prussian militarists, because both parties have sinned similarly and want to be put right. The Australian &#34; scrap of paper &#34; is a warrant or sort of <inline font-style="italic">magna charta</inline> to a citizen that he may pursue his lawful calling without interference or intimidation. I do not regard the licences issued under this law from the same viewpoint as the members of the Labour party. The issue of licences is a means to ensure a continuance of industrial operations in this country. It is a device for getting on with the job. Industries are essential to any country. If their Operations are retarded here we cannot hope to prosper or to hold this country indefinitely, and, in effect, say to others, &#34; Keep off the grass;&#34; Our neighbours are looking upon us from a distance, and if we are to retain Australia for our own use the main essential is to populate, develop it and work it. If we are to do that we should not allow a small and irresponsible section in this country to stop the wheels of industry. We are here to do the best  Ave  can for our country and justice to all. The time  Will  come when  Ave  shall vanish from the scene, but  whilst  we are here it is our bounden duty to bear witness to the truth, avail ourselves of a power which the electors have placed in our hands, and see that justice is done to every citizen. But above all, we should, as becomes a progressive and enlightened community, keep our industries going. </para>

              <para>- The one thing that has not come up to my expectations is that a part - an inferior part - of human nature has sadly failed. When arbitration was first conceived and brought into operation, it was heralded as the brightest gleam that had ever come to advanced thinkers. It was then thought that it would overcome the barbaric system of strikes which had prevailed and had caused so much trouble between employer and employee for ages. On the occasion to which I have referred, and when my convictions were put to the test, about 1,000 men were involved in a strike, which arose in consequence of the presiding judge of the Arbitration Court of Western Australia giving what was well-known at the time to be a wrong interpretation of the act he was administering. In the exercise of his powers, he fixed a minimum wage for the least competent workmen, thus allowing unscrupulous employers to work up from that low standard. It was obvious that the wrong, interpretation placed upon the act would lead to a good deal of strife, hardship, mischief, and misunderstanding. When the trouble in which 1,000 men were involved, occurred, I was the State member for the district, and I went among my  constitutents  and asked them - it was not an easy matter - to accept and loyally abide by the award of the court. I was as strongly in favour of arbitration as I am now, and I went amongst the men upon whose votes I had to depend for my political existence and urged them to return to work, notwithstanding that they were being pressed down to the minimum wage provided for by the judge as a result of his admittedly wrong interpretation of the law. I took my political life in my hands as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> knows, with the result that the men went back and the employers, as the outcome of my representations, took a more reasonable view of the situation and satisfied these workers to the full. I was not saved from the javelins or poisoned shafts of my enemies then in the Labour movement, I was assailed by &#38; gentleman who is not now in the ranks of Labour - an unfortunate man devoid of a generous impulse - who was so ungenerous as to describe me as a traitor to the Labour movement; but I went amongst the men aud urged them to return to work, and to their honour they went back. That occurred 24 years ago, and I am still a loyal supporter of arbitration. These gentlemen of the Opposition who glibly say that they favour arbitration have never been put to that test, or at least not to the extent that I have, and those honorable senators who represent Western Australia know that what I say is true. They are living witnesses of the accuracy of my assertion. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It is easy for honorable senators of the Labour party to say that they believe in arbitration, but if they do, why do they not tell the men on strike to return to work in accordance with a principle which they, above all others in the community, should support? The reason is obvious. Other employers took advantage of the incorrect interpretation of the act to which I have referred, which resulted in no end of trouble in Western Australia, and enabled unscrupulous employers to crush their employees down to such a level that they went on strike. Eventually the employers were brought to their knees, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, and were compelled to pay a fair wage. There may have been some doubt as to the part I actually played on that occasion, but I. think it will now be clear up to that point. That is the time when it is said that I was a &#34; scab.&#34; </para>

          <para>It is provided that in certain circumstances a secret ballot shall be held. Why should it be necessary to make the taking of a secret ballot compulsory? Echo answers, why? In my opinion it is because the bosses of trade unionism in Australia fear that a secret ballot means the sounding of their death-knell. I know what happens when a strike is declared. There are gentlemen here representing the Labour movement who, by the way, lived on a fat salary whilst I, when acting as the secretary of a union, was paid only 5s. a week and was always a good target for managerial spleen. Sometimes I got the sack. As a representative of a union, I did not hold the &#34;cushy&#34; jobs that some of these men are holding to-day. I have been a trade unionist for 38 years, and I am a member of a trade union to-day. I doubt very much whether some who profess to be such staunch trade unionists are actual members of a trade unionists&#39; organization. From my earliest association with trade unionism I have always insisted on the principal of a secret ballot. What is the <inline font-style="italic">modus operandi</inline> to-day? The members attend, the scene is staged, and the leaders of the latter-day Labour movement, when it comes to decision on a vital issue, say that they will take a vote. In effect they say &#34; &#39; dinky-di &#39; trade unionists pass to the right and the &#39; scabs &#39; to the left.&#34; Men must be very bold in these days to join the scabs. That is the system by which decisions are reached and many men compelled to act against their consciences. The men will not listen to reason. I have sacrificed more than the whole lot of the present Opposition have done in an endeavour to place the workers in a better position. When an appeal is made to the electors in Western Australia, I am returned triumphantly, and the people of Western Australia will return me if I have to be carried here. I challenge honorable senators opposite to state the actual conditions under which a ballot is taken in connexion with a strike. </para>

              <para>- I have heard of that before. There is an old saying that the magnitude of a charge is lost sight of in the insignificance of the accusers. Every principle for which Labour has fought during the last 25 years has been preserved for it more jealously by honorable senators supporting the Government than by honorable senators opposite. This is the reason why Labour ranks in this  chamber  have been so thinned in recent years. They laugh and talk and pretend to be happy about it. They remind me of the man who whistled while going through a churchyard to keep his courage up. We know that their hilarity is so much simulation. We have heard it all before. This is why there is such a wide gulf between honorable members supporting the Government and our friends opposite - the difference between candour and cant. </para>

          <para>The bill provides for the appointment of licensing officers whose duty it will be to issue licences to persons seeking employment on the waterfront. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> and his supporters in this chamber do not wish this scrap of paper to be issued to trade unionists. Of course they do not. But the people of Australia expressed their views in no uncertain terms at the last election, and the Government now proposes to continue with its policy so that the people of this country may get a fair deal. The bill is called the Transport Workers Bill. I emphasize the word &#34; workers &#34; and remind honorable senators of what the Leader of the Senate said concerning the amount of work done by a section of unionists on the waterfront who wish to continue a monopoly in this class of work. The right honorable gentleman told us that gangs of unionists in certain cases had been unloading ships at the rate of from ten tons to fifteen tons per hour, and that gangs of volunteer workers, when they had a chance to show what they could do, brought the output up to 24 or 25 tons per hour. It is obvious, of course, that the trade unionists mentioned were not &#34; delivering the goods.&#34; As a matter of fact they had been holding up the commerce of Australia, and piling up charges outrageously. </para>

              <para>- By enacting provisions to ensure that transport workers shall do a fair day&#39;s work - no more and no less - the same as other people have to do. If honorable senators opposite were themselves personally concerned they would see that they had a fair deal. If, for example, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> bought a suit of clothes which the shopkeeper represented to him was an all wool suit, and if, upon examining it subsequently, he found that it contained a fair proportion of cotton and was, in fact, an inferior suit, does any honorable senator imagine in that case he would be the lamb-like person he pretends to be in- this chamber? Is it not more likely that he would take the first opportunity to tell the shopkeeper in the plainest terms possible, that he was a robber? Or if the honorable senator purchased a pair of boots in the belief that he was getting an all leather article, and found later that composition entered largely into its manufacture, we may be sure that he would lose no time in going back to the rogue who sold him the boots and telling him what he thought of him. Again, if the honorable senator entered a barber&#39;s shop and was shaved in an unworkmanlike manner would he not tell the barber that he was obtaining his money under false pretences? In every such instance he would see that he got value for his money. We must deal in the same way with the workers on our waterfront. </para>

          <para>Under our arbitration system they have been receiving fair rates of pay consistent with the economic position of the Commonwealth; but in the main they have not been doing a fair day&#39;s work. Consequently they have been obtaining their money under false pretences. No one can pretend that an output of from 10 tons to 12 tons per hour by a gang of experienced wharf labourers is a fair return, in view of the fact that raw recruits can send the average up to 24 tons or 25 tons per hour. In a private business concern such as that I cited in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> head of the Australian Workers Union in Australia, this inadequate return would not be tolerated. Similarly, it should not be tolerated in the interests of the community. </para>

              <para>- We have now drifted into the curious position that the waterside workers numbering 17,000 or 18,000 out of a total of over 900,000 trade unionists have been able effectively to hold up industry in Australia. Can honorable senators opposite justify this state of affairs by any rule of equity ? Are they content to allow this small section of trade unionists to dislocate entirely the transport services of the Commonwealth? Official statistics disclose that there are about 911,000 trade unionists in Australia. It follows, therefore, that wharf labourers - these men who are content to handle only 12 or 15 tons of cargo per hour - represent about 2 per cent, of the total, and yet they have been responsible for practically 100 per cent, of our industrial troubles in recent years. Is there no remedy for this state of affairs? Can honorable senators opposite stand up and defend it? If we are to judge from their utterances in this chamber and elsewhere, they certainly are attempting to do so. </para>

              <para>- I have in my hand the labour report for 1927, issued by an officer who has served under both Labour and Nationalist Governments, and whose figures, I am sorry to say, have been impugned. It is much to be regretted that even the Commonwealth Statistician is not free from the suspicion of a certain section of unionism. The labour report for 1927 shows that in the ten years from 1917 to 1927, there were no fewer than ten important disputes in which the waterside workers of Australia were involved. These men, I again remind honorable senators, represent only about 2 per cent, of the total trade unionists in Australia, and yet the disputes in which they were engaged involved themselves in a loss of nearly &#163;500,000 a year, or a total for the ten years of &#163;4,299,000. But what of the loss to the community? The worst feature of those disturbances was the obvious intention to violate labour laws and destroy the arbitration system under which the great majority of trade unionists in Australia are working in amity. If the transport workers in Australia, numbering about 176,000, who have been misbehaving like the wharf labourers were as bad as them then their loss would be about &#163;5,000,000 a year, besides the loss to the rest of the community. If in recent years all trade unionists had been infected with the strike germ to the same extent as the wharf labourers, they would have suffered financially to the tune of &#163;50,000,000 in the ten years besides what the rest of the people would have lost. Is it not about time this union&#39;s conduct was stopped? </para>

          <para>Ex-Senator Gardiner, who for many years was Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, told us on one occasion that the workers represent 90 per cent, of the people pf this country. I do not question his statement, hut I suggest to -honorable senators opposite that it is remarkable that the people of Australia in the exercise of the franchise recently, instead of returning the Opposition in the Senate apparently realized that, notwithstanding all their fair promises, they were Labour&#39;s false friends. They preferred honorable senators on this side. This Government, I contend, is in power by virtue of the votes of the workers, if ex-Senator Gardiner&#39;s statement is correct. Surely, then, it was reasonable to expect the Government to do something to protect the rights and interests of 700,000 workers - 80 per cent, of the trade unionists in Australia - who have no sympathy with the views of the minority, and who loyally abide by arbitration. The answer is to be found in this bill. If only a fraction of what honorable senators opposite have said about the Government and its supporters were true in regard to industrial legislation, we should not be in our present position in this chamber. But the people realized that the truth was not in them; they were weighed in the balance and found wanting, and they left them wanting the posts they sought. Honorable senators opposite appealed to the workers of Australia to place them on the Government benches, and their appeal was refused. The workers realized that they are not to be trusted, and left them where they are. </para>

It is a principle of British jurisprudence that the onus of proof of guilt is cast upon the accuser, so that the accused always has a fair chance to establish his innocence. In contradistinction to that, the system of French jurisprudence provides that the onus of proof of innocence shall be on the accused. The British system was not always so. I remember that, in my infantile days, it had a flaw which enabled a person to be cast into gaol before anything has been proved against  him, and though he never appeared before a magistrate or judge and jury.

              <para>- The bill vitally affects the fundamental progress and prosperity of the nation. If it is defeated the consequences will be serious. As it is possible, but not probable, that it will be defeated, I must, in the interests of myself and my constituents, consider the contingency. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> referred to the condition of the primary producers of Australia and the disabilities under which they labour by reason of the industrial unrest that prevails and has prevailed. It is our duty properly to &#39; balance the advantages and disadvantages amongst all sections of the community. We represent not a class, but the community. I urge honorable senators of the Opposition to realize how adversely our primary producers will be affected if this legislation is cancelled. Statistics reveal that the prosperity of the country is by no means equitably distributed among our workers, among whom I include the primary producers, who are experiencing, greater and greater difficulties in sending their surplus products to local markets and overseas. The agricultural market report of the British Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for the &#34;25th January, 1925, indicates that the percentage increase in the value of wheat exported in 1928  wa3  only 32 per cent, greater than it was in 1911-13, of fat cattle 38 per cent., butter 51 per cent., and wool 76 per cent. As against that I find, on reference to the official <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Book</inline> of the Commonwealth of Australia, that the increase in earnings in the engineering, woodwork and furniture, building, mining, railway, and shipping industries, in the interval between 1911 and 1927 has been about 100 per cent. So that while the average employee increased his earnings by 100 per cent., the income of our leading primary producers increased by only about 40 per cent. If this measure is rejected, the position of the primary producers will be even worse. As honorable senators know, our exportable surplus, which has now reached &#163;140,000,000 per annum, is the only means by which we are able to pay the wages of the community, including the wharf labourers. If, by ill-advised industrial conflict, that income is whittled away, Australia will be in a perilous position  and not able to pay. We must endeavour to make the wheels of industry run smoothly. If we do not act fairly and justly one to the other and take due advantage of legislation such as this we shall jeopardize the prosperity of this fair country. I remind honorable senators opposite what a wonderful heritage is ours. Let them congratulate themselves that they did not exist in France during the time of the French Revolution, when labour unions were not tolerated by the committee of public safety. Honorable senators opposite have a penchant for the colour red. They had better keep away from anything red, because if the &#34; Red &#34; element gets into power they will be in for a bad time. </para>

          <para>This measure proposes to develop the idea underlying the act passed last year, namely, to issue licences to workers in the same way that the trade unions of this country grant tickets or licences to their members. The trade unions have brought the licensing of workers to a fine art; we have reached the stage where no person who is not licensed by a union has a chance of earning a livelihood. If this bill is not passed, and the licensing system is rejected, we shall give to men, not the right to work, but the right to starve. Fair play is bonny play, and if men will not obey Arbitration Court awards, they must make room for others who will. Why do honorable senators opposite not be frank and denounce the men for what they have done? They should not be so concerned about their political skins. Why are they afraid to say that the licensing system is necessary for the good of the community? It ill becomes any Australian to persecute his fellow man merely because he is earning an honest livelihood. The object of those who seek to destroy this bill is to give to men the right to go without food. I shall not stand idly by and allow that to be done. On humanitarian grounds alone, I could not stand by and see the meanest person in the community forced into starvation without seeking to assist him. Nothing more than the passing of this bill is necessary to hold the scales evenly between the different classes in the community and to give men the right to work. I offer this advice to honorable senators opposite in the. kindliest spirit. As a parent who truly loves his child has sometimes to chastise it, so if I have chided honorable senators opposite, it is because I love them. Instead of speaking with their tongues in their cheeks, members of the Opposition should adopt a manly attitude, and show some of the spirit that was in the old pioneers who accepted this continent as it was given to them by Mother Nature and developed it, bravely facing dangers and difficulties. Let them show some of the characteristics of the men who came 12,000 miles to possess and develop this land, and not devote so much energy to condemning the&#39; capitalist, in whose interests they say this bill has been introduced. </para>

            <para>. - I have listened with a great deal of patience to the speeches of honorable senators in support of the hill in the hope that I should hear some valid argument in favour of this legislation being placed on the statute-book, but having heard the diatribes which have been uttered by them, I am more than ever convinced that no sound reason  exists for passing it. There has been a wild hurry-scurry from Dan to Beersheba in search of excuses for the introduction of this measure. The main excuse offered seems to be that honorable senators opposite regard the Labour movement as a menace to this country, and its members as persons not to be trusted. Some of those who have criticized members of the Labour party to-night, were at one time honoured and respected members of that party, and their erstwhile opponents used the same arguments concerning the Labour party in those days as these new apostles of what was then known as conservatism now use in relation to present- day members of the Labour party. Some more substantial argument will have to be advanced before I shall cast an affirmative vote for a measure of this description. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Labour party, which represents nearly half the people of the Commonwealth, and at the last election received the support of a substantial majority of the electors of South Australia, is just as law abiding, and just as keen to safeguard the established institutions of this country, and to maintain its industries, as is any other party. </para>
          <para>It is interesting in this connexion to hear what some of the leaders of the parties opposed to Labour said when seeking the suffrages of the electors during the recent campaign. I shall first quote some remarks made by the Prime Minister in the course of a speech he delivered at Norwood, South Australia. The right honorable gentleman, at that meeting, made a statement which, had it emanated from a Labour candidate, would have been published throughout Australia in the largest and blackest type to be found in the newspaper offices ; but, because it was uttered by the Prime Minister, it received very little prominence in the South Australian press. The Prime Minister emphasized that he intended to deal with fundamental principles, and, indeed, he enunciated a number of principles which, he said, were necessary to good government and prosperity. But he said more than that. The Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Register,</inline> the conservative organ in South Australia, in its issue of the 23rd October, 1928, credits the right honorable gentleman with having said that, if he was a waterside worker, he would go round with a bottle in his hand looking for some of the men who had led them into this present trouble. The Prime Minister, who says so much about peace and goodwill, and law and order, advised his hearers to arm themselves with bottles against those who had caused trouble in the community. Yet we are told that we, the opponents of this measure, and not the Prime Minister and his followers, are the apostles of disorder and disruption. </para>
          <para>The bill before us is opposed to all sense of fair play, because it gives to an individual - a licensing officer - the power to deprive others of the right to earn their living. The Leader&#39; of the Government, in moving the second reading of this measure, endeavoured to draw an analogy between the licensing of plumbers, motor drivers, electricians, and baggage carriers with the system of licensing under this bill. There is no similarity between the two systems. Licences are granted to plumbers, motor drivers and other skilled artisans, as well as to members of the medical profession, in order to safeguard the interests of the community generally. I have read this bill carefully, but I cannot find in it any reference to competence or skill as a qualification for holding a licence. In the early stages of the application of the licensing system at Port Adelaide there were some appalling instances of incompetence. Accident after accident occurred, some minor and some serious, and in two cases death resulted. Inquiries among the foremen in charge of operations elicited that the accidents were caused by the inefficiency of the licensees and their lack of knowledge of the work they were called upon to perform. At that time many of the Southern Europeans licensed were not acquainted with the English language. I understand that a language test has since been applied, and that some of these men have had their licences cancelled. But it is a condition of affairs that is possible of repetition under the provisions of this bill. In South Australia Southern Europeans were found to have disposed of their licences to fellow countrymen. It was difficult for the authorities to prove cases of this kind, but in several instances the charge has been sheeted home, although the penalty imposed, in my opinion, has been extremely small for what I regard as a most serious offence. </para>
          <para>The luggage porters referred to by the Leader qf the Senate are licensed for a certain reason. The railway authorities decide that a certain number of porters can cope with the work at a particular railway station, and in order to prevent the reservoir of labour being flooded at that point, the number of licences issued is restricted. </para>

              <para>- I shall come back to that point later. Normally 1,800 waterside workers can handle all the cargo offering at Port Adelaide, but 3,274 men hold licences there. It is likely to create a very difficult problem later on. Because of the casual nature of their occupation and because a sufficient number of men must be available to handle cargo at a peak period, the pay of the wharf labourer is usually higher than the ordinary rate of wage. It must be  sufficient to  enable him to earn something like a living wage over the whole twelve months. If more than twice the number of men required to handle the work of the port are licensed, and each man is to earn a living wage over the twelve months, the rate of wage that will require to be bed must be 40 high as to lead to complications in years to come. &#34;Will honorable senators who favour this bill support an increase in rates of pay for that class of work to provide for these circumstances? &#34;When these regulations  were proclaimed in Port Adelaide the strike was over. On a Saturday the men decided to return to work, and the regulations were proclaimed on the following Monday. The anxiety of the Government to insist on licensing the workers of Port Adelaide had the effect of prolonging the dispute for nearly a fortnight. Had the regulations not been applied in Port Adelaide the men there would have begun and continued working and would not be under licence to-day. </para>

          <para>By way of interjection the Leader of the Senate a few moments ago spoke of protecting passengers&#39; luggage, and on the second reading he emphasized the necessity for protecting cargo. Is&#39; Port Adelaide the only port in Australia where pillaging of cargo takes place? There are no licensing provisions at Sydney or Fremantle. </para>

              <para>- I gather from the honorable senator&#39;s interjection that the bill is required not to prevent pillaging, but to tie the workers to their jobs under all conditions. There are six ports in South Australia where substantial numbers of waterside workers are employed. In only one are the men required to take out licences. The Port Adelaide waterside worker is regarded as a potential pillager, and must secure a licence ; but he may go to Wallaroo, Port Lincoln, or Cape Thevenard and work without a licence. The worker at Port Lincoln or Cape Thevenard is deemed to be quite honest while he remains at either port, but immediately he goes to Port Adelaide to pursue his calling he is regarded as a potential pillager, and must take out a licence. The whole system is bristling with inconsistencies. </para>

              <para>- I should like to hear more valid reasons for its introduction than those advanced by the Minister in his tirade of abuse when moving the second reading. The bill provides that if the holder of a licence commits certain offences he may be delicensed for a period of from three to twelve months. That is an unnecessarily hard penalty, particularly as the majority of men employed on the waterfront have established homes adjacent to the ports at which they are working, and have families and financial responsibilities which make it difficult for them to obtain employment elsewhere. If they commit an offence within the meaning of this law they run the risk of losing their means of livelihood, and cannot submit their case to a properly constituted tribunal. Of course, there is the right of appeal; but when a worker is delicensed another worker secures a licence and takes his job. Of what avail then is a successful appeal ? </para>

          <para>Why does the Government not keep the promise made by the Attorney-General on its behalf? It has allowed unfair discrimination at Port Adelaide, where the employers are giving preference to volunteerlabour. Any work available after all the first preference volunteers - and they are numerous - have been absorbed is given to the regular waterside workers who have taken out licences, and obeyed the law of the land and the award of the Arbitration Court since the day they became licensed. Appeals have been made to the Government to bring about a more equitable distribution of work at Port Adelaide, but up to date nothing has been done. In consequence of the Government&#39;s inactivity in this respect, unemployment and misery are more pronounced in Port Adelaide than ever before in the history of South Australia. We have it on the authority of medical men that little children have died as the result of lack of nourishment. The principal newspapers of South Australia, the Mayor of Port Adelaide, and the Lord Mayor of Adelaide are cooperating in an appeal to the citizens of South Australia to relieve the distress that exists among the families of waterside workers at Port Adelaide. Business men are closing their establishments because of the loss of trade. Prior to the introduction of this system approximately &#163;900,000 was earned by the Port Adelaide workers every year, over 90 per cent. of which was spent in Port Adelaide and its environs.

I object, however, to the primary producers being used as a stalking horse by certain honorable senators in an endeavour to gain political kudos.

I do not &#39;expect the Senate to accept anything that is not authoritative. Notwithstanding the severe drought experienced in the particular part of South Australia where I live, I was able to produce a few bales of wool which were catalogued for disposal at the sale in South Australia which was postponed in consequence of the waterside trouble. As honorable senators are aware, the sale was eventually held in Melbourne and in common with other sellers, I received a priced catalogue from the well-known and old-established firm of Goldsborough, Mort and Co.

              <para>- According to the authorities I have quoted, the industry did not suffer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> mentioned the difficulties of the settlers on the river Murray districts in South Australia. I have not heard that shipments from those districts were affected by the trouble on the waterfront. I am inclined to believe, therefore, that if the honorable senator had inquired more closely into the position he would have realized that it is not labour costs that are crippling the industry so much as the mistakes made by the Liberal Government in South Australia in settling people on certain areas. &#34;We remember the famous Loveday scheme, which cost about &#163;1,000,000. After a good deal of work had been done for settlement under that scheme, it was found that the land was unsuitable. The workmen had to use dynamite to blast out holes for the trees. One can readily understand that the sensitive roots of vines would not flourish in that class of soil. As a result the scheme was abandoned and there was a loss of nearly &#163;1,000,000. Similar mistakes were made in other areas. At the present time returned soldiers and other settlers on the newer areas along the river Murray are struggling against high capital charges. Although costs have been written down by the State Government there will have to be further reductions before the men engaged in the industry can make a success of it. &#34;When the right honorable the Prime Minister was speaking in Adelaide he gave a definite undertaking that the withdrawal of the licences would receive the earnest consideration of the Government. Speaking from memory and subject to correction, I think he said that Parliament would be given an opportunity to consider the whole question. The Leader of the Senate has told us that the Government is doing that. But the Prime Minister, when speaking in Adelaide, said that if a conference of employers and employees asked for a repeal of the licensing provisions, he would be prepared to amend the bill accordingly.The Peace in Industry Conference has been held and the trouble on the waterfront has received and is still receiving consideration. A considerable section of the people of Australia object to the licensing system. The Leader of the Senate yesterday quoted figures to show that there had been an increase in the quantity of cargo handled by gangs of workmen since the licensing provisions had been enforced. I do not propose to cast a doubt upon his figures, but I can assure him that if he went to Port Adelaide he could obtain another set of figures proving that the genuine waterside worker can handle more cargo and do it more efficiently than the volunteer worker. Employers who pay additional handling costs at Port Adelaide as a result of the inefficiency of the volunteers whom they are compelled to employ are much perturbed about this matter, as also are shippers whose returns are being depleted and business people whose costs are being increased. But the most serious aspect about the whole business is that local workers who have wives and families dependent upon them have been displaced by single Southern Europeans who send their savings to Malta, Italy, or Greece. Altogether too many of these foreign migrants are being employed, whilst good Australians are out of work. Because of . their frugal habits and because they have no dependants in the, country, the bulk of their earnings go out of Australia. </para>

              <para>- Many of these Australian workmen went to the war. There are 274 returned soldiers in the .ranks of the Port Adelaide branch of the &#34;Waterside Workers Federation. These are the men to whom preference in employment was promised when they returned from the war, but because of some alleged industrial offence they are now thrown on the scrap heap and, with their wives and families, are permitted to starve whilst Southern Europeans are given employment. </para>

              <para>- We have heard all these libels upon Australian workers before. Honorable senators op*posite appear to lose sight of the fact that more time is lost in Great Britain, than in Australia as the result of industrial disturbances. This statement is borne out in the latest industrial statistics available, for the period ending 31st March, 1928. Honorable senators supporting the Government have endeavoured to belittle the amendment moved by my leader. They argue that even if it is carried the licensing provisions will still operate. I admit that they will, but I suggest that it is easier for the Prime Minister to repeal regulations than to repeal an Act of Parliament. For this reason I hope that the amendment will be carried, and that the bill itself will not be placed upon the statute-book. </para>

            <para>.- Everyone, I am sure, regrets sincerely the s need for the introduction -of this bill; but one cannot shut one&#39;s eyes to the fact that the majority of the people feel that the time has arrived for the passage of such legislation. I need only remind honorable senators that for some years now there has been an almost continual dislocation of industry owing to the action of a section of workers who have been spurred on to disobey awards of the Arbitration Court. Honorable senators opposite have said repeatedly that the waterside workers were determined not to work under the Beeby award. The fact is that in the majority of disputes the workers are called out and have no option. As a rule the workers do not, of their own volition, come out on strike. I have been a worker all my life. I have conversed on this subject with a great number of working men, and I say without hesitation that I have obtained the confidence of hundreds of them. They have assured me, time after time, that they have no desire to cease work but are obliged to do so at the dictation of the militants in the various organizations. When T have asked them if they attended the meetings of their unions, they have replied in the negative, giving as a reason that if they did so and protested against the action of those who were endeavouring to foment trouble and disorder, they would be called &#34; scabs.&#34; I have had this information from bona fide members of the Waterside Workers Federation and the Stewards Union. I was assured by a member of the Stewards Union that they had no wish to take part in the last strike, but that they had received instructions to cease work and if they had disobeyed, life would have been made intolerable for them. It is no use blinking the facts. No one has a greater respect than I for sane unionism, but even zealous unionists confess that they are appalled at the manner in which trade unionism .. Australia has been prostituted during the last ten to fifteen years. </para>

          <para>The Leader of the Opposition and his <inline font-weight="bold">deputy, Senator Findley,</inline> voiced their desire for industrial peace. I do not question the genuineness of that desire, but I deplore the fact that the political representatives of trade unionism have not been able to restrain the extremist section of the movement which has been instrumental in fomenting the trouble that has necessitated the introduction of a bill of this character. Reference has been made to the Peace Conference which recently sat in Melbourne and Sydney. I, and hundreds of thousands of others in Australia, expected great results from that convention. One could scarcely have imagined that, in a country like ours, where the average individual enjoys greater advantages than his prototype in any other country, even  while  the peace tribunal was in session the extremist section which controls the industrialists would have ordered the timberworkers to disobey an award of the court. </para>

              <para>- I believe that is so, but I regret that honorable senators should utter such sentiments. It must be realized that trade unionism properly applied can do more for the workers than any other system. Its original purpose was to see that those engaged in any trade or occupation became absolutely efficient and gave of their, best to the country. It also safeguarded the interests of the workers in regard to hours, condi-  tions and wages. That splendid objective has been lost sight of, and to-day many trade unionists would drop out of the movement if it were not for the fact that if they did they would lose their tickets and be unable to obtain employment. I have personal experience of such cases. I know of one man engaged in the furniture trade who was fined &#163;10 by his union because he did in lj hours a job the log time for which was 2 hours. Here is a reference to a similar incident in <inline font-style="italic">The Furniture Worker,</inline> the official organ of the union - </para>

              <para>- I do not; but I wish to see common sense prevail. If every man did his best, that would necessarily cheapen the cost of living, and people with a limited income would be able to purchase more and more of the desirable things in life. No country ever made progress when its citizens set out deliberately to curtail the output of industry. </para>

              <para>- I have as great a sympathy for the distressed as has the honorable senator. The suffering which prevails as a result of the timber workers&#39; strike and the industrial trouble on the waterfront was brought about by those who control the unions. Is it not a fact that last Christmas was the first for many years when trade relations were maintained between the mainland and Tasmania? Previously, a certain little clique, disregarding the distress caused by their action, and animated only by a desire to keep their billets warm, fomented trouble at that time of the year. If they were ousted from the industrial movement matters would&#34; be on a better basis. No individual or section should have the power to direct the men to disobey the awards of the court. I have been told by men who received such instructions that they emanated from the executive. </para>

          <para>I shall instance another case of what I term industrial cruelty. It concerns a young fellow of only 18^ years of age, who was the main support of his mother, a widow with two young children. Through slackness of trade in Sydney, he was temporarily put off. I met him about ten days ago, and asked him if he was keeping a look-out in the advertising columns of the press for a job in his own line. He said that it was of no use to do so, as he dared not reply to any such advertisement without first consulting the union. </para>

The result is that the employer gets no opportunity of seeing the men he is engaging. A man may be in sore financial straits, yet he dare not apply for a job without first approaching the union. Have honorable senators previously heard of such tyranny ? I should not have mentioned this case had not two honorable senators said that we, on this side, are out to crush trade unionism. It is true that I desire to crush that kind of unionism, but not legitimate and straightforward trade unionism. </para>

Australia is not the only country in which industrial disturbances occur, but having recently travelled through a number of other countries, I am of the opinion that there is much less reason for industrial disputes in Australia than in those countries.

              <para>- I have heard trade unionists say that a man who will not join a union ought to starve. Such men are not true trade unionists, but an excrescence on the movement. I claim that no man who is willing to work, whether he is a member of a union or not, should be . prevented from doing so, provided that he gives an adequate return for the wages he receives. When absent from Australia last year, I took the opportunity to converse with men engaged in industry in England, Canada and the United States of America. They all seemed surprised at the number of strikes that take place in this country. Men to whom I spoke in England said that if conditions there were similar to those existing in Australia, they would have no disputes. </para>

Through a falling off in business, his employer had temporarily to dismiss two adult workmen. But knowing the circumstances of the lad&#39;s family, knowing that his widowed mother was solely dependent on his earnings, the employer kept him on. In a little while an official of the union called on him and accused him of having in his employment more improvers than he was entitled to under the rules of the trade. The employer explained that because of his decreased turnover he had to put off two employees temporarily, but that he had kept on this lad because of the circumstances .of his family. </para>

              <para>- But I am not battening on the unfortunate workers. Cases have been brought under my notice of men who, although they were apparently contented with their conditions, and were doing their work well, were compelled to hold up ships after a visit from an organizer. I remember on one occasion when I was in North Queensland there was a large steamer taking on raw sugar at a certain port. A week afterwards, when I returned to the port, the steamer was still there. The custom had been to place twelve bags of sugar in the ship&#39;s sling. The workers did none of the lifting, machinery did it all. But after an organizer who had travelled up the coast on the same steamer as myself put in an appearance the shipowners were informed that in future only .nine bags would be put in that sling; and the reason given in reply to the ship-owners query was that it was not conducive to the health of the men to follow the old custom. I believe this bill will be in the best interests of the Commonwealth. I hope that it will eventually be found that every effort recently made by&#34; the Government to secure industrial peace has been successful. No one hopes more than I do that the peace conference, which has temporarily suspended its sittings, will be revived. I have enough confidence in the good sense of a certain proportion of those who are identified with the trade union movement of Australia to believe that the disgruntled few who have withdrawn from the conference will be replaced by others who, in the long run,, will be found to be more competent to deal with important questions than those who have withdrawn. </para>

          <para>. - This afternoon I asked the following questions of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs: - 1, Has the Minister or the Government given consideration to the request of the Tasmanian Apple Evaporators&#39; Association for a bounty on evaporated apples exported, and, if so, with what result? </para>

            <para>The matter has been considered, but no finality has yet been reached. </para>

          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">I note with pleasure that the matter has been considered; but I am disappointed that no finality has yet been reached. I urge the absolute fairness of the request of the Tasmanian Apple Evaporators&#39; Association for Commonwealth assistance to enable&#39; their industry to continue. The canned fruits industry and grapegrowers have for years been receiving assistance to enable them to market their products, and I cannot understand why the Government should hesitate about granting the same assistance to the apple evaporators of Tasmania. The orcharding industry in my State is a very important one. Many returned soldiers have been settled on small orchards, particularly in the Huon district. The best grade apples are sent overseas, in order to ensure a continual market,  and the lower grade apples are usually sold in Australia; but the inferior apples, and those which are damaged whilst growing, which form no inconsiderable portion of the whole crop, are treated by the evaporating process. They are just as fleshy as the perfectly formed apples, and there is a world-wide demand for them, but the Tasmanian growers, like the canned fruit-growers of Victoria and New South Wales, are unable to compete on the European market with evaporated apples from the United States of America. They would be in a position to compete if a small bounty were paid to them. At a meeting of the Tasmanian </para>
        <para class="block">Apple Evaporators Association, held in Hobart on the 9th August, 1928, the following resolution was carried: - </para>
        <para>That, for the purpose of stabilizing the evaporating industry, the Government be asked to make available to evaporators a bounty on evaporated apples exported  in any year, the amount of which, together with the sale value realized overseas, would return to the evaporator1d. per lb. over and above his cost of production, such bounty not to exceed 2d. per lb. in any year. </para>
        <para class="block">This resolution was forwarded to the Prime Minister. The amount involved would not be more than &#163;3,000 or &#163;4,000 ; but would be very helpful to the returned soldiers and other small fruit growers who have orchards in Tasmania to-day. I urge the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs to submit these representations to his colleagues, so that, at the earliest opportunity, finality favorable to the apple evaporators may be reached by the Government. </para>

          <para>. - The facts disclosed by the honorable senator will be placed before the Minister for Trade and Customs, who will probably be in a position to give a more definite reply in the course of the next few days. I understand from the honorable senator that a bounty of 2d. per lb. would yield a profit of1d. per lb. to the grower; but it strikes me that it might be better to consider the advisability of giving the growers1d. per lb. and leave the apples where they are. That, however, is a matter I shall discuss with the Minister for Trade and Customs. </para>
