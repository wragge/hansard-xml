          <para>The application of the Australian Seamen's Union was lodged on the 7th November last. Before the application was dealt with the Seamen's Union of Australia lodged an application for registration. In view of the provisions of section 59 of the Act, the Registrar informed the parties that he would deal with the two applications at the same time. The Commonwealth Shipowners' Association obtained an extension of time to lodge objections until March 14th, and the applicants have 14 days in which to file answering affidavits. It is understood that the answering affidavits will be filed in time to enable the matter to be listed for hearing on 27th March. </para>

          <para>- I direct the attention of the Leader of the Senate to the difficulties experienced by members of Parliament in getting in touch with officials of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> various Commonwealth departments in Canberra. This morning, wishing to interview an officer of a department, I went first to No. 2 Secretariat, and then to No. 1 Secretariat; finally I discovered that the official I wished to see was in offices at Civic Centre. I hope that, during the recess, the Minister will see if some arrangements can be made to assist members of Parliament who wish to attend at the various departments in the discharge of their public duties. Perhaps it will be possible to place a car at their disposal. </para>

          <para>. -  I protest on behalf of the Opposition against the suspension of the Standing Orders to allow the Senate to proceed at once with the discussion on this important bill. Surely, honorable senators realize the difficult position in which I, as the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition, and all members on this side are placed. The bill is intended to give considerable relief to returned soldiers, and it is highly technical. It was only placed in my hands this morning. I have not had time to study it. At the moment my secretary is engaged in research work on the measure with the idea of preparing a number of amendments which, in our view, will more fully give effect to the Government's promises to the returned soldiers. If the second-reading debate is taken now, I shall have to remain in the chamber to listen to the speech of the Leader of the Senate and I shall not have an opportunity to consult with my colleagues concerning the many intricate provisions of the bill. This haste is unfair to the Opposition, and unfair to the returned soldiers. I sincerely hope that the motion will not be carried, even if it means that honorable senators will suffer a certain amount of inconvenience through having to return to Canberra next week to consider the bill. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">I am sure that honorable senators will give this bill their serious and sympathetic consideration. It was circulated some days ago, and if any honorable senator did not receive a copy of it, something must have gone wrong with his correspondence. Not only was the bill itself circulated, but also the amendments which honorable members in another place proposed to move. The bill before the Senate this morning is, of course, as amended in another place. </para>
        <para>The object of the bill is to give effect to the promise of the Government to provide a means by which appeals may be made against the decisions of the Repatriation Commission, both in respect of entitlement to pensions and assessment of war disability. Seeing that the bill provides a new method of dealing with claims, or rather superimposes an additional procedure upon that now operating, perhaps it would be advisable that I should refer briefly to the course  adopted under the existing legislation. The present act is administered by a Repatriation Commission, consisting of three ex-soldiers, one of whom is the nominee of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers League of Australia. A board similarly composed operates in each State. When a claim for a pension is made, all the relevant papers are referred to the State Repatriation Board, which may grant the claim, reject it, or refer it to the commission. If a claimant appeals against the rejection of his claim by the State board his case is submitted to the commission. The commission fully considers all claims submitted to it, and if in doubt after obtaining the advice of its own medical officers, submits the case to the Medical Advisory Board which consists of four of the most eminent medical practitioners in Australia who have the additional qualification that they have had military experience overseas. I should like here to pay a tribute to the excellent services rendered by the members of this advisory board; they are <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Syme, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Maudsley, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stawell,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Webb.</inline> These gentlemen give up much of their valuable time twice a week going through the claims submitted, and advising the commission upon the evidence tendered. Since January, 1925, the soldier has in reality had a further appeal to the Minister in Charge of Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Neville Howse, than whom there is probably no one in Australia better qualified to speak on matters concerning war pensions. Sir Neville Howse stands very high in the medical profession, and, in addition, occupied overseas during the war, the position of Director of Medical Service to the Australian Imperial Force, thus gaining a first-hand knowledge of the conditions under which the soldiers served.</inline></para>
        <para>It will, therefore, be seen that a very thorough system of dealing with pension claims is already in operation, and I might mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neville</inline> Howse, when speaking in another place, stated definitely that although the Repatriation Commission had been charged with being harsh and unsympathetic, after a close association with its work for a period of over four years he had no hesitation in saying that the charge was absolutely unwarranted. This is borne out by the records of the department, which show that during the four years ended 30th June, 1928, the number of ex-soldier pensioners increased by 439, notwithstanding that during that period 2,866 ex-soldiers unfortunately had died. Last year - ten years after the cessation of hostilities - new pensions were granted to 891 exsoldiers. The total number of new pensions granted last year, including ;hose in respect of wives, children and other dependants, was 13,547. Although no amendment of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act, under which war pensions are paid, has been made for several years - in fact, not since 1922 - the War Pensions bill has increased considerably, to a great extent on acount of the liberal and sympathetic manner in which the act has been administered. For the year ended 30th June, 1924, war pensions cost £7,090,815; four years later the cost was £7,690,890, an increase of £600,075. That increase occurred despite the deaths of pensioners, the re-marriage of widows and the adolescence of dependent children. </para>
        <para>The bill now before the Senate provides for the appointment of two types of tribunal - entitlement tribunals, and assessment tribunals. A new principle is established by this bill in that it provides for separate tribunals to deal with appeals in regard to (1) entitlement to pension and (2) assessment of the rate of pension. Canada has an entitlement appeal board but no assessment appeal board. In New Zealand and Great Britain and most other countries, the appeal boards which are in existence deal with both classes of cases. The entitlement tribunal will consist of three members, a  chairman  who may be a returned soldier, and two members who, it is provided, shall be returned soldiers. The  chairman  will be a person who has been admitted to practise as a barrister or solicitor of the High Court, or of the Supreme Court of a State. The  chairman  and one member will be Government nominees; the other member will be selected from nominations submited  by organizations of returned soldiers. </para>
        <para>The bill provides that if any new evidence having a substantial bearing on a claim is submitted to the entitlement tribunal, the case shall be referred back to the Repatriation Commission, and, if rejected by that body, it will later be determined by the tribunal. Moreover, should fresh evidence bc submitted within twelve months of the Entitlement Tribunals decision, the Repatriation Commission will reconsider the case. Should the claim be rejected by the Repatriation Commission, the appellant may again appeal to the tribunal. A claimant appearing before the tribunal may claim travelling expenses. </para>
        <para>Complaint has frequently been made that soldiers have no knowledge of the contents of their files on which their claims have been decided. In that connexion, let me draw attention to proposed new clause 45z, which reads - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>An appeal tribunal, and an assessment tribunal, shall, so far as it is consistent with the interests of the appellant, and with any obligation to respect information given to the commission upon a confidential basis, make available to the appellant or his representative information contained in the records relating to his case, provided that information given to the commission on a confidential basis may be disclosed to the appellant or his representative in any case, if the person who has provided the information consents in writing. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Government proposes that there shall be a different constitution for the assessment tribunal. It is proposed that the  chairman  be selected from a list of returned soldiers who have been admitted to practise as barristers or solicitors of the High Court or of the Supreme Court of a State, submitted in the manner provided for the appointment of a nominee of returned soldiers' organizations for membership of the Entitlement Tribunal. To assist him it is proposed to appoint two medical practitioners selected from lists of medical practitioners approved by the Minister. The medical members of this board will be selected on account of their special knowledge of the disabilities from which the appellant is suffering. This provision will be of great advantage to appellants, particularly in. cases of special diseases. Two members of the Entitlement Tribunal -will form a quorum, but the three members of the Assessment Tribunal must be present to give a decision. No medical man who is an officer of the Repatriation Depart-ment, or who has given a previous decision on the case, will be a member of the Assessment Board in respect of that case. </para>
        <para>It is specially provided in the bill that the tribunals shall not be bound by any rules of evidence, but shall act in accordance with substantial justice, and the merits of the case, and that they shall give the appellant the benefit of the doubt. The appellant may appear in person before the tribunal, or may be represented by any person other than a legal practitioner. This bill has been drawn up as a result of experience gained in the administration of the Repatriation Department during the last ten years. Regard has also been given to the advice received from other countries where appeal courts are in being, and to that tendered, after long consideration of the matter, by the executive of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers League. It was  dealt  with at the last conference of the league, when there was drawn up a list of recommendations, all of which, with the exception of a few minor points, have been incorporated in this bill. </para>
        <para>In conclusion, I should like to touch briefly on the subject of repatriation generally. Honorable senators who have been members of the Senate since the end of the v/ar, will remember the great difficulty which faced the Government in repatriating a large number of soldiers, and of honoring the promises made to the soldiers before they went away. The Minister who was charged with that duty was at that time the Leader of the Government in this chamber. All honorable senators who knew him will admit that he brought to the task confronting him all his energy and his great ability. If he were now alive no one would bc more pleased than he to see the manner in which the promises then made to the soldiers have been kept. It is true that many mistakes have been made, but it must be remembered that the difficulties were great, and the problems many. All will agree that a faithful effort has been made to fulfil the promises made. I feel sure that I am voicing the opinions of all honorable senators when I express appreciation of the great work done by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen in laying the foundation upon which has beer: built our repatriation and war pensions legislation. I confidently submit the bill to the Senate. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DALY</inline>(South Australia) [11.32.J - Without entering into the highly controversial subject of the promises made to our soldiers when they enlisted and the extent to which they have been honored, I intimate i hat the Opposition is entirely in agreement with the Government on the main principles of this measure. That the bill is long overdue does not detract from our pleasure that at last it has been introduced. Anyone who has had experience of the treatment meted out to our returned soldiers will agree that an appeal tribunal is essential if they are to receive a substantial measure of justice. The Minister said that the bill, together with a number of proposed amendments, had been in the hands of honorable senators for some days. The amendments are the most important parts of the measure from the returned soldiers' stand-point, because they are connected with the question of proof  - what the soldier has to establish before he is entitled to the benefits which the bill purports to give to him.  Only  this morning was I shown an amendment made to the measure in another place late last night. In committee, I propose to ask the Senate to consider whether that  amendment  gives to the returned soldiers fair treatment in the matter of proving their right to the benefits conferred by the bill. </para>

            <para>- But the Minister accepted it. Even if an ex-Prime Minister drafted the amendment in good faith - and I do not doubt that he did - it should not be possible for any one to say that this Parliament is out to "pull the legs" of the returned soldiers. The Senate should endeavour to draft a better proviso. In the matter of proof, the bill is hyper-technical. Each man who went to the war was certified as fit. Some who returned developed various diseases, including tuberculosis, after their return. One doctor might be of the opinion that a returned soldier suffering from tuberculosis contracted the disease as a result of his having been gassed while on active service, while another might explain the man's condition on some other hypothesis. A returned soldier whose present condition might have been caused either by his war service or otherwise will, in my opinion, be unable to establish his case. The Opposition proposes, later, to submit an amendment which, while protecting the Government against abuses, will give the  soldier the benefit of the doubt in doubtful cases. If agreed to, it will enable a man, whose health was satisfactory on enlistment, more easily to establish his claim before the Entitlement Board; but it will not alter any of the rights created by the bill. Apart from a desire to alter the bill in the direction I have indicated, we on this side will offer no opposition to its passage. </para>

            <para>- No. Suppose that on his return to Australia in 1918, an ex-member of the Australian Imperial Forces made an application for a pension. He would have to establish certain facts in order to entitle him to that pension. First of all he would have to prove that the disability from which he was suffering resulted from war service. This amendment seeks to provide that in circumstances where the tribunal is satisfied that he would be entitled to a pension, if a member of the Australian Imperial Force at the time, he shall receive that pension, unless the department can prove otherwise to the satisfaction of the tribunal. </para>

            <para>- I am unable to understand that interjection. Why is it impossible? Suppose that in 1918 a man returned from the war suffering from the effects of gas. Ten years later tuberculosis develops. One doctor might be prepared to connect the later disability with the man's war service, while other doctors might expound contrary theories. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> declares that if this amendment were incorporated in the bill it would be impossible for the tribunal to disprove liability. I submit that, in the converse case, it would be impossible for the soldier to establish his rights. </para>

            <para>- The point is that a man may be gassed, but not to an extent to incapacitate him at the time of his return. That would not entitle him to a pension. But supposing that ten years later tuberculosis manifested itself, while some medical practitioners, on examination, might declare that it was due to the effect of war service, it is probable that others would refute that diagnosis. They might claim that the man's antecedents justified the opinion that the complaint was hereditary, and in no way connected with war service. It is our contention that if a man returns from the war suffering from tuberculosis, whether declared hereditary or not, he should receive a pension. </para>

        <para class="block">Those words embrace every member of the Australian Imperial Forces because every member of the Australian Imperial Forces served in circumstances that "might reasonably be expected to be injurious to health." It does not follow that the health of every member of the forces was injured by reason of his service, but every member of the forces who served either for one day or for the whole period of the war, served in circumstances which. "might reasonably be expected to be injurious to health." That risk is not peculiar to members of the Australian </para>
        <para class="block">Imperial Forces. The ordinary citizen in his everyday life runs it; but because every member of the forces from the time he enlisted until he was discharged was liable to incapacity or injury to his health, the honorable senator's amendment would cover every member of the Australian Imperial Forces. The proviso proceeds - and was on the date of the application for a pension either deceased or suffering such incapacity as would, if death or incapacity had in fact resulted from any occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the forces, have entitled such member or his dependant to a pension, the appellant or dependant of the appellant shall be deemed in the absence of evidence to the contrary to have established his claim to a pension. </para>
        <para class="block">That is to say, if a soldier, after his discharge from the forces, has contracted a disease or has suffered some incapacity which would have entitled him to a pension if he had contracted the disease or suffered the incapacity either during his service with the forces or as a result of his war service he would be entitled to a pension although his disease or incapacity had no relation whatsoever to his service in the Australian Imperial Forces. The amendment would, therefore, establish a new class of pension benefits beyond that contemplated or made possible under the original act. That is my point of order. If the amendment were agreed to, provision would be made for two classes of pensioners - pensions granted in consequence of death, incapacity, or disease, resulting from service during the war and pensions granted because of some disease, incapacity or death occurring after discharge from the forces, but not resulting from war service. Every member of the Australian Imperial Forces would thus be entitled to a pension for any incapacity, disease or death, no matter whether it had relation to war service or not. The amendment is neither relevant to the bill nor to the act which the bill purports to amend, and it is certainly not covered by the title of the bill. The pension made available by it would not be a " war pension " since it would be payable to persons whose death, incapacity or disease had no relation whatever to the war beyond the fact that the pensioner served during the war. The parent act does not contemplate the payment of a pension on account of disease, incapacity or death, unless it has resulted from employment in connexion with naval or military preparations or operations, and I therefore take the point of order that the amendment is not relevant to the subject-matter of the bill. </para>

            <para>- Our Standing Order says that an amendment must be relevant to the subject-matter of the bill which it is proposed to' amend. The right honorable senator has suggested that by means of this amendment I am attempting to create a new class of pensions not authorized under the principal act, but the proviso does nothing of the sort. It simply does what I have just read to honorable senators - it qualifies the preceding provision. The right honorable senator has also claimed that the amendment has nothing whatever to do with onus of proof, but the provision to which the proviso would be attached deals with that, and if my amendment were carried, it would merely create an exception to that section. The purposes of the act are not enlarged by the amendment. The proviso simply qualifies the proposed new section and not the act itself. I submit, therefore, that my amendment is in order. </para>

            <para>- If the amendment seeks to open the gate wider than is proposed in the original act it is quite clear that it is not in order. If we accept the amendment the bill will lose all semblance of its former self. The amendment is elastic to an extraordinary degree. It states that death or incapacity from any occurrence happening during the period an appellant was a member of the forces will entitle him or his dependants to a pension, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the appellant or dependant will be deemed to have established his claim to a pension. I am afraid the honorable senator is seeking to put too much india-rubber into the provision. The amendment is not fair or just. It would be much better to pass the bill as it stands. All honorable senators wish to deal fairly by the returned soldiers. Under the Government's proposal an appellant is expected to make out a prima facie case, which, ox" course, is not a complete case; but in considering the appeal the tribunal will not be bound by the rules of evidence, and in all cases it will give the appellant the benefit of any doubt. </para>

I remember that the taxpayers of this country are not unworthy of some thought from members of this chamber.

I can see nothing wrong with this, and so I intend to support the measure. </para>

          <para>- The measure before the committee is entitled "A bill for an act relating to the establishment of Appeal Tribunals to deal with Appeals relating to War Pensions." Because of the highly technical nature of the bill, it is extremely difficult for a layman to determine the degree of relevancy of the amendment; but, in my opinion, it would create a new class of pensions, not contemplated by the bill or the act which it amends. I therefore rule that the amendment is irrelevant to the subject-matter of the bill. </para>

            <para>. - I suppose the State to which the right honorable Leader of the Senate and I belong, is likely to be most affected by this provision, as it is the only one which has kept intact a really good sinking fund. This fund, the management of which has for many years been in the hands of a committee, has served a useful purpose in keeping the credit of the State at a high level on the London market. I should like to know what will be the position of that committee, comprising able men who have wisely invested the accumulations of the sinking fund, when this provision becomes effective. Will the committee go out of existence, or will it continue to manage that portion of the sinking fund which was in existence before the signing of the Financial Agreement? This is an important point, and I should like the Leader of the Senate to clear it up. </para>

            <para>.- I take this opportunity to voice my dissatisfaction and disappointment at the unnecessary delay on the part of the Government in dealing with the request made to it by the Tasmanian Evaporated Apples Association for some assistance in the shape of a bounty, in order that the evaporated apples industry may be carried on. Honorable senators will recollect that when I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs whether any decision had yet been reached in regard to this matter his reply was that no definite decision had been arrived at. I want to impress on the Government the effect its delay will have. The decision of the Government, even if it proved unsatisfactory, would have to be accepted, but it is extremely  upsetting to the Evaporated Apples Association to realize that the Government has not yet arrived at a decision. It seems strange to those connected with the industry and to the people of Tasmania generally that the evaporated apples processers have not had extended to them the favorable treatment in the shape of a bounty that the canned fruits industry lias enjoyed for some years. It is some time since the attention of the Government was directed to the fact that if the evaporated apples industry was to carry on successfully some form of Government assistance must be given to it. </para>

              <para>- Unfortunately it cannot now be sold with success in Great Britain or on the continent because of competition from America, but everyone says that  Tasmanian  evaporated apples are absolutely first class, and about the finest produced in the world. The industry is asking for a bounty of 2d. per lb. on evaporated apples. When I referred to this matter on the 7th inst., the Honorary Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> in the course of his remarks, said - </para>

            <para>I understand from the honorable senator that a bounty of 2d. per lb. would yield a profit of Id. per lb. to the grower; but it strikes mc that it might be better to consider the advisability of giving the growers Id. per lb., and leave the apples where they are. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Apparently the Minister does not understand the position. As it takes 8 lb. of green apples to make 1 lb. of evaporated apples, the Minister's suggested grant of Id. per lb. in the case of green apples would be equal to a bounty of 3s. 4d. a bushel on apples, whereas the Evaporated Apples Association is asking for a maximum of 2d. per lb. on evaporated apples, which is equal to only lOd. a bushel on green apples. Although the industry is small, approximately £70,000 has been invested in factories for evaporating apples. Last year the capacity of the existing plants was not utilized to the fullest. Another 100,000 bushels of apples could have been processed, which would have meant the distribution of an additional £10,000 to the orchardists and £6,000 to the factory operatives. Owing to the large crop of apples in Tasmania last year, the absence of a bounty and thu consequent impossibility of placing evaporated apples on the British market, over 1,000,000 bushels of apples went to waste. It seems to me that the payment of a bounty which, while not amounting to more than £4,000 a year, would prevent good foodstuffs from going to waste, is a policy that should commend itself to any government. I speak on this matter, knowing well that anything I say will have no effect on this year's output, because, even if a bounty were made available, by the time Parliament next met the season would then be practically over. Nevertheless, I feel it my duty to call attention to this food now going to waste each year which could be evaporated and turned into a wholesome and readily marketable product, if only the Government would give this Tasmanian industry some small assistance. I am disappointed that Tasmania, which suffers so many disabilities on account of its geographical position, has not been able to keep this industry flourishing, so that it might be of real use to the community. I urge the Government to, even at this late hour, give the request favorable consideration. Although it may not be of much value to the industry this year, it certainly would encourage producers to carry on in the hope that their returns next year would be more satisfactory. </para>

              <para>- There was for a time, but the exporters were unable without assistance to compete with the American evaporated apples. Consequently they have to rely on the Australian market almost entirely, though there might be an outlet for a certain quantity in Java and the Dutch East Indies. The apples used for the evaporation process are not commercially marketable in Australia because of defective shape or spotted skins; but they are quite as wholesome as the finest eating apples. If the Government can see its way clear to grant the request, the industry will provide a certain amount of employment, not only in the business of evaporation, but in the manufacture of export cases and in other directions. The industry is well worth encouraging. </para>

              <para>- The facts of the industry are so patent that the course suggested by the honorable senator is not necessary. The canned fruits industry has received substantial encouragement and, as the result, a fair export trade is being developed. Why should there be any differentiation, if the Government is satisfied that there is a market for evaporated apples at a price that will give the grower and the evaporaters a reasonable return? I hope that we shall have a favorable reply from the Government before Parliament goes into recess. </para>

            <para>. -  I rise to make a suggestion in connexion with a matter which I raised yesterday in relation to cotton. The Leader of the Senate, in reply, stated that he anticipated the Prime Minister would be able in the near future, to make an announcement as to the policy of the Government, short of a statement of the tariff policy. It seems to me that in view of the fact that Parliament may not he sitting when the Government is ready to make an announcement, it might be highly desirable once the Government has made up its mind what it proposes to do, to call together the various interests associated with the industry and tell them of the decision short of an announcement in regard to the tariff. I recognize that there are many difficulties associated with the industry, and it is quite possible that a decision which the Government might come to in all good faith would not fully meet the technical requirements of the industry. I think, therefore, that probably it would be wise if the Government paid heed to my suggestion. It is, I believe, one that will be approved of by those connected with the industry. I may add that I am making this suggestion entirely on my own responsibility. I have not had an opportunity to consult the various interests concerned, but I throw out the suggestion in the best of good faith and with a genuine desire to help the Government in a matter which, I admit, is bristling with technical difficulties. I am quite sure it is the desire of the Government to help the industry, and I believe it would be well if, before finally committing itself to any scheme, the Ministry advised the people concerned. If they have any suggestions to meet the situation and at the same time give effect to the Government's policy, I feel sure that they will be most happy to tell the Government. </para>

It has been said that Australia is carried on the sheep's back. The truth of this is, I think, generally acknowledged, and  I  feel that unless something can be done to safeguard the industry, we may find it difficult to maintain the present standard of living in this country. I have here interesting figures, setting out the position, which I should like to place on record, and I hope that during the recess the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will devote its energies to an investigation of the several problems which are exercizing the minds of the various graziers' associations. The following figures relating to the production, value and average price of greasy wool, are, I think, impressive: - </para>

            <para>- I admit that Parliament is powerless. It may, however, be helpful if we consider certain factors which have a certain bearing on the price  realized for Australian wool. I refer particularly to the increasing competition of artificial wool and rayon. In 1924, the United States of America produced 36,000,000 lb. of rayon and artificial wool; in 1928 the production rose to 99,500,000 lb., and this year the estimated production is 135,000,000 lb. In Great Britain for the same years, the production was 24,500,000 lb., 50,000,000 lb. and 60,000,000 lb. respectively. The world's production in 1924 was 137,000,000 lb. and in 1928 323,500,000 lb. The figures for 1929 are of course not available yet. I suggest that these figures are somewhat alarming. The world's fashion seems to be in the direction of utilizing more and more of artificial wool and rayon. </para>
          </talk.start></continue><para>As showing the influence of this comparatively new industry on development, I may inform honorable senators that in the United States of America, Elizabethtown, a town in Tennessee, two years ago had a population of 2,400, and to-day its population is 12,000. During these two years the price of land rose to 50 times its former value. The reason for this was the introduction of German capital into the South-Eastern States of America. The American tariff prohibited the introduction of German artificial silk goods, so the mountain went to Mohamet, and German capital, to the extent of many millions of pounds, was laid out on plant and factories for the manufacture of artificial silk and rayon. When cotton is harvested and taken to the ginneries, the cotton itself is extracted from the seed, attached to which is a waste product from which, in the past, such material as surgical lint was made. A method has now been devised by which that waste product is utilized and sold in the market at1d. a lb. </para><interjection>

From this waste product, by means of up-to-date German machinery, is being made rayon and artificial silk, which has taken the place of wool for many of our requirements. </para>

Eight years ago this feathered artisan was seen in British Guiana building its nest with material which appeared to be cotton.

The plant reaches a height of seven feet. </para><para>Lancashire and Yorkshire cotton mill-owners, when shown the new product, readily agreed to accept it, and it is announced that in a few years it will be grown in sufficient quantity and quality to meet the demand for coarse count of the whole British cotton industry. </para><para>This artificial cotton, it is maintained, can be treated by existing cotton machinery.

Our Council for Scentific and Industrial Research is making inquiries into certain branches of primary industry but not much has yet been done in the direction of conducting investigation on a scientific basis into the wool industry. There is, in Adelaide, a laboratory under the control of Professor Robertson, which investigates certain diseases in sheep, and the Commonwealth Government has given £1,000 to the British Research Association which has established in New South Wales a laboratory to deal with the blowfly pest; but I fail to see that any thing has been done in the direction of actual scientific research into such problems as the standardization of wool. </para><interjection>

The wool industry in Australia is not in the sound position that many persons think. The wool producers have to combat such difficulties as rising land values, noxious weeds, increased taxation, high wages, the rabbit pest, parasites, blowflies, and, in some districts, the fluke. </para>

              <para>- That is so; and since South Africa has been mentioned, it may be of interest to note the quantities of wool being produced in that and other countries. In 1927, the total number of sheep in the world was 627,000,000, while the wool production was 3,100,000,000 lb. Of this quantity, Australia produced855,000,000lb. from 103,000,000 sheep. New Zealand had 25,000,000, and produced 202,000,000 lb. weight of wool. China had 26,000,000 sheep, and produced 60,000,000 lb. of wool ; the Argentine had 36,000,000 sheep and produced 331,000,000 lb. of wool. The Union of South Africa to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> referred, had 18,000,000 sheep, and produced 251,000,000 lb. of wool. Russia, in spite of the unsettled conditions prevailing there, had 32,000,000 sheep, and produced 237,000,000 lb. of wool. Of the total quantity of wool produced in the world that year, more than half came from countries south of the Equator. Although wool production is carried on on a comparatively small scale in the United States of America, an enormous amount of scientific research has been made into matters relating to wool and sheep. </para>

              <para>- That is one of the most important links in a most important economic chain.I admit that if we are to successfully compete with other countries, economic production is a most important factor. But even if we can produce economically our production, both as regards quantity and quality, could he improved by scientific aid. As science is playing such an important part in the development of industry it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government in this regard to keep abreast of other nations, otherwise we shall be left behind. Scientific aid to industry has very far reaching effects, but up to the present very little has been done by Australia. It has been asked why the graziers do not do more to assist themselves. They are prepared to render financial assistance; but I think it is the duty of the Government to see that scientists and others get to work immediately so that we shall always be able to market products equal to the world's requirements. Frequent reference is made to the quality of Australian wool. During the war period when the disposal of the product was controlled under the War Precautions Act or its regulations, the Australian clip comprised over 500 different classes, whilst the classifications in New Zealand totalled 700. We have been informed that by investigation and research Australia should and would be able to produce a standardized wool; that as the result of such investigation and research growers would know exactly what class to produce, and the buyers would know that they were getting the class they required. </para>

There are so many classes and classifications that in order to standardize wool, an investigation should be undertaken by scientists to show the wool-growers of Australia how to produce an article which will meet the requirements of manufacturers.I leave it at that. I hope that in future more attention will be given to this important industry, and that during the next year or two, at least, greater support will be given by the Government, particularly to the pastoralists and sheep men generally. If an investigation were undertaken at once, I am sure the results would not only be of great assistance to our wool producers, but from a national viewpoint would have a wonderful effect upon the whole of the people of Australia. </para>

            <para>. - I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> that the suggestion which he has made in connexion with the cotton industry, and which appears to me to be reasonable, will be conveyed to the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gulletl)</inline> and will, I have no doubt, be acted upon. I am sure the honorable senator realizes the difficulties that may arise in one direction ; but apart from this, I see no reason why those engaged in the industry should not be consulted by the Minister. I shall convey the honorable senator's suggestion to the Minister. </para>

          <para>I endeavoured to make it plain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> the other evening, when discussing the subject of evaporated apples, that, on his own statement, the payment of a bounty of 2d. a lb. would result in the factories making a profit of1d. a lb., and I ventured the personal opinion that it might be more profitable for those concerned to take some other action. I shall, however, see that the matter raised by the honorable senator is conveyed to the Minister for Trade and Customs. The work of the Tariff Board has been held in abeyance during the past fortnight owing to a change in its personnel, and it may therefore be some time before a definite report is obtained on the matter. </para>

            <para>[3.25].  -  We have all listened with great interest to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator P.</inline> P. Abbott in connexion with the wool industry. I regret that he has not been altogether just to the Commonwealth, which through the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has done much more for the industry than he has mentioned to-day. Had time permitted, I could have set out in detail the valuable work which has been and is being undertaken; but as at the Sydney Show, next week, the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> will deliver a speech, which will be largely an exposition of what the Government is doing in this and other directions, I do not know that I ought to steal his thunder. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator P.</inline> P. Abbott hears or reads that speech I am sure he will realize that the Commonwealth is devoting a good deal of attention and scientific effort towards assisting the wool-growing industry of Australia. I am glad be mentioned that it was the intention of the wool-growers to help themselves. That is a praiseworthy effort. I am sorry, however, that in their attempt to collect £200,000 they have up to the present raised only £35,000, which is not a very large amount for such a wealthy industry. It is hoped that they will continue in their praiseworthy effort and raise the full amount they require. Realizing the value of this industry to Australia, the Government is seized with the importance of utilizing all the scientific intelligence available in Australia and in other countries to assist the industry. It is not being dealt with merely as an Australian problem. We are linking up our efforts and ability with the best brains of the Empire, and through the Empire Marketing Board are obtaining valuable assistance. The visits of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arnold</inline> Theiler, a leading veterinarian, and probably one of the world's leading scientists, and of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Orr</inline> will establish co-operation between the Commonwealth and Great Britain in this regard. When honorable senators have read the speech which the Prime Minister is to deliver in Sydney next week, I am sure they will admit that the Government is endeavouring to do its duty in this regard. </para>
