                        <para>- I must ask the honorable senator to give notice of the first part of his question. As to the second part of it, if the bill is not made a Government measure every facility will be afforded for its consideration, because it is generally recognized that there is need for the consolidation of the life assurance laws of Australia. I doubt, however, that Opportunity for considering the measure can be afforded during the present sittings. The business that will come forward from another place will most likely occupy the whole of our attention until the Christmas adjournment. [ can promise the honorable senator that if the Government does not bring in a life insurance bill every facility will be afforded to honorable senators opposite to bring one in when the Senate resumes its sittings after the new year. </para>

                        <para>The sugar agreement made by the BrucePage Government with the Queensland Government has fixed the conditions and prices for the sale of Australian sugar until 31st August, 1931. It provides for the supply of sugar for processing fruit products for home consumption at £6 5s.1d. per ton less than the ordinary price. While the Government is sympathetic with any difficulties that the growers of raspberries and currants in Tasmania may be encountering for the time being, it does not feel justified in seeking a variation of the agreement. </para>

                    <para>. It is a somewhat unique experience for me to speak on the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's Speech other than as a Government supporter. Conse quently,I listened very carefully to the remarks of both the mover 'and the seconder of the motion, and made notes of statements which I considered were not in accordance with fact. My purpose in so doing was to acquaint the public of Australia with the real reasons for the change of government. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Later I shall deal with one or two items in the Speech itself; but at this stage I feel justified in referring to the speech of the mover of the motion - an excellent speech in many respects, but spoiled by incorrect statements regarding the causes of the defeat of the BrucePage Government. The honorable senator ought to have refrained from making statements which could not. be corroborated. The first of his statements to which I take exception is that the Labour party had always been vilified by the previous Government. I do not know what object the honorable senator had in making that statement, but during the period that I have been connected with this Parliament I have heard no vilification of the Labour party by the late Government or its supporters. It is true that we have endeavoured to let the people of Australia know the truth about the Labour party; but so long as we told the truth there was, and, indeed, could not be, any vilification. If there was any vilification, it came from the members of the Labour party itself, and not from the party with which I am associated. </para>
                <para>The mover of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply said that the defeat of the Bruce-Page Government was the result of the awakening of the people. He described it as a great triumph for democracy. If democracy has to rely upon a campaign like that which preceded the last election, then God help democracy! </para>

                        <para>- The intelligent section of the community knows otherwise. The condition in which we find ourselves to-day has been brought about largely by organizations not. connected with the party to which 1 belong. If honorable senators will cast their minds back a year or two, they will remember that the unemployed problem in Australia was greatly accentuated by industrial troubles on the waterfront. After certain steps had been taken, peace was restored on the waterfront, for the first time in seven years. Then, less than twelve months ago, there was an upheaval in the timber industry. That strike  wa3  the cruellest which Australia has experienced for many years. Those who were responsible for it, knew that the industry could not be carried on in Australia unless the Australian product could be sold at. a price that would meet, Australian conditions. The only alteration in the conditions which the court imposed was a provision for 48 hours a week. When that, award was made, men whose own positions were secure, urged the unfortunate timber workers to disobey it; they told them that it was better to be half -starved than work 4S hours a week. Unfortunately, the effects of that strike were not confined to the timber workers. As the result of inquiries both in Melbourne and Sydney, 1 have found that the timber workers' strike resulted in the dislocation of a number of other industries, with a consequent reduction of employment therein. In some industries, the dislocation was so great  that, although to-day there is comparative peace in the timber industry, those industries have not yer recovered the ground lost during the strike. Nor will they do so for some time. As a result there have been added to the list of unemployed, thousands of men. who were not in any way directly concerned with the timber workers' strike. If one interviews the heads of any of the big furniture manufacturing establishments in any of the capital cities, one will be told that, because of the timber workers' strike, trade is now so stagnant that they are carrying on with staffs that have been reduced by 50 to 70 per cent. The spending power of the people has been so seriously impaired by these industrial disturbances, that necessarily a long time must elapse before it will be possible to bring the output in the furniture trade up to what it was prior to the strike. The mover of the motion <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dooley)</inline> declared that the Bruce-Page Government was to blame for the trouble in the timber industry. ' Those primarily responsible were the leaders of industrial organizations, because they incited trade unionists to starve rather than abandon the principle of a 44-hour week in the industry. They entirely ignored the fact that all sections of the timber industry were not in enjoyment of a 4.4-hour week. All the bush mills were working 4S hours, and actually the 44-hour principle applied only to city mills. </para>

And yet they profess to believe in the principle of arbitration ! Are not they aware that arbitration .as a principle rests upon the acceptance of awards of the court by both sides to a dispute? I hold that if arbitration is to be successful, an award, whatever may be its nature.  must be obeyed loyally by all concerned. If an award is not. acceptable to one or other of the parties, the act provides constitutional means for an alteration or amendment of it.  If we are to be regarded as a law-abiding people, and earn the respect of other countries, we must be prepared loyally to abide by all the decisions of our properly constituted cri  ibunals </para>

[ turu now <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> one or two incidents that came under my notice during the last election compaign. And I take this opportunity to say that they reflected no credit upon supporters of Labour candidates in the election for another place. Iti my somewhat lengthy career as a public man, I have taken part in many election campaigns, and I say without hesitation that I have never- known such widely organized misrepresentation to gain votes as I noticed during the recent election contest. I can speak only for Tasmania, but I have, no doubt other honorable senators will have something to say as to what happened in their States. </para>

                        <para>- Nationalist candidates who lost their seats need not be regarded as martyrs. They stood for a cause that is certain to be returned to power in the near future. But I set out to tell of a number of election incidents that came under my notice. In Hobart I found that many of those who were helping the sacred cause of Labour were visiting shop after shop, and informing sales girls and other employees that, if the Bruce-Page Government were returned, their wages would be reduced. </para>

Those who propagated the lie were fully aware that the Bruce-Page Government had no control whatever over the wages of shop girls in Tasmania, or any other State. Unfortunately, the average girl is not fully informed about these matters, and the girls in Hobart, at all events, did not know that their wages are determined by a State tribunal. But Labour supporters descended to still lower depths of degradation. They paid particular attention to a number of old-age and invalid pensioners, and . spread the lie that if the Bruce-Page Government were successful, invalid and old-age pensions would be reduced. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator knows that the Bruce-Page Government did not propose to reduce that form of assistance to any deserving case.  His  sneering reference to the proposal clearly suggests that he is prepared in make an unfortunate man, who may haw been out of work for a long time)- and who perhaps has a wife a in! half n dozen children to support, put his hand into his pocket and contribute towards the purchase of a gold bangle or silver cup for die child of wealthy parents. The late Government did not propose to deprive any deserving case of a maternity allowance. I have before me the report of the policy speech delivered by the present Prime Minister in the Richmond Town Hall on the 19th September, 1929, in which I naturally expected to find a definite and clear pronouncement regarding the policy of his party on matters of vital importance to Australia. I did not expect to read anything actually misleading to the people. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps I expected too much. In addition to more than the average number of ambiguities and platitudes, there were several instances of absolute piracy. As the report before me was despatched by mail for publication in the Tasmanian papers the day after its delivery, I presume it can be regarded as accurate. At the conclusion of his speech the present Prime Minister said that if his party were returned to power effect would be given to the policy which he enunciated eleven months ago. In the summary of the Labour party's proposals reference is made to the establishment of a radio telephone service between the mainland and Tasmania. I have always advocated the establishment of such a service; but I am strongly opposed- to the Prime Minister referring to the matter in the way he did, the suggestion being that his party was the first to propose it. He was fully aware that the Bruce-Page Government had already given consideration to the installation of such a service between the mainland and Tasmania, and had provided a certain sum <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the Estimates to cover preliminary costs. In effect, he said that if a Labour government were returned to power a radio telephone service would be installed. That, went down very well in Tasmania, because after a definite pronouncement has been made by a party leader it is difficult for the candidates belonging to other parties to put the true facts before the electors.

                <para class="block">General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> announced, on 25th October, that the new Government would continue the arrangements already made for the establishment of a radio telephone service between the mainland aud Tasmania. He further said that a sum of £100,000 had been placed on the Estimates for this work by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, and that the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> would make provision for a similar amount on his Estimates. In the same speech the present Prime Minister also said that if his party were returned to power telephonic communication between Perth and the eastern States would be established, but he did not tell the electors that a good deal of work in that connexion had already been done by his predecessors. As a member of the Public Works Committee I visited Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth in May of last year, where evidence was taken on the question of linking up Western Australia with the eastern States by telephone. Later the evidence was considered by that committee, a report was drafted and adopted, and was tabled in the House of Representatives before  the dissolution occurred. </para>

                        <para>- No; but if the present Leader of the Government in another place had been honest in the matter he would have announced that the initial steps in connexion with these two undertaking had been undertaken by the Bruce-Page Government, and that if his party were returned to power the work would be continued. Many people were grossly misled and electors, particularly in the States directly concerned, were under the impression that the Labour party was initiating these proposals. I mention these two distinct acts of piracy to show the manner in which the Nationalist party was misrepresented by its political opponents. The people were also told to beware of the powerful commercial and financial forces behind the Government, which were seeking to dictate the policy of this nation and who were at the moment endeavouring to turn back the clock thirty years in an endeavour to repeat the evils of the "nineties."

                <para>I want now to refer to a matter which E am very loth to touch upon, but about which someone must say something. It was another of the factors that had a wonderful influence on the recent election. The great majority of the public servants of Australia absolutely forgot that they held the title of public servants, and through their organizers and other officers came so much into the open that they publicly advertised in the newspapers of Australia, or at all events in one of them, which has a very big circulation, urging the people to vote Labour. </para>

                    I want to speak on this matter' dispassionately. I want the people of Australia to be proud of the public service of Australia. I want those who provide the wherewithal to maintain it to feel that it is a service in which they can have every confidence, and is one that will not descend to party politics. The first object of the public servant should be to serve his country. A public servant is literally one who serves his country. In the recent election, however, officials of public service organizations not only advertised in the public press, but also issued thousands of circulars, urging the people to vote for Labour. I shall read a paragraph from one circular, issued over the name of the secretary to the Tasmanian branch of the Postal Workers Union. It is as follows: -

                <quote>
                    <para>Allowance Postmasters. Any reduction in salaries applied to public servants would almost certainly mean a comparative reduction in your present niggardly allowance. So, beware. Do not be misled, Labour will give you fair play. Try them by voting No. 1 fo, Labour on Saturday, 1.2th October. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">They were not bold enough to say straight out that it was the intention of the then government, if returned to power, to reduce salaries, but the suggestion they made was that, if there should be any reduction, the allowance postmasters must bear a comparative reduction in their present niggardly allowance. It was a cruel and reckless suggestion to make, and had no foundation in truth. There had never been any suggestion emanating from the late Government, or its supporters, that there should be any reduction in the salaries of public servants, or any diminution of their status. But, as a matter of fact, the payment to allowance postmasters is purely a departmental affair, and is based entirely on the amount of business done in any particular allowance post office. If an allowance postmistress finds on her returns that she has increased" her postal business, she gets an addition to her allowance. On the other hand, if there has been a decrease in the business she has done, her allowance is decreased. That is the contract entered into between the department and the allowance officer. It is made, not with the Prime Minister, nor with the Government, nor with the </para>
                <para class="block">Parliament, but with the Postal Department, and this public service organization  well  knew it. Yet this suggestion was good enough, from a party political point of view, to broadcast throughout Tasmania among the allowance officersanu other people connected with the public service. </para>
                <para>We have in Australia a population of 0,200,000, and we have an extensive public "service. We have tried to make it a useful body. It is also expensive, but to get good business we must be prepared to pay well. I may remind the Senate that Australia has entered upon a period of adversity. How long it will continue, no one knows. I have no wish to be a dismal prophet, but I am afraid that under the present administration it will be much more prolonged than it would have been  under  the previous administration, lt is now indicated that extra taxation is to be imposed upon the people. I speak with a desire to help. I say that it is the duty of the public servants to recognize that the people outside, who have to find the wherewithal, should receive proper consideration. No matter how we may try to allay the feeling outside that they are overburdened by having an expensive public service to maintain, that feeling is a  growing  one, and if the period of adversity is prolonged and the burden of taxation becomes too great upon them, the people will rise up and cry for economy; and, as is always the case, the first effort at economy will be an attempt to reduce the cost of the public service. For my part, I want the public servant to maintain the esteem and respect of the community; but he cannot hold that when he descends to party politics. I, therefore, regret very much the attitude taken up by a majority of the public servants during the last election campaign. I have been in public life for many years, and I have become acquainted with thousands of public servants, who are always prepared to do their very best for their country; but I am afraid that, in their organizations as in other organizations, those who put self first predominate. The watchword of the public service should be " Our country first and all the time." </para>

I look upon this innovation with a good deal of dread. I am not militaristic; but I should be unworthy of being called an Australian, or, indeed, a Britisher, if I neglected to do my part in seeing that Australia is in a position to defend itself. I, therefore, ' strongly object to any step which weakens an already weakened defence system. It is not safe at this juncture to do so. It would not be worthy of Australia to weaken its defence scheme in view of the debt it owes to the Mother Country, upon whom an additional burden would thus be placed. I regret very much that the Government has seen fit to take this step without conferring with those who were in a position to advise it, and who, I think every one will admit, were in the best position to give advice. The Government took steps to abolish compulsory military training, and then went to its ' advisers and asked them to help it to find a substitute. </para>

                        <para>- According to the Governor-General's Speech, Ministers look forward to the Imperial and Economic Conferences to be held next year, with a sincere hope that they will be able to co-operate with  His  Majesty's Government in Great Britain to the lasting benefit of the Commonwealth of Australia and the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. We shall have another opportunity to deal with this matter; but I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> how he can expect his Government to look forward with a sincere hope of cooperating with the British Government in matters that will ensure the lasting benefit of Australia, and also the Old Country, when it is the absolutely determined attitude of his Government to do no trade with the Mother Country in the direction of buying goods from her. We, in Australia, are separated from Great Britain by thousands of leagues of sea. We have a wonderful heritage capable of producing twenty times  more  than it now does could we but find a market. We are absolutely dependent upon outside sources for the disposal of our surplus products. Yet the indication given in the Governor-General's Speech is that our tariff wall is to be raised even higher against other countries. In effect, we say to the British manufacturer, " We want you to give us the best price for our wool ", and to the British people we appeal, " We desire you to buy more Australian products than you have done previously, because we are your kith and kin." But it must not be forgotten that they are also our kith and kin. We tell the people of Great Britain further, " Having bought our raw material, if you dare to manufacture it into goods such as we use in Australia our tariff wall will be raised so high that you will be unable to climb over it." But we shall still term it tariff preference. Last year I had the privilege of visiting the Old Country, and I spent a great proportion of my time doing what I could to help Australian industries. I did not confine my attention to the cities, but visited the provincial centres and boosted Australian products on every possible occasion. I remember being entertained in England by a certain organization, and in my address to the gathering I stressed not only the desirability but the fairness of British consumers using more Australian goods. The gentleman who re1sponded to my speech stated that he appreciated my earnest, desire to advance Australian trade, but that he wished to inform me that for many years local manufacturers had dealt very extensively with Australia in a commodity upon which a fair duty had been imposed. That duty was then increased so exorbitantly that in one year the Australian business of those manufacturers had fallen off by 80 per cent., due to the introduction of a tariff which they were unable to surmount. He added that, despite this, we still claimed to be giving effect to the principle of British preference, and that it was difficult to listen sympathetically to my plea in the circumstances. I believe that there is only one policy which is any good to Australia to-day, and that is one of work. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> can explain to me how a man with a wife and family, receiving £5 a week, can afford to buy as much now that the cost of production has increased by 100 to 125 per cent. as he could when he was receiving £4 a week, the problem is solved. But it cannot be done, and the worker is compelled to buy less. That is due principally to the organized restriction of output. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> comes from a city where that practice has reached startling dimensions. The honorable senator knows that if a worker is honest and industrious enough to give his employer a reasonable day's work for his pay, he is soon disciplined, and fined heavily for his temerity. Recently I quoted such a case that came under my notice only a few months ago, and  I  have since heard of a number of other instances. I know of a man working in one of the suburbs of Sydney, who did a job effectively in a certain time. Within a week he was paraded before his union and fined £10 for cutting down the time in which the union considered the job should be done. That man has no redress, as he has to remain a member of the organization to receive work. </para>

The administration of that party will have my support in all matters which have my approval. I do not believe that there is a Nationalist or a Country party senator who desires to retain his seat, simply for the purpose of opposing the government in power. I am confident that, like myself, they will do all they can to advance the interests of Australia. I sincerely hope that when the details of the measures forecast in the Governor-General's Speech are dis closed, the programme will not be as bad as we anticipated. If it is, I shall be bound to fight it. I hope that the Government will realize the wisdom of at all times keeping before it the real needs of Australia, and that it will avoid sectional legislation. We are Australians and we cannot injure one section of the community without injuring all. </para></speech>

                    <para>. -  As one sitting in opposition to the Government of the day, and almost wholly unfamilar with Parliamentary etiquette and procedure, may I say how glad I was to hear the right honorable Leader of the Opposition state on Thursday last that it was his intention not unnecessarily to harass the Government, but to help by constructive suggestions any endeavours it made to introduce legislation according to the mandate received by it from the country. I read into that declaration an indication that the right honorable gentleman did not intend to adopt a narrow attitude towards the administration of the Government. On the other hand, I was very sorry to hear an honorable senator on this side attempt to belittle, if not to ridicule, that great office, the VicePresidency of the Executive Council, and the senator occupying it, as well as his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> by referring to them as " half-baked " Ministers. I hope that, however much we appreciate the need to increase the existing Ministerial representation in the Senate, none of us will again descend to such tactics. If we consider the subject and put ourselves for a moment in the position of the Leader of the Government in this chamber, we shall realize that it is one of the most difficult in Parliament to-day. It falls upon the honorable senator to pilot through this chamber all the measures that come from another place. He has very slender numerical support in the Senate, and is faced with a party overwhelmingly strong in numbers, one that includes three ex-State premiers, ten or twelve ex-cabinet Ministers, and one or two of the most able political tacticians in the Commonwealth. We should deal with honorable senators opposite as men. We shall not refrain from criticizing the measures which the Government introduces. On the contrary, we shall criticize them severely and oppose them strenuously, if we feel they are not in the best interest of the community. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In that attitude of constructive criticism, I should like to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of maintaining the national credit. All who have had any experience of affairs beyond the borders of Australia know that credit is one of the most important elements in national or individual progress and prosperity. I am inclined to think that this Government has not yet recognized that fact. I feel that that is a lesson yet to be brought home to it, and I believe that the lesson will be learned. Credit is a pedestal very delicate in structure if weakened, but very powerful if maintained. Anything that interferes with the foundation of the pedestal will affect us individually and collectively, most seriously. </para>
                <para>I find in the Governor-General's Speech a total disregard of the future. This Government had no sooner taken office than it rushed in and interfered with the existing migration system. It cabled to Great Britain asking for a modification of the migration agreement, and made announcements that have been broadcast throughout the civilized world, indicating that Australia, a country as large as the United States of America, does not hold potentialities for more than the paltry 6,500,000 people who now inhabit it. </para>

The effect. is a direct shaking of chat pedestal of credit. Financiers on the other side of the world, as well as industrialists' and others, who were looking to Australia to provide fresh opportunities for themselves and their families. will now say, " No ; Australia is not the place for us. Let us look for other fields of investment and industry, other homes for ourselves and our families." The Government has seriously retarded the development of this country, for no matter what argument is now brought forward, an indelible impression has been made on the minds of people overseas that Australia is unable to absorb even three or four thousand migrants per annum. </para>

They requisition the Home authorities, through the Commonwealth, so that the Commonwealth is really only the medium through which correspondence between the States and the British Government passes.

Soon after the formation of the new Ministry, the Prime Minister, with a view to advertising Australia and giving the people of other countries an opportunity of knowing him and his Ministers, and their views, consented to the making of a. " talkie " film. The speech of the Prime Minister of this young and progressive country, supposed to be well endowed with great natural resources, informed the world that Australia contained many thousands of unemployed. If that was not another dagger thrust at the credit of this young country, I do not know what it was. The Government would be well advised to do its utmost to prevent that film from being exhibited outside Australia. </para>

Should the Government venture into fields of activity of that kind, I hope that it will not act without expert advice. I have here a leaflet which, I understand, was distributed throughout the electoral division of Calare. Over the signature of G. A. Gibbons, now the honorable member for that district in another place, appears the following: - </para>

                    <para>Our industry is in a bad condition. The wheat crop will be very limited, while wool values are extremely low.

                        <para>- I thank the honorable member for his interjection. Although in clear and definite terms the late Government stated that it did not possess the constitutional powers necessary to grapple with the situation effectively, not one member of the present Government gave it credit for sincerity. Indeed, that Government was accused of not telling the truth. When the BrucePage Government made proposals for the settlement of the dispute, certain members of the present Ministry went into the country to persuade those most directly concerned not to take any heed of the Government's efforts. I wish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> to remember how the work of the previous Government was hindered in this way. I have no desire to make the task of this Government any more difficult than it is. All I desire is to impress upon the Leader of the Senate that the Ministry, of which he is a member, is in much the same position as the Bruce-Page Government, when it endeavoured to bring about a solution of the coal-mining dispute in New South Wales. For this reason I have a good deal of sympathy for the Leader of the Senate in his appeal for assistance. It seems to me that he realizes, probably for the first time the magnitude of the task confronting the Government, and how much more difficult was the task of the previous Government, because of the gross misrepresentation of motives. The issue appears to me to be a simple one - similar to that of two persons engaged in a business. On the one hand we have the coal-mine owner, and on the other the employee. I am not suggesting that the dispute in the. industry is the fault entirely of either the mine-owners or the employees. Probably there are faults on both sides. But it is a fact that, through their joint action some years ago, they raised the price of coal to such a high level that it has become an unmarketable product abroad, and now there is a deadlock. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran,</inline> who is an ardent supporter of the present Ministry, that the Government of the State, which he assists to represent in this chamber, found recently that it could save an enormous sum of money by importing coal from Great Britain, despite the fact that British coal had to be transported over 12,000 miles as against less than 2,000 miles from Newcastle. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with the honorable senator. But let me return to the position in New South Wales. It has been suggested that if the miners would agree to a reduction of ls. a ton in wages, the owners would cut ls. a ton off their profits, and that the general public should contribute 2s. to enable the industry to carry on. It would be just as logical for me to ask honorable senators to contribute 2s. a ton for all trade that passed through my hands in the course of my business." That, in a nut shell, sums up the coal-mining position in New South Wales. We have a fairly considerable coal deposit in Western Australia. It may not be regarded as the best steaming coal, but it is a good quality product, and is largely used in my State. The miners there have been working for twenty years, and have never had any trouble. During the whole of the time  the mines in New South Wales have been closed the Western Australian miners have been asked to keep on working and contribute to the support of their idle comrades in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- Before the making of the award to which so much objection was taken, bush workers scattered all over the Commonwealth were working 48 hours. The Lukin award did not affect, that, section of the industry, and there was no outcry because the hours of bush timber workers had not been reduced to 44. It was only when the award affected organized timber workers in Sydney and Melbourne thai there was trouble. Then, to quote the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare,</inline> it became a rotten award, or, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> worse than a rotten award. </para>

                <para>I turn now to the references in the Governor-General's Speech to the £34,000,000 migration agreement, and I suggest that the Government would have acted far more honorably if it. had brought down a proposal to suspend the scheme in its entirety instead of suspending the assisted passages agreement and expecting the Government of Great Britain to contribute towards interest payments on any amounts raised. By repudiating the solemn obligation contained in an agreement, this Government has  sunk  to a very low level indeed, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator R.</inline> D. Elliott observed, it has done a great deal to shake the confidence of the people of Great Britain in the Commonwealth. It would seem that because a certain percentage of Southern Europeans are coining to -Australia, migration, in the opinion of the Labor party, must cease altogether. I have no particular love for Southern Europeans, but in fairness to those who have come to Australia it must  be said that they have shown a disposition to work. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. No matter what may be said in derogation of these southern Europeans, the leaders of trade unions take very good care that they join up and pay their union fees. As to the Italians who have settled in Western Australia. I may say that some time ago when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Angwin,</inline> who is now Agent-General for Western Australia in London, was Minister for Lands and controlled the activities of the Agricultural Bank, he stated publicly that if farmers continued to let contracts to Italians for the clearing of their land he would withhold assistance to them from the Agricultural Bank. It would appear, however, that private members of the party to which the Minister belonged did not share his views, as in the course of conversation, one of them remarked, " I wish to God I was not in my present position to-day. If I were not where I am I would soon get these Italians to do my clearing. I had two gangs sent up from the Government Labour Bureau to my farm, and boughttools, tents, and ' tucker ' for them. They stayed on my farm until they had eaten all the ' tucker,' then they sold ' all the tools and tents and cleared out and left my work undone." The principal objection to the Italians seems to be that they are inclined to work. </para>

                <para>The government proposes to abolish the Development and Migration Commission. This, we are told, is to be done in the interests of economy. It may be good tactics to save 6d. in expenditure and advertise the fact. If the news is broadcast effectively the world takes more notice' than if we spend £50 and say nothing about it. It is well known that for some time the Development and Migration Commission has been a clear target for every critic to shoot at. It has not been at all difficult to ascertain how much it has cost the Commonwealth to date, but the value of its work is not so easily ascertainable. I know, however, that it has saved Western Australia a great deal of unnecessary expenditure, and I firmly believe. that if it had been appointed a few years earlier, it would have prevented the unnecessary expenditure of millions of pounds, and saved a large number of people from a good deal of misery. I say without hesitation that the good work done by the Development and Migration Commission for Western Australia alone more than balances its total cost to the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>I do not propose to deal at length with the Government's proposal to abolish compulsory military training. That has been fully dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce), Senator Glasgow</inline> and other honorable senators; but I take this opportunity to say that since the Government approves of the voluntary system I hope it will become universal. A not inconsiderable number of industrial leaders lately have been advocating the voluntary enforcement of the Arbitration Court awards. Now the Government appears to favour the voluntary system of military training. I hope it will go further. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable senator was speaking of an allCanadian wheat pool I interjected that there was no all-Canadian wheat pool in the sense indicated, and he replied that I was too precipitate, as usual. Actually there is no Canadian wheat pool as outlined by the honorable senator. . The three prairie States of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have organized wheat pools which are controlled by a directorate elected by the participants in the respective pools. No other authority has any control over the farmers' wheat and, as nearly as I can ascertain, the three pools control 52 per cent, of the wheat production of Canada. Although the pooling system is carried on to a considerable extent in Canada all the Canadian wheat is not under control. The only really successful wheat pool in the Commonwealth is that in Western Australia, which is controlled by the farmers themselves. It is a voluntary pool and is the only one in the Commonwealth which is conducted as a business organization. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> that the people of Western Australia will never consent to being associated with an all-Australian wheat pool. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. It is interesting to note the extraordinary changes which are occurring in the policy of the Labour party. Some time ago the party favoured the nationalization of all means of production, distribution and exchange. That had a masculine and commanding sound. But times changed, and we were then informed that that party believed in the " socialization " of the  menus  of production, distribution and exchange. That expression apparently had a more seductive and feminine touch. It has now gone a step further and instead of using the words "nationalization" and "socialization," it employs "co-ordination," which suggests perhaps that a happy state of matrimony exists between the other two. </para>

                        <para>- He was jointly responsible with the Government of which he was a member. I agree with the honorable senator's contention that the Commonwealth and State Governments have got into the habit of spending too much - money, and perhaps in many cases spending it unwisely. Unfortunately, that fault is not confined to governments, as quite a number of private persons are guilty of doing the same thing. The honorable senator also said that the Bruce-Page Government sought means to spend surplus revenue instead of handing it over to the States as provided by the Constitution. Without attempting to argue that point, I wish to quote a statement made in evidence before the Western Australian Disabilities Commission, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> G. Higgs was the-  chairman,  and which, in 1925, inquired into the financial position of that State. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keenan,</inline> on behalf of the State Advisory Committee, quoted section 6 of the Surplus Revenue Act of 1910 which provides that "In addition to the payments referred to in section 4 of this act, the Treasurer shall pay to the several States, in proportion to the numbers of their people, all surplus revenue, if any, in his hands at the close of each financial year." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> R.

                    <para>That section was never intended to give to the States any money at all. It was put into the bill with my own knowledge, because of a constitutional difficulty. . . It waa never at any time agreed or suggested that moneys, in addition to the 25s., should be paid over to the States. It was fully understood by everybody concerned that the 25s. was to be a final pay.ment It was estimated that the surplus revenue available would be 25s. and not more. . . And it was deliberately intended that there should be no surplus to distribute under that section. </para>

It is unfortunate that the governments of Australia have got into the habit of spending more money than perhaps should be collected from the people.

                        <para>- Yes, the Labour party gained a considerable accretion of strength and a good deal of publicity in that connexion. It is rather unfortunate that the Government was compelled to go to the country when its' budget proposals, involving imposition of additional taxation in certain directions, had just been brought down. The Nationalist party did not for a moment favour a reduction in wages. We contend that high wages are the result of high production. This is demonstrated in other countries. For instance, in the United States of America higher wages are earned because of higher production, and the workers have, if anything, better condition of living than they have in Australia. This I had an opportunity of seeing when I was in California last year. The same thing applies in Canada. We hear a tremendous outcry about the conditions of living' in Australia compared with those in other parts of the world. The picture is very much overdrawn. The conditions of living in many countries of the world where wages are lower than they are in Australia, are better than here. I am Vice-Consul for Sweden, in Rockhampton, and I have read a good deal about the conditions of living in Sweden. Conditions of living there are in many respects much better than they are in this country, although the Swedish workers there do not enjoy the high wages we have here. I mention these two cases to show that conditions of living are not altogether dependent on high wages or low wages. </para>

                <para>Now that the country has decided that it is desirable to retain federal arbitration, it is, in my humble opinion, the right time for the Labour Government to ask the people by way of referendum for additional powers to make federal arbitration function properly, and I recommend that the people should, be asked to decide on the lines proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> in 1926, and agreed to by both Houses of Parliament. It was only when the proposals were submitted to the people that the union organizers decided to oppose them. I really believe that in the present temper of the country there is a very strong chance of the people saying " yes " on this occasion. Of course I am not going to say that I would approve of them as they were put forward by this Government. </para>

                <para>We hear a good deal about the coal trouble, and the promise of members of the Government to settle it within a very limited time - I think a fortnight was the period mentioned - and we hear also much about hardship and suffering in connexion with it. The responsibility for this hardship and suffering rests on the men themselves. It is their wives and children who are suffering, yet they will not do the work which lays at their hands, because they will not accept one jot of a reduction in wages or an extension of hours. I do not advocate the men accepting low wages, but with some knowledge of the coal industry, I say that they could, by some slight reduction in the hewing rate, earn wages which would be envied by every other class of. artisan in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It is not nonsense. I know what I am talking about. It has come out that when a month's notice of the lockout was given and the men saw that there was a lean time in front of them for probably a long period they put forth their best efforts and in some cases earned as much as £25 a week in the Newcastle coal mines. We can, of course, take a very large discount off that figure. But is there any need for women and children to be suffering and starving when men can earn wages like that if they willingly turn their hands to it? It is another example of the way in which the organizers control the members of their organizations. . I think we can safely say that Australia is union- organizer-ridden to the point of madness. </para>

                <para>I was connected with a coal-mine in Central Queensland where the ordinary award rates were being paid to the workers, but every fortnight that came round showed a loss. At last it was decided to close down the mine and the miners were given notice to that effect. Some other miners on the same field approached the directors and offered to work the mine on tribute and it was finally agreed that it should be worked on tribute by these men. From that day to this the miners have been doing well and the owners likewise. When orders are good the former have each averaged wages at the rate of £1,200 per annum. Possibly co-operation on similar lines will solve our difficulties in the coal industry. It has been adopted in Central Queensland with quite good results on a number of mines, and the workers are able to make very good wages. They could do the same in New South Wales. The hardship and suffering of which we are told could be avoided if the men would be content toearn a good wage even though it involved the acceptance of a slightly lower hewing rate. If the employers cannot make a reasonable profit, it stands to reason that they cannot keep their mines open. It has been ascertained by investigation that 2s.1d. was the profit shown on the old basis of working. </para>

                <para>I view the decision to abolish compulsory military training with a good deal of misgiving. It is true that there are gestures of peace on every hand, and that these may be thought to justify the adoption of a voluntary system. But gestures of peace have been tried out from the beginning of the world's history; they have always failed in the past,' and probably must fail in the future. I hope they will not, and certainly think that they should be encouraged in every way. I trust that the wit of man will yet conceive something that will do away with war. But we must be ina position to defend our country, and I do not think that the voluntary system will give that adequate measure of defence which the Government considers necessary. I have had experience of both systems. Under the voluntary system in the old militia days in Queensland, it was quite an easy matter in country centres to raise companies of light horse or even artillery, but in the cities it was most difficult to get volunteers for infantry and arms of that kind. The position will be accentuated more than ever to-day, because the inducements to participate in amusements in cities are greater than they were at the time of whichI am speaking. Despite all our improvements in the art of war, infantry still remains the base line, and I do not see. how, by the voluntary system, we can obtain sufficient troops to fill our infantry quotas in the cities, which, afterall, are the places where defence is most required. The 4s. a day which the Government is offering by way of remuneration to volunteers when they are undergoing training compares most unfavorably with the 8s. a day paid in the pre-compulsory days, when the value of the £1 was very much greater than it is to-day. Compulsory training had a great many merits which voluntary training will not have. The voluntary system is most unfair, inasmuch as it is everybody's duty to lit himself to defend his country; but under it we get only the patriotically inclined to submit to. training, whilst the others are probably watching football matches, losing the benefit of the physical development that is gained by those who submit to military training, and not learning obedience to orders. There is no opportunity to inculcate discipline in them, and discipline, above all things, is what the young Australian is sadly lacking. These are points which ought to be considered by  the Government. Ministers should not lightly do away with compulsory training. Some months ago I had the advantage of a couple of days' unofficial connexion with a camp in central Queensland, and at the end of the course of training I was particularly pleased to see the troops swing through the streets of Rockhampton. The physique of those boys - their ages ranged from 18 to 20 years - was something to be proud of, and the way they swung along with martial stride and good step showed that the training had not been wasted on them. That is an example of the advantages we shall lose by the alteration in the system of defence. I cannot understand why Labour has done this. . It brought in compulsory training, and the system has functioned very satisfactorily. It was the base line for supplying troops for the Great War. Yet now, because of some influence which is not apparent to me, Labour has gone  back on its old principles, and has removed this very necessary element from the public life of Australia. </para>
                <para>I also regret the stopping of nominated migrants from the Old Country. I assume that is what is meant by the cablegram recently despatched by the Prime Minister. It is really a repudiation of the £34,000,000 migration agreement, and I daresay that the British Government is making representations to the Commonwealth Government to that effect. </para>
                <para>A great deal is said about absorption. 1 agree it is very necessary to keep that phase well before us, but surely, with our vast spaces and great resources, we can absorb a reasonable quota of migrants. The fears of this Government were not entertained by our pioneers.- When my father and others came out to this country they were unskilled, and absolutely unfitted for immediate developmental work, but they settled down and fully 90 per cent, of them made good. To-day their childrenare in excellent positions. </para>

                        <para>- That is admitted, but Australia then had no markets, and lesser absorptive power than it has to-day. The principal factor governing the success of our pioneers was their indomitable spirit. They did not require the spoon-feeding methods that are so popular to-day. Nor was there a Labour government in power with unsound ideas on migration. We have also to consider the matter from the point of view of the League of Nations, a tribunal which regards with disfavour the perpetuation of Australia's vast unoccupied spaces, while other countries remain over populated. That is one  reason why further consideration should be given to the problem, and why it should be viewed broadly. </para>

                <para>We should encourage rather than discourage assisted migration. I admit that the Mother Country also has its responsibilities in the -matter. The London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> recently announced that Great Britain had reached its peak as regards population, and the only solution of its problem was a better distribution of its people throughout the Empire. America also has probably reached its peak of population, and will need a distribution. But such a distribution does not necessarily mean sending to Australia only the unemployed. It should rather be a transfer of desirable citizens. I believe that Australia should receive from Britain a proportion of the intelligentsia - commercial people, manufacturers, high technicians, the best type of people, accompanied with capital, who will be able to establish and carry &gt;u new industries in this country. If that plan were followed, Australia would have no reason to complain of the migration scheme, and Great Britain would be assisted, as we should then be able to absorb a greater proportion of her unemployed. We must have brains, capital, and directivity. I expressed similar views when at Sydney, Nova Scotia, with the Empire Parliamentary delegation last year, and they appeared to be acceptable to the British representatives present. </para>
                <para>I understand that it is the intention of the Government to amalgamate the Development and Migration Commission with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, under the Works Department. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear it. I consider that the activities of those two bodies are entirely different, and that such a procedure would be unsound. I have already indicated to some extent the trend 'of the activities of the Development and Migration Commission. Those of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research are more in the direction of scientific experiment and research and, while I think that the council has done very good work, I believe that there are still untouched many avenues which it should investigate. That body did excellent work inquiring into diseases in sheep and other matters vital to Australia, but I should have liked to see it direct attention to mining technology and the liquefaction of coal. The latter is a pet subject of mine, and both are of the utmost importance to the development of Australia. For over three years I have been concentrating upon the commercial possibility of extracting oil from coal. While I was* with the Empire Parliamentary Delegation, the subject was debated at a conference, presided over by the Minister of Mines, Vancouver. The English delegate, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall,</inline> who is now a Minister in the British Labour Government, was firmly of the opinion that the scientist in charge of operations in Great Britain was not putting his best foot forward, or sufficiently optimistic in his task, with the result that other countries were outpacing Great Britain. T com mented that it was rather unfortunate for Australia that it was so, and the Canadian representative echoed my sentiments on behalf of his own country. I said that both countries were relying for guidance on experiments being conducted in Great Britain. Since then, there has been a great development in the matter. I believe that an eminent German chemist has discovered a new method for the liquefaction of coal. T refer to the Bergius process, which is succeeding so well that Germany expects that, within three or four years' time not one gallon of oil will be imported into' that country. Also, the low pressure process is proving so successful in Great Britain that it is being employed wherever coalfields exist. Australia, with its marvellous coal deposits, should have a far better chance to extract oil from coal, than to win it from natural resources. Of course, I wish to see that method also prove successful, but to me it has not the possibilities open to the distillation of coal. </para>

                        <para>- I am pleased to hear it. With our immense coal resources, there should be no need for us to import oil. At present we send abroad about £13,000,000 per annum to purchase petrol, which could better be kept in the country and devoted to the winning of coal and the distillation of oil from it. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> hope that the Government will stay its hand, and not interfere with the activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, but rather -direct them along the lines which I have suggested. Both that council and the Development and Migration Commission; require time to achieve results, and if those results are not yet as apparent as we should like, there is no doubt that weshall appreciate their importance in the near future. </para>

                <para>I have a grievance to voice in connexion with the allocation of portfolios. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> has intimated that the Senate was flouted in that allocation. I agree with the right honorable gentleman, that we should have had <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> departmental head, in addition to the VicePresident of the  Executive  Council, a position which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> is, so far, worthily filling. I desire, not to reiterate the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce, but to call attention to the manner in which the State of Queensland has been flouted. The third State of the Commonwealth is represented only by an honorary Minister, an improper condition of affairs. I do not say a word about the fitness of Queensland's representative in the Cabinet; but as a matter of principle it is wrong that the great State of Queensland should have to be content with an honorary Minister in a cabinet of thirteen. That is unfair treatment for my State, and I strongly protest against it. That reminds me of a promise made by the gentleman who has the honor to represent Quensland in the Cabinet. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> stated on the hustings that he favoured, for a period of five years, a bounty on the exportable surplus of beef to enable the cattlemen of Queensland to survive their losses occasioned by the recent drought, and to get on their feet again. Will the Government give effect to that promise, or is it to be treated merely as a cheap vote-catching device ? </para>
                <para>There is one thing in the speech upon which I heartily congratulate the Government, and that is the announcement of its intention to proceed vigorously with the completion of the Kyogle to South Brisbane railway. A sum of £350,000 has been placed on the Estimates for the purpose. I understand that, although the railway is approaching completion, the bridge over the Clarence River is a long way off finality. My object in eulogizing the Government in this respect is to ask it particularly to expedite the work on that bridge, so that the complete opening of the line will not be long delayed. I asked a question on the subject the other day, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> replied that, in all probability, the Clarence River bridge will not be finished until some months after the completion of the railway. I urge the Government to take every step to expedite the completion of that bridge. Until that is effected the railway will not function as satisfactorily as we all desire. </para>

Although pressure has been brought to bear upon them, they have so far refused to include a Sunday train. I speak without authority in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> matter; but I understand that the NewSouth Wales Commissioner was agreeable to the running of a Sunday train, but that the Commissioner in Queensland was not. Now that there is a different government in Queensland, it might be possible, if the Federal Government, which is financing the scheme, were to approach it, to get a promise from both Commissioners that a daily train service, including Sundays, will be established. There is a daily train between Sydney and Melbourne and also between Melbourne and Adelaide, and there is no reason why there should not also; be a daily train between Sydney and Brisbane. </para>

                <para>I desire to refer to the question of preferences. When the return of a Labour Government in Britain was announced, 1 was the first person in Rockhampton to hazard the conjecture that our preferences with the Mother Country were in danger. Unfortunately, we had not long to wait before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Snowden</inline> announced that, in order to provide a free breakfast table for the people of the Old Country, the British Government would do away with those preferences. Later, because of representations made by the Dominions, that Government modified its proposals. It has now decided to hold the matter over until the Imperial Conference which is to be held next May. L hope that the Prime Minister who, no doubt, will represent Australia on that occasion, will urge the retention of the existing preferences. They mean a great deal to Queensland. Let us consider their effect in respect of one item alone. Assuming that the export of sugar from Queensland to Britain is 200,000 tons per annum, the removal of the preference would mean a loss to Queensland on that item alone of £1,000,0.00. It might be urged that the removal of the preference would provide a cheaper commodity forthe people of Britain; but it would, after all, make so little difference to the average family as to be negligible. In any case, the value of the preference granted to Australia by Britain is not nearly so great as that granted to the Old Country by Australia. </para>
                <para>The Governor-General's .Speech deals with a number of financial matters, but I shall leave my remarks concerning them until the Budget proposals are before the Senate. The outlook is not particularly bright, but, fortunately, there are a number of factors which indicate that an improvement is in sight. The appreciation in the price of wool, the bountiful rains which have fallen recently, and the lowering of the interest rate, indicate that, we are turning the corner and that more prosperous times lie ahead. Should the Government adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibbons)</inline> and guarantee 6s. 6d. a bushel for wheat, a doubtful benefit to growers would be assured ! By wise administration the Government can do much to assist the country. So long as it brings before the Senate sane and progressive measures, it will meet with no captious opposition. The assistance of the Opposition will be withheld only if the Government introduces fantastic or highly experimental legislation. </para>

I stand to-day where I stood twenty years ago in relation to industrial regulation. I have always held that there should be only one industrial authority in the Commonwealth. For years I have advocated that full powers in such matter? should be vested in the Commonwealth. Some time ago, when the electors were asked to grant fuller powers to the Commonwealth, the action of the Labour party resulted in their giving a negative decision. </para>

                <para>I now propose to pursue a line of argument which might be regarded as somewhat pessimistic or revolutionary. In this country to-day there is one main issue, and there are two parties. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber stand for the preservation of the existing social system. They believe in improving it where it needs improvement; in mending it, hut not ending it. Another section, which controls the Labour movement to-day, believes in the destruction of the present system and setting up in its place a communistic state. Thus there' is a complete line of demarcation between the principles enunciated by honorable senators on this side of the chamber and the social system advocated by that section which controls <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> and his followers in this chamber. There is not any shadow of doubt that this is the issue before the people. The question of a divergence of political faith is not involved. For thousands of years this intricate political problem has been under discussion. If we go back to the days of Plato we find that he stood for the democratic state, while Aristotle represented the aristocratic system of government. But the people in those days were either not sufficiently educated or were too careless to take an intelligent interest in the discussion of the issues that came before them. -In our time, owing largely to a wider knowledge of the doctrine preached by Karl Marx, the issue is becoming a somewhat acute problem, and in my judgment it .will have to be fought out in the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>It is remarkable that the Labour party to-day is endeavouring to steer a course between these two extreme  schools of thought. It is appearing in a new role. In its earlier days Labour directly challenged all forms of monopoly, and strenuously opposed the money power.' On many occasions I have heard my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> fulminating against monopolies, whatever form they took. To-day it would appear that he and other members of the Labourparty have abandoned those cherished principles, and so we find them in the role of the friend of the monopolistic enterprises and the representatives of themoneyed class. We have this evidence on every hand. It is written in character* so .plain that he who runs may read. Labour has mortgaged its political soul tothe money power. I need only remind the Senate of the attitude of the party during the recent election. Is it not a fact that the huge picture combine in this country - representing largely American capital - went to enormous expense <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> ensure the return of the Labour party? It may not be out of place here to emphasize that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of pounds, are extracted from the people of the Commonwealth by the moving picture interests in the United States of America. During the election  its representatives in this country raised the cry - " Hands off the people's amusements." Arid the Labour party, be it noted, immediately fell in behind .this combine and said - " No taxation of the people's amusements." Why was that done? Was it not because the moving picture combine spent hundreds of thousands of pounds to help the Labour party to win the election? </para>

                        <para>- It was only necessary during the election to walk down the streets of any of our principal capital cities to find evidence on every hand of the active participation of the American picture combine in the campaign. At almost every session in many picture theatres there was thrown on the screen an announcement of the taxation proposals of the Bruce-Page Government, and an urgent appeal was made to the people to vote for candidates representing the party which advocated no taxation on amusements. This was done every day. I repeat, that the moving picture industry must have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds to assist the Labour party, because that was the only party which promised not to impose a tax on amusements. I am satisfied that those controlling the industry, by the expenditure of a huge sum of money, helped the Labour party very materially to defeat the BrucePa.ge Government. Indeed, some of their placards urged the electors to vote Labour. These election advertisements were displayed on hoardings in every street in Hobart, as well as on every main road in the environs of the city. Why, then, should <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> feel so sore about the reminder? I repeat that, by falling in behind the picture combine, the Labour party during the last election campaign, surrendered itself to this capitalistic monopoly. </para>

                <para>The argument of our Labour friends was that the Bruce-Page proposal to tax the moving picture industry on its gross turnover was vicious in principle. As a matter of fact, it is not a new principle at all. The present Ministry, even to-day, by the imposition of excise duties, is taxing the gross turnover of breweries throughout the Commonwealth. I also remind the Senate that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> the Postmaster-General, when a member of a Tasmanian Ministry, introduced a similar measure, under which every publican in that State had to pay a tax of 2£d. on every gallon of beer and every bottle of whiskey which he ordered. Was not that taxation upon the gross turnover? The present federal land tax also embodies exactly the same principle. It is a tax upon the gross turnover of the land-owner, so, as I have said, there is nothing new in the principle. </para>

                        <para>- This objection to the principle which, as I have shown, is not a valid objection, was the only excuse which the Labour Party could offer for surrendering itself, body and soul, to the American picture combine. But we have other instances of Labour's defection from its former principles. The liquor interests have always been <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the side of Labour, and it is a coincidence that immediately Labour is returned to power, by amending the excise duties of the previous Government, it hands back to the rich breweries the Id. a gallon additional excise duty imposed by the BrucePage Government recently. Is not this further evidence of the powerful influence of rich monopolies in the affairs of the Labour party? </para>

                <para>The only move made so far by the present Government for the relief of unemployment is a proposal to tax' industry. This Government has imposed a tariff duty of 10s. a gallon upon imported whisky in order to force the Australian consumer to drink an inferior brand of spirit - to poison the consumer with Australian whisky. Can it be argued that this has been done in the interests of the Australian working man, or to provide employment? May not we assume that the intention was to increase the profits of the Federal Distilleries .in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Wren has a controlling interest? Unquestionably this is another instance of a surrender of the Labour party to the money power. </para>

                        <para>- We will not argue that point here. The Labour party once justly complained that there were no newspapers in Australia in which its members could express their opinions or voice their ideals. But what did we find during the last election? The powerful Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> supported the Labourparty and the policy of protection. Another influential newspaper, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> published one of the most scurrilous and disgusting political cartoons that has ever appeared in a reputable newspaper, and it was used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> G. Theodore as campaign director for the Labour party in New South Wales. The powerful Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> and other prominent so-called capitalistic journals were on the side of the Labour party during the last election. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>I think I have clearly shown that the Labour party has changed its ideals, and that it has now become the champion of monopolists and money power, and is no longer a true advocate of democracy. The members of the Labour party have pleased their capitalistic friends - the rich manufacturers - who laud them day after day, and who will now transfer a further burden to the shoulders of the working man. The manufacturer will make bigger profits to swell his coffers, and the cost of  living will soar, while the poor unfortunate working man who looked to the Labour party to solve his problems will agaiti be left in the lurch. I shall deal with that subject at greater length when the budget and financial papers are under discussion. For the moment I shall content myself by saying chat the big moneyed interests are referring to the Labour party as the saviour of the community. </para>
                <para>But let us examine the other side of the picture.. How will the members of that party get on with their other friends? No man can serve two masters. How are they going to reconcile their attitude towards the capitalists of this country, with their professions towards the extreme element which was once represented so faithfully and so well by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> The communists have now representation on the other side of the chamber and in the Cabinet. We can already see the concessions granted to these friends of theirs, and may naturally ask how long the Government will be able to steer its present course. I suppose the first evidence of a desire on the part of the Government to please the revolutionary section of the Labour movement is its amended defence policy. It is a well known fact that the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, which is the supreme controlling body of the trade union movement in this country, is avowedly communistic. That body believes in controlling the means of production, distribution and exchange by revolutionary political and industrial action. </para>

                        <para>- I have never supported a policy of revolution, and I hope chat I shall never be charged with that crime. The Australasian Council of Trade Unions controls the trade union movement and the trade union movement controls the Labour party. I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council if that is not so? </para>

                        <para>- The revolutionary body that controls the trade union organization in Australia is the absolute boss of the Labour movement. That is why I refused to follow the men who are blazing this revolutionary path. A section of these revolutionaries deliberately aimsat the destruction of all armed military forces in Australia. The communists do not want a trained army; but they want a free run with the rifle, because the Labour party believes in no conscription, and no interference by the military in industrial disputes. </para>

                        <para>- That may be the opinion of the honorable senator, but the other day we had a visit from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman,</inline> one of the directors of the trades union movement, who said that, as the State Government's action in connexion with the coal dispute in New South Wales was almost certain to have interstate consequences, it was the duty of the Federal Labour Government to assert its authority with the forces at its command. That is, the military forces. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman</inline> urges the Labour Government to call out the military in connexion with the industrial disputes in the coal-fields. Is the Minister prepared to follow that advice? I have not before me a copy of the Labour party's platform, and therefore cannot give its defence policy. It appears to be part of their political programme to keep the copies of their platform strictly to themselves. </para>

                <para class="block">Yet the Labour party contravenes that principle on every possible occasion. It will not permit its followers to have the privilege - of fighting in defence of their country, their homes or- their firesides, yet it says that every man must join a union or be called a scab or a traitor to the Labour movement. It thus employs industrial conscription in regard to trade unionism, but its friends outside who direct its policy will not allow any of the supporters of the party to strike a blow in defence of their country. The abolition of compulsory military training is a distinct gesture towards the communistic friends of the Government, who direct it from outside. </para>
                <para>The Labour party also seeks the abolition of the Singapore Naval Base, one of the greatest safe-guards we could possibly have for the protection of Australia. Ministers are prating about their desire for the adequate defence of Australia, yet they make this further gesture to satisfy the militant element within the Labour movement. They tell us that they have no time for communism, but they obey its instructions in regard to defence. </para>
                <para>The other day the Prime Minister said that the Commonwealth Government had accepted the Soviet Government's pledge to the British Government to abstain from propaganda in England and the dominions, yet to-day, in answer to a question, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said, that this was a matter that had nothing to do with Australia. In this connexion let me read the following : - . </para>
                <para>In a speech at Pretoria the Minister for Justice <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pirow)</inline> referring to the Durban police raids on natives who had not paid the head tax, revealed that a wide-spread plot on Kith December was instigated by the Third In- ternational. It was calculated to strike a serious blow at the industrial life of the Union. </para>
                <para>The Third International, declared the Minister, sent written instructions to a number of native labour organizations to " wage a struggle against the native bills and all other petitions, but in a revolutionary manner, on 10th December. Militant demonstrations were to be conducted, and the mines were to be penetrated by all possible moans." Therefore, he claimed justification for the Government'* preventive action at Durban, which was the chief centre of unrest. He added that the Union Government would legislate  at the earliest date to deal 'with the agitator who was at the root of the trouble. </para>
                <para class="block">Although we have this evidence of a distinct plot on the part of the Third International at Moscow, to interfere seriously with the industrial relations of one of the dominions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> has accepted the pledges given by the SovietGovernment. But it is only another little gesture to appease the communistic friends of the Labour party ; to keep them quiet while Ministers sit down and draw their salaries. </para>
                <para>We were informed the other day that the Commonwealth Government has suspended the issue of licences  under  the Transport Workers Act. What is that, but another attempt to appease the militant section, which is the driving force behind the Labour movement to-day? Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> or any other honorable senator sitting with him refuse to admit the immense benefit conferred by the Transport Workers Act on the people of Australia? No other piece of legislation enacted of recent years has done more than it has done to bring about peace and contentment and fair conditions on the waterfront of Australia. Yet the Labour party has now suspended the issue of licences under that act at. the behest of the militant leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation. </para>
                <para>The other day a union waited on the Minister in Canberra and urged that preference to unionists be observed. I am not and never have been a believer in preference to unionists. I am consistent in this regard, because I opposed compulsory military service during the war; although having regard to the number of eligible men associated with the Labour party to-day who refused to go to the war, I should not be prepared to take up the same attitude again. I opposed conscription, and I am equally opposed to preference to unionists, because I regard it as a form of compulsion. It is conscription. This step has also been taken by the Labour Government in an attempt to appease its communistic masters. </para>
                <para>Another gesture designed to please the communists is the cessation of migration. Here is a paragraph from the <inline font-style="italic">Pan-Pacific Worker</inline> to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> frequently contributes. It reads - lt is the immediate task of the militants to carry on a determined and unceasing struggle against all form of race prejudices and race hatred fostered by capitalism and reformism. </para>
                <para class="block">They want the White Australia policy to be destroyed. So far the Labour Government has not made any definite gesture in. that direction but it will have to, do so sooner or later. It cannot steer a clear course between the two opposing parties. It cannot remain uninjured between the fire of the capitalistic forces and the shells of the communists. Eventually it must pass to one side or the other. In regard to migration, this newspaper says - <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> is obvious that the workers of Australia, acting in conjunction with the Labour movement of Great Britain, must fight the mass migration scheme of Bruce and Baldwin. It cannot be doubted but that these schemes are exclusively in the interests of the exploiters and imperialists. </para>
                <para class="block">In suspending migration the Labour party has surrendered to the wishes of the militant section. </para>
                <para>I think I have quoted sufficient to show that the contention I have tried to set up that the Labour Government is endeavouring to please two masters is correct. In the end it must either surrender to the militant section or mortgage its political soul and future to the capitalistic section of the community. I think it is a. matter of impossibility for it to steer a course which will keep it unscathed. </para>
                <para>I have some notes upon some of the proposals iu the budget, but I think I had better leave them until we come to deal with the budget in the next few days. But there is one thing I should like to mention. To serve certain, interests which are at the present time standing behind it the Labour party is attempting to abstain from taxing pleasures and luxuries. At the same time it is taxing the every-day commodities of the people, their food requirements, their clothing: children's socks and women's hats, and placing an intolerable burden upon industry. I do not know what the workers will think when they eventually come to realize that the cost of living is soaring up. They must see how absolutely futile were the promises made to them. </para>
                <para>I do not wish to hamper any negotiations which may be taking place in an effort to settle the coal dispute, but I declare that the Labour party flagrantly and wickedly deceived its supporters when it stated that it would settle that strike in fourteen days. Honorable senators opposite know that that was impossible, and that the Federal Government has no constitutional powers to do such a thing. So the strike continues, and unemployment is rife. </para>
                <para>The Labour party claimed that it would solve the unemployment problem by raising the tariff. No government can solve the problem in that manner. </para>

                        <para>- I can hardly imagine anything like the childlike simplicity of honorable senators opposite if they believe that an increased tariff is going to relieve unemployment. How is the tax on whisky going to help a workman on a farm, in a timber mill, or in a mine? How is a tax on the commodities of life going to relieve unemployment in the building trade, or give assistance to any unskilled worker? It is absolutely certain that this prohibitive and vindictive tariff will throw more men out of employment. Imports will continue to come into Australia; no tariff will keep them out. The local manufacturer, receiving this large subsidy from the Government, will immediately raise the price of his commodities. The worker will then demand higher wages, and his demand will be granted. The cost of production will be increased, and so the vicious circle will be pursued. I am confident that after the expiration of another twelve months or two years there will be as much, if not more, unemployment than there is at present. I believe that we have not yet reached the full depths of our trade depression. Already there is a curtailment of expenditure on public works. If the high tariff does what the Labour party claims it will do, it will stop imports and so lessen our Customs receipts, which will leave still less money available for distribution. The consequent high costs will curtail the purchasing power of the public and revenue will suffer through the lessened Customs receipts, with the result that next year's budget will disclose a greater deficit than that which now exists. </para>

                    <para>Who is it but the Communists who are directing the strikes against the law at the present time? The men's officials are sitting back and letting the Communists control their unions. Those who do their duty and attempt to keep the militant usurpers out of the committees of Australian unions are the target for all their vile abuse, being branded as "class traitors and scabs " for trying to assist working men and women to get a living. Wake up, fellow workers, and clean our unions of all disrupters. Are we still going to countenance strikes and disorganization of industry until the British Empire falls, and keep our children hungry until the Communists have toppled over our constitutional Governments <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> institutions? What then, fellow  workers?  Misery and pestilence. Nothing short of that will satisfy the Communists, and until they push the workers into violence and ruin. Unless the workers throw them out, the militants, following their instructions from Moscow, will ride the trade union movement to destruction, and I predict that Labour's hope df building up a clean White Australia with a high standard of living will not be fulfilled. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not think that I am unduly stressing the dangers of this evil. All thinking: men know that there is a dangerous element in this country that wants to destroy existing institutions and set up, probably, a regime similar to that which now harasses Russia. I should not refer to that element so seriously but for the fact that it controls the Labour movement. </para>

                        <para>- I do, and that is why I am on this side of the chamber today. In all my experience of the Labour movement, and especially recently, I have never heard a Labour man denounce a. strike. Not one had the courage to denounce the waterside workers' strike that occurred a year or two ago; to tell the men that they were wrong. They were silent when they should have spoken. As a matter of fact, members of the Labour party openly supported participants in the timber workers' strike. Indeed, nearly every member of that party broke the law. There is much talk about the prosecution of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Brown, but many overlook the fact that the late Federal Government could have prosecuted practically every member of the Labour party for inciting men to break the law-. </para>

                <para class="block">To most men disillusionment comes sooner or later. I hope that the Labour Government will not indulge in wild schemes, or try to please its communist friends, but will exercise common sense in the government of the country. I hope that it will realize that its duty is to conserve the country's welfare, that it will legislate in the interests of the whole people, and not of a section of them, and that it will apply itself to the solving of the problems confronting the country. There is sufficient constructive work for it to do without pandering to sectional interests. Our so-called democracy has not brought to the world the benefits which were expected from it. Under our scheme of representative government it sometimes happens that a party seeking office will make all sorts of wild promises to the electors, knowing that it cannot give effect to them. That happened at the last election; the Labour party made promises which it knew were impossible of fulfilment. </para>
                <para>In the old days the Labour party had ideals; it fought for principles; it was concerned with the welfare of the struggling masses; it would not ally itself with capitalism, or any  moneyed interests; it had an industrial and a financial policy. But to-day that party is barren of any high ideals of citizenship; its only objective is to gain the treasury bench, and to manipulate the administration in the interests of its supporters. I am sorry that the great Labour movement has so far departed from the path on which it first set out. Without desiring to assume the role of a prophet, I feel confident that if the electors had the opportunity to-morrow they would reverse the decision they gave a few weeks ago. The workers will soon find that the Nationalist party is a better friend to them than is the party to which they gave their support. In conclusion, I repeat that I shall vote for any Government measure which I believe will serve the best interests of the country. But whatever the consequences - even at the risk of a double dissolution - I shall not hesitate to take action to frustrate any efforts of the Government which I believe will not be in the interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

There is much in the Governor-General's Speech for which the Government may take credit. When I call to mind some of the reactionary governments of the past, when the country was governed from Pitt-street, Bligh-street, or Flinders-street, or even from Fleet-street, London, I realize that the present Government, even in the few weeks it has been in office, has by comparison, done a great deal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> has promised, his support to the Government so long as its proposals have his approval, but he has indicated that he will stoutly resist any proposed legislation of which he does not approve. He is, in effect, prepared to assist the Government in passing pop-gun legislation; but should it introduce measures of heavier calibre he threatens it with an appeal to the country. The Labour party is prepared to accept his challenge; it is prepared to go to the country again. I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> to study the votes cast for the several candidates in the Denison, Bass, and Wilmot divisions. A study of those figures would convince even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Ogden</inline> that had ' there been a double dissolution, he would not now be in a position to say whether he would, or would not, assist the Government to give effect to its legislative proposals. The electors of Australia have shown their approval of the Labour party's constructive policy, by returning to another place a Labour government with a majority of seventeen over the members of all other parties combined. </para>

                    <para>The stirring song orhymn of the French Republicans, was composed in 1792 by a young officer, Rouget de Lisle. He composed both words and music under one inspiration on a night in April, after dining with the Mayor of the City of Strasburg. It was first known as the " Chant del'Armé du Rhin." The song was speedily carried by enthusiastic revolutionaries to the chief cities of France. It was brought to Paris by the volunteers of Marseilles, who sang it as they entered the capital, and as they marched to the storming of the Tuileries. It was thus called " La Marseillaise." As early as the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, it was enthusiastically taken up as the French National Anthem, and has held that honoured place until this day. </para>

John Brown was an American abolitionist, and leader of the famous attack on Harper's Ferry in 1859. Early in life he conceived hatred for the institution of slavery and became famous for the killing", under his orders, of five pro-slavery settlers. After carrying on a strenuous anti-slavery campaign,  he was eventually seized, imprisoned, convicted of " treason and conspiring with slaves and rebels, and murder in the first degree ", and was hanged at Charleston. Shortly after his death a popular song amongst abolitionists was " John Brown's Body." </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Yes, and in leaving that party he went the way of many others. During the time the Labour party has been in opposition different administrations have endeavoured to guide the people of Australia through the dark shadows of the political valleys ; but with so little success that the people at last decided to give the Labour party an opportunity to overcome the obstacles which the Nationalist party found it impossible to surmount. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> spoke of loyalty and goodwill towards the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> also said that he was prepared to assist the Government to a certain extent; but added a proviso to the effect that at the first opportunity he would knife it. I suppose that is the type of loyalty we can expect from the Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden. Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce also referred to economic freedom, but I should like to ask the right honorable gentleman what economic freedom was experienced during the war or more recently by those who had to submit to the iniquitous provisions of the Crimes Act and the Transport Workers Act? The Labour party is a friend of not only the working man but the primary producers. That was instanced by the convening of a conference of primary producers at Bathurst several years agoby <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> T. Lang, one of the greatest Premiers New South Wales has ever had. That gentleman was always prepared to go right ahead with his policy and to strenuously fight for that which he believed to be right, without asking for any quarter. During the recent election campaign, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> who were Ministers in the Bruce-Page Government, went into the highways and by-ways and told the farmers that they were their friends. But to-day stud rams and ewes are being exported to Russia, South Africa and other countries where valuable flocks are being raised and their wool is entering into strong competition with one of Australia's staple commodities. About 30 years ago, wattle seedlings were exported to South Africa with the result that wattle bark can now be produced in that country at such a ridiculously low rate that it can be exported to Australia and sold at a price much below that at which the local article can be. marketed. Years ago the wattle bark trade was worth millions of pounds to Australia, but our trade in that direction is not only seriously challenged by South African producers, but actually taken out of our hands. The wattle bark industry is now worth £2,000,000 a year to the Union of South Africa. If an embargo is not placed upon the exportation of stud rams and ewes from Australia it will not be long before wool producers in that country will be seriously competing with the woolgrowers in Australia. Previous administrations have allowed stud sheep to leave this country. </para>

South Africa boasts they are now so well established in the merino stud sheep industry that they can afford to do without any more Australian merino rams - well, perhaps, but let them try! They have never allowed the export of ostriches, ostrich eggs, or angora goats (mohair) from South Africa, and they put a very high duty upon our products such as wheat, flour, &amp;c. </para>

The sooner it is clone, the better it will be for the progress of Australia. So far as I am concerned, John Brown and Charlie McDonald will not be permitted to rule the destinies of this country. They did not put the coal where it is. It was put there for the use of every man and woman in the land. We know what His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales said after he made his inspection of the coal-mining districts of Great Britain. If he returned to Australia and went through the mining fields where John Brown and Charlie McDonald and other colliery proprietors are starving thousands of men and keeping 12,000 nien out of work, I am sure he would say the same thing. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- It is said of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weaver,</inline> the Minister for Mines in New South Wales, that he has declared that until the heavens fall coal will be produced by the miners of the Maitland district. Knowing the miners of that district well, I can at once say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weaver</inline> is a liar. Men, who would not work under the scab conditions laid down by John Brown and the other coal proprietors, would not work for the State under the conditions provided at Rothbury. I speak as one who worked in the mines of New South Wales and also in New Zealand prior to enlisting for the war in 1914. The miners of the Maitland district sent two regiments for the defence of Australia and the Empire, and to-day thousands of them bear the scars of battle. Did they return to allow John Brown to starve their women and children? We are hampered by the limited constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. I believe ri the unification plank of the Labour party's platform. 1 regard it as utterly wrong that State jurisdiction should be allowed to hold up action on the part of the National Parliament. It is a condition of affairs that must be altered, and I believe that even in our lifetime something will be done in the direction of unification. </para>

                            <para>- But these were printed, and I saw them in print. I have no need to apologize for what was done for me by a member of the legal profession. For years I have been so frequently called "Digger," that the impression got about that I was not possessed of any Christian names. I am not ashamed of James Patrick. There is a good solid Irish sound about my Christian names. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Elliott</inline> then went on to ask for some particulars about my  Avar  service. I can give him those particulars. As a member of the Australian Navy I was one of the landing force which left Australia on the 16th August, 1914, for German New Guinea. Strange to say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ridley,</inline> one of the Senate messengers, was one of my noncommissioned officers. At that particular time <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neville</inline> Howse was in charge of the hospital arrangements. When we returned from New Guinea I was received into the Balmain Hospital as a malaria patient. When I was certified O.K. again I joined up with the naval bridging train, still serving under Noncommissioned Officer Ridley, and also under Non-Commissioned Officer George Maunder, one of the senior permanent waiters in the refreshment room of this building. I have, therefore, ample evidence on the spot about my soldiering. I soldiered on in Egypt and elsewhere for five years and one month, and I went and returned with a clean record both  physically and otherwise. I soldiered on and took my share of the heat and the burden of the day to the best of my ability. I shall not apologize to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott for the part that I took in the great war. I admit that all credit is due to the honorable senator for the part that he played in that upheaval. I served Under him, andI know that he was a good soldier, but I deprecate his personal attack upon me. </para>

My brother, William, served for five years, while my brother, John Edward, served for three and a half years, enlisting when only 17. He was shot through the right eye, and may be totally blind in four or five years' time. My sister, Katherine, also played her part in the war. Yet, in this National Senate, I was insulted by a man under whom I served abroad. What was the underlying motive of that direct personal attack? </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline>
                        should be clad in kilts in order that he might act as a sample unit of a Queensland kilted regiment; but I did not' wish to be personal. I believe that the Scullin Government has displayed sound common sense in its handling of our defence problem.

Born as we are in the atmosphere of liberty and free government, we will not become part of a force which strikes deeply at the root of free government as this bill does. . . . The bill had its origin in the mind of the military commandants, but the string they played upon to dupe a credulous public was our White Australia policy. We have insulted our neighbours, not by the object of our desire, but by the method we have adopted to attain it, and therefore we fear reprisals. </para>

Elliott said nothing about our Australianborn citizens; his whole concern was for the Southern Europeans. As a trade union leader, I congratulate the Government on its action in relation to the suspension of assisted migration.

I say nothing against <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page other than as a Treasurer, for I know him to be a good surgeon and physician. For a couple of years I lived in the district he served on the north coast of New SouthWales.  His  name there is a household word - not as a financier, but as a physician and surgeon. It is certainly a tragedy to have as Federal Treasurer a man who says that two and two make five.

                    <para>There are many aspects  of  the debate to which I should like to refer, but we have a fairly long business-paper and time is valuable. We are expecting a number of measures from another place shortly, and  if  Parliament is to rise on the date contemplated, we must push on with the business. I believe we can  finish within  the time fixed  if Ave  cease talking about these bogeys of bolshevism, and  the  unseen influences that are alleged to be disrupting the Labour movement. I am inclined to think that  if  a Labour Ministry had been  in  office when the seat of Government  Avas  transferred to Canberra, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> would have blamed  it  for the colour of the carpet  in  this chamber, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> would have concurred, because both honorable senators affect to believe that anything  Avith  a. tinge of red  in it  is evidence of our association  Avith  some hidden force  in </para>
                    <para class="block">Russia. I can assure both honorable gentlemen, however, that the Government, which I have the honour to lead in this chamber, owes no allegiance to any outside political body. They need have no fear that we intend to link up with outside forces and bring about a revolution in Australia, because as I pointed out by way of interjection earlier in the debate, even if some people believed there was the need for a revolutionary change, the necessity for it disappeared when the democracy of Australia returned Labour to power a few weeks ago. </para>
                    <para>There seems to be a complete misunderstanding on the part of honorable senators opposite, as to what is the Government's policy concerning some of the matters mentioned in the Speech of his  Excellency  the Governor-General. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> mentioned what he termed a series of destructive administrative acts, and quoted particularly the proposal of the Government to suspend compulsory military training. I do not propose to traverse the arguments employed by honorable senators on this subject. All I wish to do is to remind them that the Labour party's platform has been before the people for many years, and even if the former Prime Minister did force an election upon one issue, Labour candidates declared that if returned to power, Labour would not only maintain the federal system of arbitration, but would give legislative effect to every plank in its platform. </para>

                            <para>- At the same time it inculcates in a youth a spirit of militarism before he reaches the age at which he is competent to decide for himself. The Government has pledged itself to reduce the military vote by £150,000. We believe this can be done without impairing the efficiency of our defence system. Although certain honorable senators opposite have earned renown in military service not one of them, during this debate, succeeded in proving that our estimate  was  an over-statement of the case, and not one was able to demonstrate that the voluntary system, which we propose to establish will not be at least as adequate for the defence of Australia as was our compulsory system. </para>

                            <para>- That may be of benefit to the taxpayers, considering that although we had so many generals on the Ministerial side for several years, during that time, £64,000,000 was spent on defence, and all we have to show for such expenditure is the somewhat insignificant fleet, which spents most of its time in Sydney. It may be of advantage to the taxpayers to have a government consisting of men somewhat inexperienced in military organization, and who take the views of expert military men who are not influenced by party politics. </para>

                            <para>- We suspended compulsory military training, and perhaps we were safe in assuming that Australia would not be invaded during the short period in which the new organization would be built up. I do not think it will be long before the voluntary system will be at least as efficient as that which has now been abolished. It will then be our proud boast that, in this respect, we stand side by side with every other dominion in the British Empire, with the exception of New Zealand. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator's contention is not supported by the information in my possession. One of my first acts after my appointment as a Minister was to conduct an investigation into the licensing system. I interviewed the licensing officer in Melbourne who was asked if he would grant a licence to a man in the last stages of consumption, or one who had just served a term in Pentridge, and he replied "It is quite possible." I was further informed that 8,935 licences had been issued, although at a peak period work could not possibly be found for more than 4,227 men. The same condition of affairs exists proportionately at Port Adelaide. Notwithstanding this we are informed by honorable senators opposite that the Transport Workers Act has been the means of promoting industrial peace. </para>

                <para>As mentioned in my opening remarks on the Address-in-Reply, we shall soon be receiving a good deal of business from another place and it will be necessary to expedite the work of the Senate. I understand that several honorable senators opposite still wish to speak on the Address-in-Reply and also on the Estimates and Budget papers. In these circumstances I ask honorable senators to come prepared to sit for an hour or so later to-morrow in an endeavour to dispose of the Address-in-Reply and the budget and thus enable us to deal on Friday with the two measures, the first reading of which I have just moved. If that cannot be done I shall have to ask the Senate to sit on Tuesday of next week. There are also other measures coming from another place and in order that I may be able to regulate the business of the Senate and to meet the convenience of honorable senators who desire some freedom during the week-end I ask them to assist in disposing of the Address-in-Reply and the budget by to-morrow night. If that be done an adjournment can be made from Friday until Wednesday; if not I shall have to ask the Senate to meet on Tuesday next. </para>
