                        <para>- Is the Minister aware that, in a common recreation room at the Hotel Kurrajong last night, &#34; The Red Flag &#34; was sung by a number of leading politicians, including Ministers of the Crown? Is he further aware that the singing of that song was particularly offensive to a number of the guests present, as well as to an overwhelming majority of the people of this country? Seeing that the hotels at Canberra are owned by, and conducted in the interests of, the public, will he take steps to see that revolutionary songs whichmight hurt the feelings of patrons of the hotel are not sung there in future? </para>

                <para class="block">I have just submitted, and chief among them is the knowledge that we have at last in power a Commonwealth Government that will uphold the principles of democracy, and legislate on a humanitarian basis in the interests of all sections of the community. The advent, of this Government is in more .than one sense historically important, since it is the first Labour administration to sit in the Federal Capital of Australia, and the first to hold office since the termination of the great war. It is approximately fourteen years since the Fisher Labour Government held office, but there are many of us who well remember the good work which it performed, aud therefore appreciate the re-entry of Labour to administer the affairs of the Commonwealth. I can say without fear of contradiction that there has never been a federal ministry more earnest and sincere and more honestly desirous of administering the affairs of the Commonwealth in the best interests of the nation than the Fisher Government was. To-day we have in power a replica of that administration. I am convinced that it will uphold the splendid example set by the Labour Government of fourteen years ago, and legislate not on behalf of sectional interests, but for the protection of all. </para>
                <para>For years every conceivable act of political trickery was practised by our political opponents in order to keep Labour out .of office. Aided by a large majority of the great newspapers of Australia they vilified and misrepresented Labour from one end of Australia to the other. I remember the leaders of the Bruce-Page Government telling the people prior to the 1925 election that Australia was on the verge of a revolution, and that the Labour party wished to dispense with constitutional government. There was, of course, not the slightest justification for such statements. Again during the 1925 election, when the great waterside trouble was in progress, the representatives of the Bruce-Page Government assured the people of Australia that if they were granted a further term of office, Johnson and Walsh would be deported, that peace and harmony would prevail, and that the country would be governed according to law. The political cry of our opponents  at that time was for &#34;law and order.&#34; The people, however, have come to see that they were tricked. The result of the last -general election shows that at last they realized that what they had been told by our opponents was untrue, and as a result of this awakening a Labour government is in power to-day. The supporters of the Bruce-Page Government promised all sorts of reforms, for which the people looked in vain, and when that government endeavoured to put the clock back 25 years by attempting to destroy the principle of arbitration, and thus deprive the workers of their only means of receiving fair treatment the electors expressed their disapproval in the most decisive fashion. During the last election campaign no side issues such as communism or bolshevism were raised as on previous occasions. For the first time in many years the people were free to give their decision on one broad issue, stripped of political trappings, and their verdict was a triumph for democracy as against an autocracy. </para>
                <para>The task before the present Government is tremendous. How gigantic it is few persons fully realize. It is not my desire to hit a man when he is down, but &#91; cannot refrain from saying that the previous Government has left matters in such a state that it will be some time before the present administration will be able to make real progress. Unfortunately, it is unable to start from scratch; it commences with the handicap of the previous Government&#39;s maladministration. Last year the then Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> informed the people of Australia that there was an accumulated deficit of &#163;5,000,000, and as five months of the current financial year have elapsed it will be an extremely difficult task for the Government to accomplish what it desires during the present financial year. The speech which  His Excellency  delivered to Parliament yesterday gives an indication of the course which the Government intends to pursue, but a more detailed outline of its legislative programme will be given early next year. It will be admitted that the Government is pursuing the right course and that it is its desire to work in the interests of the community generally. </para>
                <para>While in power the Nationalist Government was always advocating industrial peace, but its one idea of the way in which industrial peace should be brought about was that the worker should always make a sacrifice. In 1928 the Bruce-Page Government passed an arbitration bill containing many iniquitous clauses aimed at the workers, but within twelve months it had to admit that this legislation was quite ineffective. It then endeavoured to scrap the whole system of arbitration. I am extremely pleased that the present administration intends to* bring down legislation to improve our present system of conciliation and arbitration. We shall not have industrial peace until equity and justice prevail, and we look to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court for justice for the workers. I sincerely hope that the strenuous efforts now being made by the Government to settle the coal dispute will meet with success. I do not desire to deal extensively with that matter at this juncture; but the trouble is so serious that I urge the Government to take steps - drastic, if necessary - to put an end to the suffering and misery that now exist as a result of the lockout. I have visited the coal-fields, and I know precisely what is happening there. I have seen helpless little children going to school  lunchless,  and forced to have recourse to the soup kitchens provided by charity in. order that they might keep body and soul together. </para>

To-day, the Nationalist Government of New South Wales is doing little more to bring about peace in the industry. According to the views of honorable senators opposite, there is only one method by which the dispute may be settled, and that is by the worker making further sacrifices. </para>

                <para>I am sure that everybody will be pleased to learn that further restrictions are to be placed upon the introduction of foreign migrants into Australia. It is useless to  deny  that foreigners are being employed  in this country to the detriment of Australians. Hundreds of thousands  of  pounds are sent out of the country annually by these foreigners. Every rational person must realize the futility of protecting Australian industries  if,  at the same time, we import foreigners to manufacture the articles that we need. The Federal Labour Government will endeavour to make operative an effective tariff that will be in the interests, primarily, of Australians and Britishers. If any benefits remain to be distributed, the foreigners may have their share. &#34;We should certainly not encourage the introduction of foreign migrants while our own countrymen are out of employment. I have nothing against those foreigners, other than that their standard of living is not ours. After years of toil and sacrifice, Australians have established a standard of living of which we are all proud, and which we cherish to such an extent that we are not prepared to permit it to be lowered. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will realize that it is necessary to confirm the information before taking action. The trouble is caused by these foreigners being ignorant of the industrial conditions prevailing in Australia. Many of these men know nothing of arbitration court awards, and their ignorance is being taken advantage of by some of the people whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> represents. The Federal Government gives practical assistance to the country by making substantial monetary advances to the States in order that an extensive system of main roads may be constructed, and I hope that steps will be taken to ensure that all the materials used in the construction of those roads shall be of Australian origin. It will be agreed that it is regrettable that we have to import motor cars, but that it verges on tragedy if we have to import the material with which to construct the roads on which those motor cars run. I trust that the Government will be able to devise some scheme to relieve existing distress produced by unemployment. There is no greater crime to society than to allow helpless women and children to suffer the pangs of hunger, particularly in such a young country as ours, where the natural resources are illimitable. It is pathetic that, after a reign of fourteen years, Nationalist governments have left the country in such a deplorable condition. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but I hold that to Nationalist governments must be attributed the blame for most of the distress that now reigns in Australia. I may be wrong, but it is- my conviction, and apparently that of the constituents who sent me here, that a government should do something in the interests of the people it represents. It should be realized that the backbone of a country is its flesh and blood, and that something should be done for the people who made great sacrifices during the Great War to keep this country safe for democracy. The people are entitled to all that it is humanly possible to give them, and a government should honour that obligation. If a government fails in its duty to the people it must expect to be thrown out of office. And that was the fate of the late Federal Nationalist Government. </para>

                <para>I trust that honorable senators will realize the seriousness of Australia&#39;s position, the extent of the problems which confront this Government, and the great handicap under which it labours. No other Federal government came into power at a more unfavorable time. On every hand it is faced with want and hunger - with a great army of unemployed. Within a few weeks it has achieved wonders, and has encouraged many employers to cease dispensing with the services of their employees. That in itself is some justification for its existence, and goes to prove that it is sincere and earnest in its endeavour to ease unemployment and to encourage the prosperity of our industries in order thai they will be able in the near future to provide work for more of our own people. 1 am confident that this Labour administration will warrant the trust reposed iu it by the people, and I solicit  the  help of all honorable senators in the task that is involved in straightening out the present chaotic state of affairs. If we all put our shoulders to the wheel and assist we shall again place the country upon the plane to which it was raised by  the  Fisher government over fourteen years ago. It is the intention of this Government to continue where the Fisher government left off, and, if given a fair chance, it will undoubtedly do as that government did - leave the country with a surplus instead of the tremendous deficit under which it now groans. </para>

                    <para>. - I have much pleasure in seconding the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> that an address &#39; be presented to  His Excellency  the Governor-General in reply to the speech with which he opened Parliament yesterday. That pleasure  is  intensified by the fact that as the result of the overwhelmingly favorable vote cast for Labour candidates at the recent general election  we  have now on the Treasury bench of  the  Commonwealth Parliament, a Labour Government  in  control of the affairs of  this great nation,  meting out justice to all and giving favours  to  none. &#91; congratulate our worthy and able leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seullin,</inline> on being the first Labour Prime Minister  to  assume control of the Government  in  the National Capital, Canberra; and  in  this regard, I extend  my  congratulations also  to  his worthy and able team of Ministers. I trust that their stay  in  office will  be  prolonged. As  to  their success I have  no  doubt whatever. </para>

                <para>It  is fitting  that I should tender special congratulations  to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> my  colleague from South Australia,  on  his accession  to  the high and honorable office of Vice-President of the Executive Council, and Leader of the Government  in  the Senate. In his hands and  in  those of  my  old friend and colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> to whom I also tender  my  congratulations,  the  destiny of  the  Government  in  this chamber will  be  safe and the business of  the  Senate  will be  well and worthily carried out. </para>
                <para>Not only is the return of a Labour Government to office a fact of historical importance; it represents one of the greatest triumphs of the Labour movement. For fourteen years Labour has existed in the shades of opposition, beset by many great storms that have from time to time darkened the political horizon. After being called upon to suffer an almost withering attack from within its own ranks, it was faced with the defection of many stalwarts of the movement, who, having sharpened their wits by association with Labour, and in the service of their former ideal, thereafter sought by all means at their command to encompass its destruction. But the movement has weathered all storms, and today, as the result of the first election since 1914 that has been decided upon real political issues, it is in power in another place with a big majority. The people, when given the opportunity, not only displayed their confidence in the Labour movement; they also intimated in no uncertain way that the federal system of arbitration should be retained, and with it the Australian standard of living. This standard, as we know, gives a measure of comfort to the masses, those who bear the heat and burden of the day, those who do the useful work, those who delve in the mines for riches or work in the fields and paddocks to foster production, or keep the wheels of industry turning. It is the aim of the Labour movement to give to those who produce the wealth of the nation a full and just share in the apportionment thereof ; and it is a healthy sigu that the people of this generation of Australians have recognized the efforts of those great democrats of the old days who pioneered the Labour movement, and, facing tremendous odds, nailed to the mast- head of this young country the banner of civil and economic freedom. I take this opportunity to pay a tribute not only to those worthy pioneers who still remain loyal to our cause, but also to the countless thousands who constitute the rank and file of the movement for the yeoman service they rendered at the last election. The gibes of our critics during the years we were in opposition, have been well answered by the people of Australia. The movement has emerged from its testing time fitter, better and stronger than ever. </para>
                <para>As to the task confronting the Government, I have no illusions. The banner of civil and economic freedom is still at the masthead, but that for which it stands is very far from realization so far as a big body of the people are concerned. It will be one of the greatest tasks of the Government to bring that freedom nearer to the homes of the people, but first of all the Government must dispose of the many unpleasant legacies handed down by its predecessors in office. Among these are widespread unemployment with its attendant suffering, which has been so well described this afternoon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley,</inline> an empty Treasury, a deficit of approximately &#163;5,000,000, and depreciation in our primary and secondary industries, which must give all thinking persons ample ground for concern. It. cannot be said that the previous Government upon acceptance of office was fettered by an inheritance such as this. Rather was the reverse the case. Upon coming into office it found in the Treasury a surplus of &#163;7,400,000, little unemployment, and prosperity in our primary and secondary industries. It is not my intention to indict the late government for having altered all this. It has already been arraigned before the bar of public opinion and found guilty by the jury of the people of the Commonwealth. Its punishment is that its stewardship has been handed over to another government - the problems confronting Australia have been entrusted to other hands for solution. </para>
                <para>The speech with which  His Excellency  the Governor-General was pleased to open Parliament yesterday, disclosed not only a desire for action on the part of the Government, but also the fact that steps have already been taken by it to deal with the existing unemployment which is probably one of the greatest problems confronting Australia to-day. </para></speech>

                <para class="block">Thompson attribute existing unemployment to the movement which is represented by the Government occupying the Treasury bench in the Commonwealth Parliament at the present time? My friend&#39;s silence shows that there was no point in the interjection he made. The Government has placed the unemployment problem in the forefront of its policy. It proposes to tackle it in what I consider the best way of dealing with it, and that is by curtailing migration. We are told by His Excellency the Governor-General that a communication has already been forwarded to the Imperial Government seeking relaxation from the assisted passage provisions of the migration agreement with Great Britain. I trust that the Imperial Government will accede to the request, because I can conceive no worse policy than one which encourages work seekers to migrate to a country where the reservoir of labour is already overfull. If we induce people to come here under those conditions, it is distinctly unfair to them, because their entry can only be followed by one of two results - they must either join the army of workless or displace others already in employment. Irrespective, therefore, of whatever government may be in power, it should be an accepted fact that no migrants should be assisted to come to Australia until proper provision has been made for their absorption in our community. </para>
                <para>During its term of office the late Government spent approximately &#163;2,000,000 on migration activities. The bulk of the expenditure represents passage money for the 160,000 migrants who were brought to Australia during the period. It must be obvious that had there been no assisted migration during that period, there would be little or no unemployment in Australia to-day. </para>

                        <para>- If my friends of the Opposition will tell me how we can gain by bringing to this country a person who is not. in the position to pay his own passage, when we already have here people for whom we cannot find employment, I shall be prepared to concede the point. But until they can do so, I repeat what I have already said  in this chamber, that it is not a wise policy. I am pleased the people of Australia have endorsed that attitude, because this question was undoubtedly one of the turning factors in the recent elections. Would it not have been better if that &#163;2,000,000 had been diverted into channels, controlled by either the Commonwealth alone or the State Governments in co-operation with the Commonwealth, which would have assisted the primary and secondary industries of the country to extend their activities and thus absorb more workers? As it is, the money which has been expended has merely brought to Australia a number of competitors with Australians in an already overcrowded labour market. The interjections of honorable senators opposite give colour to the suspicion that behind the policy of the late government was a desire to create a surplus supply of labour, which, together with the abolition of the Arbitration Court, would have resulted in a lowering of the Australian standard of living. </para>

                <para>Many of the migrants who came to Australia expecting that the promises made to them prior to their departure from their homeland would be realised have been sadly disillusioned; they are now included in the ranks of the workless in this country. It is true that some migrants have secured employment in Australia, but only by displacing others. The suspension of assisted migration will do much to solve the great problem of unemployment. The Premier of South Australia has attempted to take the Federal Government to task in this connexion. If there is one responsible public man in Australia who should remain silent on the subject of unemployment it is the Honorable R. L. Butler, the Premier of South Australia, for that State is in the unenviable position of having the highest percentage of unemployed workers of any of the Australian States. </para>

                        <para>- I again remind the honorable senator that before interjecting he should make sure of his facts. The chief factor contributing to the present unsatisfactory position in South Australia was the huge public works policy of a previous Liberal administration, known as the Railways Rehabilitation Scheme. That Government, instead of spreading the work over a number of years, endeavoured to complete it in a comparatively short time, with the result that it attracted to South Australia some of the surplus labour from the other States. When the work was completed large numbers of men were thrown out of employment. </para>

                        <para>- It did not. The Labour Government on assuming office would have curtailed the scheme, but the work was then so far advanced that that action was not practicable. It is true that it could have refused to finance the scheme, but that would have meant that a number of railway lines which had been torn up would have been left in such a state that trains could not have run over them; bridges would have been left partially built; and new structures to take the place of engine sheds and workshops which had been demolished would have been left in various stages of completion. To have left the railways in that condition would have been to act more foolishly than to complete the original scheme. </para>

                <para>Not only should the admission into Australia of foreign migrants be discouraged, but steps should also be taken to deal effectively with those already here. Under the Federal Aid Roads Scheme the Commonwealth makes available to the States large sums of money for road construction. While I am not aware of the position in all the States, I know that, as a result of the insistence by the late Government that the contract system should be adopted in connexion with such works, large numbers of southern Europeans have been employed by road contractors in South Australia, to the detriment of genuine Australians. Men in a position to know have informed me that some hundreds of such foreigners are employed on road construction works in that State. One contractor, who is his own foreman, employs a gang of 22 men, all of whom are foreigners. Another contractor is himself a southern European, and, naturally, the men working under him are also foreigners. </para>

Honorable senators opposite cannot evade their responsibility by saying that those contracts were let by the State government. The Federal Government, which paid the piper, could have called the tune. In this class of work Australian and British workmen should be given preference over foreigners, and I hope that that policy will soon be pur into operation by the present Government. </para>

Naturally, it does not contain particulars of the policy to he adopted, for that is a matter which will be explained when the budget is presented and the Estimates come under consideration ; but, knowing what previous Labour governments have done, I have no doubt that the present administration will not only grapple with the financial problems confronting the Commonwealth, but that it will also discharge the existing mortgage, and bring about a surplus.

                        <para>- The term of office of that government was notable for the number of such leaning posts which were created. I am pleased that the members of the new Government propose to discontinue the practice followed by their predecessors in office. In future there will be greater co-ordination between the Development and Migration Commission and other government departments without in any way impairing the efficiency of any of them. The Government will not create separate boards to do work which can more effectively be carried out by existing departments. With that, I think, the people of Australia will wholeheartedly concur, and, after the scheme has been launched, it will, I am sure, be responsible for a considerable saving, and bring about that result concerning which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> appears to be so anxious. </para>

                <para>The next question that calls for consideration is the condition of our primary and secondary industries. To improve our position we must aim at increased production, and provide better facilities for the marketing of our products. No government should countenance any avoidable drop -in the price of Australia&#39;s primary production. The efforts of all governments should be directed towards increasing the yields and the stabilization of prices. During the regime of the late Government - for the last decade, as a matter of fact - there was a considerable increase in the area under production; but, unfortunately, that increase did not connote an increased production in the same ratio. On the contrary, there has been &#39; a substantial decline in the Australian &#39; wheat yield in recent years. It may be argued that this is beyond the control of any government - that it is due, in the main, to variations in climate, fluctuations in price, and other causes. </para>

                        <para>- Although, propitious precipitations have deluged most of the drought areas of Australia since the advent of this Government, I am not going to be so unkind as to imply that the late Government was responsible for the &#39;drought season which preceded the rains. I do not suggest that the Bruce-Page Administration had any control over the weather; but I do emphasize that governments can control the opening up of areas for wheat-growing purposes, and I do say that State governments of the same character as that which recently occupied the federal treasury bench have been responsible for the settlement of wheat-farmers in areas where the margin of safety, as regards rainfall, is very narrow. Thus we are faced with the position that, despite huge expenditure on public works in providing facilities for new settlers, large numbers of primary producers, after spending some of the best years of their life in trying to develop their holdings, have been obliged to leave them without any reward for their years of toil. </para>

                <para>Two illustrations of the truth of my statement are to be found in South Australia and Victoria. In those States successive Liberal or Nationalist governments have consistently overlooked large areas of country with an assured rainfall, suitable for practically all kinds of mixed farming, and have opened up for settlement land in districts with -an insufficient rainfall. These areas have been developed at a huge cost to the taxpayers in those States. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that there is a large area of good land on that Peninsula, with an assured rainfall, and in the years to come that territory should produce a much greater cereal crop than it has up to the present. But in recent years other districts with a scanty rainfall have been opened up. Railway facilities have been provided and  heavy  expenditure incurred in other public works, but settlers who took up land four, five or six years ago are still waiting for a return on their expenditure of capital and labour. I refer particularly to the Buckleboo ai-ea. If the honorable senator will read some of the reports presented to the South Australian Parliament concerning that settlement, he will have some idea of the amount paid in drought relief to keep farmers on the land there. To counteract the evil effects of this unwise policy of land settlement, there should be co-operation between the Federal and State Governments for the  repurchase of land in large estates suitable for closer settlement in districts with an assured rainfall. If this is done settlers who take up that land will have reasonable certainty of some return, and since railways, roads and other public works have been, provided, the expenditure necessary for the settlement of a given number of people should be considerably reduced. It should be possible to bring such areas under production at little or no public expenditure, and in addition the return on expenditure for existing public works should be considerably increased. This is u matter in which I have taken a great deal of interest, but as I have spoken upon it on a former occasion, I do not wish now to reiterate what I then said. &#91; strongly urge the Government to see that the necessary tests for suitability are made before further lauds are opened up for settlement. If we are to secure an increase in the volume of our production, we shall have to insure a closer settlement of all those areas with an assured rainfall. I noted with pleasure, a statement made by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> yesterday to the effect that the Government proposes to extend the policy of applying science to our primary industries. </para>

                        <para>- I freely admit that it did, but there is a vast field for an extension of that work. We must realize this when we remember that, as regards the yield per acre, Australia is twenty-fourth on the list of the principal primary producing countries of the world. There are two ways in which our position in this respect may be improved. The first is by the restriction of wheat-growing in areas with a doubtful rainfall, and the second is by increased production per acre in cultivable areas with an assured rainfall. This increase in yield would be made possible by the eradication of pests, and the application of scientific methods to production. </para>

                <para>I come now to the question of marketing. In my opinion the late Government did not give sufficient attention to this important matter. It is brought home to us more forcibly each year that, as regards the sale of their exportable surplus, our primary producers are at the mercy of speculators. An attempt has been made to formulate a pooling system  for  the co-operative handling of our wheat. It has been attended with some success, but I believe that to secure to the Australian wheat farmers that full measure of justice which they have a right to expect, it will be necessary to establish an all-Australian pool, into which farmers will be compulsorily drafted.  I  do not say that the Government should, willy nilly, pass legislation to compel our farmers to pool everything. What I suggest is that, as regards the disposal of surplus wheat, our growers should have an opportunity to decide by ballot whether or not they approve of such a proposal, and the Government should indicate that if their decision is in favour of a compulsory pool, it would assist them to the fullest possible extent. Any system, to be complete, must have some outside backing, because in the early days of any co-operative scheme it would be impossible for the farmers themselves to provide the finance. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. But what would be the price if it were not for the operation of the co-operative system, which in Australia to-day  act3  as a policeman to private purchasers who are compelled to make  their offers substantially on the basis of what they anticipate the pool will be able to pay ? If they did not do so they would not be able to buy wheat at all. </para>

                    previously made it clear that as far as the organization of United States producers was concerned there would be nothing but co-operation with the Canadian organization. Such cooperation, it is suggested, would be most informal. Just as two industrial corporations might have a gentleman&#39;s agreement in regard to price and division of markets, so the wheat organizations might arrange their affairs.

A few weeks ago-, when, there was a tremendous financial slump in Wall-street, the Canadian pool was able to stabilize the wheat market to a considerable extent. It not only refused to sell at the panic values created by the slump, but was able to purchase quantities of wheat offering at panic prices.

Dumping was only part of the greater problem of the control and supply of wheat getting into fewer hands. This year there had been a sudden price slump, owing to large holders being forced to unload suddenly. There were huge combines of wheat buyers in Britain as well as sellers.. Overseas buying was practically limited to three large combines, plus a co-operative wholesale society.

                        <para>- I have already intimated that I do not think the two activities in the field are of benefit to the growers. Conditions might arise when a competitor with a pooling system might be able to take advantage of exceptional circumstances prevailing in the wheat market in a way that the pool could not.- Instances have occurred where private buyers have been able to benefit by temporary wheat shortages to a greater extent than a pooling organization possibly could. All that the wheat farmers are asking for, and all any producer is entitled to, is a fair market value for the commodity he produces, and which would be available to him under a properlycontrolled pooling system. A Commonwealth pooling system, or a series of State pools with a central selling organization, would not only be beneficial to the wheat-growing industry, but of great advantage to the country generally. </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable senator is aware, tremendous speculation &#39; takes place in connexion with wheat sales. Shipments placed on board vessels at Australian ports are in some instances sold and their destination changed several times while they are still on the water. As a result of these resales and speculation generally the margin between the price received by the producer and that paid by the consumer is often increased, and it is to reduce that margin that the Labour party is endeavouring to evolve a co-operative marketing system under the control of the growers. </para>

                <para>The wool-growers are in a similar position. I venture to say that the recent slump in wool values, which to a great extent was due to speculation, has awakened the wool-producers of this country. They made a mistake a few years ago when they , rejected a scheme for a continuation of a wool-pooling system, and an agitation for a  reintroduction  of that system will probably be revived in the near future. The arguments which I have adduced in favour of the wheat-pooling system could also be used with equal force in connexion with our wool production. </para>
                <para>I notice from a&#62; paragraph in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, that the Government intend to honour the promise made by the previous administration in the matter of granting financial assistance to South Australia. The urgency of this matter is, I am sure, well known to honorable senators. The case was fully presented to Parliament in the report furnished by the South Australia Disabilities Commission, which conducted a full and complete inquiry on behalf of the late Government. I under stand that the present administration intends to be more generous, and will grant the full amount recommended by the commission without imposing any unnecessary obligations upon the State Government.. If that is so, I feel sure that the people of South Australia will be grateful to the present Government for the financial assistance which they will shortly receive. </para>
                <para>It is not <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> intention to reiterate the pleas I made on behalf of the viticultural industry some months ago except to say that what I said on that occasion has proved by subsequent events to be true. South Australia is the principal wineproducing State in the Commonwealth; of the 18,000,000 gallons of wine beverage or spirit produced in the Commonwealth, no less than 14,000,000 gallons are produced in South Australia. Unless the industry can be assisted in successfully marketing its product over a period of years, or until the Wine Export Control Board can, -by improved marketing methods and advertising, increase sales abroad, the industry in South Australia will be in a parlous condition. The recoil will be upon a section of the industry least able to bear it. More particularly will it adversely affect returned soldier settlers, who were virtually compelled by the State government of the day to engage in the wine industry. Because conditions were then propitious, the market favorable and prices high, that government prepared and planted large areas with wine grapes, and on those areas it repatriated returned soldiers. The result was a large increase in the wine production of Australia. The first of the new areas came substantially into production in 1922, the output being 8,542,573 gallons. In 1923 that had increased to 11,427,793 gallons, and in 1924 to 14,663,S81 gallons. In 1925 the output was 13,299,290 gallons; in 1926, 16,224,741 gallons; in 1927, 20,456,341 gallons; in 1928, 17,302,611; while for 1929 the estimated production of Australia is 18,399,968 gallons. The greater bulk of that increase represents the product of areas which were planted for the repatriation of returned soldiers, and the increase has caused the present difficulty. It has brought about a surplus beyond the capacity of &#34; the Australian market to absorb, and compels us to establish markets elsewhere, a task at present beset with difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- That suggestion is worthy of consideration, but it is not the fault of the growers that wine is not retailed more cheaply in Australia. Speaking from memory, the grower receives about &#163;7 10s. a ton for his grapes, and after they are processed, the excise duties .paid and the various marketing channels traversed, the consumer pays at the rate of something like &#163;114 per ton on the resultant beverage. Those figures were supplied to me by  Colonel Francis,  who is vitally interested in the problem in South Australia, and who assures me that they are correct. The task is chiefly one calling for State action. The Federal Government derives a large amount of revenue from the brandy production branch, of the industry, and I think that out of that revenue it would be justified in granting assistance to the wine beverage side. That could be done by slightly increasing the bounty and by a continuation of drawbacks and control for a period of years. I would not advocate that procedure were I not convinced that eventually we shall find a market for our surplus overseas, also in Australia, by reason of our increased population. It would be a tragedy if in ten years time we found that we had a&#34; market for 20,000,000 gallons of wine, and we were unable to supply it because we had put the grubbing axe into large holdings on account of the present unfavorable position. That would be a tragedy not only to the settler, but to the government of South Australia, which has sunk large sums of money in the industry, draining, channelling, providing pumping plants, and otherwise assisting to place areas under cultivation. I trust that the Federal Labour Government will adopt a more sympathetic attitude towards the wine industry than did its predecessor, which reduced the bounty by 9d. a gallon two years ago, and so precipitated the present crisis. I am confident that if the policy that I have outlined is followed the industry will eventually stand firmly on its feet. It is an industry that brings to Australia a considerable volume of outside wealth, and provides in this country employment for a large number of people. It is also responsible for bringing under intense production areas of land which, comparatively speaking, would be poor for cereal growing, grazing, and many other forms of primary production. </para>

It is my belief that this Government will justify the confidence reposed in it by the large majority of the electors of Australia ; that, as the years go by, it will establish a record, which will eclipse that of its predecessor in the matter of mere length of tenure of office and, what is more important, that it will leave behind such a record of good work that it will be said of it with pride, &#34; Something attempted, something done.&#34; </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline>
                    and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline>
                    the former on having become the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and the latter upon his accession to office in the Ministry. I am sure that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline>
                    must have been rendered almost breathless by the speed with which he has shifted from one position to another in this chamber. He had scarcely become comfortable in his&#39; seat as Leader of the Opposition when he found himself Leader of the Government in the Senate I assure
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline>
                    and his colleagues that honorable senators on this side will do everything to assist the conduct of business in the Senate, and that Ave  shall not unnecessarily interfere with its progress.
                </para>
                <para>Before dealing with matters arising out of the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, I shall address myself to one or two remarks emanating from the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply, beginning with those made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran.</inline> The honorable senator&#39;s remarks remind me of a bell wether, a very convenient animal: usually an old and tractable sheep whose services are requisitioned to lead his fellow sheep into the muster yard. For a long time the farmers of Australia have been particularly suspicious of the Labour party. Now we find that party professing to be their greatest friend. We find gentlemen like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> going about the country making long, plausible speeches about wheat pools, and talking learnedly to farmers as fellow farmers, all with the hope that those farmers will be inveigled into the yard of the Labour party. But let it be noted that the farmers are not expected to read <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Dooley&#39;s  speech, in which he advocates that all imported goods should be shut out of Australia. According to him we are to have a tariff that will definitely prevent importation of goods into this country. Naturally if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> were to make such a pronouncement to his new-found friends, they would at once declare, &#34; That is going to put up the price of things that we have to buy, and it will i u jure us when we are in competition with the markets of the world. How are we to sell our products if all imports are to be shut out of Australia, and we are to be restricted to purchasing all our requirements in this market?&#34; So <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> keeps tactfully quiet on that phase of the subject, and confines his attention to the wine industry and wheat pools. But what would be the position of our wine industry if other countries were to adopt the suggestions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> and apply them to our wines. Incidentally, while not proceeding exactly along those lines, the Labour Government in Great Britain does propose to destroy the preference on Australian wines, and, when that is done, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> will have very carefully to eschew any references to the blessings of Labour governments in connexion with our wine industry. Such references might cause some of his new-found friends to remember that that Labour Government in Great Britain intends to take a step prejudicial to the industry, one that will wipe away a preference which was established by a Conservative government. </para>
                <para>To-day we have a rather extraordinary occurrence in connexion with federal governments, one which I think is a record. We are about to be presented with a budget from the new Labour Treasurer, who tells us that the previous budget has had to be revised. Then we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
                <para class="block">O&#39;Halloran, who,  accidently,  happens to be a South Australian representative, announcing in anticipation of the new budget that the Labour Government intends to pay the full amount of the grant to South Australia. That, I assume, is merely electioneering tactics, to divert to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> glory that is really due to an opposing party. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> was talking so learnedly about wheat pools, I looked through the Governor-General&#39;s speech to see if it announced the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool, but found no mention of one. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran&#39;s</inline> talk about such a pool is nothing but political birdlime to mislead those people in the wayback,  often referred to as hayseeds, who read <inline font-style="italic">Mansard,</inline> into the belief that this Government intends to do &#34;something for them. The honorable senator&#39;s remarks reminded me of a leaflet which was, during the recent election, circulated in the Calare constituency under the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gibbons.</inline> It promised the farmers that if a Labour Government were returned to power they would get 6s. 6d. a bushel for their wheat and it probably won the Calare seat for Labour. At any rate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran&#39;s</inline> talk about a compulsory wheat pool, no mention of which is made in the Governor-General&#39;s speech, is merely political birdlime. </para>
                <para>Many strange promises were made during the election. Passing through South Australia the other day I encountered a friend who had been there&#39; during the general election. I am sorry <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> is leaving the Chamber because this is a matter that intimately concerns him. My friend told me that he had listened to a speech by one of the supporters of the Labour party in South Australia in which <inline font-style="italic">r</inline> terrible picture of the devastation caused by the drought in the north of the State and in Eyre&#39;s Peninsula was drawn. I pricked up my ears when my friend told me that this gentleman was speaking very well on agricultural questions, because I remembered <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> making very long, speeches in this Chamber on agricultural questions, and I said to myself. &#34; This must be my friend, O&#39;Halloran&#34;. My other friend went on to tell me that this gentleman said that the poor unfortunate farmers who had been starved out on Eyre&#39;s Peninsula, were victims of Liberal administration, and that if Labour had been in office they would never have been permitted to go out into the dry areas ; that only quite recently the Commonwealth Government, through its agents the Development and Migration Commission, had been instrumental in having an area of land opened up in the north-west mallee district in Victoria, and was putting people on land where he knew quite well they would starve, because they could not possibly live on it. Now I happened to know that the proposal that had been made in regard to the north-west portion of the mallee in Victoria had been put forward, not by a Liberal or Nationalist Government, but by the Hogan Labour Government of Victoria. It was a proposal to develop what is known as the Nowingi area, and in this regard, let me quote from the second annual report of the Development and Migration Commission. The Victorian Government referred to in the report was, as I have already said, the Hogan Labour Government. On page 35 will be found the following: - </para>

                        - Early in 1928, the Victorian Government submitted a proposal for the construction of a railway and roads in the North-Western Mallee district. The proposal involved the development and settlement of a strip of country westwards from Nowingi and immediately south of the settlement on the existingRedclilfs-Merringur railway.
                    </para>
                    <para>The submission contemplated the following expenditure: - </para>

                </para>
                <para>After preliminary examination of this proposal, the Commission felt that it was a marginal proposition, and decided, with the concurrence of the State authorities, to conduct a detailed economic survey of the area, with a view to estimating the total costs of development and the results which might be expected to accrue therefrom, both to the settlers and to the community as a whole. </para>
                <para>Although the submission was for the construction of 35 miles of railway, and the associated feeder roads, it was made clear that the Victorian Government contemplated the development of the whole area of country between Nowingi and the South Australian border. This would involve the construction of 50 miles of railway, and the execution of other necessary public works, including proposed reticulation by means of waterchannels involving an expenditure of approximately &#163;500,000. </para>
                <para>The Commission&#39;s examination, therefore, related to the estimated costs and results of the development of the area which would be served by a 56-mile railway. </para>
                <para>In a report submitted to the Government in November, 1928, the Commission set out particularsof its inquiries, and discussed the prospects of profitable settlement. Briefly, the principal facts adduced and the conclusions reached were the following: - </para>

But what are the facts? &#34;Within a month of its appointment as u Government, it has already appointed another board. Finding itself at a dead end in the matter of the coal trouble, all it could do was to appoint a board and arrange a conference, the very steps which it criticised the previous government for taking. What is the Hibble tribunal but a board? If there are no merits in boards, why do Ministers shelter themselves behind the Hibble tribunal? Why do they not deal with the coal trouble direct? </para>

I forgot that there are criminals whose freedom is restrained in the  interests of the community, but I refuse to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> was referring to them. In any case, what does he mean by economic freedom? As f understand it, economic freedom means the liberty of a man to please himself as t,o the employer for whom he shall work, and as to the rate of pay he shall accept for his work. I do not think there is a limit to the economic freedom of any individual in Australia. Any one has the liberty to work or refuse to work.

                    said that the present Government would emulate -the Fisher Government. If the present Government seeks to emulate the Fisher Government it is going about it in a very curious way. I was a member of that government. I was
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher&#39;s</inline>
                    Minister for Defence, and I well remember moving the introduction of the bill for the inauguration of universal and compulsory military service. The measure was carried unanimously in both Houses, and having carried it, the Labour party went into the country and boasted about it. We said, &#34;What did the Liberals do? They merely carried compulsory training, for boys, whereas we, the real patriots, have extended it to the men. We are going to train every adult in this country up to the age of twenty-one.&#34; We said that every person, physically fit and living in a district where he could conveniently be trained, must be trained to enable him to take part in the defence of his country. We boasted about all this. We said that our method was better than that which the Liberals put forward. If the present Government proposes to emulate the Fisher Government by abolishing compulsory military training, I tremble to think of the likely fate of the whole temple of Labour, which was raised in the years from  1910  to  1913.  I suggest that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline>
                    reflects before he again compares this Government with the Fisher Government.
                </para>
                <para>The recent election resulted in the defeat of the Bruce-Page Government. There was no election for members of the Senate, so that honorable senators are still in the position of having the endorsement of the electors. A peculiar position has arisen in this Parliament, for  in one chamber there is a preponderance of Labour members, whereas in the other Nationalist and Country party members predominate. I take this opportunity of saying that the Opposition in the Senate will not deal in any partisan spirit with the legislation that comes before it. Each measure will be judged from two points of view - first, whether the Government has authority for its introduction, and secondly, its effect on the country. We on this side recognize &#34;that the Government has received a mandate from the people in connexion with industrial matters. The electors undoubtedly desire that the present dual system shall continue. We shall recognize the mandate they have given the Government. Any legislation introduced to amend the arbitration system in order that it may work more smoothly; any attempt to create a better spirit between employers and employees; any effort to extend the principle of conciliation, will receive our hearty support. The Government need expect no opposition to such legislation, for we recognize that it is entitled to legislate in respect of industrial matters. The election was largely fought upon that issue, and the people gave their verdict. But on other questions the Government will have to establish, to the satisfaction of the country, its right to change the existing legislation before the Opposition will support any measure introduced for that purpose. </para>
                <para>I desire to draw attention to the change in the representation of the Government in the Senate. For many years various governments have recognized the importance of the Senate in this respect, although it is true that in the early years of federation this chamber did not receive that recognition in ministerial appointments that was its due. From 1901 to 1910, the Barton, the first Deakin, the Watson, the Reid-McLean, the second Deakin, the first Fisher, and the third Deakin Ministries were represented in the Senate by one minister with a portfolio and the Vice-President of the Executive Council. From 1910 to 1916, during the administration of the second Fisher, the Cook, the third Fisher and the first Hughes Governments, the Senate, in addition to having a minister with a portfolio and the Vice-President of the Executive Council, had also an honorary minis-  ter.  Between 1916 and 1926, a period which embraced the second Hughes ministry, the two Nationalist war governments, as well as the Bruce-Page Government, the Senate had two ministers with portfolios and one honorary minister. In June, 1926, the Bruce-Page Government increased the number of ministers in the Senate to four - one minister with a portfolio, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and two honorary ministers. It will therefore be seen that from the inception of federation the Senate has had either two ministers with full ministerial rank, or one minister and the Vice-President of&#39; the Executive Council. It  has  remained for this Government to deprive the Senate of any minister with a portfolio. The Senate is now on a lower plane as regards ministerial appointments than it has ever been since the inception of federation. I protest against such treatment of the Senate, particularly as it is quite unnecessary. The Government&#39;s failure to recognize the position of the Senate in the Constitution cannot be excused on the ground that its numbers in this chamber are small. During the regime of the first Deakin Government the number of its supporters in the Senate was small, but that Government did not disregard the Senate&#39;s claims to recognition in the matter of ministerial appointments. I do not know whether we can take any effective means of emphasizing our protest in. this matter, but I feel that the Government&#39;s action warrants more than passing criticism. </para>
                <para>The Government won the election largely because of the promises it made to the electors. One of those promises had relation to the removal of unemployment. Labour party candidates, especially when addressing electors in industrial centres, made it appear that in their opinion the Bruce-Page Government was largely responsible for the unemployment then existing. To-day the Labour party is being called upon to deliver the goods, lt is no longer in Opposition, incapable of doing more than criticize. But we look in vain to the Governor-General&#39;s Speech for any ray of hope for the unemployed. It is true that the Speech contains a paragraph that it is not proposed to appoint a Director of Economic Research. That will result  in a very doubtful saving of about &#163;2,000 per annum. Is that grain  of  sand  to be  offered to the unemployed? Theunemployed are told to &#34; wait and see.&#34; The miseries of the unemployed men and their families were exploited by Labour candidates in order to secure the support of electors for themselves and to create hostility to Nationalist candidates. Those electors will find nothing in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech to assuage their suffering. </para>
                <para>In connexion with the trouble in the coal-mining industry, the Government also made definite promises. I have here an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of Monday, the 7th October, 1929- </para><quote>

                        <para>- The report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore&#39;s</inline> speech contains no reference to co-operation. He said that if a Labour Government was returned the mines would be re-opened within a fortnight. But what happened when a Labour Government was returned? We read paragraphs in the press that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> was investigating the constitutional position; that the Government was giving the mutter serious consideration; that each week-end Ministers visited Sydney to consult with union officials. After much cogitation and travelling and many conferences they evolved a proposal which, when brought forward by the Bruce-Page Government, they received with ridicule. They suggested  a conference between the  mine-owners and the miners. The miners asked for bread, and they were given a stone. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> promised to re-open the mines; he gave them  a  conference. He won much support for his party by his promise to re-open the mines. </para>

                            <para>- The second administrative act of the present Government, to which I direct attention, was the suspension of the agreement with the British Government as regards assisted migrants. The third was the suspension of the issue &#39;of licences&#39; to waterside workers. These, it will be noted, were all acts of destruction. The fourth administrative act, and the only one which may be regarded as constructive, was the appointment of the Hibble tribunal to deal with the trouble in the coal-mining industry. This Government won the election by creating a scare that the Bruce-Page Ministry proposed to bring about a reduction in wages, and yet its only constructive act up to the time that it met Parliament was to appoint a tribunal, the  chairman  of which suggested a reduction of wages as a condition precedent to the re-opening of the mines. </para>

                    <para>Let me now examine some of the destructive administrative acts to which I have referred. In suspending compulsory military training, this Government reminds me of a mischievous child who, after playing with a toy for a time, becomes tired of it and pulls it to pieces. I could understand the decision of the Government if, after having given serious consideration to the problem, it had come to the conclusion that the system of training was not being carried out along right lines. But this Government did not take that stand. It suspended the entire system and then it appealed to the Military Board, saying in effect: -  &#34;For  heaven&#39;s sake tell us what scheme we can put in its place.&#34; </para>

                        PEARCE.Having announced the suspension of the system of compulsory military training which, as we all know, &#39; aroused a storm of criticism, the Government then declared that.it proposed to consult with the Military Board as to the system to be adopted in future. That was done. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, and another Minister proceeded to Melbourne and conferred with the Military Board. What was the reason for this precipitate action upon the part of the Government? I read in the press that the Minister for Defence
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline>
                        stated that the Government intended to take some time to consider it. But it appears t.hat a gentleman outside the Ministry - I refer .to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath.</inline>
                        the honorable member for Ballarat - said in so many words to the Government: &#34; No you don&#39;t. You must abolish compulsory military training before Christinas.&#34; Apparently the Government promptly replied &#34; Yes,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath,</inline>
                        we will abolish it.&#34;

                        PEARCE Evidently the Minister for Defence did not think so at the time. Until
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline>
                        told him he was not aware that the people would be behind this administrative act. On what ground did the Government abolish compulsory training? Several reasons have been advanced, but not one of them is conclusive. In the first place it was reported that the Treasurer
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline>
                        having examined the finances, declared that the abolition of compulsory training would lead to substantial savings in &#39;expenditure. Accordingly that was put forward as the principal reason. We were told that the Government intend to effect economy and that the only way in which this could be done was by doing away with all camps of training.

                            <para>- Nevertheless it is clear that the only way to effect economy in this direction is by abolishing the camps of training. We were told also that the volunteer system to be introduced would be just as effective as compulsory training. But is it not clear that, if the volunteer system is to be effective, the men must go into camp for training, and does it not follow that if they are to he trained in the same way as trainees under the compulsory system it will be impossible to effect savings? Again, we were informed that this Government had a mandate from the people to abolish the compulsory system. On that point I remind the Senate that the respective platforms of the several parties were placed before the people at the general election in November last, and on that occasion the electors endorsed the platforms of the Nationalist and Country parties. When the Bruce-Page Government appealed to the people a few weeks ago the question of compulsory military training was not mentioned. </para>

                        <para class="block">Plans formnlated by the military authorities for the enlistment of volunteers were explained by the Adjutant-General of the Australian Military Forces (Brigadier -General T. H. Dodds), in an address at the United Services Institute Hall, South Melbourne, last night to officers of the former Citizen Forces. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The report goes on to quote Brigadier-General Dodds as saying that the military authorities had nothing to do with the proposed change, but were simply carrying out orders issued by the Government. He added that the plans for training volunteers prepared by the authorities aimed at brighter and more attractive conditions of training and a smarter uniform. This apparently is what the Labour party has been waiting for all these years I According to Senators Dooley and Dunn, Labour has been in the wilderness for fourteen years, and now, having reached office again, it has produced something! This, we are informed, is Labour&#39;s efficient defence policy! The report states that the rates of pay will be the same as under the compulsory system, and then quotes Brigadier-General Dodds as saying - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It will be necessary to provide a more attractive uniform than that used by the compulsory trainees. The question of a betterfitting uniform has been under consideration for some time, and an attractive tunic has been evolved. Khaki will be retained. The tunic is cut on neater lines than previously, without pockets in the shirt, a half belt in place of a full belt, and upstanding collar and sleeves without cuffs. According to the individual ideas of each regiment trimming may be added by coloured collars, pipings, and buttons. As is the ease with the greater part of our plan, much depends upon available funds- </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Apparently the Government has ample funds at its disposal, since it has, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran,</inline> agreed to pay a grant of &#163;500,000 to South Australia -  but it is estimated that the new uniform would not cost 50 per cent. more than that usually issued to trainees. It is also proposed that trainees should be issued with web equipment for purposes of training. </para>
                    <para class="block">I direct particular attention to the latter part of the statement, in view of the Government&#39;s declaration that compulsory military training has been suspended for reasons of economy. What does all this change amount to? Apparently , instead of a low-cut collar, volunteer trainees are to be supplied with uniforms with stiff upright collars and coloured pipings, and the new uniform is not to cost 50 per cent. more than that previously issued ! How all this must stir up the anti-military spirit of our friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae!</inline> We can imagine how enthusiastically he will endorse this new defence policy of the Labour Government! At last we are to have an effective defence policy for Australia - a policy that conforms  to  Labour&#39;s ideals! On manyoccasions we have heard a number of honorable senators now supporting the Government denouncing the evils of militarism, and all the pomp and circumstance that attach to it. Boiled down, it would appear that the difference between militarism and Labour&#39;s idea of effective defence is the difference between an upright collar with coloured pipings and a collar that is not upright; between a full shirt with pockets and  a  shirt with none! WhenI was listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -</inline> Dunn, I had  no  idea that the only difference between the militarism as we have known it in the past, and an effective defence scheme  as  evolved by the Labour Government, is a difference in the cut of the military coat. I never thought that if the trainee was clothed in a loose-fitting tunic, he was a representative of militarism, but that if he were wearing a coat with a waist like a tailor&#39;s model, he conformed to Labour&#39;s latest idea of an effective defence unit. </para>
                    <para>But turning for a moment from the satirical aspect, of Labour&#39;s defence policy, I desire, in serious mood, to direct the attention of the Senate to what is happening  in  other countries, and  to  indicate the views of governments of other countries, far more powerful than we are, concerning disarmament. The following is  an  extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Empire Parliamentary Association Report on Foreign Affairs,</inline> for July and August, 1929:- </para>

                <para> In announcing an investigation into military expenditure, the <inline font-weight="bold">President (Mr. Hoover)</inline> made a remarkable statement, the importance of which was immediately recognized by the press. He pointed out that, according to official estimates, public expenditure for the next four years was expanding greatly, and that a striking feature in this situation was that the purely naval and military expenditures represented an increase over pre-war figures of no less than 530,000,000 dollars (&#163;109,200,000). Proceeding, the  President  said: - </para>
                <para>The American people should understand that current expenditure on strictly military activities of the army and navy constitutes the largest military budget of any nation in the world to-day, and at a time when there is less real danger of extensive disturbance to peace than at any time in more than a half a century. </para></quote>

                <para>In the case of the United States of America there has been an increase in three years of &#163;25,000,000. The United Kingdom alone, of the four great powers, shows a reduction in expenditure amounting to &#163;4,000,000, and I remind honorable senators that, in the last resort, Australia will have to look to Great Britain for her effective defence. France shows an apparent increase of over &#163;20,000,000. but allowing for the fluctuation in exchange rates, the actual increase may be somewhat less. Japan shows an increase of &#163;5,000,000 in four years. These figures, which are taken from the Empire Parliamentary Association&#39;s Report on Foreign Affairs for July and August, 1929, relate to the army, navy and air force. </para>

                    PEARCE.They are the only years given in the report from which I am quoting. I give the following naval figures separately, because our national safety depends upon the maintenance of a navy. A nation cannot attack us unless it has a navy; and our safety lies in the possession of the British navy as a part of the British Empire. The following figures enable a comparison to be made between the  naval expenditure in the year before the war with that of the present year -

                </para>
                <para class="block">Although Prance shows in respect of its naval expenditure an apparent reduction between 3913-14 and 1924-25 of from &#163;18,440,000 to &#163;11,928,185, there was, after making allowance for the value of the franc no actual reduction during that period. </para>
                <para>But let us have regard to the naval expenditure of the two nations in the Pacific - the United States of America and Japan - our neighbours; let us contrast their naval expenditure with that of other countries. A navy is the only thing that can threaten or defend us. The two Pacific nations which I have mentioned have increased their naval ex penditure, one from &#163;28,000,000 to &#163;7 6,000,000 and the other from &#163;9,000,000 to &#163;25,000,000. On the other hand the navy upon which we lean and live, has, taking the purchasing power of the sovereign into consideration, suffered a reduction of probably one-third in its expenditure during the last few years. </para>
                <para>These figures have to be borne in mind when we are considering a recent speech by the  President  of the United States. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoover,</inline> a protagonist of peace, and an advocate of disarmament, in which he said in effect &#34; The United States of America will not disarm prior to an agreement; the United States will disarm only when an agreement has been reached.&#34; Yet we are told by the Government of Australia - this lonely outpost in the Pacific - that it intends to suspend compulsory military training as a &#34; gesture of peace &#34;. Such action is more likely to be regarded as a gesture ofeither insanity or infinite foolishness. </para>
                <para>I now come to the second destructive act of this Government - the suspension of migration. Here again the Government acted precipitately. The first announcement, telegraphed from Canberra to the press, over the name of the Prime Minister, was to the effect that the Government had suspended assisted migration. That announcement was, of course, intended for consumption by those who during the election campaign had been gulled by certain stories, such as we have heard this afternoon, concerning the alleged relationship between migration and unemployment. But when it was pointed out to the Prime Minister that this assisted migration scheme did not stand alone - that it was linked up with a development scheme and a loan of &#163;34,000,000 at a very low rate of interest to assist in the development of the States - the Government changed its ground. We were then told that it had not suspended assisted immigration, but had despatched a communication to the British Government setting out its views on the subject, and that when it received a reply the whole matter would be taken into consideration. What are the facts in regard to migration? For the first nine months of 1928 the arrivals and departures of British migrants were as follows :  - Arrivals, 58,875 ; departures, 44,240; or an excess of 14,635 arrivals over departures. We then come to the bad days of unemployment, and we find there is an automatic check. For the first nine months of 1929, the arrivals were 48,775, and the departures 45,378, or an excess of arrivals over departures of only 3,397. If this vast continent, with a population of over 6,250,000, is faced with unemployment solely because of an  additional 3,397 people in the Commonwealth, there must surely be something wrong. Are we to advertise it to the world that because the arrivals exceeded the departures by 3,000 odd during the first nine months of the present year, we have, according to. the stories of honorable senators opposite, an army of 200,000 unemployed? We are then told that the Government and its supporters do not object to our own kith and kin coming to Australia, but are strongly opposed to foreigners coming into this country&#39; and taking the food out of the mouths of fellow-Australians. </para>

                    PEARCE.Yes, because it was not true. The figures in relation to foreign immigration disclose that for the first nine months of 1928 the number of arrivals was 10,108, and the number of departures 8,824, or an excess of 1,284 arrivals over departures for that period. Is it to be suggested that because 1,284 foreigners arrived in Australia within nine months the Commonwealth is being flooded with foreign migrants? But let us go further. For the first nine months of 1929, 7,876 foreign migrants arrived and 8,366 departed, so that the foreign population actually decreased by 490. If
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline>
                    is logical, he must urge that the excess of departures over arrivals during that period provided jobs for 490 Australians, but the probability is that that number of Australians lost their jobs because of the decrease in migration.

                    repeated today a statement concerning the influx of southern Europeans which he doubtless made on numerous occasions during the election campaign. The figures, in this connexion, show that for the first nine months of 1928 the arrivals totalled 4,181, and the departures 1,987, or an excess of 2,194 arrivals over departures. For the first nine months of 1929 when the restrictions imposed by the Bruce-Page Government became effective, the arrivals totalled 2,090 and the departures 2,228, so that there was actually an excess of 138 departures over arrivals.

In what way is Australia suffering from assisted migration? I turn to the report of the Development and Migration Commission, which gives an indication of the type of migrants which are coming to Australia. On page 38 of the Second Annual Report of that commission I find the following : -

In other words, in ibc twelve months covered by this report, the Labour Government of Western Australia  requisitoned  for more adult farm workers than did the remainder of Australia. Another class of requisition was that for domestic servants, and the following is a table of the number recorded :- - </para>

                    <para class="block">Although the introduction in December, 1926, of the free passage scheme for domestics has resulted in an increase of 52 per cent, in the number of domestics brought to Australia; the supply of that class of labour is still somewhat short of the demand. The facts are that every one of those migrants had a job to go to as soon- as he or she stepped on to the wharf ; and that there are still more employers asking for domestic help. Yet this Government has said to Great Britain, through its Prime Minister, &#34;We have received some 10,000 of your unemployed. They are swamping us. It is true that our population increased by excess of arrivals over departures last year by only 3,000, but we cannot employ them all. </para>
                    <para>Our unemployment problem is so acute that although every domestic servant that we brought to Australia in the last twelve months was given employment as soon as she landed, and did not put anybody out of work, and although the organizations concerned have letters from these boys, that we brought to Australia, saying they are being well trained and well brought up, with a future in front of them, we- do not want any more of your domestic servants or boys in future&#34;. Most of the domestics were unemployed girls from the middle districts of Lancashire. Their migration to Australia opened to them the&#39; possibility of a future instead of their being allowed to suffer the pangs of hunger and even starvation, while we needed their services in Australia. Yet this Government says <inline font-style="italic">%o</inline> them &#34; Stay away. There is work for you here but if you dome you might displace some hardy waterside worker in Sydney, or possibly some shearer in Queensland.&#34; The Government practically says to Great Britain &#34; We ask you to keep your domestics but, whilst we cannot take those domestic servants or your boys and give them a home, in Australia, and a chance to become good citizens of this country, we urge you, for heavens sake to take our wheat, our wool, our wine, butter and dried fruits, and continue the preference you are giving on our wine and our dried fruits. Also, for heaven&#39;s sake, do notrefuse to  lend  us money* although we do not want your men.&#34; I think one might well paraphrase an old- doggerel and  declare, &#34; We don&#39;t want your girls, we don&#39;t want your boys; but, by jingo, we do want your money, and we want it badly. too.&#34; In effect, this Government says &#34; We do not want your men because, whilst it may relieve your unemployment, it will, to some little extent, aggravate our unemployment problem. But we do want your money to help us to find work for our unemployed.&#34; </para>
                    <para>Now I come to the third act of destruction, the suspension of licences to waterside workers. That is another gesture 10 the communistic comrades outside. The Government says in effect to them, &#34; We are going to let you again enjoy yourselves in the good old way, and as soon, as it is safe we shall deal another deadly blow at this Transport Workers Act. We &#34; will get rid of it altogether.&#34; And then, when- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran&#39;s</inline> farmer friend sends his wheat to be shipped, probably next year, the other branch of the honorable senator&#39;s family, having done away with the Transport Workers Act, a nice little waterside workers&#39; strike will be precipitated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> will promptly go into recess until the strike is over, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> will take his place in the interim, and &#39; talk about economic freedom, the brotherhood of man, and all that kind of thing. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> will resume business soon as the strike is over, and will talk once more to the farmers about the blessings of a compulsory wheat pool. Australia has had a few months of peace in the waterside industry, but now, by this act of destruction, we have an attempt to reintroduce industrial warfare on the waterfront. </para>
                    <para>I have passed under review the three destructive acts of this new Labour Government. I come now to its one constructive act: the appointment of the Hibble tribunal. The recent election was won on a cry of wage reduction, and the first constructive act of the Government brings about a proposal for a reduction of wages. As soon as that finding is made by - the  chairman  of the tribunal appointed by the Prime Minister to investigate the trouble in the coal-mining industry it is denounced  -  and denounced by the Prime Minister himself, followed by his Treasurer. </para>
                    <para>And what do our friends opposite intend to do about Johu Brown? They had a glorious time during the election in connexion with John Brown. From every platform they asserted that, by failing to prosecute John Brown, the Nationalist Government had thwarted the ends of justice.

This Government has been in -power for a month. What has it done with John Brown? Why has it not prosecuted him? </para>

                        PEARCE.I wish now to say a few words with regard to the Government&#39;s proposal to tamper with the  &#163;34,000,000  migration agreement. I have already dealt with the matter in regard to assisted migration. The agreement provides for the advancing of money for developmental purposes to the various States of the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, the full  &#163;34,000,000  is available for works of a developmental character approved by the Commonwealth and British Governments at  1-J  per cent, interest for the first five years and one-third of the effective rate of interest for a further five years. The terms of the agreement are of tremendous advantage to the States, who for the ten years during which most developmental works are un reproductive will pay a very cheap rate of interest for the money advanced to them. It is very unlikely, however, if this agreement is tampered with, that the British Government will be at all solicitous to extend the operation of that part of the agreement. It has financial difficulties of its own, and it was a very generous act on its part to agree to share the interest burden on our developmental works. I am, therefore, astonished that at a time like this, when money is required .for developmental work, in order to provide employment, a government which professes to be anxious about providing employment should be proposing to seek  an alteration in the agreement that furnishes the States with money for that purpose.
                    </para>
                    <para>There is another feature of this agree-  ment  to which I wish to draw particular attention. It is an undoubted fact that, in the past, money has been squandered on public works that have not  been  fully investigated before being approved. Knowing this, the British and Commonwealth Governments made a stipulation that before the developmental works proposed to be undertaken under the migration agreement could be approved they had to be inquired into by a competent body to ascertain if they were economically sound. For that reason the Development and Migration Commission was appointed, chiefly because of the individual fitness of its members and also because as a composite body it could bring various types of minds to bear on the different questions likely to come before it for review. At first the various States looked upon this body with a rather jealous eye; they were rather suspicious of it, but gradually the commission, by working in with the States, lias gained the confidence of every State Government, and, what is equally important, that of the State departments. The latter have come to realize that it is a body whose purpose it is to assist thom, and not .to interfere with them in their work. It is no exaggeration to say that to-day the Development and Migration Commission has earned the full confidence and also the full cooperation of every State Government and State department. I therefore cannot understand why there should lie any proposal to interfere with it. I am led to believe that the proposal of the Government is to have the work done by some Commonwealth department. The Development and Migration Commission has been accepted by the States and State departments, because they have gradually come to realize that it is not in the true sense a Commonwealth Government department, but that it is a semi-independent body. If these State departments are now to subordinate themselves and their work&#39; to the control of a Commonwealth Government department I predict that very serious difficulty and friction will soon arise. The States of Tasmania and Western Australia have received tremendous assistance from the Development and Migration Commission. When application was first made to the Bruce-Page Government for a continuance of the Tasmanian grant that Government thought it would be a good thing for the two administrations concerned to investigate the cause of Tasmania&#39;s financial positi&#39;on. It suggested that the Development and Migration Commission should be asked to make an investigation on behalf of both governments, and report as to means by which the State might be able to carry on without so much assistance from the Commonwealth. That inquiry was made with full co-operation between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government, and as a result various recommendations were made for the reorganization of the Agricultural Department of Tasmania, and for the establishment of agricultural bureaux and forestry bureaux. Various measures were suggested for promoting co-operative effort in agriculture. All these recommendations have been put into effect by the Tasmanian Parliament, and it is generally agreed that the work done in that respect, has been of great .assistance to Tasmania, particularly in putting her on a much sounder financial footing. </para>
                    <para>Western Australia having very extensive areas of Crown lands available for settlement has provided great opportunities for development, and consequently has received a largo amount of assistance under the migration agreement. The Development and Migration Commission, in this &#39; connexion, has gained the entire confidence of all parties in that State. When the intention of the Federal Labour Government was announced, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier,</inline> the Labour Premier of Western Australia, referring to the proposed suspension of the clause of the migration agreement relating to assisted migration and the future of the Development and Migration Commission, said - &#34; Without expressing any opinion on the broad matter of policy as to whether the Development and Migration Commission should he abolished or retained, I should like to say that its work in Western Australia has been very valuable and of great assistance to the State. Every proposal submitted to the commission by us has been examined most thoroughly, and for the past twelve months it has been making a careful study of the land settlement project known as the 3,000 farms scheme, with which is associated the construction of many hundreds of miles of roads and. railways and some important water supply works. If approved under the Migration Agreement, this big project can be carried out within five years, but without the assistance provided for under the agreement, the State would probably be unable to complete it within twenty years. Of course I cannot speak for the other States, but, so far as Western Australia is concerned, we have been greatly assisted through the investigations of the commission in our task of developing the State. </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth Prime Minister&#39;s request to the British Government for a temporary suspension of assisted migration during the present period of unemployment and trade depression, whatever its effects may be, should achieve good by focusing the attention of the people on some of the hard, and disagreeable yet inexorable facts of our economic life that can no longer be ignored. It cannot be the desire of the Federal Government that the population of Australia should not be increased. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin&#39;s.</inline> difficulty is the shortage of work offering for our own people, and his idea obviously is that the problem of unemployment cannot be solved except by stopping immigration. To my mind that is quite an erroneous view, but while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin&#39;s</inline> Government and other Governments in Australia hold it, there ought not to be any more migration to this country. We must not only banish unemployment, but also remove the fear of unemployment. </para>
                        <para>At the same time it will be a very serious matter for this State if we are not to get the advantage of the cheap money under the migration agreement. It will be remembered that under the agreement we were to pay one per cent. On the money advanced for the first five years, and then one-third of the actual interest rate for the next five years, after which we were to assume full responsibility for the whole of the interest. So far we have received &#163;4,489,000 under the arrangement, which has already saved us &#163;600,000 in interest, while the total saving on that sum will be &#163;1,346,936. This is an enormous advantage for  a  State that must have money for development work. If Britain is willing help this State to the extent of &#163;10,000,000, as arranged, the saving in interest will be no less than &#163;3,875,000.In other words, Britain has offered to assist the development of the State by advancing &#163;10,000,000, and the interest concession represents a gift to the State of &#163;3,875.000 compared with the interest liability on on equivalent amount borrowed in the ordinary way. People can judge for themselves what it will mean to the State if we lose that advantage. It will mean so much money less to provide employment under this heading, for if we borrowed an equal amount at ordinary interest rates the difference between the respective rates would necessarily have to be deducted from the money available to provide work. </para>

                    <para class="block">The same story can be told of all the States, but I want to give an instance of how the Development and Migration Commission has saved Queensland from a wasteful expenditure, which would have been a very serious burden to the State. The Queensland Labour Government submitted to the Queensland Parliament what is known as the Dawson Valley irrigation scheme. That scheme was proposed in all sincerity by an enthusiastic engineer, who obviously did not have full knowledge as regards soil and various other factors, which are essential to make an irrigation scheme a success. There was no investigation as to the products likely to be produced on the country to be irrigated, nor of the prospects of finding a profitable market for whatever was produced. Yet the Queensland Government was about to commit the State to this scheme. In order, however, to get the advantage of the cheap money under the migration agreement it made application to the Commonwealth Government to have the scheme brought under that agreement. That necessitated an investigation by the Development and Migration Commission, and when that investigation was made it was ascertained, first of all, that the soil and dairy experts of the Queensland agricultural departments had never been asked for a report as to the suitability of the country proposed to be irrigated, or as to the possibility of carrying on dairying in the area. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly it is, but I am merely attempting to show how the Development and Migration Commission has prevented wasteful expenditure in Australia. If it had not been for the fact that under the terms  of the migration agreement it was necessary to have an investigation by some competent body, the Dawson Valley Irrigation scheme would have been saddled on the taxpayers of Queensland to-day. After full investigation the commission reported adversely on the scheme and said that before the State should be committed to it experiments on a small scale  should  be carried on in various parts of the area in order to determine whether it would be possible to carry on similar operations on a big scale. It is possible that these experiments are now being conducted in Queensland to-day. </para>

                    <para>That is an instance of the way in which The Development and Migration Commission prevented the people of Queensland from incurring a liability of &#163;4,000,000. If the same procedure had been adopted in regard to soldier settlement how many millions of pounds would have been saved ro the various States? It is all very well to say that the States can look after these matters, but we know that millions of pounds have been squandered in soldier settlement because various schemes were not investigated before the State governments embarked on them. The body set up by the Bruce-Page Government to investigate in an impartial way altogether free from politics these proposals for expenditure and to look particularly into their soundness, has done good work. I have given two instances to-day in which it has saved Queensland and Victoria from an expenditure of huge sums of money. It would be a disaster to the Commonwealth to abolish a body, which is just the very thing we need in Australia to conduct investigations and prevent th6 reckless expenditure of money Money is going to be very hard to get in the future. We know that we should have been careful in the past. There is a double reason for being careful in the future. Yet here we have a government talking about unemployment and about providing employment by means of developmental works, proposing to get rid of the one body that has done effective work in Australia in the investigation of schemes on which public money was proposed to be spent. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Extension of time granted.&#39;&#93;</inline></para>

                        <para>My Ministers propose to co-ordinate the functions of the Development and Migration Commission which was established in accordance with the Development and Migration Act of 1.926, with those of the Commonwealth Council of Scientific and Industrial Research; and this work will be brought under the direct control of the Department of the Prime Minister. </para>

                    <para class="block">As the work of the Commission is already under the direct control of the Department of the Prime Ministerno change is contemplated. What is meant by that paragraph? The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is an entirely different body from the Development and Migration Commission and has altogether different functions. How can there he co-ordination between a body dealing with developmental matters and one whose business it is to make scientific investigations? The members of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research may know nothing of developmental matters; indeed, they were appointed because of their knowledge, not of such matters, hut of science and the application of science. The members of the Development and Migration Commission, on the other hand, were chosen not because they knew a great deal about science, but because they had been trained to judge the economic value of developmental schemes. Whoever is responsible for the proposal outlined in that paragraph does not understand the different functions of the two bodies. The Government&#39;s proposal is almost equivalent to suggesting that the work of the Commissioner of Railways in Victoria should be co-ordinated with that of the University of Melbourne. That would mean that instead of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clapp</inline> controlling the Victorian railways, the University of Melbourne would control them. The proposal of the Government will either destroy the usefulness of the Development and Migration Commission or load the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research with duties for which it is entirely unfitted. No persons in the community would be more ready to admit their inability to undertake the work of the Development and Migration Commission than would the members of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. </para>

                        PEARCE.The Department of Markets deals with marketing of our produce; the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research deals with research problems affecting production ; the Development and Migra tion Commission deals with the extension of fruit production, dairying, and other similar matters. In some cases the matters dealt with by these bodies are closely related; and, in order to prevent overlapping, their members meet with the Minister once a month in order to corelate their work in such a way that overlapping is prevented. That is not coordination in the sense that one body carries out the functions of another. It is merely an endeavour to avoid the danger of one department doing the work of another.

                        PEARCE.Another destructive act of the Government since it assumed office was the suspension of licences for waterside workers. This is another instance of the Government&#39;s interference with a deliberate legislative act of this Parliament without the authority of Parliament. What is the object of suspending these licences, seeing that, for the first time since 1917, we have had a period of peace on the waterfront? The Government which talks of industrial peace and of solving the problem of unemployment has dealt a blow at the one measure which has brought industrial peace on the waterfront.

                        PEARCE.It is evident that the hand of the Government has been forced by the extreme element in its ranks. The result will probably be that, instead of the peace which has reigned on the waterfront during recent months, there will be a repetition of the scenes of the past, when the industries of this country were held up. Should trouble again develop, what would the Government do? We should probably find it arranging futile conferences, and granting all sorts of concessions to those who caused the trouble. The restoration of peace would be at the expense of the community.

                    <para>The Government won many votes because of its declared intention not to impose the amusement tax proposed by the late Government. The American moving picture interests in this country, by the expenditure of much money and the circulation of propaganda, did a great deal to assist the Labour party to win the election. The Government has announced that it will not proceed with the taxation proposals of the Bruce-Page Government in respect of amusements; but it proposes to tax the industries of this country by imposing increased taxation through the Post Office. The money which the late Government expected to derive from the taxation of amusement companies will now be derived from an additional tax on newspapers, periodicals, telephones and telegrams. Instead of the American moving picture interests assisting to balance the ledger, the money will be derived from the industries of Australia. </para>
                    <para>A peculiar paragraph in the Governor-General&#39;s speech is that which reads : - &#34;A bill to make better provision for the control of gold reserves in the Commonwealth will be submitted to you.&#34; I have not heard that there is anything wrong with the control of gold reserves in Australia, although I have read many financial statements by banking companies and the chairmen of directors of various financial institutions. I have studied many of the  cricitisms  of both governmental and private financial institutions; but nowhere have I seen any suggestion that there is anything wrong with the position in relation to our gold reserves. What is behind this cryptic utterance in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech? Does the Government mean to use the printing press? That appears to be the meaning of the paragraph. I warn the Government that if it tampers with the gold reserves in that way the troubles which confront Australia to-day will be accentuated. Not only would it create further unemployment, but it would also increase prices, raise the cost of production, and deal a deadly blow at the industries of this country. A government which tampered with the gold reserves by issuing more paper money would be like children in a powder magazine; it would be playing with the most dangerous thing to be. found in the legislative arsenal. </para>

That means that the fund from which wages are paid is being adversely affected. Wheat and wool are our two staple products, and the money received for them supplies the bulk of the wages fund from which labour is paid in Australia. Although they know that these are the facts, the reported utterances of Ministers lead us to believe that these two industries, reduced as they are in income, will be still further hit by some of the proposals contemplated by the Government. </para>

                    <para class="block">I ask them, when they meet the representatives of the British Government at the Imperial and Economic Conferences, not to expect Great Britain to make all the concessions; to remember that there is something due from Australia. They must not expect Great Britain to keep up her navy and her army and to continue expenditure upon the Singapore naval base while we in Australia disarm, and render the people of this country unfit to defend themselves. I urge them to  remember that, if they expect the British taxpayer to do his bit in regard to effective defence of the Empire, the people of Australia should be prepared likewise to do their part in providing for the defence of this country. I ask them also not to expect the British Government to extend sympathy and assistance to our industries by way of preferential duties while we pile up duties against the British manufacturers who are seeking a market for their goods in this country. I remind them that it will be a very bad introduction to the Imperial and Economic Conferences if they endorse the statement made by the present Minister for Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> the other day, that this Government intends to build up a tariff wall so high as to prevent the introduction into Australia of all goods that can be manufactured here - in other words, to prevent Britain from finding a market for any of her manufactures in the Commonwealth. I ask them to remember that the British preferential duties in regard to Australian sugar, wine and dried fruits, as well as many other primary products are of substantial benefit to Australia; they are helping to keep many people of this country in employment. If we expect Britain to grant concessions  to  Australia, we must  in  return, be prepared to show some consideration for British manufactures. </para>

                        it is not necessary for me to traverse much of the ground covered by the speech of the Governor-General. I wish, however, to direct particular attention to the Ministry&#39;s proposals for the defence of Australia as they affect the activities of the department over which I had the honour to preside as a member of the late Government. Compulsory military training was introduced by legislative act, and it has now been discontinued by an administrative act. We all know what would have been said by supporters of the present Government if the Bruce-Page administration, without reference to Parliament, had introduced any change in policy on such an important subject as the defence of Australia.

                        GLASGOW.I challenge the statement that this Government had a mandate to interfere with the defence policy of this country. At the general election in November of last year, the Nationalist Government stated definitely that it stood for the maintenance of compulsory training as part of its defence policy, and that Ministry was returned with a majority. The election a few weeks ago was fought on an entirely different issue. I admit that the Leader of the Government
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline>
                        intimated that the Labour party stood to its former policy, but the only issue before the people concerned federal arbitration. It is inconceivable that the people within twelve months would change their mind on such a vital subject as the defence policy of Australia as it has existed for eighteen or nineteen years.

To maintain this strength it will be necessary to enlist a certain number of men, and experience has proved that it is not possible to secure them under the voluntary system.

                        GLASGOW.But the organization was built up under the compulsory system. What is the history of the defence organization of Australia? Prior to federation our defence forces consisted of volunteers and militia organised in small units in different parts of thecountry. One of the principal reasons for federation was that we should be able to establish a co-ordinated system of defence. Immediately following federation defence was taken over by the Commonwealth. At that time the units had to be raised where the men were prepared to volunteer, and because of the weakness of that system no regard could he paid to the strategic needs of the country. In 1910, the Cook Government commissioned the late Lord Kitchener, the greatest military organizer in the British Empire, to investigate and report upon the defence organization of the Commonwealth, and in his comprehensive report Lord Kitchener recommended that to provide for the defence needs of Australia it would be necessary to introduce compulsory military training. Shortly after that report was received the Cook Government was defeated. The Fisher Government came into office, and, be it said to the credit of that Labour Administration, it gave effect to Lord Kitchener&#39;s recommend&#39;ation. Thus it came about that a Labour government introduced compulsory military training in Australia, a system which provided the necessary officers, and noncommissioned officers for the various units sent from the Commonwealth at the com mencement of the war. Hitherto it has been the proud boast of the Labour party that it was responsible for compulsory military training in this country. It was also the proud boast of the Labour party, led by the late
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline>
                        that Australia was in the war to the last man and the last shilling, and certain members of the party handed in a blank cheque on both those promises. It is interesting to recall what the present Prime Minister

                        said in the second-reading debate on the Defence Bill of 1910.  His  remarks are to be found on page 6218 of

                    <para>Let us now examine the situation and test the courage of the Prime Minister to-day. It is apparent that the Government did not contemplate making this drastic change immediately, as the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> is reported in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 26th October as having stated that -  . . No alteration in routine or policy would be made without careful consideration, and the advice of every responsible officer would be welcome. A definite defence policy has not yet been evolved by the Ministry. For the present, the existing conditions in the department would not be disturbed. . . . The Ministry has not discussed the abolition of military training, and it will be months before this question becomes a matter for discussion. When the more pressing problems have been dealt with, we will make a comprehensive review of the defence policy. </para>
                    <para class="block">Apparently that announcement was made by the Minister with the approval of the Government. The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> is also reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 29th October in the following way: - </para>

It is difficult to reconcile both statements. The Minister for Defence accepted full responsibility for the statement he made concerning the defence policy of the Government; but within three days his utterances were contradicted by a member of the party who is not a Minister. The opinion of the member of the Labour party which I have quoted is sufficient to show that the Government lias been influenced by the extremists in that party who have their minds always on Moscow, where, I may remind them, there is plenty of compulsion, particularly in the matter of military training. By administrative act the Government has suspended military training. Why has this course been adopted? </para>

                    <para>As it has been stated that compulsory military training is more costly than th: volunteer system, it is interesting to notethat in 1908-09, the last year in which provision was made for meeting the expenditure under the voluntary system, the amount provided on the Estimates under this heading was &#163;723,46% whereas for the year 1929-30 provision was made for the expenditure of &#163;1,428,271. In the earlier period which I mentioned, a citizen force establishment of 23,794, militia and volunteers, was provided for, whereas the citizen force establishment for 1929-30 is 50,000. Taking into consideration the decreased purchasing power of money, the &#163;1,428,271 which was recently provided for is equivalent to approximately &#163;900,000 in 190S-09. Considering that the citizen force is practically twice as strong as it was in 1908-09, it is clear that the compulsory system is less costly than the voluntary method, particularly when we remember that the present day organization is more complex and that it contains a larger percentage of specialized units and technical equipment, than was the case some years ago. Under the voluntary system the period of enlistment was for only three years, but not more than 50 per cent, of the men remained in the forces for- eighteen months. This meant in many cases that they were provided with uniforms which were used for only a few months. Attendances were irregular, and the time of the officers and instructional staff was too frequently taken up with parades of insufficient strength. There was, moreover, no regular turnover of men who could be regarded as reserves. Some of the enthusiasts remained in their units for long periods, and performed excellent service, but on the other hand, many others became ineffective after their first camp, when the novelty of soldiering had worn off. Further, under the compulsory system the men can be trained at places which are of strategic importance; it also provides a means of getting the men to attend parades. Some honorable senators who have served in the various units, will be able to speak of the excellent spirit that exists in the Citizen Forces. There has never been a larger number of officers and noncommissioned officers than there are at present; the total now exceeds 10,000. We have never had a larger number of trained officers and non-commissioned officers, and it is absolutely hopeless under the voluntary system to expect to get a sufficient number to keep the present organization going on a voluntary basis. If the Government think that it can do so, it will be disappointed. </para>

                        GLASGOW.I do not recall General Monash ever having made such a statement. There are in this chamber honorable senators with military service who will readily admit that it is anything but an expensive farce. Under the present system there is a regular intake of recruits and a regular output of men, who have undergone training in a systematic manner over a definite period at a minimum of cost. That the system is not ineffective is clearly shown by the results achieved during the Great War. The Naval Board reported that, from a naval viewpoint, the system proved the reverse of ineffective, and that after only three years experience of compulsory training the board in 1914 was able to mobilise the numbers required within 24 hours after the declaration of war. On the military side, it may be stated that the success obtained in the organization and training of the Australian Imperial Force was due largely to the existence of a scheme of universal training. At very short notice we were able to mobilise, organize and despatch overseas one division, and a light horse brigade, and these were followed shortly by another division and two light-horse brigades. About a year later we had at the front four infantry divisions and four light horse brigades. That was a wonderful achievement, when we consider that in Australia we had only a citizen force. It was possible only because we enjoyed the benefits of a compulsory military training system. In 1909, the number of officers was only 1,696, but in 1914 there were 3,449.It would be impossible to obtain that number of officers under the voluntary system. Anyone with experience will admit that the compulsory system is the more economic one. Statistics disclose that, under it, it costs only &#163;6 per year to clothe, pay, and train a man. No other system can approach it for economy.

                            <para>- I admit that; but much good would have accrued from such a consultation. I personally could have suggesteda method which would have given the voluntary system a chance: that of continuing the present system for three years, allowing the quota that had served two years to go out next year, the quota with one year&#39;s service to go out the following year, and that which had just been called up to go out the third year. Under such a plan and over that period the voluntary system could have been grafted on. to that which has been discarded, and it would have had a chance of success. Instead, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said, the Government tinkers with this matter as it has done with many others. It was in such haste to obey the ultimatum that it received from the extremists that it did not consider anybody, not even the Service. Honorable senators on this side keenly regret the action of the Government. This is a matter of high policy which should have been discussed in this chamber before action was taken. One can easily imagine what honorable senators opposite would have said had a Nationalist government followed a similar course. </para>

                        <para>The question of maintaining a separate organization for the Air Force having been brought under the notice of my Ministers by officers of the Defence Department, the Defence Committee was instructed to investigate and report to the Council of Defence. </para>

                    <para class="block">Who are the officers of the department who have brought the matter under the notice of Ministers? What a remarkable statement to record in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech! And no decision was arrived at by the council! Naturally, Australia cannot at present afford a large air force. That force may have a threefold role. It might be ordered to adopt an independent role, or it might be ordered to co-operate with the army or the navy. It is essential that we should have one co-ordinated Air Force. As the navy now exists that arm of the service would - require about fifteen planes. Surely the Government does not seriously contemplate the creation of a separate service with its own organization and training establishments to provide the necessary services for such a small number of planes? When I was Minister for Defence I went thoroughly into the problem and satisfied myself that the most economical way to train this arm to provide for our defence needs was to have one homogeneous air force. In the event of trouble it would be possible for such a force to play an independent role or to act in cooperation with the army or the navy. In the latter case, it would come under the orders of the commander of the army or the navy. I hope that the Government is not going to cut our diminutive Air Force into separate distinct entities for the army and the navy.

                        <para>My Ministers have, however, asked for a report on the possibilities -of co-ordinating the work of the Air Force with that of Civil Aviation </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The roles of the Air Force and Civil Aviation are absolutely different and distinct. In civil aviation the motto should be &#34; Safety first &#34;, and every pilot who flies a commercial plane should see that he adopts that motto. But a war-plane pilot is taught all sorts of evolutions in the air, as it is only by being expert in aerobatics that he has a chance of victory when he joins issue with an enemy plane. That is why one sees army pilots performing all sorts of evolutions in the air, apparently, to the uninitiated, for amusement. I do not think that it would be wise for the Government to amalgamate the functions of Civil Aviation with those of the Air Force. </para>
                    <para>Again, the late Nationalist Government always let contracts for the various civil aerial services and the establishment * of different air routes. This Government would be well advised to continue that policy. I suggest that before honorable senators opposite plunge into government enterprises they should take a trip te my State, Queensland, and inquire into the experiences of the State Labour Government in that regard. That information would be of considerable value not only to them, but to the Commonwealth, as it would save the community a very heavy and futile expenditure of public money. Civil aviation is merely another and a new means of transport, and I had contemplated advising the late Government to bring it under the administration of the Minister for Transport. I make the suggestion to the present Government, as it would enable them properly to coordinate the various means of transport. Just as we do not wish to see roads running in competition with railways, so we do not wish to see an air force competing where a very efficient and expeditious land service is already established. The Federal Nationalist Government established commercial air services over routes in the back country of Queensland and Western Australia, and from the latter State to the Eastern States, through Adelaide to Cootamundra and Melbourne. Not only did that policy assist civil aviation, but at the same time it enabled people in our remote centres to make contact with our more densely populated areas. I should like the Government to pause, before taking any further drastic action such as it has adopted in regard to defence. That step is a serious blow to Australia, and I am satisfied that before many years pass it will have to be retraced. </para>

                        <para>. - I have carefully perused the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, and have come to the conclusion that it is to be distinguished from all others which I have heard in this chamber by reason of the omissions from it. It is difficult to find in it one specific statement; where a subject is mentioned it is in the most vague and general terms. Apparently the Government is afraid to pin itself down to a. definite policy on any subject at all. For example, I have failed to find in the speech, the slightest reference to a matter which has been mentioned definitely in every other Governor-General&#39;s Speech since I entered this chamber: that of preference to returned soldiers. I ask the Government to define its attitude in that respect. Is it going to cast that principle overboard as it has done with many others? </para>

                            <para>- Even returned soldiers have to obey the law of the land. If they refused to work on the wharves naturally others had to take their place. However, I leave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> to settle that matter with his State authorities. The Federal Government did not employ those returned soldiers. I reiterate that my party has always consistently observed the principle of preference to returned men, and since it is reported that that vital principle has been abandoned I should like to have a statement one way or the other from the Leader of the Government in the Senate. If the Government intends to abandon the principle, where did it receive its mandate? </para>

                    <para>With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Glasgow, I regret exceedingly the abolition of compulsory military training. Can any honorable senator point to anything in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin&#39;s</inline> policy-speech which would give the slightest indication that it was the intention of the Labour party to abandon the principle of compulsory military training. The only mention of the subject of defence in his policy speech was the cryptic reference he made to the adequate defence of Australia which could he construed to mean anything from a regular army downwards? Of course, Ministers will say, &#34; We are merely suspending compulsory training. We do not propose to alter the act, and at any time it is open to any one. to restore compulsory training by a stroke of the pen.&#34; If Ministers are convinced of the necessity for this policy, let them bring in a bill to abolish compulsory military training. We are prepared to give them a chance to get a mandate from the people on it. It has been said here to-day that the Ministry consulted its experts before making this change of policy. The statement is absolutely incorrect. A public announcement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> to clear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Chauvel of the charge that otherwise might very well have been laid against them - that of having advised this change of policy. They made it very clear to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> that that must not on any account be said of them. Two of the greatest living soldiers to-day, who could have been consulted before this change of policy was brought about, were not consulted. </para>

                            <para>- It is their job to tell us how best to defend Australia. The only task the Government set them was to -find some sort of substitute for what had been abolished. I hope, therefore, honorable senators opposite will not endeavour to camouflage the issue and lay the blame on these experts in order to save their own skins. Why did not Ministers ask these distinguished military gentlemen for a straightout opinion as to the best way in which Australia could be defended? Had they done so they would have got a straightforward recommendation, and the Government could then have decided whether to follow it out or not. It is ray opinion that the nucleus we had could not be further reduced without paralysing its usefulness. We can, of course, decide to have one or two divisions. Ministers say that they propose to maintain five divisions, yet they cut down the nucleus to about half the number of men previously in training. It is a matter of impossibility. Our forces were cut to the bone before. <inline font-style="italic">i am</inline> awaiting with interest the full proposals of the Government. I am by no means a militarist. In my first term in Parliament I fought against the proposal of the then government to put trainees into camp for three months, and with the help of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I fought against the proposal to apply the provisions of the British Army Act to tha Australian forces in time of peace. My object has always been to ensure the adequate defence of Australia and I can assure honorable senators, with all my experience and reputation, that what the present Government proposes will not provide that adequate defence. </para>

                        has interjected that during the recent war, with a little training, Australia produced the finest soldiers in the world. Nothing could be further from the truth. I was a soldier during the Boer war and from the outbreak of the last war until its finish, and I can assure the honorable senator that he is totally incorrect. I enlisted in the first week of the Great &#34;War and was appointed to the command of a battalion at Broadmeadows. I had the pick of the officers and noncommissioned officers who came to us under the compulsory training system, and I was ordered to enlist trained men only. I was given the northern . district of Victoria in which to enlist them, and finding that I could not secure the requisite numbers of trained men there I enlisted any likely man that came along.  Colonel McCay  told me that I had not obeyed orders. I admitted that I had not done so, but asked to be given three weeks in which to train the men I had enlisted, and offered to discharge at the end of that time any man he could pick out as not having had previous ex perience. At the end of the three weeks,  Colonel McCay  had a parade, but he could not pick out one man who had not had previous training. He said to me, as honorable senators have said to-day, &#34; What is the use of our compulsory training? We spend thousands of pounds on it yet in three weeks you can produce men equal to those who have previously been trained.&#34; I replied that I could not have done it but for the fact that I had been given the choice of the experts to take charge of the untrained men. Nevertheless, those men were not even then to be regarded as soldiers. They had merely a veneer of the soldier. That was about the end of August. Steady training was continued until the middle of October, with drill every day and even at night. The men were drilled all the way to Egypt and when they arrived there on the 6th December they were drilled morning, noon and night in the desert until the following  April when we set off for Gallipoli and delivered the attack that made the name of Australia famous. Even then these men were not trained soldiers. Had they at that time acquired the absolute mastery of the art of war which they had gained by 1918 when I led them at Villiers-Brettouneux,  their casualties would have been nothing compared with what they were at the landing. They attempted to do things which in France they would have recognized as impossible or as requiring other means of achievement. They were the First Division, a body of absolutely picked men, the cream of Australia, whose appearance and intelligence were favourably commented &#39;upon by every one who came in contact with them, but at the end of nine months they were still raw. It is said by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline>
                        that war is becoming more scientific. Of course it is, but that does not mean that soldiers can do without training. *As a matter of fact it means that they require more training. The greatest advocate of a mechanized army,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Major Liddell</inline>
                        Hart, is of the opinion that by reason of the scientific training required all armies should now consist of regular soldiers.

                            <para>- Had it not been for the compulsory training of preceding years we could not have done what we did in the war. Australia&#39;s wonderful effort there was the result of the compulsory training system; the Australian Imperial Forces were the product of the compulsory training system. Had we attempted to bring a whole army into being at once, as the Americans did, we should have failed utterly. That country already had a regular army; its material was as good as ours; but they were entirely ignorant of the rudiments of war, even after fifteen months&#39; training in their own country. At the battle of Hamel they were sandwiched between our own men, and they performed magnificently; but later, when they went into action alone, they were not only defeated, but massacred. The men were the same as our own - they were good men - but they were untrained. We built up our force gradually, using the trained men to instruct the others. It was not done in a day, and, while we were training, the first volunteer army was sacrificed. The sacrifice of the &#34; Old Contemptibles &#34; saved civilization. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator knows how easy it is to create a false impression by a newspaper article. I have read the newspaper report of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash&#39;s remarks, and I know to what he referred. It is true that he said we did not have an army; but when the distinguished general said that he was referring to the policy of retaining the nucleus of an army instead of an army. He said that, as an army, that nucleus was useless ; but our finances at the time were such that we could not maintain more than a nucleus. I challenge the Leader of the Government to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash to compare the Government&#39;s new proposal with the system which  it supersedes. At the time when our soldiers were winning world-wide praise, the party to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> belongs declared publicly that it was folly to send any more Australians overseas, because the few thousand men that we could put into the field would not be more than as a spoonful  of water in the ocean compared with the vast masses already there. I do not say that the Australian soldiers won the war; but I refer with all modesty to the words of the great enemy general, Ludendorf, who said that it was the allied victory of the 8th August, 1918, which convinced him that Germany had lost the war. That victory was won by the Australians under <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash. The force under his control was greater than that which comprised the whole British Army at Waterloo. So great was the faith of the Allied leaders in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash that a force of Canadians equal to the Australian force in numbers was placed under his command. The Labour party at that time would have robbed the Allies of the momentous victory which the Australians won on that occasion. So long as Australia maintains even the nucleus of an army like that which fought in the late war, other nations will hesitate to challenge it; but, unfortunately, the Government has announced its intention to abolish the system which built up that army, and to substitute for it something which might in future bring the Australian soldier into contempt. While every officer of the force will do his best to make a success of the new scheme, that success will not be attained unless the Government itself urges the citizens of this country to fill the empty ranks, and make the army a live concern. The Labour party, however, contains men who would leave Australia defenceless. </para>

                            <para>- The- reason for the Government&#39;s proposal is difficult to understand, seeing that it has admitted that it is not made on the ground of economy. Indeed, it proposes to spend even more money, not on schools of instruction, but on what are comparative frills. It will provide prettier uniforms for the volunteers. Should the men of Scottish extraction insist on being provided with kilts, the additional expense will be considerable. If the Government and its supporters were frank, they would admit that they have no desire whatever to take any part in the defence of the Empire. One would think that the United States of America, being separated by many miles of sea from any possible enemy, would not build up any considerable military force, but that country is not adopting that policy.  President  Hoover has been enthusiastically quoted as a leading exponent of the doctrine that countries, such as Australia, can purchase immunity from invasion by disarming, and so shaming warlike neighbours into disarming, too.  His  Armistice Day speech shows that he does not share this infatuation. He said - </para>

                        <para>The world is at peace, but it is an armed peace. Including active reserves there are nearly 10,000,000 more men under arms than there were at the outbreak of the war in 1914, and there are fears, distrusts and smouldering injuries amongst the nations which are the tinder of war. Nor does anything in human experience warrant the assumption that war cannot occur again. We must reduce and limit warships by agreement only. I have no faith in reduction of armaments by example alone. Until the nations can build agencies for the pacific settlement of disputes on stronger foundations, until fear has been proved groundless by long proof of international honesty, until the power of world public opinion as a restraint of aggression has had many years&#39; test, there will not have been established that confidence which warrants the abandonment of preparedness for defence amongst the nations. To do so may invite war. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so; but I have no doubt that the people of the United States of America have some basis for their fear. And who is to say that one day that country will not deem it expedient to invade Australia? Prior to the war the United States of America possessed 10 dreadnoughts, 23 cruisers, 42 destroyers, and 23 submarines. Last year, despite the Washington naval agreement, that country had 18 dreadnoughts, 32 cruisers, 262 destroyers, and 122 submarines - an enormous increase on the pre-war figures. It has a regular army of 134,500 men and 180,000 militia. It proposes to raise the latter figures to 435,000. In addition, it has 112,000 in the reserve officers&#39; training corps, comprising university graduates and other highly-educated men who, after their ordinary military training, are placed in a special reserve. </para>

I invite him now to say with what country are we keeping pace. I heard some reference to Denmark&#39;s proposal to disarm. On that subject I addressed a question to the honorary minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> today, and I was told that the official information will be obtained for me. In the course of my military duties I get information of this nature and I know that the Government of Denmark never proposed to dispense entirely with its army. Although it intends to abolish compulsory military training, it will retain its 25,000 regular troops at their full strength. We should remember also that Denmark has an area about equal to that of Gippsland in Victoria, or the Federal Capital Territory, and I suggest that a regular army of 25,000 men is ample for its defence. </para>

This country offers a much richer prize for an aggressor nation. It would appear from its declaration of policy, that if Great Britainbecame involved in war, the aim of the present Government would be to maintain neutrality in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Well, that is a useful admission to have. When we went away at the outbreak of the war, the party which the honorable senator is now supporting declared that Australia was in the war to the last man and the last shilling. We left Australia with that promise ringing in our ears, but when we were almost at our last gasp a certain section of the Labour party failed to live up to its promise. Disguise it as they may, the Government and its supporters are under the domination of the Red Internationale, which regards Great Britain as its greatest foe. At present the Red Internationale is raising a revolt among the natives in South Africa and is doing its best to cause trouble in India. It is endeavouring to white ant the British Empire in the hope that one day it will tumble down in ruins, and it seems that this Government is prepared to give these enemies of our Empire its full support. My career as a soldier is rapidly coming to a close, and I do not wish to see Australia&#39;s sons with naked hands in the face of some enemy. Possibly a son of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> may one day be in that unhappy position. </para>

                    <para>I turnnow to another interesting subject - the statement that southern Europeans are allowed to come to Australia to take work which should be given  to Australians, and I propose to show that they are not doing this country any dis-service. In the Gippsland district of Victoria a vast area of fertile hills country was abandoned during the war, because of the inroads of rabbits and the spread of the bracken fern. When our boys came back from the war, those who in the ordinary course would have returned to farms in the hills districts of Gippsland and the Otway Ranges, realized that the country could be reclaimed only as the result of a tremendous expenditure of labour. Furthermore, they were attracted to the city  by  the illusion of high wages and short working hours, so they drifted off the land, and hundreds of thousands of acres  of  fertile farm areas were abandoned. To-day southern Europeans are taking up those lands. They are hard at work clearing the country of bracken and rabbits, and are converting the holdings into productive settlements. These men are not depriving anyone of a job, but are only undertaking pioneering work which others who have sought easier conditions in the cities have declined to do. They carry on their task from early morning until nightfall, and are assisted by their womenfolk, just as are many rural workers in France and Italy </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and for that reason there is no justification for condemning them. I attended school with sons of southern Europeans, some of whom fought in the Australian Imperial Forces overseas. They are good Australian citizens and we should welcome them, particularly as many of them are developing land which others have neglected and in doing so are endeavouring to secure an honest livelihood for themselves and their families. When these diligent men are. reclaiming a wilderness and are not interfering with  anyone,  why should we term them &#34; dagoes &#34; ? Their sons will make just as good men as the present Treasurer who, believe, is of the same descent. Men  should  be encouraged to take up this work. </para>

                            <para>- Award rates do not come into the question, as they are working on their own account just as&#39; are other rural settlers who are operating in a small way in other parts of the Commonwealth. I am not in favour of men being sweated; but men of this type who are assisting the development of this country should be encouraged. </para>

                            <para>- In most -cases, I understand, they have taken up abandoned farms, and in providing for themselves are also rendering a very useful service to the community. It is wrong to assume that every southern European who comes to this&#39; country is a competitor in the labour market, because many of them are undertaking &#39; work which our own people will not tackle. I am sorry that the Government has submitted such a meagre legislative programme, and in conclusion point out that it is somewhat difficult to learn from the Governor-General&#39;s Speech what measures the Ministry actually intends to introduce. </para>
