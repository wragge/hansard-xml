          <para>. - When the Senate last met, I was suffering a disability, and consequently did not have the opportunity to congratulate you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> on your assumption of the high office that you now occupy. Had I been present I should, of course, have done so; but I cannot accommodate myself to the vicissitudes of fortune, and I therefore take this opportunity to congratulate you upon your election. The high office that you hold is the creation of the Senate, and that being so, the Senate looks upon it with jealous eyes and with a desire to preserve in all respects its rights and dignity. If I may say so, there is one direction in which I am sure you will exercise all your t.nlents in the future. There are in this country at present some who have no admiration for the Senate, and it will necessarily fall to your lot, sir, as its presiding officer, to take up the cudgels on its behalf, and, together with honorable senators generally, see that it does not suffer either in regard to its reputation or its work. It is within the knowledge of honorable senators that some time ago the power of the Senate was challenged, and that this . deliberative assembly, under its constitutional authority, threw down the gage of battle. The matter was brought before the electors, ft was then found that' those institutions that challenged the authority of this chamber were wrong and that the Senate was right. That fact alone is sufficient to embolden us in the belief that this chamber is still the true exponent of popular feeling in this country. It is founded as firmly as the British House of Commons, and critics who so freely unthinkingly or unwittingly attack an institution like this, which is the people's own creation, had better be on their guard, since the Senate will always be ready with a reply to them. I feel that it is unnecessary for me to do more than mention this, as I am confident that while you occupy your present office you will always see that the good name and reputation of the Senate are jealously preserved. </para>
