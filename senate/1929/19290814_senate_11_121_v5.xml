The position of  President  of the Senate is a high, honorable and responsible one, and I approach it with a full sense of the responsibilities that attach to it. I hope that I may be able always to keep intact the rights and privileges of honorable senators and to preserve the dignity of the Chamber.

          <para>&#91;3.22&#93;.- -On behalf of honorable senators on this side of the chamber, I desire, sir, to extend to you our congratulations on the honour that has been conferred upon you by the Senate in electing you as its  President.  The position, as you have said, is one of grave responsibility and great dignity. We recognize that it is our duty as senators to assist you to discharge the obligations of your position, and to uphold the dignity of the Senate by bowing to your decisions and by cooperating with you in the observance of the Standing Orders. I trust that during your term of office, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> you will have the help of every honorable senator, and feel sure that your interpretation of the Standing Orders will be conducive to the efficient discharge of public business. </para>

        <para>SenatorDALY (South Australia) &#91;3.23&#93; . -On behalf of the members of the Opposition I desire to convey to you,- sir, our congratulations upon your election to the presidential chair. I endorse everything that has been said by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> but I feel that some explanation is necessary as to why there was no other nomination for the position. </para>
        <para class="block">In the first place it is &#39; recognized that our numbers on this side of the chamber are small and for that reason we could not afford to nominate one of our members for the office of  President.  Another reason is that it was common knowledge that ministerial supporters had unanimously decided to support your election. Concerning that decision we have no complaint to make. There was no personal feeling in the minds of members of the Opposition concerning any of the three ministerial candidates for the position; any one of them would have been equally acceptable to us. We congratulate you, sir, on being the elect of your party. We recognize that on the floor of the chamber you were a faithful supporter of the Government, and for that support you were selected by your party for the very high and honorable position&#39; to which you have just been elected by the Senate. I assure you that during your term of office the Opposition will do everything it can to enable you to achieve the ideals at which you aim. You will receive our loyal support and we feel confident that you will carry out your duties with absolute impartiality. On behalf of the Opposition I sincerely and heartily congratulate you on your election. </para>
        <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon. W. Kingsmill)</inline> &#91;3.25&#93;. - I thank honorable senators for their kind wishes and for the promises of support which I have been accorded. </para>

With some trepidation, I venture to repeat the hoary chestnut that has been so frequently heard in various parliaments: that we trust that they may long continue to adorn those positions. In British Parliamentary procedure the Leader of the Opposition has a very important function to perform, and I am confident that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> will exercise his undoubted gifts in the performance of his duties. I trust that, in our respective capacities, we shall be successful in preserving the high standard of debate that has characterized the proceedings of the Senate in the past and that, in differing, we may do so impersonally. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> that he will receive from the Government and its supporters that consideration which is the right of the Leader of the Opposition, even though he is representing a minority. The rights of minorities should be respected, and I hope that the time will never come when in a British Parliament a minority will be denied an opportunity to state its case. </para>
