                    <para>.- On Friday last I made some reference to the industrial trouble on the northern coal-fields of New South Wales. It is gratifying to honorable senators to learn that as a result of negotiations during the week-end there is every likelihood of a settlement of that dispute. I am sure we all hope that these negotiations will lead to a lasting peace in the industry. I cannot, however, let the occasion pass without drawing attention to the way in which the unfortunate coal-miners have been misled during the last -five or sis months. Months ago they could have obtained terms of settlement, even better than those they are now likely to secure. But they were told to wait until a Labour Government was in power, and they would get better terms. No more dastardly form of conducting an election campaign could have been adopted. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Those who were responsible for these statements, including the political leaders of the miners themselves, were fully aware of the constitutional limitations of the Commonwealth with regard to the control of industry. They must have known that it would be in the interests of the miners to accept the terms, offered previously, but for political purposes the men were gulled into the belief that if they held out long enough they would be able to exact better terms. Consequently they were kept out of employment for many months longer than was necessary. For this state of affairs I blame <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> the present Treasurer, and other leaders of the Labour party in New South Wales. It is disgraceful that any party should adopt such tactics for the purpose of securing votes. I sincerely trust that, as the outcome of the recent developments, we are about to enter upon an era of peace not only in the coal-mining industry of New South Wales, but in industry generally throughout the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>I wish now to refer to the Government&#39;s proposal to abolish compulsory military training. I recognize that there may have been many defects in the manner in which compulsory training was carried out, but no fault could be found with the system itself. It is, I believe, generally&#39; conceded that it does not take long to- knock the average infantryman into shape. </para>

                        <para>- Practically the whole of the First Division, which was regarded as the flower of the Australian forces, were men who had previous military training, and nearly all of them were recruited from the ranks of our citizen forces. The original Seventh Battery, of which I was a member, was officered entirely by men who had had experience in the citizen forces, and I believe that 90 per cent, of the battery were citizen force men who enlisted <inline font-style="italic">en masse.</inline> The compulsory system for the training of our citizen forces in operation at the outbreak of the war laid the foundation for the building up of that magnificent body of men known as the Australian Imperial Forces. Now that the Government has decided to abolish compulsory military training, I am afraid it will be difficult to provide for the adequate defence of the Commonwealth, especially as regards the technical units. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> that in my reference to the infantry  I had no desire to belittle the glorious work which our infantry did during the war. All I wished to do was to emphasize that time is required for the efficient training of artillerymen, engineers and other technical units; that a considerable term of apprenticeship is necessary before men comprising such units are fit to take the field. I trust; therefore, that if the voluntary system does not prove satisfactory the Government will reconsider its decision and revert to the compulsory training of our citizen forces. Though the Government&#39;s proposal may be regarded as a fine gesture of peace, it appears to me to be dangerous for Australia to be first among the nations to put into force this policy of world disarmament. The previous Government, I remind the Senate, was always prepared to meet other nations in conference to consider this important matter, and it did not incur unnecessary expenditure for defence purposes. What is the position in other countries? Our friends of the Labour party would have us believe that the spirit of- militarism is absent in Russia, where the spirit of social reform, so we are told, is so much in evidence. During the week end I read with interest an article in the <inline font-style="italic">National Review</inline> written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Baker White concerning the war policy of the Soviet Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. White</inline> states - </para>

                    <para>The war policy of the Soviet Government may be divided into four sections -the building up of the armed forces in Russia; propaganda to produce the war atmosphere at home and abroad; war plotting abroad; and espionage. With regard to the first there are some striking details and figures available as to the recent increases in all branches of the armed forces in Russia. During the past two years the Soviet Government has been engaged in adding to the Red Army, which was reduced to a paper strength of 562,000, an enormous militia. Military service has been made compulsory for all men in good health, the periods of service comprising pre-military instruction at 19 and 20 years of age, active service from 21 to 25, and service in the reserve from 26 to 40. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">From this it is evident that every Russian subject is compelled to render military service for 21 years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. White</inline> goes on to say - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The pro-military instruction is given to 842,000 youths in 4,500 centres, the permanent army trains about 270,000 men each year, and the mobile territorial organizations a further 600,000 men. Russia is, therefore, giving effective military training to more than 870,000 men a year, and competent military experts have estimated that in the event of war the Red rulers would have at their disposal more than 10,000,000 men who had received military training. </para>
                    <para>Large numbers of women are also being enrolled as Red Army auxiliaries, not only as nurses and canteen workers, but as operatives in the aviation and chemical warfare departments. Moreover, under the Soviet Military Service Act, in time of war all women between the ages of 19 and 40 are liable to compulsory service. Every effort is being made to equip this vastly increased army. The arsenals have been reorganized and, at present, are the most active section of the heavy industries; more preparations are in progress for chemical warfare, in its most horrible forms, than in any other country in the world; and militarist clubs, such as &#34;Friends of the Air Fleet&#34; and the &#34; Friends of Chemical Defence,&#34; have been formed in all parts of the country. Particularly striking are the figures of the Soviet purchases of high-grade refined nitrate, used exclusively for the production of explosives. At the end of 1927, <inline font-style="italic">The Times</inline> reported that 50,000 tons had been bought from Chile during the year, while negotiations were in progress for more. In 1926, Russia&#39;s purchases only amounted to about 2,000 tons, and in prewar days to 12,000 to 15,000 tons a year. It is disquieting to note that the financing of this huge purchase of nitrate was arranged in Berlin. </para>
                    <para>The Soviet Air Force is also steadily increasing in strength and efficiency by reason of extensive purchases of aeroplanes from Germany and elsewhere. Special funds are repeatedly raised among the Russian workers for the purchase of battle-planes, and the slogan of the Osoaviakhim (Air and Chemical Defence Society ) is : &#34; Every town must have its own aeroplane and aerodrome.&#34; In the field of commercial aviation, which in Russia is part and parcel of the military machine, there is also great activity. According to an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Pravda</inline> of July 8th, the following air lines are in operation: - &#34;(1) Two Western European lines, Moscow to Berlin, via Riga, and Leningrad to Riga, worked by the society &#39; Derluft,&#39; in which the great German air concern Lufthansa plays a considerable part. &#34;(2) TheUkranian air-way, uniting Moscow, via Kharkov, Piatigorsk, and Baku to Pehlevi in Persia. Here the German concern again enters into the picture, as it operates a line from Baku to Enzeli, Teheran, and so to Bouchir on the Persian Gulf, and another line from Teheran to Meched, Merv, and Bokhara. &#34; (3) The middle-Asia group, operated by the &#39; Dobrolet &#39; society, the most important section of which is the line BakuKrasnovodskKhivaBokharaTashkentTermez, and so to Kabul. It is thus possible to get from one of the Soviet aerodromes in Asiatic Russia to the gateway of India in six or seven hours. &#34;(4) The air system connecting Verhnedinsk with Ulan-Bator, the capital of the Mongolian Republic, and Irkutsk with Yakutsk.&#34; </para>
                    <para>At present the Soviet air services cover some 11,427 kilometres, and plans are on foot for covering 30,000 kilometres, as soon as possible. On March 17th last, that well-informed French journal, <inline font-style="italic">L&#39; Illustration,</inline> publisheda striking article and chart on the SovietcumGerman air activities in the Middle East, and pointed out that more than one Soviet aerodrome is well within striking distance of that vital link, the Suez Canal. A study of the chart proved this, and showed the extraordinary strategic significance of the&#34; Red air activity. </para>
                    <para>The extent of Russia&#39;s military preparations can, perhaps, be best gauged from the size of the military Budget, which increased from 244 million gold roubles in 1922-23 to 720 million gold roubles in 1926-27, and these figures do not include expenses for barracks, which are borne by the local budgets. </para>

No honorable senator wishes to see Australia in the throes of another war such as that which a few years ago convulsed the world ; but we shall leave ourselves open to grave dangers if, in the interests of economy, our defences are weakened. I feel sure, that however eager the people of Australia may be for economy in administration, they do not want Australia to be left defenceless. I am no advocate of extravagance in administration ; but I claim that we should deal in a commonsense way with matters of disarmament and defence.

Notwithstanding that the object of the Labour party is the nationalization of industry, I trust that the Government will be guided by the experience of both State and Commonwealth Governments in connexion with State enterprises. Before the Commonwealth Shipping line was disposed of, it cost the taxpayers of this country about &#163;750,000 a year. Whenever governments in Australia have launched out in enterprises of this nature, the result has always been a loss to the taxpayers. </para>

                        <para>- That- is an untimely interjection. If .the honorable senator refers to the disposal of the Commonwealth steamers, I remind him that they were sold; at what at the time, was full market price. The same remark applies also to the disposal of the State cattle stations in Queensland. It is true that those stations were sold for less than they cost; but that was because the purchase price was ridiculously high. Any station-owner would be glad to dispose of his holdings on terms similar to those made by the Queensland Labour Government. If there is any scandal in connexion with those cattle stations, it is that their former owners became wealthy by their sale. Australia&#39;s experience in the nationalization of industries has been such that I hope the Government will not embark on further State enterprise. Australia is not the only country which has made the colossal plunder of engaging in State-owned shipping enterprises. The United States of America and Canada have also experienced very heavy losses in the same way. It is infinitely better to allow those who have a knowledge of shipping to carry on the business than for governments to endeavour to engage in such trading enterprises. </para>

                <para>I wish now to refer to the unfair position which has arisen in connexion with the introduction of a new tariff schedule. This is not a party matter. A  similar  position arises whenever a new tariff schedule is brought down. An overseas vessel loaded with a valuable cargo of merchandise, having completed the discharge of a portion of her cargo at Sydney, leaves to complete discharge at Brisbane; but, after her departure from Sydney, and before her arrival in Brisbane, a new tariff schedule may be tabled, with the result that consignees at Brisbane are compelled to pay, in some instances, a much higher duty than the Sydney consignees. That places the Brisbane business people at a great disadvantage. I believe an understanding was once given by a Minister for Trade and Customs that an effort would be made to place this matter on a more equitable basis. It would seem reasonable to provide that when an overseas vessel has once reported at any branch of the Customs Department, the ship&#39;s cargo shall not be subject to higher duties consequent upon the introduction of an amended tariff schedule before the discharge is completed. Under the present circumstances, consignees at certain Australian ports are placed at a great disadvantage. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Allen, when speaking in Brisbane quite recently, said that on a certain quantity of cotton piece goods duty to the amount of &#163;235 was collected in Sydney, but on a similar quantity of material from the same shipment &#163;341 was collected in </para>

                    referred to the proposed suspension of the issue of licenses under the Transport Workers Act, which is a subject of great importance to the Queensland people, particularly as, during the past twelve months, there has been more industrial peace on the waterfront in Queensland than there has been for many years. During the cane-crushing season there is usually a good deal of industrial unrest on the waterfront, particularly at Cairns, Townsville, Bowen and Mackay; but, since the licensing system has been in operation, there has been an almost entire absence of industrial trouble. The primary producers and residents of North Queensland generally view with alarm the proposal of the Government to dispense with the licensing system. When in Bowen a few weeks ago, I was informed that, under the Transport Workers Act, there had not only been continuity of employment ; but a considerable reduction
                    <inline font-style="italic">in</inline>
                    the cost of handling cargo on the waterfront. A stevedoring company at Townsville also announced quite recently that, owing to the continuity of operations and the expeditious manner in which cargo was now being handled, the company was able to reduce handling costs, which is of great advantage to the primary producer.
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Extension of time granted.&#93;</inline>
                    I have been assured by many of those engaged in the industry that since the present system has been in operation there has been a marked improvement, not only at the ports where licences are issued, but also in those which are operating under the old system. In ports where the licensing system has not been applied the militant element now recognize that if there is any unreasonable delay or undue interference that system, may be introduced at those ports. Generally  speaking, the  conditions on the waterfront in Queensland during the past twelve or fifteen months are infinitely better than they have been for many years. As the wool-growers, sugar cane growers, millers and storekeepers and residents generally have  derived wonderful benefit from the licensing system, I earnestly hope the Government will not institute a change which may have the effect of bringing about general industrial disorder.

                <para class="block">One paragraph of the Governor-General&#39;s Speech states that immediate steps will be taken to amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. In reading that statement one would almost imagine it to have been made by the late Government, because it has been the policy of the Nationalist Government for the last six or seven years to amend that act so as to make it more workable and equitable. The late Government, when amending the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, was told by the members of the Labour party that it was trying to interfere with our industrial legislation in order to reduce wages and to lower the conditions of the workers. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> and his followers are well aware, that the limitations placed upon the Commonwealth Government under the Constitution make it impossible for us to make the Arbitration Act really workable. In spite of that, we were &#34;bitterly attacked inside and outside of this chamber when we tried to improve our industrial legislation. The Prime Minister himself has said that he does not believe altogether in the principle of arbitration. He preferred round table conferences between employers and employees to bring about a settlement of disputes. That is the. very thing that honorable senators on this side have been preaching for years. Yet, when we endeavoured to remove the duplication and overlapping of Federal and State industrial awards, the Labour party misrepresented the position to the people to such an extent as to bring about the overthrow of the late Government and the return to power of the Labour party. Fortunately, the people have already recognized that, in voting for the Labour candidates at the last election, they made a grave mistake. That is shown by the fact that at the Victorian elections, last Saturday, the votes cast for the anti-Labour forces were far in excess of those cast for the Labour party. It is very gratifying to us to know that, even within a few weeks, the people of Victoria have recognized that they were misled as to the real issue of the recent federal election. </para>
                <para>The people are being burdened with additional taxation, and under the new tariff the cost of living is likely to be increased. This Government has repeatedly stated that it proposes to reduce imports into this country so as to encourage Australian manufacturers. With that principle every senator on this side is in hearty accord, provided, of course, that it does not interfere with the export trade in our primary products. This Government, which is pledged to economy, is proposing to expend, during its first year of office, &#163;600,000 more than the expenditure set out in the budget of the late Government. The Treasurer is relying on his budget to bring in an additional customs revenue of &#163;1,200,000. Yet, at the same time, he is gulling the people by tolling them that he is going to reduce the imports into this country. One thing is a complete contradiction of the other. I trust the Government will not continue the propaganda with which it deceived the unfortunate coal-miners of New South Wales, who were told that, under a Labour Government, peace and prosperity would return to. the coal-mining districts. I trust that as the session proceeds, and as the members of the Government gain more experience, they will realize their sense of responsibility to the community and cease to try to make good fellows of themselves by making rash promises which they are fully aware can never hp carried out. </para>

I regret the passing of the Bruce-Page Government, because of its sincere efforts to further the interests of the Commonwealth, and particularly the country districts. Western Australia has suffered a great deal under federation, so also have Tasmania and South Australia, and they afford a striking instance of the failure of federal legislation, because so early in our history, no less than three States - those with the smallest populations - have to receive disability grants contributed mainly by the richer States of the Commonwealth to enable them to function properly. </para>

                        <para>- I oppose it wholeheartedly. During the election campaign I found that the people in the outlying parts of Western Australia were of the firm opinion that the best new? from Canberra was no news at all. I am one of those who regret that the effect of federal legislation has been to create this anti-federal feeling in the smaller States. It seems to me that benefit or suffering has come upon the members of the federation according to their geographical situation. That is to say, States close to the Seat of Government or having a large population, have benefited, while those with small populations and further removed from the Seat of Government, have suffered, Western Australia being the greatest sufferer because it is furthest removed from the federal capital. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>It is true, however, that the Bruce Page Government displayed a certain measure of practical sympathy with the outlying members of the federation that had not previously been extended to them, and gave evidence of its desire to assist them by the appointment of commissions to inquire into the disabilities suffered by Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. The independent and impartial tribunal which inquired into the position of Western Australia had as its <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr. Higgs,</inline> an ex-Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and it recommended the payment of an annual grant of &#163;450,000 to the State. We received that full amount for one year, but for the following three years the grant has been reduced to &#163;300,000, two thirds of the amount recommended by the commission. In the meantime, and particularly during the months in which a Labour Government has been in power in the Commonwealth, the disabilities of Western Australia have been enormously increased. Although the States would be pleased to have increased grants I think they would prefer a fairer deal by the removal of the causes of the disabilities they suffer. It stands to the credit of the Bruce-Page Government that it made an effort, belated though it was, to deal with the vicious circle created in Australia by the imposition of high customs duties. We all recognize that a higher tariff means higher industrial awards, with consequent higher prices and higher cost of living, and that a higher cost of living leads to still higher industrial awards. Unemployment is always lurking in the background of that vicious circle, increasing at a faster rate than the cost of living. It follows, therefore, that the higher the cost of living the more unemployment there is; every increase in customs duties leads to an increase in the cost of living and production and. thus greater unemployment is brought about. </para>
                <para>The Bruce-Page Government, before its defeat, had begun to realize that the false economic position which had arisen in Australia was due largely to the operation of the tariff, the overlapping of State and Federal arbitration awards and the provisions of the Navigation Act. It came very properly to the decision that federal arbitration should be abandoned. We know the result when the matter was put before the people, mixed up as it was with taxation of picture shows and a number of other side issues. It is significant, however, that three Governments, those led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher, Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr-. Bruce,</inline> have asked the people by direct referendum to give the Commonwealth Parliament additional power over industrial affairs and the people have always said &#34;No,&#34; with a very loud voice. On the last occasion the Labour leaders in the State arena in Western Australia were foremost in advising them to say &#34; No.&#34;  In my opinion they were right in doing so. </para>
                <para>Belatedly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> also began an economic investigation into the operation of the tariff, and he promised a proper scientific revision of our protection policy, which, while perhaps giving more adequate protection to key secondary industries would also ensure that the great primary industries of the Commonwealth, which are also key industries, should not. suffer from the pronouncedly grievous burdens imposed on them by a high tariff. He also promised a review of the operation of the coasting trade provisions of the Navigation Act, with a view to their abolition, so that the primary producers of Australia might obtain cheaper freights, and the people of the Commonwealth might travel from one point to another on our vast coastline in British vessels employing white labour. This they are not permitted to do at present. If a person chooses to pay for a trip from Fremantle to New Zealand, he may travel on an overseas mail steamer from Fremantle to Melbourne or Sydney so long as he does not ask for a refund in respect of the portion of the journey which he does not take beyond either port. But that, of course, is too heavy an expenditure for a great many of the people of Australia who wish to travel from one part of the Commonwealth to another. </para>
                <para>There is no doubt that during the last election campaign the very sound policy of the Bruce-Page Government in regard to these existing burdens on the people of Australia, was misconstrued and misrepresented as an attack on the wages of the workers. Not one of its proposals could be so interpreted. On the contrary a sound economic industrial policy would give the workers better wages and a better purchasing power, just as the workers in United States of America and Canada have a greater purchasing power with the higher wages they receive. </para>

                <para>The people of the Commonwealth were evidently not ready for the change the Bruce-Page Government asked them to face. The Australian democracy was not quite prepared to make an apparent sacrifice, which would really amount to an advantage, but I think, already the conviction is growing that the Bruce-Page Government was right in the steps it was taking in regard to these three important burdens on the community. </para>
                <para>I was not a member of the party led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> but I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the loyalty he displayed to the agreement he made with the Country party. The Government that carried on the administration of Australia for something like seven years, was formed of Nationalists and members of the Country party, and I must say that throughout the whole of that period, the former were always fair and square in their relations to the Country party. The Government did not do all the Country party wished it to do, but I am satisfied that the best results from the point of view of the people generally can only be obtained by co-operation between the Nationalists and the Country party in the administration of the affairs of Australia. </para>
                <para>I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> Vice-President of the Executive Council, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> upon attaining the high and honorable positions which they occupy in this chamber.  Their Government has been elected by the people, and it seems to me that any legislation it submits is entitled to our fair consideration. I shall, therefore, be pleased to assist Ministers in the conduct of business in the Senate, but it will be my duty, I anticipate, to oppose a good deal of the legislation brought forward. I am sure that honorable senators will not forget that the Senate is a chamber of review, and also a chamber for the protection of the rights of the individual States. In these circumstances, therefore, I need i &#62; express the hope that there will be ne factious opposition to the Government in this chamber. The new Government will be judged by the people by the legislative fruit it produces, hut the crop in sight so far, I cannot help thinking, must be disappointing to a great many of the supporters of Labour who carried it so enthusiastically to victory at the polls on the 12th October last. </para>
                <para>Let me take as an example the very first action of the Government, which I regard as a blow at the prestige of the Senate. This is the more democratic chamber of the federal legislature, because honorable senators are elected by the whole of the people of their respective States on the most democratic franchise in the world. Yet we find that whereas under the late Government four Ministers were regarded as necessary to handle the legislation brought into this chamber, the majority of whose members were all sympathetic with the administration of the day, to-day the new Labour Government has only two Ministers in the Senate. Thus two men are to do all that four capable and industrious men found -a difficult task. The plank in the platform of the Labour party, &#34; one man one job,&#34; has been absolutely violated in these appointments. That each Minister in the Senate should be called upon to do two men&#39;s work I regard as an insult to the Senate, particularly when we know that we have in the Senate Labour men more capable than some of those in another place who have been elected to ministerial rank. The fact that we have only seven members of the Labour party in this chamber seems to me to be a good reason why we should have at least four Ministers. It is an easy matter for Labour Ministers in another place to get their measures through that chamber. They have a big majority behind them, and if a bill has been fully considered and decided upon in caucus, it should pass through another place quite easily, even without full explanation.. But in this chamber, where there are only seven Labour members out of 36, it will be absolutely necessary for every item of legislation to be properly explained,  which seems to me to be a fairly good reason why the full number of Ministers should have been retained. </para>
                <para>The Government is grossly overworking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> by allotting to them a task which was previously undertaken by four active and industrious Ministers. Of course, there is a reason for it, a straight out reason to be found in the Labour platform. &#34;We all know that the Labour party aims at the abolition of the Senate, and, with the object of vesting complete legislative authority in. the central government, is in favour of delegating to the provincial governments only such powers as the central government might deem fit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> in the course of his speech last week, strongly advocated unification in accordance with that plank in the platform of his party. That, I submit, would be a complete repudiation of the federal bond. The States of &#34;Western Australia and Tasmania, for certain, would never have entered the federation, but for the fact that the form of government contemplated offered complete protection in the form of equal representation in the Senate to every State without regard to its population.  Yet now we have one of the great political parties in the Commonwealth, only 29 years since the consummation of federation, treating the Constitution as a scrap of paper, by advocating the abolition of the Senate. We may, however, take comfort in the thought that, before such a drastic alteration can be effected, the government responsible for the proposal must secure the approval, not only of a majority of electors in the Commonwealth, but also in a majority of the States. And this, I venture to say, will never be obtained. </para>

                        <para>- I should not have complained but for the action of the Government in reducing the number of Ministers in this &#39; chamber. This policy, in my opinion, has been adopted to belittle the importance of this branch of the legislature with a view to its ultimate abolition in the terms of one of the planks of the Labour party&#39;s plat form. Therefore, from the States&#39; point of view, it is important that the sovereign rights at present enjoyed by them should not be impaired in any way. Under the existing Constitution, the States have wide powers, and are able to administer all local and domestic affairs far better and more economically than would be possible by the Commonwealth Government from Canberra. The State Governments are responsible for administration of Crown lands, land settlement, railway construction, education, police, and nearly the whole of the domestic services affecting the every-day life of their people. The Federal Government should confine its attention to those legislative powers entrusted to it under the Constitution, and not seek in any way to interfere with the sovereign rights of the States. The people of Australia deliberately chose the federal system of government in preference to unification, and I sincerely trust that the sovereign powers enjoyed by the States will long be retained by them. </para>

                <para>I turn now to the Government&#39;s proposal to abolish compulsory military training. One reason for federation was the. need to provide for the adequate defence of the Commonwealth. It was felt by the people that this important function should be entrusted to the government of the nation. Though we may differ in our views upon party politics, we are all agreed that the security of the Commonwealth should be our first consideration. I am sorry, therefore, that this Government&#39;s first action was to abolish compulsory military training as one step in the direction of  destroying the splendid system of defence initiated by the late Andrew Fisher and the Labour Ministry of his day. Also, I regret exceedingly that, before taking this drastic action, -the Government did not consult the Council of Defence . Evidently the Labour party of to-day is animated by changed ideals, since it has deliberately set about to destroy the temple of national safety erected by a former Labour Ministry. </para>

                <para>As a layman, I believe it is necessary to instruct our young people to use . the rifle. This task will be rendered the more difficult if it is left till they reach the age of maturity. We have indisputable evidence that the physical training and discipline afforded under the compulsory system have been of inestimable value to the youth of Australia, and I am assured, upon high expert authority, that in the Australian Imperial Forces&#39; training camps _ the value of the initial training in military drill was demonstrated to a very marked degree. It is not in keeping with the sentiment of the people of Australia that the Commonwealth should urge the Government of Great Britain to continue with the work on the Singapore naval base, which is so essential to our safety and defence, and at the same time destroy the well proved system of instilling the first principles of military defence into the manhood of Australia. What does the Government propose to set up in its place ? I have given this subject a great deal of thought, and I know of nothing that can quite take the place of that physical training, which, hitherto, our young men have received under the compulsory system. It has occurred to me, and I offer it as a suggestion to the Government, that the boy scout movement might be subsidized with the idea of making it more attractive. Whatever is done, the Government should institute some system of physical instruction to  compensate  the youth of Australia for what they will lose through the abolition of compulsory military training. </para>
                <para>I do not blame the Labour party for endeavouring to give effect to the several planks of its platform; but I consider that, on . such an important subject as this, the party should 3eek to achieve its purpose in a constitutional manner. During the last election campaign, we heard nothing of this proposal to abolish military training, though, as I have said, it is one of the planks of the Labour party&#39;s platform. Therefore,&#39; I contend that if the Government wished to make the change it should first have sought the approval of both Houses of Parliament. By abolishing compulsory military training without a direction from Parliament, the Government has done the wrong thing in the wrong way. Though the safety of the nation is involved, the Government, without any reference to Parliament, and without even consulting the Council of Defence, by its administrative act ha3 struck a blow at our system of defence. Here again I protest against the Government&#39;s policy in overlooking the Senate and allowing such an important matter as this to be decided by the dominant party in the House of Representatives. </para>
                <para>I come now to the third administrative act of the Government - the suspension of . the licensing system under the Transport Workers Act. The system should have been retained though the form of licence might have been simplified to make it less objectionable to many of the workers. The transport workers&#39; licence could have been made similar to the miner&#39;s right. If this had been done, I have no doubt that it would have been the pride of those holding it to retain it unblemished for a number of years. We have to thank the Transport Workers Act, and* the Bruce-Page Government, which passed it, for the peace which we now enjoy on the waterfront. </para>

I am pleased to say, however, that they kept work going at Albany, and many of the men earned very good money for the support of their wives and children.

                        <para>- I have no doubt that the men did make good wages. At all events they earned very much more than those who went on strike at seaports in the other States.

                <para>From the point of view  of our primary producers this peace was absolutely essential because the uninterrupted export of our primary products to overseas markets is essential to the welfare of the Commonwealth. We have had peace on the waterfront now for the last eighteen months, and yet one of the first acts of this Government was to suspend the licensing system. If, unfortunately, industrial peace is succeeded by industrial unrest, the responsibility must rest with the Government. It is true that during the last election campaign, Labour candidates declared in favour of repealing the act; but that has not been done, and again I say that, in suspending licences, the Government has done the wrong thing in the wrong way. Its proper course was to bring about the change, by legislative, instead of an administrative, act. I, therefore, charge this Government with having failed in its duty, through not allowing the Senate an opportunity to express its opinion on this important matter. </para>
                <para>I now desire to refer to the suspension of the migration agreement referred to in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. The Government has suggested to the British authorities that, in view of the unemployment prevailing in Australia, the &#163;34,000,000 migration agreement should be suspended insofar as it applies to assisted passages for migrants. It is a serious thing to seek to vary an agreement honorably entered into. The agreement provides that for every &#163;1,000 received by a State Government it will provide a new farm, or that for every &#163;75 advanced one migrant will be absorbed. It is further provided that one half of the farms thus established shall be allotted to assisted migrants, the remainder to be made available to our own people. This agreement has been of considerable benefit to several of the States. To Western Australia it has been of incalculable value, for that Sta&#62;te, so far, has received more money under the agreement than has any other State. Consequently, Western Australia&#39;s loss in the event of the agreement being suspended will be the greatest. Already &#163;4,4S9,000 has been spent in Western Australia, under the provisions of the agreement, on public works, railway construction, advances to group settlers - many of whom are migrants - and water supply. Under the agreement that State has already saved &#163;600,000 in interest; the ultimate saving will be about &#163;1,300,000. Every railway now being constructed in Western Australia is being financed by money obtained from Great Britain under the agreement. In addition, big rock catchment water supplies are being provided. Apart from the direct benefit resulting from the expenditure of this money on reproductive works, the indirect benefit is immense. The action of the Government in. seeking the suspension of certain clauses of the agreement is tantamount to asking that the whole of it be suspended, for, in view of the difficulties experienced by the Home authorities, it can hardly expect them to continue to advance money if it fails to carry out Australia&#39;s part of the agreement. </para>

                        <para>- There are many big schemes to which the Commonwealth is not yet committed. It is not committed to the 3,000 farms scheme, notwithstanding that already a good deal of work has been done in connexion with it. Anticipating approval, the State Government put settlers on the land. The suspension of the agreement will affect developmental works already carried out as well as others which have been proposed by the several States, particularly &#34;Western Australia. Indeed, the public works programme of that State cannot be carried out without the assistance of the Federal and Imperial Governments as provided for in the agreement. It is not necessary for me to point out that if, unfortunately, work in connexion with those schemes is suspended, further unemployment will result. Before despatching that cable to Britain, the Federal Government should have consulted with the State Governments, because they are the parties chiefly affected. One would have thought that the Government would at least have ascertained the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier,</inline> the Labour Premier of Western Australia, on the subject before cabling to the Home authorities. </para>

In this connexion I can only express the hope that the Government will not add to the duties to be performed by the latter body by entrusting to it the administration of the Federal Capital Territory.

                    <para>Without expressing any opinion on the broad matter of policy as to whether the Development and Migration Commission should be abolished or retained, I should like to say that its work in Western Australia has been very valuable and of great assistance to the State. Every proposal submitted to the commission by us has been examined most thoroughly, and for the past twelve months it has been making a careful study, of the land settlement project known as the 3,000 farms scheme, with which is associated the construction of many hundreds of miles of roads and railways and some important water supply works. If approved under the Migration Agreement, this big project can be carried out within five years, hut without the assistance provided for under the agreement the State would probably be unable to complete it within twenty years. Of course I cannot speak for the other States, but, so far as Western Australia is concerned, we have been greatly assisted through the investigations of the commission in our task of developing the State. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and I have also considered, with far more earnestness and pleasure, our less absorption responsibility if, instead of our being required to absorb one migrant for every &#163;75 advanced, we put one migrant on a farm for every &#163;1,000 advanced. Every migrant placed on a farm provides employment for others. From an Australian point of view, it is a good policy to place men on the land. </para>

The first agreement with Great Britain was negotiated by the then Premier of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell, when he was in London. He conceived the plan of placing on some of our empty lands a number of unemployed worker in Britain then in receipt of the dole, and giving them an opportunity to make good in Australia. Subsequently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> when Prime Minister, made a bettor agreement than any previously negotiated on behalf of any State. Existing State schemes became&#34;agreed undertakings,&#34; under the agreement negotiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce.</inline> The three States which hod individual agreements with the British authorities - Western Australia, Victoria, and South Australia - came under the Commonwealth scheme, and reaped the benefit of the better conditions offered to the Commonwealth by the Home authorities. </para>

                        <para>- If a migrant could not meet the loss, the State undertook to meet it. I agree with the Minister&#39;s suggestion that, in fairness to the State which had the courage to launch the undertaking, the whole of the expenditure should be brought under the provisions of the agreement. Over 2,000 group settlers in the south-west of the State of Western Australia are transforming that portion into a productive area. The system has been expensive to the State Government, inasmuch as it has to meet a large amount of expenditure which is not covered by the agreement. If honorable senators opposite wish to obtain evidence of the value of migration and land settlement in the matter of providing employment, they should visit the south-western portions of Western Australia, where the group settlements are located. A few years ago Busselton was a small and quiet, but beautiful, seaside resort, with little active rural development in progress. </para>

                        <para>- Mainly, but not entirely; a few estates were purchased. Since the group settlers have been placed on the land near Busselton, that town has developed to a remarkable extent. New buildings have been erected, additional businesses established, large quantities of butter are being produced, and there appears to be progress and prosperity on every hand. I think I am safe in saying that within a period of two or three years, the town of Busselton has doubled its population. This has had the effect of providing employment not only in the immediate locality, but in other parts of the State. It is only natural and proper that we should make our vacant Crown lands available to Britain&#39;s surplus population, and it is to be regretted that there are not larger areas of suitable wheat lands available for settlement. </para>

                <para>It is interesting to note that it was not until 1890 that Western Australia was granted responsible government; Western Australia being the last of the Australian colonies to be removed from the domination of Downing-street. When the request was made, a large body of public opinion in Great Britain was opposed to handing over one-third of the Australian continent, consisting of nearly 1,000,000 square miles which, at that time, was actually owned by Britain, to a small population consisting of 48,502 persons. There was a good deal of opposition - which was actively expressed in the House of Commons - to the proposal in Great Britain, and this was based, I believe, on the contention that this huge area of Crown land should be kept for British settlers. A select committee, consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> H. Parker, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Cockburn-Campbell and Governor Broome, was appointed to lay the case before the British Parliament. At that time an assurance was given by them, and it has always been a State policy since, that those Crown lands would be held in trust for the people of Australia and of Great Britain. It may be that the Australian Labour party is not versed in our history in this respect, but this is undoubtedly one of the many obligations we owe to the Mother Country which has always treated us with unfailing generosity. </para>
                <para>It was a generous act, not only to give us, at. that time, the self-government that we desired, but also to hand over to 48,502 people without any restrictions whatever, an area of nearly 1,000,000 square miles, to be settled in the way we thought best. It is a trust which the successive governments of Western Australia, including the present Government, have always honoured by providing land, in small areas, for settlement by white people of the British race, as opportunity offered. It seems that the Federal Labour party wish Australia to adopt the role of an ungrateful child who has persuaded its mother to make it a gift and then forbids her to enter the home. </para>
                <para>I trust the nominated and assisted migration system will continue since it appears to be the best that we can adopt. Under that system the nominator guarantees the migrant employment or support for, I think, a period of two years. In Western Australia, the Government grants, free of cost, an area of 160 acres of land to any migrant who will occupy it. The only charge made is the cost of the survey. A land settlement, migration and development policy is the only one which can make the State prosperous, and it is a policy that is being carried out by the present Labour Government as it was by its predecessors. </para>

                        <para>- It depends upon the locality and quality of the land. Most of the group settlers in the south-west of the State were placed on less than 160 acres at the outset; but in the poorer areas the Government have increased the area. In the wheat belt, a man requires 1,000 acres of land, and the average size of the blocks consist of about that area. A settler is given 160 acres free of cost, and the balance is made available to him on easy terms extending over 20 or 30 years without interest. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier,</inline> in the&#34; remarks I have read, referred to the 3,000 farms scheme, which has been established on land which comprises a considerable area of good sheep and wheat country, and where the State will not be faced with the losses which occurred in connexion with the group settlement scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> has said that under the migration agreement the scheme can be carried out in five years, but if the assistance, which that agreement provides, is not available, it will take twenty years to do the work. I, therefore, ask honorable senators to consider what the position of Western Australia will be if the operation of the agreement is suspended. </para>

                <para>It is true that promises have been made to the effect that the scheme will be proceeded with; but it is necessary to remember that a good deal of preliminary work in connexion with surveys, road-making, and clearing has already been carried out under the agreement. If the agreement is suspended at this stage, the position of hundreds of settlers between Southern Cross, Ravensthorpe, Esperance, Albany and the great </para>
                <para class="block">Southern districts will be very serious. These areas were made available for settlement after the Lands Department had advertised the properties, and the Agricultural Bank had advanced large sums of the State Savings Bank&#39;s funds for their improvement in anticipation of the work being brought under the Migration Agreement. The settlers have also spent their own money in improving the land in absolute good faith, and not one of them would have been on the land or have spent his own or government money had it not been for the promise made that these areas would be opened up by roads and railways and provided with a water supply under the migration agreement. Many of these settlers have done a good deal of preliminary work, and it will mean their ruination if there is any repudiation or serious amendment of a definite undertaking between the Imperial, Federal and State Governments. I, therefore, trust that the Commonwealth Government will be very careful before it interferes with the developmental work in the matter of railway and road construction and water supplies which the authorities have been carrying out under the agreement. The most effective way in which to defend Australia is to provide for the occupation of its empty spaces, and an active policy of land settlement and development which has the approval of the State Labour Government should be allowed to continue. </para>
                <para>I wish now to refer to a paragraph in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech in which reference is made to a revision of the tariff schedule. Since the speech was delivered a new tariff schedule has been tabled, in which higher duties are imposed on no less than 221 items. These duties are now in force. The schedule appears to be in a veritable drag-net; nothing has been overlooked. Not only have luxuries been heavily taxed, but very heavy duties have also been imposed upon the necessities of life. </para>
                <para>The main complaint in Western Australia against successive Federal Governments is the manner in which Customs duties have been increased. It would appear that if the Bruce-Page Government in this regard chastised the </para>
                <para class="block">Western Australian people with a whip the present Government is subjecting them to the sting of a scorpion. Included in the list of commodities on which higher duties are to be imposed we find clothing, textiles, metals, machinery, oils, paint, paper, crockery, petrol and motor trucks. Nearly everything required by the man on the land has to bear higher duties, and this will have the effect of increasing the price to a majority of the Australian consumers. The cost of living and the cost of production will be seriously increased, and these higher duties will be a crushing blow to primary production - the true source of Australia&#39;s national wealth. </para>
                <para>Those engaged in the pastoral, agricultural, mining and timber industries have to sell their products in the markets of the world; but the articles they require to assist them in production can only be obtained under the new tariff at prices which will make it almost impossible for them to compete in the overseas markets. It is quite clear that the cost of producing wheat, wool, metals, including gold, must be increased, and that the extra cost will fall very heavily upon the shoulders of the consumers. Further, I am afraid that the new tariff will have the effect of accentuating the drift of population to the big cities, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, and will certainly increase unemployment, particularly in the country districts. I intend to oppose the whole of these increases in duty. </para>
                <para>I hope that the Government will deal with the schedule immediately, because it is quite unfair to collect these increased duties, for perhaps, months before ascertaining whether the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and particularly the members of the Senate, approve of them. This action shows a callous disregard for the interests of those engaged in the primary industries of Australia, and I am sorry that before the Government introduced the increased tariff, it did not see fit to weigh carefully and have regard to a warning that the Premier of Western Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collier)</inline> issued on this very subject. I was at a gathering at Narrogin on 18th October, and at that time it was apparent that there would be a change of government. At that gathering <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> made some remarks which he, to some extent, directed at me. He actually said that he hoped that I would keep in mind what he said, and I told him that I was entirely in agreement with his views and that I hoped that his triumphant colleagues, when they took over the reins of Government of the Commonwealth, would agree with him, as thoroughly as I did on that occasion. This appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australia</inline> on the 19th October - </para>

                    <para>Speaking at the reception in the Town Hall, Narrogin, this morning, the Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collier),</inline> said he sometimes felt that a very considerable portion of the people did not realize that Australia was dependent almost entirely on the wealth produced from our primary industries. When people realized that a fall in the price of wool meant a reduction in the national income of about &#163;30,000,000, they appreciated the importance of the primary industries. He hoped that members of the Federal Parliament would be mindful of the fact that prosperity was not brought about in the cities, but that Australia&#39;s future progress and prosperity depended entirely upon the manner in which Parliament realized that it was the primary industries that were the source of its wealth. The party that endeavoured to place burdens or difficulties in the way of those engaged in primary industries was doing a dis-service to Australia. </para>

                <para>The tariff has been largely increased in spite of that warning, and in spite of the report of the Big Pour, who came out from England without receiving any payment for their services, and gave us their views on the tariff and other subjects.

Dyason, Brigden, Giblin, Copland and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Wickens,</inline> whose most interesting book was tabled only a few weeks before the change of Government took place.

After that &#39; recommendation was made, the Financial Agreement came into force. I was one of those who opposed it. The 25s. per head capitation grant was, in consequence, reduced. Now, on top of that, the tariff has been considerably increased. If the Commonwealth wished to honour fully that recommendation and put Western Australia in the position that the majority of the commission wished it to occupy, it would probably cost &#163;900,000 a year. The way we can, and should, be assisted is not so much by the payment of large sums of money, as by placing us upon a better economic basis by permitting our primary industries to be relieved of the tariff exactions that are being put on them year after year by the Federal Government in the interest of the wealthy manufacturers of the Eastern States, resident largely in Sydney and Melbourne, and their employees. It is true that our secondary industries in Western Australia are comparatively unimportant, but we shall not be able to make them important while we have severe competition from the established manufacturers of the Eastern States. South Australia, as well, is suffering all the disadvantages and none of the advantages of the high tariff policy. Every State of the Commonwealth has a vigorous land settlement policy, which is described in every Governor&#39;s Speech at the opening of Parliament.

                        Johnston. tion is the levying of taxation by the Federal Government through the tariff on everything that affects the settler from the moment that he goes on the land. I have had a great deal to do with land settlement in Western Australia, as I represent a country constituency. I have repeatedly seen men going on land that is naturally waterless, heavily timbered, and quite unproductive until substantially improved. A great deal of it is simply the home of the dingo and kangaroo, and it takes brave men and women to settle in parts remote from railways, and to face the discomforts of a pioneering life outback. When the settler decides to go on the land, the first thing he requires is a motor truck in addition to food, stores, equipment, clothing, tools and axes, and the prices of the whole of these requirements are being increased, because of the exactions of the tariff. It is also evident that railway freights must go up, because of the increased cost of living following in the train of the increased tariff.

                        <para>- I should be pleased if all our implements were made in Australia provided their price was reasonable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> is very glad to get protection for his industry at Sunshine, but, then, he complained to the royal commission on the Navigation Act that the coastal provisions of the act were oppressing his industry. He said that in Western Australia he had to charge for agricultural machinery from 10 per cent, to 12&#163; per cent, more than in Victoria. He was compelled, he said, to take that action much against his will, be-&#39; cause of the high freights brought about by the operation of the Navigation Act. This vicious circle does not please any one. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> wants a protective tariff, but he also wants to be relieved of the taxations imposed by the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act. Western Australian settlers suffer in this way. They not only pay high prices for the protected article manufactured in Melbourne, but also bear an additional increase of from 10 per cent, to 12&#163; per cent, on the price to the Victorian farmers, because of the oppressive incidence of the Navigation Act. </para>

                <para>We certainly entered federation with our eyes open. To-day we are the victims of a granted prayer. We desired a federation&#34; and we got it in the neck. We have the Massey Greene, the Pratten and the Fenton tariffs, and from the point of view of every one engaged in the pastoral, agricultural, and other primary pursuits, each one of those three tariffs has imposed greater and increased burdens upon production. Petrol, for instance, has just had a third penny in extra taxation placed upon it. Perhaps some members of the Labour party regard the petrol tax as a luxury tax upon joy riders, and from that point of view it would certainly be proper. </para>
                <para>Petrol, however, is absolutely essentia&#93; to the farmers and settlers of Australia. They must have it, not only for their transport but also for a large portion of their farming operations. To-day, ploughing and harvesting are done very largely by the use of tractors. Petrol is needed for the motor vehicles which enable new farmers to make a start. It is only by their means that farming operations can be carried on at a distance from a railway line. The man who will be the worst hit by a tax of 3d. a gallon on petrol will be the one who is situated furthest from an existing railway. </para>
                <para>Not only is the motor truck absolutely essential for the transport of wheat; it is also largely employed for the transport of stock as well as the everyday requirements of the farm, particularly the new farm. I have with me a cutting from the <inline font-style="italic">WestAustralian</inline> referring to the economies of motor transport and pointing out that bullocks have been brought down by motor transport, eight at a time, from Roy Hill Station 300 miles to the railhead, and thence carried by rail 600 miles to market in Perth, where they have realized &#163;17 a head. Honorable senators will, therefore, see how essential petrol is to new settlement, as well as to farmers and pastoralists already established. All primary producers should be granted a rebate of the tax of 3d. a gallon placed on petrol. </para>
                <para>Gold-mining is an industry of vast importance to Western Australia. At Wiluna a mine is being developed at a capital expenditure of &#163;1,000,000, which promises to be the largest in the world. The people of the State are pleased to note that a good deal of the capital invested has come from the Rand in South Africa for the first time in the history of the gold-mining industry in Australia. When I look at the 221 items of tariff increases, super-imposed as they are upon an existing high tariff, I find that they are all a direct tax upon the gold-mining industry. Not one person engaged in gold mining or in any other primary industry derives the slightest benefit from this tariff. It is no wonder that the people engaged in gold-mining have asked for a bonus on the production of gold. Although their proposal might not stand a strict economic test, it has been brought before this Parliament on many occasions by the gentleman who is the only representative of the gold-mining industry in another place, and who is now Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green).</inline> The people on the Kalgoorlie goldfields and at Meekatharra and Wiluna are hoping that the present Government will afford them the relief they have so long advocated in this direction and . which has been given to other industries. </para>
                <para>The tariff increases show a ruthless disregard for the interests of &#39;the primary producers, but the worst feature about them is that, so far as I have been able to ascertain by a series of questions which have not been directly answered, they have not been made as a result of any recommendations by the Tariff Board. On that board we have men of science and understanding, whose task it is to study with care the relation of every alteration to the tariff schedule as a whole and its. effect upon all industries. I certainly think that no increases should be made except as a result of recommendations by the board. It appears to me, however, that the Government&#39;s haste to increase the tariff in all directions may have the effect of destroying the whole basis of the existing tariff schedule. </para>
                <para>If the Tariff Board is not to be consulted, why retain it? The Government seems to have a passion for the destruction of existing institutions. I have already pointed out its anxiety to abolish the Senate and State rights. The Labour&#39; party seeks the abolition of Upper </para>
                <para class="block">Houses. The Federal Labour party has suspended or abolished compulsory military training and the licensing provisions of the Transport Workers Act. It is also attacking the gold standard, and the migration agreement seems to be in danger. It will not hurt very much to add another little bit of destruction by abolishing the Tariff Board, if, in future its recommendations are not to be followed, and the tariff is to be ruthlessly raised as a matter of Government policy without regard to the possible economic effect on the whole schedule. </para>
                <para>I am afraid the new tariff will react more heavily on the wage-earners and workers than on any other section of the people. The basic wage-earner, who predominates in the community, will certainly find the cost of living heavily increased. He will have large increases, up to 50 per cent., imposed on the cheap clothing he buys for himself, his wife, and his children, particularly on cotton goods, socks, shirts, and hats. </para>

                        <para>- I have already pointed out that with every increase in the tariff there has been a practically corresponding increase in unemployment. Of course, that is not what honorable senators of the Labour party wish. They think that these tariff increases will lead to the employment of more factory hands in the great cities, and thus increase employment in Australia. The increases will do nothing of the kind. Each increase in the cost of living reduces the purchasing power of the community, because the cost of production is increased, and to that extent decreases the measure of employment in the Commonwealth. That is the view I have been sent here to express. The people of Western Australian feel that the Australian policy in regard to tariff increases is wrong, and they are fortified in that view by the report of the commission on the finances of Western Australia as affected by federation, and by the opinion expressed by a number of economists that a high tariff policy is injurious to Australia, and particularly to the States of South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. At any rate, when the basic wage-earner finds that in addition to having the cost of living in creased, he is out of a job through the increase in the cost of production, I am sure he will not thank the government of the day for the new tariff schedule. </para>

                    <para>.- I congratulate the Leader of the  Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> upon his political good fortune. Very shortly after his election to this chamber he was elected Leader of the Opposition and now, after the appeal to the people, he occupies the position of Vice-President of the Executive Council. He is one of the luckiest men I have ever met in politics. I am pleased to be able to add that I consider he is performing the duties of his office most efficiently. I wish, however, to protest against the treatment of this chamber by the present Government. Ever since I have been a member of the Senate we have had at least one Minister with a portfolio and two assistant Ministers. On one occasion when, owing to the illness of  a  Minister, the business of the Government was in the hands of his two colleagues, the strain proved too great for them. The decision of the Government that &#39;it should be represented in this chamber by only the Vice-President of the Executive Council and an assistant Minister is an insult to the Senate itself. It is not as if the Labour party lacked members with administrative ability. Our old friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has been identified with the Labour movement for nearly the whole of his life. He was in the Senate many years ago, and surely has the necessary qualifications, yet he is thrust aside as if he were nobody. Then we have also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Digger</inline> Dunn, who announced himself as one of the young members of the Labour party. Why has he been overlooked? We are told from time to time that youth is going to regenerate the world. Why was not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Digger</inline> Dunn entrusted with the task of regenerating the Labour party? I am surprised that he has been ignored.  His  military training should have fitted him for administering the Defence Department, and if he had been selected, the Labour party would merely have been following the practice of having the Minister for Defence in this chamber. Other members of the party in the Senate chamber also were qualified for ministerial positions, but apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> was the power behind the scenes. He has for so long ignored the upper branches of our legislatures that, apparently, he decided the Senate should not nave adequate representation in the Ministry. </para>

                <para>When he was Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> in defiance of the wishes of the people, abolished the Legislative Council. We understand that he has similar designs on the Senate, but I warn him that if he has any such ambitious scheme as that in his mind, the task will be beyond him. The people will never agree to the abolition of this chamber. I do not say that Queensland is the most important State, but it is second in size to Western Australia, and its potentialities are unequalled in any other State. Yet the only representative it has in this Ministry is an assistant Minister. It is not fair that Queensland should be ignored in this way. </para>

                <para>The attitude of the Labour party to arbitration, during the election campaign, indicated that it was attempting to ignore economic facts. The appeal to the people was the direct result of two industrial disputes, during which the principle of federal arbitration was deliberately  violated by not only the rank and file of the industrial movement, but also the leaders of trade unionists throughout Australia. Scarcely a day passed without denunciation of the court and its awards. A good deal of attention was focussed upon the timber strike, which was the outcome of an award by Judge Lukin. The bush timber workers were not in any way affected. They had always worked 48 hours, but an upheaval took place because workers in city timber mills were required to work longer hours. Honorable senators opposite consistently ignore the fact that very little timber is now being used in the erection of big modern buildings. For the most part, they consist of steel frames and concrete or bricks. Even the window frames are of steel. In the majority of modern buildings, the only timber used is to be found in the doors, though in some there is a thin layer of flooring over concrete. The effect of this modern practice is to paralyze the timber industry. Our hardwood timbers are too heavy and our pines are unsuitable for concrete casing, so practically the only structural timber used is Oregon, which is imported. I say, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> and other Labour leaders, who urged the timber workers to defy the award of the Arbitration Court, were ignoring plain economic facts. </para>
                <para>In the coal industry, the position is much the same. The men engaged in the northern coal-mines of New South Wales have been on strike for the last ten months. A day or two ago there was an announcement that their leaders had agreed to a reduction of 9d. a ton in the hewing rates, so all they have gained, after ten months idleness, is 3d. a ton on the offer made by the mine-owners at the beginning of the strike. It is a scandal that Labour leaders should have urged the men to continue on strike in the face of the economic facts of the industry. Coal is not now used so largely as it was a few years ago. Crude oil fuel is displacing it in steamships and in many other means of transport. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> during the election, declared that if Labour were returned the coal-mines would be re-opened in a fortnight. Of course that was impossible. Even when the tribunal, which was appointed by this Government to investigate the position, made a recommendation, it was rejected by the miners, so it is safe to say that this Government has humbugged the miners at every turn. The settlement, which now appears to be probable, could have been achieved six months ago, if the men had been in a reasonable frame of mind, and if their leaders had been desirous of ending the dispute. The high cost of coal, as we all know, has an important bearing upon other industrial activities. A reduction of 5s. a ton in the price will do much to relieve the economic pressure in a number of other industries. </para>

All the commissions of inquiry which have investigated the coal industry, including the Hibble tribunal, have reported to the same effect. There has been no evidence that the miners were returning profits greater than from 2s. to 2s.1d. a ton. A good deal has been said of the misery and privation experienced by the coal-miners and their families; but if they would agree to a slight reduction in their wages, the mines would be re-opened and the miners again placed on their feet. </para>

Australia is as worth defending to-day as it was then. If it was then right, that in a democratic country every citizen should take an equal share in its defence, it is right to-day.

Let the age for training be raised, if delegates liked; let it lie physical training at first, and military training in manhood; but he urged them not to lose sight of the vital question at issue.

                        <para>- If Australia is worth defending, our young people should be trained to defend it so that, should the occasion arise, they may be fit to take their part. Probably the objection of the Labour party to compulsory military training is based on the assumption that it encourages a military spirit. I do not believe that it does anything of the kind. I have not yet met one young man who has become a militarist because of his training in the Citizen Forces. The military spirit will always be apparent in some whether the volunteer or compulsory system of training is in operation. In this democracy we should welcome anything which will assist the development of Australia&#39;s manhood, and particularly a system which gives all young men an opportunity of meeting on the same footing. Under the compulsory system of training every man is the equal of his companions; it is a method  which dispenses with class distinction. The Leader of the Government in the Senate said that his party was opposed to the compulsion of youths who had not a vote. That, however, is only claptrap, as votes have nothing whatever to do with compulsory military training. Is it not the responsibility of a young man who has not reached the age at which he is entitled to vote to train for the defence of his country? It has already been proved, beyond doubt, by military experts in this chamber that compulsory military training has had a very beneficial effect upon the physical development and discipline of our young men. What was the attitude of the members of the basher gangs during the timber workers&#39; strike? Their first incentive was to strike the other fellow. </para>

                        <para>- It was. The Government is taxing the people by the imposition of heavy Customs duties, and by means of very high income and land taxation rates; but at the same time it is declining to tax the American picture combines which supply the films to Australian exhibitors. The Bruce-Page Government endeavoured to impose a tax upon these combines; but whenever an effort has been made to tax them it has been found that the profits go to the combines in America, and therefore can not be taxed. During the last election campaign the members of the Labour party were acting as the agents of these big American interests. As pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden,</inline> the Labour party, which was once opposed to combines in any shape or form, is now openly assisting them instead of relieving the very heavy burden which the workers have to shoulder. According to the budget, taxable incomes of individuals from &#163;201 to &#163;1,500 are to bear a super tax of 10 per cent., from &#163;1,501 to &#163;3,000 15 per cent., and from &#163;3,000 upwards 20 per cent. The taxation on companies is to be at the rate of 20 per cent. It is astounding that the Labour party, which has always been so opposed to combines, should practically have given an undertaking that if returned to power it would not tax these picture combines, while at the same time it is imposing an additional burden upon every other section of the community. With the exception of a few big showmen in the cities there are very few exhibitors in Australia who are making a living, and in some cases suburban and country showmen are actually losing money. Australian people who are using Australian capital will have to pay the heavy income taxation rates I have quoted, while the American combines who lease their pictures to the exhibitors here at such high rates that they are hardly able to carry on, will escape taxation. </para>

                <para>During the election campaign the Labour candidates said it was the intention of the Bruce-Page Government to impose an amusement tax which would have the effect of increasing the price of children&#39;s tickets. That was never intended and the statement was a gross misrepresentation of the position. The Labour party received substantial financial assistance from the picture combine, without which it would not have been able to obtain the publicity it did. Although the coffers of the Labour party were empty owing to the strike of timber workers and a previous election it obtained such publicity by the way of cartoons and propaganda generally that it received a greater measure of support than it ever anticipated. Where did the money to pay for these cartoons, and advertising generally, come from. It did not come from its own political supporters, but was supplied by the picture interests. The first proposal of the Bruce Page Government was to impose a tax of 5 per cent, on the total receipts from charges for admission. Under this the small showmen would have escaped, as there was an exemption of &#163;100, which would have benefited all but the big city showmen. If taxation were imposed upon the gross receipts it would come out of the money which the combines are making in Australia. As the result of the advent of the Labour party these big American interests are avoiding taxation which they should be paying, while some small showmen will have to pay at least 20 per cent. tax. </para>
                <para>The sooner the Labour party wakes up to the &#39; real position and imposes taxation upon the gross receipts of these American combines the better it&#39; will be for Australia. The theatres in which &#34; talkie &#34; films are projected are seriously interfering with those in which silent films are screened, and also ruining the legitimate drama and practically every other form of entertainment. The money which these concerns are taking from the people is all going out of Australia, and the Labour party will not raise a hand to prevent it. Do honorable senators opposite call themselves the friends of the working man when they refuse to tax combines which are charging 7s. 7d. a seat as is charged at the State Theatre in Sydney on a Saturday night. The taxation of gross receipts could not have been passed on, although the entertainment tax on tickets is in most cases borne by picture patrons. Moreover, the price at which a film is leased to a showman is determined by the financial position of the house requiring it. The com bine squeezes the utmost out of the exhibitor every time. There are very few British films being exhibited, and if the present policy is persisted in, it will be even more difficult for British producers. It was the proposal of the Bruce-Page Government if returned to tax the picture combines to the extent of 12-J per cent, on its gross profits - on the money that went to America for the purchase of films - and thus encourage British production. The decision of the present Government to allow these American combines to escape is in conformity with the Treasurer&#39;s attitude when he held office in Queensland. He is quite accustomed to extracting money from this class of people, and despite the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> the other day, endeavoured to repudiate the suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> is connected with the wealthy interests, I emphatically state that that gentleman has always been connected with them. In one instance the present Commonwealth Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> the late Premier of Queensland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McCormack)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fihelly,</inline> acting as a subcommittee of the Labour party, took certain action during an election campaign in Queensland. I had left the party just previously, because the element that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCormack</inline> represented wanted to boss, with the industrial unions, the whole political show. I refused to obey the dictation of a section that wanted to boss the political Labour party altogether. There was no trouble between the members of the party and myself in connexion with my resignation. I was head of the executive for years, and I know, therefore, a good deal about its finances. I was asked to stay with the party until the State elections were over, but I refused to do so. What took place was this : The present Treasurer of the Commonwealth entered into a contract with the Licensed Victuallers not to interfere with licences for three years in return for the payment of so many thousands of pounds. </para>

He is to-day a member of a Government that is proposing to restrict foreign immigration to Australia.

I do not object to Italians coming here so long as we have room for them. The Treasurer&#39;s attitude is nothing but camouflage and his words so much humbug, and no doubt the people of Australia will find this out for themselves before the term of office of this Government expires.

In Queensland he sacrificed his colleagues to further his own interests, and 1 guarantee he will do the same thing in the federal arena.

On the contrary, it would have taken all arbitration powers under the control of the Federal Parliament, and it made several attempts to do so.

                        <para>- That is so. The Bruce-Page Government then made an endeavour to introduce amendments into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act with a view to making it more workable. That it did not prove to be more workable was due to the fact that no assistance was obtained from the other side. There was no possible chance of enforcing awards ; the men simply flouted them, and the Government thereupon asked the States if they would hand over to the Commonwealth Parliament the power to control arbitration. The States declined that request, and I believe they were right in doing so. In my opinion industrial matters should be controlled by the States. Nevertheless I supported the Government in the attitude it took up. Seeing how apparent it was that there should not be two arbitration authorities in Australia, the one overlapping the other, the Bruce-Page Government then offered to abolish federal arbitration, and allow the States to control industrial matters. If that had been done, it would have led to a reduction of industrial turmoil. This gave the people another opportunity to express a voice on the matter, and their verdict was that the Federal Parliament should control arbitration, and that the Labour party should administer the affairs of the Commonwealth. </para>

In any case the Nationalists will give the Government more assistance in carrying out the arbitration law of the Commonwealth, with a view, to ensuring peace, than was given by the Labour party to the late Government, and any measure that is introduced for the purpose of ensuring that both workers and employers shall be fairly treated, will meet with the approval of honorable senators now in Opposition to the Government. </para>

                    also said that the Federal Government was responsible for the volume of unemployment in Australia. It is one of the worst features of Australian life that men. who want to work cannot obtain employment. It is a national waste and a tragedy to the men who are thus situated. The cause of all this unemployment is to be found in artificial legislation. Any tariff increase means an increase in the cost of living. Each increase in the cost of living means an increase in wages. Each increase, in wages creates a demand for a higher tariff, and in the end the working man is no better off than before. It is this vicious system which is responsible for our unemployment, yet the new Government has further increased the tariff. There are troublous times ahead.
                </para>
                <para>Ministers are not to be blamed for taking any step that they think will relieve unemployment. It is usually the practice to borrow a few pounds and spend it on a job to give relief to unemployed, but that is not the way in which the problem should be tackled. The only remedy for the unemployment evil is to produce something and sell it at a price at which people can afford to buy it. At present, the product of labour will not sell abroad at a price which will pay for the cost of the labour. Wherever we go in Australia we find three things uppermost - work everywhere, plenty of money to do the work and no dearth of labour. There are opportunities, for work everywhere. There is land to be cleared, scrub to be cut, houses to be built or repaired. The banking returns show that there is plenty of money available. There are &#163;215,000,000 on deposit in the Savings Bank. That is not ail money deposited by the workers. A great deal of it represents the money of the people who are afraid to put it anywhere else. The other banking returns tell the same tale. Why is so much labour walking about seeking employment and unable to obtain it? It is because people lack confidence. They are afraid that they cannot get a return for the money they spend if they pay others to clear the land or do any other essential work. I am afraid that until we can produce articles at a cost at. which people can afford to buy them, we shall never get rid of our unemployed. </para>
                <para>The Labour plan to relieve the position is to raise the tariff and make in Australia everything Australia wants. I am an Australian and I believe in using Australian goods, but the action the Government has taken in this respect will simply add costs to people who cannot pass them on. I am of opinion that the new tariff will give more employment in the big cities, especially in Melbourne and Sydney, and, in that respect, it may do some good; but what about the farmers? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> tells us that we shall have to make more goods in Australia and the people will have to pay for them. But what will be the position of those people who cannot pass on the added cost? The costs of those who have to sell their products outside Australia for whatever they can get for them will be increased, and I am afraid that, in consequence, they will be put right out of business. The tariff cannot be of assistance to those who produce wool and wheat, our staple commodities. On the contrary, the producers of wool, wheat, fruit and other primary products, cannot stand additional burdens, and the policy that increases the amount of labour in the big cities will have the effect of throwing out of work, in country districts; thousands of men who are doing infinitely better and more essential work than those who are employed in the cities. If the Labour party has no better method of solving the unemployed problem than that of increasing the tariff, all I have to say is that I do not think it will prove successful. The farmer, who has to sell his product in the open market and has no say in the price he gets for it, also finds that he has very little say in the price he pays for everything he requires. The amount he pays to the man he employs, or for the plough he uses, the food he consumes or the clothes he wears, is increased by this artificial legislation. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is touching upon a very big subject. It is hard to say just how land values are fixed. I think it will be generally admitted that at present they are too high if land is to be taken simply on its productive value. There is a school which says that land values are based on the price the land will bring on the market. But we know that many people place a fictitious value on land because they want to acquire it for some special purpose other than that of making a living on it.They may like a particular area, or a block may be acquired by a man because it adjoins his own. On the other hand it might not be a good thing to reduce land values at one fell swoop. It might deprive many people of all the equity that they possess in the land and the last situation might be infinitely worse than the first. </para>

Many people are working their land for what they can take off it, and the only way in which they can get more work for the wages they pay, so that the product of the land may be sold at a price at which people can buy it, is to reduce the cost of production by reducing the tariff. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is also opening up a big problem in referring to soldier settlement schemes. As a matter of fact, all the governments of Australia, Commonwealth and State, were pushed into those land settlement schemes by a public which was intensely sympathetic with the soldiers, but utterly irresponsible in the matter. The governments realized that if they did not buy land on which to settle returned soldiers, others would be got to do so. In my ministerial capacity in the State of Tasmania I had a fair amount of experience of purchasing land for soldiers. I had, on many occasions, to act practically as agent with both buyer and seller against me, the seller sitting down, knowing well that he would get the price he wanted, and the buyer pressing me to buy at the seller&#39;s price. The governments were forced into that position. But many who talk of the price paid for land for soldier settlement forget the price at which produce was selling in those days. For wheat 10s. a bushel could be obtained, for butter as much as 3s. a lb., and for a calf &#163;5. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It is easy to play the game backwards, and say now how foolish every one was then. The governments certainly did lose a lot of money over soldier settlement, but plenty of private capital was lost in the same way. Individuals bought land and stock, and made just as many losses as were made in connexion with soldier settlement. I could give numerous instances of this; but, of course, these persons were not governments, and the public generally did not hear anything about their failures. There are two sides to the question of the losses sustained on soldier settlement. </para>

                <para>Increases in cost, following the increased tariff, will be very harmful to the fruit industry, which looms so largely in Tasmania. At one time apple-growers could ship their apples to London and do very well on a return of 8s. or 9s. a case. To-day it costs the apple-growers 8s. or 9s. a case to send them to London, and the apples do not bring in any greater return than in previous years. The new tariff will therefore bring about unemployment in the apple-growing districts of Tasmania. Growers will try to do without fertilizers. They will try to dispense with the labour that they should employ. If we increase the cost of everything the apple-grower uses, his food, his clothing, sprays and so forth, and he gets no more for his apples, the result of the tariff, so far as he is concerned, is not difficult to estimate. The manufacturer, on the other hand, does not care how much his costs are increased. He simply raises the price of the article he is producing and so passes on the extra cost. It is quite impossible for the farmer or the fruit-grower to do this. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and, unfortunately, we appear to be making no effort to improve matters. We all agree that to retain the export trade, the quality of the product sent overseas must be unchallengeable. In this connexion I wish the Minister to note that some time ago there was a revision of the various standards of fruit intended for export; and experience has shown that the enforcement of the new regulations is going to damage the Tasmanian apple industry. It should be remembered that Tasmania is not in the same position as the fruit growing States on the mainland. The growers in South Australia, Victoria or Western Australia have big cities in which to market their surplus product, whereas the Tasmanian grower must ship the whole of his output either to the other States or to Great Britain. Last year, as I have said, revised regulations to control the export trade were drawn up as the result of a conference of inspectors from all the States, with the exception of Tasmania. Unfortunately, Tasmania was not represented by an inspector from its own agricultural department, though I do not think that this was the fault of the State Government. A Commonwealth inspector, however, was present. One regulation agreed to provides that the ends of all export cases must be planed. I agree that an export case planed in this way will look much better, but I wish the assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> to bear in mind that the majority of Tasmanian orchardists have to obtain their cases from bush mills which have not the facilities for planing, and while the cost of the work, if done in a city mill, ought not to be more than <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> a case, the price at Tasmanian bush mills, if they were compelled to put in the machinery, would be very much higher. Another regulation prohibits the export of plain grade apples. These, I may inform honorable senators, are apples in which a certain percentage may have a blemish not exceeding in the aggregate &#189; inch in diameter. They realize just as good a price in England as some of the better grades, and we have to dispose of them somewhere. I am aware, of course, that this is not the place for the discussion of the technical aspects of the regulations, but I wish to emphasize that a regulation of this nature will press heavily upon certain growers in Tasmania, and I strongly urge the Government to obtain the advice of the State Fruit Advisory Board, appointed by the department and the growers, before these regulations are given effect. I believe in standardization, and when I was a member of the State Parliament, I was instrumental in passing legislation to this end. I was the first to provide for it. </para>

                <para>Another matter to which 1 direct attention is the request for a bounty on evaporated apples. If our growers could dispose of another 200,000. cases of dried apples, the position of the industry would be materially improved. The return to growers of dried apples is only 2s. per 50 lb. which equals about one bushel and a quarter of green apples and makes 6 lb. of dried apples, so the price works out at only 4d. a lb. American growers land their evaporated apples on the London market at from 5&#189;d. to 6d. a lb., so that the price received by us allows only 2d. for processing. </para>

                        <para>- 1 do not think there is, but the lowest price at which Tasmanian evaporated apples can be landed on the English market is 7&#188;d. or 7&#189;d. a lb. If the Government could see its way to provide a bounty of between &#163;3,000 and &#163;4,000 our growers would be able to carry on. One of the Parliamentary committees, of which I am a member, proposes to visit Tasmania in the course of a few weeks, . and I believe it should be instructed by the Government to inquire into the condition of the apple industry in that State. Few people realize how extensive are the operations of our orchardists and what splendid machinery they have installed to carry on their business. So keen are they to exploit every avenue in the export trade that they have sent tons of cores and peelings to Germany, where there is a market for that by-product of the industry, and our growers have been content with a profit of a few shillings a ton. I sincerely hope that the Government will see its way to grant a small bounty for the assistance of the industry. </para>

                <para>I also direct attention once more to the position of our berry fruit-growers, particularly the growers of black currants. Because sugar is too dear they are unable to process the fruit. If they could get sugar at anything like export parity, this class of fruit could be sold to jam manufacturers for export. This year, I am sorry to say, the great bulk of the berry fruit will fall to the ground. Recently a deputation, of which I was a member, waited upon the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> with a request that he should make representations to the Queensland Government to allow Tasmanian jam manufacturers to obtain sugar at &#163;15 or &#163;16 a ton for the processing of our berry fruits and he promised to do so. I appeal to the present Prime Minister to do the same. At present they have to pay over &#163;30 a ton for it. </para>

                        <para>- A few hundred cases were shipped to the mainland last year, but there are the difficulties in connexion with the development of that trade. The fruit has to be packed in small boxes and all work has to be carried out at the highest possible speed owing to the risk of fruit being ruined by heat or rain. Apparently the only hope is for the growers to market the product for jam manufacturing purposes and this could be done if sugar could be obtained at export parity. Our growers deserve all the assistance which the Commonwealth can give them. They are not making a decent living wage, and this year they are absolutely faced with ruin because the processers have informed them that unless sugar can be obtained at export parity, they cannot buy the fruit. </para>

                <para>Turning again to the revised standards, which I mentioned a minute or two ago, I should like the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> to note that the new regulations which provide for the elimination of a number of varieties will do serious injury to a number of growers in Tasmania. I am aware that the newer varieties of apples sell better than old varieties, but we have in my State three or four well-known kinds, that are a good marketable product, and should not be interfered with. One in particular, called &#34;Crows egg&#34; grown in Southern Tasmania, commands a good price in the English market. An orchardist of my acquaintance ships between 800 or 900 cases every year, and always obtains a satisfactory price in London. Some time ago, an Englishman arrived in Tasmania and bought an orchard comprising mainly this variety of apple. He has been working it for four or five years, and is making a good living on the place; but he informed me that if this variety is eliminated from the list of export apples permitted under the regulations he will have to abandon his property and return to England. I am sure that these revised standards have been drawn up without a complete knowledge of the splendid varieties grown in some of the colder fruit-growing localities, and I therefore urge the Minister, before the regulations are gazetted, to seek the advice of the Fruit Advisory Board in Tasmania., because I am sure this Ministry docs not wish to do anything to injure Tasmanian orchardists. </para>
                <para>We shall have other opportunities to discuss a number of other subjects that are mentioned in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, so I. shall conclude my remarks by again urging the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> to give close attention to the various aspects of the apple export trade, to which I have directed attention to-night. </para>

One that strikes as being particularly significant is that many of those who then were associated with the party to which I belong, are now in opposition in this chamber, and I have noted that, in the discussion this morning, the most virulent attacks on the Ministry have come from them. </para>

But I have no intention of dealing at length with that aspect of the debate. Suffice it to say that I would rather have remained outside this chamber for another fifteen years than continue to be a member of it by the means which kept some of them in this Parliament. There has been considerable criticism of the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, but I have not found any disposition on the part of honorable senators opposite to get down to fundamentals. They have indulged in more or less carping criticism regarding statements alleged to have been made by Labour candidates at the recent election. One of the charges made by several honorable senators opposite is that Labour candidates made wilfully inaccurate statements, in order to gain votes. Although I was not a candidate at the election, I must share my responsibility for the statements made, because I was one who spoke on behalf of candidates for election to another place. Not one wilful misstatement has been sheeted home to us. </para>

Indeed, the very fact that the coal-owners consented to meet the miners in a further conference soon after the new Government assumed office, is evidence that the election had some effect even on the coal situation.It has been said that the Labour party accused the Bruce-Page Government and the Nationalist party, generally, of an attempt to reduce wages. I cheerfully admit that I made that statement, and I am prepared to back it up. Indeed, facts - not mere opinions - bear out the statement. From the very inception of the coal trouble the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> was avowedly on the side of the coal-owners. Another wing of the Nationalist movement - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bavin</inline> and his&#39; Government in New South Wales - also openly sided with the coal-owners throughout the dispute. I go so far as to say that both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bavin</inline> were practically the instigators of the coal-owners&#39; demand for reduced wages. </para>

                        <para>- They insisted on the miners making a greater percentage reduction than the owners were called upon to make. In the coal industry in New South Wales, it has been the custom for many years, for the owners and the miners to share in any advance in the price of coal. If the price of coal improves by ls. a ton, the miners get 3d. and the owners 9d. a ton of that increase. On this occasion the deduction was to be ls. per ton each. The contract miners, whose only capital is their labour, were to accept a reduction of ls. a ton, and weekly hands ls. a day, whereas the coal-owners were to accept a reduction of only ls. a ton. For the purpose of showing that a reduction of ls. a ton was a great concession on the part of the owners, a determined effort has been made to prove that their profits were so small that they could not possibly forego a greater amount. </para>

                        <para>- The findings of the commission are not worth 2d., because it was a purely faked concern. From its inception the commission has steadfastly refused to take evidence in public, or to have the owners&#39; profits disclosed, and, &#34;consequently, no confidence can be placed in its findings. The present Government has so little confidence in the commission that it will terminate it as soon as possible. I am not a coal-miner, but at one time I was a member of the coal-miners&#39; organization, and paid levies in support of those on strike, as I would do again if the necessity arose. There is one mine in northern New South Wales the shares in which were of a nominal value of &#163;10. When those shares had been paid up to the extent of &#163;6, the company decided to regard them as fully paid up. On those &#163;10 shares, paid up to the extent of only &#163;6, a 100 per cent, dividend was declared for several years. Another mine in New South Wales has repaid more than twice over in bonuses the whole of the capital invested, and until recently paid big dividends on capital which did not exist, because it had all been returned to the shareholders. </para>

                        <para>- If they did not work short time voluntarily they would do so compulsorily because of intermittency of employment. All the talk of their high wages is so much bunkum when the average earnings of those engaged in the industry are considered. The average wage, and not exceptional cases, is the only fair basis of comparison. If a man makes big wages on piece-work, he does so only by the expenditure of more than average energy, and, consequently, he is the sooner incapable of earning anything. Some men, who appear to think that their great strength and energy will last for ever, tear out the coal at such a rate that they outdistance the average man and make exceptionally high wages; but their term of usefulness ceases much earlier than is the case with men who work more rationally. Many miners become broken down early in life from that cause. Honorable senators should also remember that mining is a dangerous occupation. Every hour of every day that a man is underground he takes his life in his hands. There are, unfortunately, numerous instances in which men have forfeited their lives while working in coal-mines; while accidents of a minor character are so common as to appal those not acquainted with the industry. Whatever wages the miners make they can never be more than they deserve. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind was ever shown. What was claimed - and that is an entirely different matter - was that if a lower price were charged for the coal there would be a greater demand for it, and therefore more employment. That was a purely hypothetical statement. In Great Britain after the long coal strike in 1926, hours were lengthened and wages drastically lowered ; but many thousands of miners are still unemployed. Indeed, the remedy there was worse than the disease. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing worse could be substituted. The keystone of the capitalistic system is unemployment. The system would break down in no time if there was no unemployment. On the other hand, when unemployment becomes rampant, as it is now, it becomes a danger to the very system which creates and fosters it. The system is one which does not create wealth for the primary purpose of conserving the needs of the people, but wealth in the form of goods or commodities for selling at a profit. When such commodities can no longer be sold at a profit those who control them in effect refuse to produce, and, consequently, the system breaks down. </para>

                    B. Hayes referred to the imposition of high customs duties; but we have to realize that high tariffs cannot possibly lead to a perfect order of society. They become necessary in one country largely because of the adoption of high tariffs in other countries. To a great extent they are measures of retaliation, and, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline>
                    B. Hayes said, while the tariff may have the effect of increasing the number of employees in city industries, it cannot benefit every one to the same extent. The honorable senator referred to its effect on the fruit-growing industry in Tasmania; but I point out that if protective duties lead to more people being employed in the big cities, the home market for primary products must necessarily increase. Whilst protective tariffs are imposed for the benefit of those directly concerned, they are of indirect benefit to many others. I would not for a moment pin my faith to the piling up of tariffs as a means of founding a new social system; they mean only a temporary alleviation of the troubles from which the system suffers.

                <para>The subject of arbitration has received a good deal of attention during the debate. For the past twenty years we have heard the same old story concerning the manner in which industries of this country are suffering as the result of the awards of arbitration courts and similar tribunals. Some honorable senators have quoted au article which I wrote in the journal referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> - <inline font-style="italic">The PanPacific Worker</inline> - in which I decried arbitration on the ground that it practically took the fight out of the workers and caused them to lean on the courts and their officials for those improvements in industry for which formerly they had to fight in order to obtain the wages and conditions to which they are entitled.I am not going back on what I said. I was strongly in opposition to the arbitration policy of the Bruce-Page Government which wished to skittle arbitration without putting anything in its place. Honorable senators opposite have said that that Government was not opposed to arbitration, but sought either to have it entirely under Commonwealth control, or hand it over to the States. We must recollect that the Bruce-Page Government made arbitration impossible by creating a number of penal offences, and making criminals of unionists in this country who dared to do what they are free to do in Great Britain and other civilized countries. </para>

                        <para>- I dispute that. On the contrary, they have operated largely against the workers, and to a very slight extent against the employers, for the simple reason that, while the employers may be summoned and taken to court for breaches of an award, they can always get even by reducing hands and wholly or partially closing down their works, thereby throwing the whole crowd out of employment. While there is&#39; one section of the community, which owns the means of production, the land, the machinery and capital, it will always have the big end of the stick, irrespective of the arbitration laws that are passed. </para>

                        <para>- I bitterly opposed it, and lent my services towards a movement to defeat it. While in favour of the Commonwealth Government having complete industrial powers, I thought the late Government&#39;s proposal was the most absurd and reactionary that could be conceived. Instead of giving this Parliament greater powers, that Government would have shackled Parliament by taking the power to appoint a body to create industrial conditions, without giving Parliament the power to alter the conditions under which the tribunal worked, regardless of any situation which might arise. If that proposal had been carried, it would have been possible to obtain an alteration of the system only by another referendum. If the Bruce Page Government had used its ingenuity and power to devise the worst possible way in which to bring about an alteration, it could not have &#39;been more successful than it was in suggesting what it did. Perhaps honorable senators have forgotten the fact that these proposals were defeated by a much smaller majority &#34;than former proposals of a similar nature. From the time when the Fisher Government first submitted proposals for an amendment of the Constitution in regard to industrial matters, until the last occasion, the majority against such proposals has always been smaller. I am certain that if the Bruce-Page Government had submitted a sensible and rational scheme, it would have been carried, and the Labour party would have assisted it. </para>

                        <para>- There are very few subjects upon which all parties could agree. In the matter of arbitration I may say that I believe that the workers of this country should get what has  systematically  been denied to them. They should get it both ways. They should have the right to arbitration if they please, and also the right to reject arbitration and strike if they think fit. </para>

                <para>All criticism of trade unionism which I have heard during the debate has been of a carping nature. There has been no recognition on the part of honorable senators opposite of what all the greatest public men of this and the last generation regard as the greatest factor in the elevation, not only of the material, but of the moral and mental standard of the working class. No one contends that unionists are perfect or that they are superior to those in any&#39; other walk of life. There has been considerable criticism of the little mistakes that unionists have made; but their critics have ignored the fundamental principles of unionism and the part it has played in industrial affairs during its long and chequered career. Trade unionism has succeeded in preventing unscrupulous employers, who, if not in a majority, lead the majority, from beating the workers of this and every other country down to the lowest possible level. It has been organized labour that has put up a fight for better conditions than, those which they possessed. Whatever unions do, I am always behind them, not only with verbal support, but with whatever funds I can make available to assist them. </para>

There is no more valuable institution in this or in the Mother Country for improving the condition of the great masses of the people than trade unionism. Those who desert us are called scabs and blacklegs. We use these terms of opprobium advisedly to express our contempt for those who do not give allegiance to the class to which they belong. </para>

                    who, I think, has made the most valuable contribution to this debate, referred to Soviet Russia. The honorable senator approved of two principles in the constitution of that country, one of them being that it should be not only a responsibility but a privilege for a person to prepare himself to defend his own country. The second was that every citizen should give service to the community on the principle that he who does not work neither shall he eat.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline>
                    commented on those two principles in order to eulogize the system of compulsory training which our Government has seen fit to suspend. The honorable senator got very near to being just on that occasion ; he just missed the point, which is that the obligation on the part of the people of Soviet Russia to be prepared to defend their country exists because of the second principle to which the honorable senator has referred. When the honorable senator uses his influence to try to bring about a similar condition of affairs in Australia this party may reconsider its attitude in regard to military training. I consider that a man is a fool to prepare himself to defend this country on behalf of its capitalists. If I were of military age I should not raise a finger to assist those individuals, from who we not only reap no benefits, but receive disadvantages, by reason of the heavy burdens that we have to carry on their behalf. Prior to the Great War, no politicians would have dared to restrain the liberty of the people by introducing such measures as the Crimes Act. the Transport Workers Act, and a certain amendment of the Industrial Arbitration Act. Those actions were scandalous infringements of our liberty.

                <para>Take, again, the ban by the late Government on working class literature. That was a direct affront to every adult worker in Australia. The Government took to itself absolute power to dictate what should be read and what adults should be forbidden to read, just as a father might do with a little child whose mind was immature. We were told that we should not be permitted  to read anything considered by the Government to be unfit for us, on the principle that we might run amok after absorbing the proscribed literature. That was a denial of freedom to which no past generation would have submitted without raising the greatest outcry that has ever been heard in the country. Unless our own Government quickly repeals that infamous embargo, I shall be as bitter in my attack upon it as I am upon the last Government in the matter. It is an inconceivable insult to every adult in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I did not say that. Those who associate the censorship of obscene with that of political literature, forget the existence of one fundamental difference. Theoretically, it may be claimed that no one has any more right to dictate whether I shall read a moral or an immoral book, than he has to say that I should not read a revolutionary treatise. But here is the difference : The political literature to which I have referred can, by its composition, only appeal to adults. Young children would not&#39; understand the import of the words contained in such works, whereas obscene literature is couched in such language that it appeals particularly to the minds of the young, and to their detriment. That is the difference between literature of a seditious &#39;and revolutionary character, and obscene literature. That difference is quite wide enough for a broad distinction to be drawn between them, and what should be done in one case is no criterion, of what should be done in the other. </para>

                <para>I come now to the assertion that the Labour party received assistance from the picture interests during the last general election. Personally, I very seldom patronize picture palaces, as I do not like the ordinary type of picture. I believe they do more harm to the morals of the young than any other method of propaganda. T have nothing against Americans individually, although collectively I think that country is the most jingoistic power on earth. It is most callous in its disregard of the needs of other nations. We owe the United States of America nothing. That country has done every thing possible to shut out our few exports by raising a high tariff wall, whereas, unfortunately, our people use a great deal more of their products than they need to. I am not speaking out of sympathy to Americans, whether they be regarded as  monopolists or otherwise. Although it is claimed that the New South Wales picture interests, after raising a great outcry against the imposition of the proposed amusement tax, were about to fall into the arms of Labour. I point out that, for some mysterious reason, about three or four weeks prior to the recent election, we heard no more of their protests. Personally, I did not know of any one receiving a red cent of their money. The campaign director for the Labour party convened a meeting of those concerned immediately after the election, and made an appeal for money because our funds had, on the strength of our good name, been overdrawn by &#163;12,0.00. The followers of the party liquidated that debt by means of donations from trade unions and sympathisers. The opposition of this party to the proposal to impose that amusement tax was raised from the outset, before the proprietors of the picture concerns had time to make any outcry. It is our belief that, in spite of the assurances of honorable senators opposite that the tax would not be passed on, the people who patronized the picture shows would have had to pay it, and the vast majority of them are workers and their families. I believe that even the workers are entitled to a little amusement sometimes. </para>
                <para>I desire to say something about the attacks made upon the Labour party in regard to Soviet Russia and communism. I say cheerfully that if any one reads the objective of the Labour party, the socialization of industry under democratic control, he will find no fundamental difference between that and communism. Both aim at exactly the same goal. </para>

                        <para>- It is. If honorable senators will read <inline font-style="italic">Free from Bias,</inline> with their minds freed from theological prejudice, they will find that the founder of Christianity was a Communist, if he was anything. The early church was purely communistic both in regard to its teaching and the practice of its followers. So far I can see there is nothing of a criminal character or that condemns a man to obloquy in the profession of communism. I have never been a member of the communistic party, but I &#39; believe that that body has the same right to place its opinions before the people, and to endeavour to secure their support, as has any other. I object to the tendency on the part of those who happen to be in the majority to persecute and practically to dub as criminals all those who differ fundamentally from themselves. </para>

                <para>Honorable senators opposite have been trying to attribute the ills of this country to the alleged evils of high wages, due to Australian industrial awards. Honorable senator after honorable senator opposite b&#187;s claimed that our production is being harassed, that our employers are upset; that those who can do so will invest their money elsewhere rather than put it into industry, owing to the evil effects of arbitration. Yet, what is the position of the United States of America, with all its huge resources, its wonderful advance in scientific and technical matters, its enormous population, its home market, and its practical lack of trade unionism? There unionism exists only amongst the highly skilled artisans; they are the only people to receive high wages, and they do not represent more than 5 to 10 per cent, of the workers of that country. In spite of the individualism for which the United States of America is famed, and of its claim that every man there may do as he likes and invest his money as he desires,- recent statistics disclose that unemployment in that country is practically on a par with unemployment in Great Britain. We know that the number of unemployed in Great Britain is great, and that even since the advent of the Ramsay MacDonald Government it has increased. So that even if we take individualistic countries like the United States of America or semi-socialistic countries like our own, or even if we regard Asiatic countries where cheap labour exists at about 10d. a day, and where there are millions of workers, we find that unemployment is rampant, with its attendant wretchedness, destitution, vice and crime. We also discover that those conditions are in the main attributable to the failure of capitalism to support in decent comfort the people of the community. Until that system is abolished, no efforts can be more than palliatives of existing conditions. We cannot hope fundamentally to cure those evils until we deal with fundamental causes. The fundamental causes of these evils is that while we have capitalist production we have anarchy in distribution while we talk about giving a basic wage and settling things on systematic lines we over look an important fact. Take a case where inquiry is being made into what should be the basic wage. Witnesses from various sections of the working class are examined. They bring into the court articles of wearing apparel, and the prices of these articles are compared.  Evidence is taken to show just how much clothing women and children require to live decently, how much food they consume, and even what it costs to purchase toothbrushes, powder puffs, and so forth. Evidence is taken as to how much they spend on newspapers, amusements and life insurance. All these confidential details are gone into exhaustively to ascertain the minimum amount on which an employee can live. At the same time employers are totally exempt from examination of a similar character. We do not know whether they live on .turkeys and truffles, or whether they give 50 guineas for dresses or cloaks. No evidence is taken to show what dividends they draw, what incomes they enjoy, or what they spend on pleasures or vices - there is nothing to show what it costs to maintain them in  their positions. Until both sides are treated equally in this respect, until both are subjected to the same humiliation, I object to one class being signalled out in order to ascertain the minimum amount on which it can maintain sufficient energy to earn more dividends for the employers who are exempt from these humiliating investigations. </para>
                <para>I want honorable senators opposite to know that we are not out as a class to beg concessions from the employers. We are out to get them. And if we cannot get them by one means we shall get them by any other means available. We are under no obligations to employers. When we work for a man we give him considerably more than we get in return in the shape of wages. Otherwise he would not employ us. The dignity of the workers is as great as that of honorable senators opposite who, whether they are workers or not, in their official positions, have the powers of wealth, money, and influence behind them. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that that is so. That is another fault that I have to find with the existing order of things. The gentleman, who is a barrister and is the servant of any one who will give him the biggest fee to argue that black is white, becomes sacrosanct, the mirror of impartiality, never does anything crook, and is quite incapable of taking sides or showing bias as soon as he is put en the bench. It is most regrettable that we cannot criticize judges. I remember hearing a judge hurling an offensive epithet  at a witness the moment he was sworn in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. When two men were tried for an offence connected with the Broken Hill strike one man was acquitted by a jury and the other a day or two later convicted by another jury. The same judge went out of his way to say that the man who had escaped should have been found guilty. I know that many judges make remarks quite unworthy of the positions they hold, and, consequently, I say that no worthy judge need fear criticism, and one who is not worthy deserves it. It is not for me to lay down any strict law saying &#34; This is good and this is bad,&#34; but I maintain that if a judge, by his general conduct, merits the support, approval and veneration of the community, he will get it and if occasionally some individual in the community abuses his position, no matter how objectionable the abuse may be, it is better that he should be allowed to go free than that judges should be placed on a pedestal of sanctity and all criticism of them forbidden. </para>

                <para>But I wish to revert to the John Brown case. What  We  objected to was that while unionists who committed breaches of the law were fined and promptly dealt with - whoever the judges were it was certainly the Government that instituted the prosecutions - while the transport workers were dealt with at very short notice and given no time to retrace their steps, the Bruce Page Government withdrew its proceedings against John Brown, although long drawn out and exhaustive inquiries had ascertained that there was a prima facie case against him and a summons had been issued. There may not be one law for the rich and another for the poor, but there is certainly one rule for administering the law in the case of the rich and another for administering it in the case of the poor. The Labour party does not believe in the penal provisions of the Arbitration Act. It has no desire to prosecute either John Brown or the timber workers. Its decision in the John Brown case is therefore not inconsistent with its policy. There is, however, another point. The proper time to proceed against John Brown was immediately the offence had been committed. If the psychological moment is allowed to slip by it is a mistake to launch a prosecution at a later date. </para>

                <para>It was almost a crime for the Bruce Page Government not to take the steps which the present Government has taken to stop immigration when we had thousands of people unemployed in Australia. It is not a question of whether our immigrants are Southern Europeans or Britishers. While we leave our doors open to those who like to come here voluntarily, with certain necessary restrictions, of course, we should do nothing to encourage, still less to spend our own scanty income in assisting, people to come here when we have no means of absorbing them. Honorable senators opposite admit that there are many unemployed in Australia. No one can deny that there are tens of thousands of them. The old story that every fresh migrant makes more work for the people already here if carried to its logical conclusion would mean that the most thickly populated country would be the safest to receive immigrants; that England and Belgium should be better off than Australia, and that China and India should be rolling in luxury and affluence. As a matter of fact the whole question is whether immigrants can be absorbed. If they can be absorbed in the industries of a country without displacing others they add to the national wealth. If they cannot be so absorbed they simply add to the national poverty and to the national disgrace that people cannot obtain means of livelihood in a country with the vast potentialities that Australia possesses. There can be no greater indictment of the absolute failure of the present day system than the fact that unemployment is rampant in all countries. </para>

                        <para>- Russia offers no objection to recording the number of those who are out of work. The Soviet Government points out that as the cities grow, absorbing a greater number of workers, who live under better conditions than the rural population, there is a tendency on the part of the peasantry to flock into the cities. But before they can be absorbed in employment provision must be made for them. In a country where great changes have taken place it would be impossible even under the most ideal conditions to bring every one into employment immediately. Although Russia withdrew from the war before its termination it lost more of its citizens than any of the other combatant nations, and subsequently it endured three or four years of what could scarcely be called civil war, because it was instigated and assisted by every one of the great powers. The Home Secretary in the Lloyd George Government stated in the House of Commons in reply to a question, that Great Britain had spent, in munitions and actual cash advances, over &#163;100,000,000 to assist the counter revolution in Russia to break down the Bolshevik r&#233;gime - to defeat a government with which Great Britain was not officially at war. Troops were also sent from the United States of America, Japan, Germany, France and Italy. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. British warships bombarded Archangel. Furthermore, Great Britain and the other nations subsidized Kolchak, Wrangel, Denikin, and every Russian leader that revolted against the Soviet regime. But in spite of the forces arrayed against it the Red Army in Russia eventually crushed the counter revolutionary movement. These protracted struggles caused the destruction of an immense area of cultivated land, as well as thousands of miles of railway line. Thousands of bridges were blown up and millions of railway sleepers were piled in heaps and burnt, and the blockade rendered it impossible to get even medical requirements into the war torn districts for the use of the wounded and sick in the hospitals. Notwithstanding all these attacks, backed up by the combined powers of the so-called civilized nations, the Soviet system of government survives, and instead of having the poverty, misery and degradation which characterized the centuries of Czarist despotism, Russia is gradually emerging from her troubles and re-building her industries. In many respects she has reached a stage of production greater than that prior to the war. All this goes to prove that there is something to be said for the other side, despite the attacks on the Soviet system by those who are continually deriding the leaders of Russia to-day. </para>

Why should we induce people living in other countries to break up their homes, sever all their associations and family ties to come to Australia only to be thrown on the scrap heap when they get here or else filch a job from some one else who has to be displaced in their favour? There could be no greater tragedy than that. Surely no one suggests that any person would leave his own country and come to Australia merely for the pleasure of travelling. </para>

                        <para>- In the majority of cases, a man leaves his own country only when the industrial conditions there are intolerable, or nearly so. Consequently, if a man breaks up his home and severs all his associations to come to Australia, this country should be in a position to absorb him in industry. If it is not able to absorb him, those who induce him to come here are committing a crime against him. I have seen copies of glowing advertisements published in the English newspapers, apparently at the instigation, or, at all events, with the connivance of, the Commonwealth Government, through its representatives at Australia House, setting out the wonderful opportunities for people who come to Australia, telling them there is work to be had at high wages, or land to be obtained on easy terms. We know, of course, that all these statements are absolutely false. </para>

                <para>So far as Southern Europeans are concerned, the only objection I have to them is that, being ignorant of our language and accustomed to conditions worse than our own, they can be used the more readily to break down our standards of living. It is for that reason that I consider it dangerous for this, or any other, country to have too great a proportion of foreigners in times of acute industrial depression. It is a fact that they are being used to break down our industrial conditions. It is alleged, in some instances, that if they are in work, they are getting the award rates of wages. We have ample proof to the contrary, but, unfortunately, the evidence would not be accepted in a court of law. In many instances these foreigners are alleged to be working at award rates, but actually they are sharing a contract with one of their own countrymen, and not getting standard wages. These things are being done, even by some of our own people. They are supposed to be getting a certain wage, but they have to allow the boss a rebate, so that actually they are not in receipt of the award rate. If this can be done with our own people, how much more easily may it be done in the case of foreigners, who are unable to speak the English language? Unless we can first make provision for the employment of migrants, without displacing our own people, it is criminal on our part to induce them to come to Australia. I hope, therefore, that steps will be taken to prevent any assisted migration until the whole of our own unemployed are absorbed, and that is not likely for some considerable time. </para>
                <para>One of the chief reasons for the unemployment that exists to-day is the growth of mechanical inventions.

                        <para>- I do not. Increased production will merely mean a still further glut in the world&#39;s markets, unless it is possible to increase the purchasing power of the people. This cry about increased production is obviously a fallacy. I advise honorable senators to consider the position in Great Britain at the time of the great coal strike. Exactly the same condition of affairs exists in Australia to-day, fuel, oil, and the development of hydro-electric schemes have lessened the demand for coal for industrial purposes. The depression in the coal industry in Great Britain was partly due to the poverty of the nations, consequent on the war, resulting in a decreased demand for British coal. It was further stated that the trouble could be cured by increasing production. This meant longer hours of work; but, instead of curing the evil, the methods adopted intensified it. As we know, the British Government abolished the seven-hour day and substituted a working day of eight hours. At the same time a drastic cut was made in the wages of the miners. What has been the result? There has been more unemployment in the coal-mining industry in Great Britain since then, and those who are in employment are living under wretched social conditions. </para>

                        <para>- If there had been no war the Ruhr mines would still have been producing. Under the reparations scheme, coal was sent to Prance in excess of her needs, and some of it was shipped to Great Britain. Consequently, while British miners had to submit to a reduction in wages, the mine-owners were able to pay dividends by the importation of reparation coal. The miner depended solely upon his wage-earning capacity; but the owners had at their command profits earned in more lucrative times and invested in other industrial concerns, including shipping, which enabled them to live while the miners were starving. All these facts go to show the utter inability of the present system to cope with the demands of modern civilization to remedy the state of anarchy which prevails and make it possible for the great bulk of the people to live decent lives. This continuous struggle between the fortunate possessors of the most modern methods of production and those who depend on employers for the right to work and&#34; live is the class struggle, about which we hear so much. </para>

                <para>I have heard people talk about the class war as if the term were invented by trades hall agitators whose one desire is to ensure their own livelihood. The class struggle is as old as humanity itself; but it has been intensified in modern times because of the enormous increase in production and the remarkable disparity between those who own and those who do not. This class struggle is going on, and will continue until the working class subdues the other class ; until we reach that stage in our social evolution mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> when he who does not work neither shall he eat; when there shall be no wealthy investors, and no John Browns who can indulge in the maintenance of expensive horse-racing establishments while their employees starve. The working-class movement will continue to organize and solidify its ranks, till it has the power and the strength to overthrow the existing conditions. </para>

It is said of Mark Twain that, when asked if ho believed in an equal division of the good things of the world, he said &#34; Not as a general practice, but I would not mind trying it once.&#34; All this talk about the objective of the socialists being an equal division of the world&#39;s wealth has no foundation. I have never yet heard a socialist seriously make such a proposal as that. It is simply a figment of. the imagination of those who desire to cast ridicule upon the movement. A better organization under a saner system of society is urgently needed to replace the present condition of chaos and barbarism, which is the worst the world has experienced for the last 2,000 years. Other systems of reform are merely palliatives. We shall have to get down to fundamentals and make both land and machinery the property of the whole of the people. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that they have all been successes. A great deal depends on their management. The great irrigation works at Yanco, for instance, has resulted in the loss of large sums of money. But take the case of the State brick works in New South Wales. Prior to their establishment there was a brick combine. If a builder ordered a quantity of bricks from one man the order was sent on to the secretary of the combine, and if, after consulting his records, he found that that particular  brickmaker  had already supplied his quota, the order was passed on to another manufacturer. That was done openly in New South Wales. Prices were raised tremendously. The establishment of the State brick works resulted in the price of bricks being reduced. Those works supplied for governmental works millions of bricks which otherwise would have been bought from the combine at greatly inflated prices. The State brick works have paid since their establishment. Again, the State Monier pipe works have not only paid their way; they have also repaid the whole of the capital invested in them. They are still paying dividends. The Walsh Island engineering shops have also been a paying proposition. </para>

                        <para>- -Not always, for sometimes they squander the money of investors. When honorable senators opposite talk about the injury done to our credit in Britain . by the despatch of a certain cable to the Home authorities I am reminded that &#34; wild cat &#34; schemes in Australia, in which British investors have lost their money, have done Australian credit infinitely more harm. I instance the Commonwealth Oil Corporation which started the Newnes shale works, in which money was squandered wholesale. A man who occupied a deputy-managerial position there told me that young fellows who were relatives of some of the big shareholders, came out from Great Britain to fill &#34; cushy &#34; jobs, although they did not know the difference between shale and blue metal. They were a parasitical drag on the whole concern. In another town a copper mine was started and a huge chimney stack was erected in the wrong place, and had to be re-erected elsewhere. After a huge dam had been excavated in another case, it was found that it was on a higher level than the creek which was to supply it with water. Private enterprise which had sunk the dam was unable to induce the water to run up hill, and, therefore, the dam remained empty. Numerous instances of that nature can be seen throughout the country, but they do not receive the same publicity that is given to failures in State enterprises. </para>

                        <para>- I hold that it is better to spend money wisely than unwisely, for money spent unwisely is a dead loss, whether spent by a government or a private concern. The existence of a number of State enterprises does not necessarily constitute socialism. The socialising of a few industries while others are left in the hands of private enterprise is not socialism. Under a proper system of socialism the common needs of the people are collectively controlled. The starting of one enterprise of a so-called socialistic character in a capitalistic world is not the way to prove its success or otherwise. </para>

                <para>The time is ripe for drastic alterations to our Constitution. I object to handing over control of arbitration to the States because it would mean not one system but half a dozen different systems. The time is ripe for an increase and not a decrease of the powers of the Commonwealth. Industry is so widespread and so interlocked, not only between State and State, but also between country and country, that the sooner it can be placed under one authority the better. There should be another democratically elected convention to revise the Federal Constitution. The recommendations of the convention would, of course, have to be submitted to the electors for their approval or otherwise. That would ensure a proper security, while providing that elasticity which is necessary to meet changing conditions. In the United States of America there is, in. addition to the Federal Constitution, a constitution for each of the several States. Some of them were granted in the days of English  monarchs,  when those States were British colonies; but after the War of Independence they were revised. A number of those State constitutions provide for their own periodical revision by an elected convention which may make whatever amendments are deemed wise. A similar provision in our constitution would be a great advance on the present hide-bound constitution under which we live. </para>

                <para class="block">Parliament of New South Wales over 30 years ago, I was a critic of the Federal Constitution when an enabling bill was introduced into the State Parliament by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes. I then condemned the more or less unnatural and hybrid form of the Constitution which embodies some portions of the Constitution of the United States of America with a number of British principles, without blending them. I am still of that opinion. The recent decision that the British dominions are practically independent nations is an additional reason for the revision of our Constitution. We should know exactly where we stand in relation to the other dominions and the centre of the Empire. It would have been well had the British Parliament passed a short act declaring that the self-governing dominions were independent. There could have been an agreement for the settlement by arbitration of any disputes that might arise. Those who believe that the British Empire is different from other empires, and will survive where they have crashed, are hugging a delusion. There cannot be a political or economic union, of widely scattered countries where there is no physical union. The differences which exist between the component parts of the British Empire are already revealing themselves. Our recent decision to prohibit the exportation of stud sheep was directed chiefly against another part of the Empire having the same rights and privileges as we have, and a similar constitution to our own. That embargo was directed chiefly against South Africa, because it was felt that that country was a potential rival to Australia in the wool industry. For the same reason the Government of South Africa some time ago refused to allow ostrich eggs to be exported to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, eleven years ago. Even if they were uttered only yesterday there is no disgrace in changing one&#39;s opinions. Many of us once had the idea that the compulsory military training of all citizens would lead to that equality of service which some claim for the system, and would make all citizens subject to the same discipline. We also thought it would prevent the growth of the military system by dispensing with the necessity for a standing army; we accepted it as the lesser evil. My experience, however, has been that it has not had a good moral effect. While I believe in discipline, I contend that self discipline is the only true discipline. As a result of experience I have found that the evils associated with a system of compulsory military training are a hundredfold greater than the benefits attaching to it. During the war three of my sons were in the training camp at Liverpool. Two were there for a period of three months, and later another went into camp and did not have an opportunity of getting away for nine months. The first two who were in camp told me that it was impossible to leave anything of the slightest value lying about without it being stolen, and that even a used tooth brush would be taken. </para>

Under the compulsory military system there is no equality in the matter of training. Boys attending the Sydney Grammar School, and other such educational institutions, are drilled during school hours, while the sons of working men have to lose their Saturday half-holiday in order to undertake their training. Those who belong to the well-to-do class, those who were attending the higher-grade schools, were trained in what was virtually their school time, and, therefore, did not lose any recreation. They were entirely distinct from the common herd. </para>

                <para>I wish now to refer to some of the incidents associated with the early training of compulsory trainees. I mention, as an instance, the case of Harry Flintoff who was imprisoned for his refusal to train. According to an anti-conscription publication, I find that - </para>

                    <para>Harry Flintoff did not drill or perform any alternative service during his first imprisonment. To some persons, his refusal to accept non-combatant duties may appear to be unreasonable. We ask such critics this question : &#34; If you were holding the coats of two men fighting, would you not feel that you were aiding and abetting the fight?&#34; And. again, &#34; If either pugilist killed the others would you not, in part, be responsible for his death?&#34; </para>

                    <para>Do the framers of the act imagine for one moment that they can hoodwink conscientious men and women by a verbal distinction between combatant and non-combatant? An army is an engine of combat in all its branches. It is not against the mere firing of a rifle that conscience rebels; it is against the whole spirit and purpose of combat for which the military machine is called into being. </para>

                        <para>- There is no difference in principle. A non-combatant is aiding war-like activities. There were numerous cases similar  to  that which I have quoted, and frequently I had occasion  to  take exception  to  the treatment meted out to trainees. The publication  to  which I have referred reports  the  case of Thomas Roberts with which I was personally acquainted, in this way- </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Great relief and not a little jubilation must have been felt by the military officers and heads of the Defence Department when Harry Flintoff&#39;s resistance was broken. One can imagine the &#34;strong men&#34;  amongst  them rubbing their hands - or more likely, tapping their canes against their leggings - and saying, &#34;We told you so.&#34; Only a little firmness is necessary, all this foolishness will stop. </para>
                    <para>In this jubilant spirit, and flushed with success, the Queenscliff officers, during the early days of June, 1914, took in hand the Quaker lad Tom Roberts, aged 16, for his first term of imprisonment of 21 days. Although no worse than that of several others - Flintoff, Size, Yeo, and Giles - the treatment of this boy was destined to give full publicity to the shameful happenings taking place under the name of military discipline in the military prisons. His affair, coming so soon after and so much resembling Flintoff&#39;s, could not he ignored, even by parliamentarians determined to whitewash conscription. </para>
                    <para>Here, again, we prefer to let the lad&#39;s case be told rather than tell it. So the next paragraphs arc just a cutting from the Federal <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 18th June, 1914. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs</inline> is speaking. He says - </para>
                    <para>Only to-day I received the following letter :  - 125 New-street, Middle Brighton, 19th June, 1914. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline></para>
                <para>Finding I am unable to obtain justice from the Defence Department, I write earnestly appealing to you to kindly use your influence in connexion with the unjust treatment of our lad, who, through loyalty to his parents&#39; views of Christian teaching, is undergoing solitary confinement in the cells at Queenscliff fortress. </para>
                <para>Tom is a lad of16, and was sent to Queenscliff on Wednesday last for 21 days, for refusing to train under the Defence Act. My wife and I are members of the Society of Friends, and hold strong views on the matter of militarism, which is a vital one in the religion of the Quakers, and, however you may differ from me on this point, I am quite sure, as a man, you will agree that this is not the treatment for a boy of 10, even if he had committed a crime. </para>
                <para>For continuing in his refusal the boy was placed in a cell next the guard-room on Thursday night, where he was confined until 11 o&#39;clock on Saturday morning, and then court-martialled. The military court then order him to be placed in the cell for seven days. He is locked in a cell 10 feet by 10 feet, built of wood, with an iron door. It has no window, the light coming in through a grating. He has a wooden stretcher; the mattress and blankets are taken away in the morning and not brought back till dark. He has half an hour&#39;s exercise in the morning, and again in the afternoon. He is on half diet; has not been allowed to read, nor to write to his parents. </para>
                <para>We were quite unaware of this treatment of him until we visited Queenscliff on Monday, when we found him looking worse than when seen five days previously. This we attributed to the mental strain of solitary comment, a recent illness of a month in bed, and to the reduced diet - after lunch on Satin day he received only bread and water until breakfast on Sunday. </para>
                <para>The civil court ordered the boy into military custody, but surely it is going beyond the intentions of the citizen army for a court-martial to be allowed to step in after a case has been dealt with by the civil court. Furthermore, solitary confinement should never be ordered. The question may well be asked: Is this  a  citizen army, controlled by Parliament, or a military army, controlled by the Military Board? A Melbourne lawyer states that solitary confinement is considered inhuman, and only used in the case of refractory criminals of the worst type. </para>
                <para>My wife and I earnestly appeal for your influence in this distressing matter. . . . </para>
                <para>Yours very sincerely, (Sgd.) F. J.  Roberts. </para>
                <para>That letter only reached me to-day( continued <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs).</inline> I understand that the boy has now been taken out of solitary confinement. All authorities are opposed to solitary confinement as a punishment, even for prisoners who have committed crimes like theft. Imagine a boy being  placed in a room by himself, and kept there day and night, without being allowed to read or write, for a period of a week. </para>

                    ; It is scandalous. I do not think that any member of either House would say that a cadet refusing to drill should be punished with solitary confinement. It would have been better to compel this lad to read than to prevent him from reading. Authorities in various parts of the world are challenging the wisdom of imprisoning as a means of reforming the adult criminal, and surely it is, to say the least, an abnormality to put into solitary confinement boys who, under the direction of their parents, refuse to drill.

The argument that compulsory training provides valuable discipline is, in my opinion, absolutely wrong.

They were taught to do everything in an endeavour effectively to slaughter a man. </para>

                        <para>- If there is one thing more than another that produces war, it is preparedness for it. A nation cannot make what the military authorities believe to be adequate preparations for war without imbuing in the trainees a desire to try their hand at that work. The doctrine of preparedness for war as a remedy for peace is a doctrine of hell, and should be consigned there. It is totally opposed to all human experience. I hope that the self -governing dominions of the Empire will become imbued with a self-respect that will induce them to inform the sovereign power, Great Britain, if she ever seeks to call them into another world war, that they will not humbly and dumbly follow her if there is any possibility for them to remain neutral. That would be a greater evidence of our wisdom and morality than to rush eagerly into warfare to glorify a great Empire. </para>

                <para>I think that the military razor gangs of the world have inflicted enough harm on the community, and that we should take steps to institute amicable relations between all countries. Instead of indulging that national egotism which boasts about its own virtues we should be prepared to meet other nations face to face in a friendly manner, and assume a decent responsibility. So long as the capitalistic system exists the League of Nations, the Kellogg and Locarno Pacts, can do nothing to prevent war. The League of Nations is the great illusion of the present age; it is a league that will precipitate the world into war. It is composed of all the victors of the Great War, the rabble from the Versailles Conference. </para>

Furthermore, the small nations, oppressed by the larger nations, have no remedy when aggrieved. I cite the example of the Italian attack upon the Greeks on the Island of Corfu. Innocent women and children, the occupants of a convent, were killed and, when the case was brought before the League of Nations, that body fined the Greeks, apparently because some of their people were killed! </para>

                        <para>- I am repeating statements made in the daily press. Certain Italians, allegedly making explorations in Albania, came into&#39; conflict with some Greeks, and were killed. On the strength of mere allegations, and without investigation, the Italian Government, under Mussolini, sent armed ships to the island of Corfu and blew up a number of the residents, including a number of children, under the care of a convent. The League of Nations then adjudicated in the matter, and fined the Greeks for having allegedly allowed some of their subjects to commit murder. Italy collected the fine. </para>

                        <para>- I do not admit that to be a high tribunal. In the circumstances, I say that it is a dastardly tribunal. I believe that the League of Nations is injurious, inasmuch as it misleads people to believe that its existence is a guarantee of peace. The most conservative individual must admit that the last war was, in its final analysis, the result of commercial friction between the greater powers of Europe. The cause of the conflict was an avariciousness to control the world&#39;s markets, and the position is more intensified now than it ever was. With every new country that comes into the manufacturing arena, and begins to manufacture where it used to import, the position becomes more acute, and finally will cause conflicts which must lead to war. For that reason, we should endeavour to organize the workers of the world to fraternize one with the other, and to determine to resist the machinations of the capitalistic system, which has brought about the world&#39;s suffering and degradation. </para>

                    <para>. - I did not anticipate having to reply when I moved the Address-in-Reply in this chamber. But certain honorable senators opposite have deliberately misunderstood the position, or have failed thoroughly to grasp what I intended to convey when I referred to political trickery. It was my intention to make it apparent that, at the last election, the people had before them a clear-cut issue, devoid of all the misleading side-tracks that have been associated with federal elections for so many years. Time after time the Labour party has been accused of fraternizing with bolsheviks and communists; red herrings of all descriptions have been drawn across the trail. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>This party was accused of aiding and abetting in the strikes that so frequently occurred just prior to the holding of general elections. It was unfortunate for Labour that those troubles took place at such a time; but it was still more unfortunate that it should be accused of aiding and abetting them. The people of Australia were tricked by the Bruce-Page Government when it declared that it would deport Walsh and Johnson if returned to power. </para>
                <para>I also referred in <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> speech to the Bruce-Page Government having endeavoured to put back the clock 25 years. My reference was to its endeavour to abolish Federal arbitration. There is no question that had the Federal Government been returned to power, State arbitration would also have been abolished. </para>

                <para>I have said that from the suggested competition for a cure for unemployment, the one known remedy must necessarily be excluded. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> knows from experience what that remedy is. It was his sound appreciation of the economics of the position that led him to induce the railway employees of Great Britain to accept reduced wages as an alternative to unemployment. Reduced working hours mean only reduced production, reduced spending power, reduced prosperity, and increased unemployment. </para>

                <para class="block">It is really necessary to go through the whole of the article to convey the meaning intended, but the fact remains that the honorable senator&#39;s idea is that there is only one way out of our present difficulty. With others he recognizes that Australia is hard pressed. The Government also recognizes it and is doing its best to meet the situation, but the only suggestion advanced by the Nationalists is that a greater sacrifice should be demanded from the wage-earner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> has inferred that because the coal-miners and other workers are not prepared to accept a reduced wage or work longer hours and harder, they are necessarily lazy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> has laid stress on the fact that the use of concrete and steel in building construction in the cities has displaced a number of carpenters. Industrial strife cannot be blamed for that state of affairs. A considerable amount of labour is thrown out of employment by the use of mechanical contrivances, which we all realize must largely take the place of the human machine. We have had instance after instance of men engaged in railway construction work being displaced by the use of mechanical navvies. But it is useless to say to the men so displaced that they should work longer hours or harder, or work for a reduced wage. The fact remains that they have no work to do, and as the machinery which displaces them is probably made overseas, Australia is thus losing, in the matter of employment, at both ends. If we have twenty men working eight hours a day and find that we can dispense with ten of them by the use of machinery, the only logical conclusion is that if twenty men are to be kept in employment,- we must dispense with the machinery or call upon the men to work shorter hours, so that the work available may be distributed among all. It would be absurd to ask half of the number to work longer hours and harder in order that the other half might be kept at work. I am one of those who believe in the employment of machinery, but if it should not give a proper return, or if it should not prove of benefit to us, why cannot we follow the old method and keep our people employed on the old lines? The Labour party stands for improving the lot of the people. </para>
                <para>The Nationalist Government was in power for nearly seven years, and although it was well aware that there were thousands of Australians out of employment, it made no endeavour to prevent others from coming to this country. </para>

                        <para>- The Government is doing whatever it can for him. We realize that he is in a most helpless position. Whereas the ordinary labourer, who works under an award of the Arbitration Court, has some idea of what he will get for his labour, the farmer has no idea of what he will get for his. He works long hours, and is certainly entitled to more than he gets, but he simply places his product on the market, asks the purchaser what he is prepared to give for it, and accepts the price offered. The trouble is that certain interests fix the prices of primary produce. The Government has at present no control over them, but it hopes in future to be in a position to exercise some control over the prices that will be obtained for primary produce. </para>

                        <para>- No project is too big for us to tackle. Starvation is staring many of our people in the face. Every day additional men are being thrown out of employment, and we cannot stand idly by. It is useless to keep on harping about bolshevism and about the control of the Labour party being in the hands of reds and extremists. Such talk gets us nowhere. In any case, it is merely political trickery, such as enabled the late Government to maintain its hold on the Treasury benches for years. The people can no longer be deluded into the belief that the Labour party consists of a lot of revolutionary madmen. It is no recommendation for the late administration that the new Government should have come into office to find great armies of men. starving in Australia. I hope that by the time the present Government has been in office for seven years, something will have been accomplished to remove all this unemployment. I shall be very disappointed if such is not the case. </para>

                        <para>- I doubt if there has been any improvement in Queensland as the result of the change of government. I know that immediately the Nationalist party secured control in the State, it allowed the squatters to reduce wages by abolishing the rural workers&#39; award, and in !New South Wales there is no question about _ the Government&#39;s intention to abolish the rural workers&#39; award, with the object of permitting bargaining to be resumed. That is to say, advantage is to be taken of the unfortunate position of the workers of Australia, who to-day are tramping the country in search of food. I have read articles in the press in which certain agents have stated that they can find employment for quite a number of people in country districts of New South Wales if the rural workers&#39; award is swept aside and the workers are allowed to accept work at a small wage. Twenty-five years ago, before arbitration laws  were in operation, many men worked for low wages, and some for no return at all. It was not uncommon for men to work for a month or so for a road contractor, under the contract system - for which the Nationalist party stands to discover later that he had nothing with which to pay them, or that the cheques he gave would not be honoured by any one in a country town. Therefore a man working for such road contractors never had a remedy. That happened to me, so I can speak with some authority on the subject. In those days there was no arbitration court award and no eight-hours day. Employment was a matter of arrangement.  A  road contractor for whom I worked owed me money which I could not get. I .worked for fifteen days at the rate of 10s. a day, although at that time the ordinary pay was 8s. a day. One morning I discovered that overnight he had <inline font-style="italic">gone to</inline> the local storekeeper, who was really the contractor, and, having drawn the money owing to him, disappeared without paying me. </para>

                        <para>- It was a common experience for employees of road contractors in those days. If an employee asked how much he was going to get the contractor would say that he would see what the man was worth, and it was a common experience for a man after working for three or four weeks, to be paid only portion of the wages owing to him, and to have to wait till the end of the contract for . the balance due. To put an end to that state of affairs the working class organized themselves into unions and decided to support a government that pledged itself to bring in legislation for their protection. Arbitration was then instituted, and from that day onwards the worker knew what his hours of work would be and also how much he was entitled to get. Although conditions to-day are not what we should like them to be, they are infinitely better than the conditions that obtained 25 years ago. Employers are legally bound to honour awards and to give employees reasonable working conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> commented upon the silence of honorable senators supporting the Government concerning the dispute in the coal-mining industry. No one knows better than honorable senators opposite what steps have been taken to reopen the mines in New South Wales. This Government has left no stone unturned to overcome the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- I have yet to learn that the mine-owners were prepared to compromise. I understood they were definitely pledged to stand to their original proposal that the miners should suffer a reduction of1s. a ton or 12&#189; per cent. The terms of settlement are somewhat bettor than that. It is all very well for honorable senators opposite to declare that the miners should have compromised at an earlier stage in the dispute. If they themselves were in the position of the miners they would be equally reluctant to accept auy reduction in wages or an increase in the hours of labour. We should endeavour to view all these disputes through the eyes of those most intimately concerned. I say, therefore, that the miners very properly held out for the terms which their leaders had laid down. I know what all these reductions in wages mean to the workers. No matter how economical a man may be, he never has anything to spare from one pay day to another, especially if he has a wife and family dependent upon him, and he would be a spineless creature if he were not prepared to put up a fight in their interests. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> respects every man who has the spirit to stand up for what he believes to be his rights. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> in his references to migration declared that the Labour party took the narrow view.
