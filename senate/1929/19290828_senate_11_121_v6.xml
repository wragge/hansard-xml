                and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia to give evidence on behalf of the returned
                soldiers. That official stated that the proposal had been considered by the
                league&#39;s executive, and that the State branches had been asked for their
                opinions, with the result that they unanimously endorsed the Government&#39;s
                proposals. The Public Works Committee recommended that the erection of the building
                be proceeded with at the earliest practical opportunity. In March this year the
                Prime Minister received a letter from the Federal president of the league, in which

            governed by the Commonwealth under a mandate from the League of Nations. It seems
            fitting, therefore, that His Majesty&#39;s representative in Australia should visit the
            Territory. Beneficial results will accrue from the visit which, I feel certain, was not
            only appreciated by the white and native population of New Guinea, but also has the
            approval of the people of Australia.</para>

                        <para>. - The subject of insurance might profitably be discussed at considerable length,
              but in this case honorable senators on this side feel that it is their duty simply to
              define the policy of the Opposition in regard to the bill and to indicate to the
              Minister in charge of it certain alterations which should, we consider, be embodied in
              it. I shall leave the discussion of those alterations until we reach the committee
              stage. If the title of the bill permitted, and members opposite were open to
              conviction, honorable senators of the Opposition would like to discuss the
              nationalization of insurance but, recognizing that the policy of the Government is in
              favour of private enterprise, we know that it would be futile to enter into such a
              debate. In our opinion the bill, in view of the policy of the Government, becomes a
              mere consolidating machinery measure to regulate the activities of private enterprise,
              and we realize that the best that we can do is to secure to members of the community
              the maximum protection in the circumstances.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In order to give the Minister in charge some idea of what is in the minds of
            honorable senators on this side, and so that our opinions may receive that respect to
            which the right honorable the Leader of the Government admitted they were entitled, I
            shall briefly deal with some of the vital omissions from the measure. It will be
            admitted that members of the community are either policy-holders or potential
            policy-holders. One of the most vital omissions from the measure is provision for the
            protection of those potential policy holders against unscrupulous canvassers. The
            canvasser is the first person that the potential policy-holder meets in this matter.
            Whilst admitting that reputable insurance companies take every&#39; precaution to see
            that they are represented only by the right type of man, who will not make
            representations inconsistent with the terms of the policy, and who recognizes that the
            representations he makes are not binding on the company, I point out that the only
            representations that are binding on the company are those contained in the policy. A
            high-principled company employs representatives who are prepared to canvass for business
            only in strict conformity with the provisions of the policy. But there are other
            canvassers who have no such code of honour, and honorable senators of the Opposition
            have had their attention drawn to certain cases which should be considered by the
            Government and its supporters when dealing with this bill. Honorable senators will
            realize that the measure does not set out to alter the existing law so far as it
            concerns canvassing. The Government of South Australia found it necessary, in the
            interests of the community in that State, to protect reputable land firms, and companies
            who were honestly dealing with subdivisions, against unfair competition on the part of
            unscrupulous land-owners, by providing that all who wish to transact subdivisional sales
            shall first receive some authorization. That authorization is in the form of a public
            authority. The land salesman rnakes an application, which is submitted to the police,
            who go into his antecedents and satisfy themselves that he is a man who can be trusted
            to speak only the truth to potential buyers concerning the sales he endeavours to make.
            I suggest to the Minister and honorable senators opposite that it would be wise to
            incorporate a similar safeguarding provision in this bill, providing that insurance
            canvassers shall be trustworthy.</para>

                                - No, to a system of authorization. Honorable senators of the Opposition are not
                enamoured of the term &#34; licensing.&#34; Honorable Senators may ask what
                necessity there is for it. We can bring under notice a number of cases of this
                particular form of misrepresenta-tion, against which we are anxious to safeguard the
                public. I shall quote an example that is not an isolated one. There were two old-age
                pensioners - a brother and a sister - in a country town in South Australia. A
                collector came to the sister, and said, &#34;You do not want your brother to be
                buried by the Government. For 6d. a week we will give you a policy that will provide
                for the payment of &#163;12 10s. on the date of his death. Of course, if you died
                first your brother would not like to see you buried by the Government, and, for
                another 6d., at the date of your death your brother will receive &#163;12 10s., and
                you will be able to be buried respectably.&#34; This old couple thought the matter
                over and took out policies accordingly. They paid premiums for five years, and at
                the end of that period the brother contracted cancer. Not very long after it had
                been discovered that his case was hopeless, this particular canvasser called at the
                home of the couple, and, with tears in his eyes, said to the woman, &#34; Well, you
                know, you could not bury him to-day for &#163;12 10s.; but you have been such a good
                payer that, if you cancel this policy, take out a fresh one, and pay an extra id. a
                week, we will pay you &#163;15.&#34; She listened to this proposal, and cancelled
                the previous policy. The brother died, and the sister received five months&#39;
                premiums at 7d. per week. I personally interviewed the manager &#39;of the company,
                who said, &#34; Of course, there is the proposal. This man told us he was in good
                health. The proposal says, &#39; I am in sound health &#39;.&#34; But the brother
                knew, and the canvasser knew, that he was in a hopeless state of cancer. Would such
                a case be probable if a better check were kept over that form of canvassing? The
                respectable insurance companies do not adopt that method of business; but it does
                obtain.
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline>
                                will tell of another case
                that occurred in his State, and it is a most glaring instance of what can be done
                and of the unfair competition between what we may call the doubtful company and the
                company that is trying to introduce high morals into insurance life.
                            </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>Another aspect of this matter to which we should give serious consideration in
            committee is that form of proposal which is signed by the potential policy-holder in
            good faith, and contains a statement to the effect that he is in good health. But no
            medical examination is required of the applicant, and the gamble is all on one side. If
            it .subsequently transpires that, when he signed the policy, he was not in good health,
            the insurance company loses nothing, but the policy-holder loses practically all except
            his premiums. If a company decides on that form of policy it should take the applicant
            with all his defects. It has plenty of opportunity to limit its liability by insisting
            on a medical examination.</para>
                    <para>Another alteration that I would suggest to the Minister - although it is not so
            serious a matter as that to which I have just referred - relates to children&#39;s
            insurance. In the bill the obligation is on the parents, and I suggest that where the
            word &#34;parent&#34; appears the word &#34;guardian&#34; should be inserted in its
            stead. A canvasser may call at a home when the father is absent at work. He canvasses
            the mother, secures her signature, and there is an effective policy. Now, who pays the
            premiums? The father probably knows nothing about the transaction. That should not be
            the position. If the father is the guardian of the children, he should know his
            responsibilities in the matter of their insurance. If the parents are legally separated
            by order of the court or by some other means, and the mother becomes the guardian, she
            is entitled to do what she likes regarding the insurance of the lives of her children;
            but while the father is the guardian he should have the final voice in the matter.</para>
                    <para>
                        Another point that might with advantage be explained by the Minister relates to the
            surrender value of the policy. It seems to me that sufficient protection is not given to
            the policy-holder, so far as the surrender value is concerned. 1 realize that we cannot
            lay down definite principles as to surrender value, because they depend on a number of
            contingencies; but I do suggest to the Government that the final arbiter in &#39;this
            matter should not be the company. Suppose, for instance, that a man desires to surrender
            his policy, either on the ground that he cannot afford to continue to pay the premiums,
            or for any other reason, and the company declares that the surrender value is &#163;200.
            Once the company has made that decision there should be somebody to whom the
            policy-holder could appeal in the event of a dispute as to the value. This is a most
            important matter at the present time, because many men who have been able to keep up
            their payments for years now find that they have to rely on their policies being kept
            alive entirely out of the surrender value. A policy may be surrendered, and the holder
            may lose
                        <inline font-style="italic">the</inline>
                        benefits. If there is not sufficient
            provision in the bill to meet such contingencies I suggest to the Minister that it
            should be inserted.
                    </para>
                    <para>There is one other small matter. According to the definition clause, &#34; actuary
            &#34; means &#34; a Fellow or Associate of the Institute of Actuaries of Great Britain
            and Ireland or a Fellow or Associate of the Faculty of Actuaries of Scotland.&#34; If we
            have not now, we certainly hope to have in this great Nationalist Capital City of
            Canberra an Institute of Actuaries. Why not alter that definition so that &#34; actuary
            &#34; would mean a fellow or associate of any institute of actuaries approved by the
            Governor-General-in-Council, or some such provision? That would provide for any
            contingency such as I have mentioned. The bill is essential for the protection of the
            community, and the Opposition will give the Government every facility to secure its
            speedy passage.</para>

                            . - I listened with a great deal of attention to the statement made by the
              Minister on behalf of the department, in moving the second reading of this bill. I
              emphasize that point because it became evident to honorable senators that the speech
              which the Minister was supposed to be making was really the case for the department,
              and he read it as such. The time has arrived for the Senate to take strong exception
              to the way in which important measures are placed before this chamber very often by
              Ministers. Years ago it was the custom for Ministers in charge of bills to go to
              considerable trouble in order to acquaint themselves with their provisions and to
              deliver interesting and instructive speeches. But it has now become the practice for
              Ministers to read a carefully prepared statement which is recorded in
                            <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                            as the speech of the Minister, when it is
              nothing of the kind. This is misleading to the. public and it is not treating the
              Senate with that respect to which it is entitled.

                by the Leader of the Opposition
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline>
                                this measure is long overdue. If my memory serves me aright, the Minister in charge
                of the bill had a most unfortunate experience not long ago because of certain
                transactions with an insurance company which could not have acted in the way it did
                had this measure been in operation when that company was formed. In consequence of
                the absence of proper legislation to control the insurance business, it has been
                felt for many years that the public has been exploited by mushroom insurance
                companies which have sprung up from time to time and which secure the services of
                well-known persons to act as directors. On some occasions they have appointed
                members of this Parliament to act in that capacity because they believed that in so
                doing they would be able to make a stronger appeal to the investing public than they
                could in other circumstances. The promoters of such companies get their cash and
                then slip quietly out of the business, whilst the investing public is left to &#34;
                nurse the baby &#34;. On several occasions in recent years, companies of this nature
                have been formed and the fact that no one has been prosecuted for obtaining money
                under false pretences points to the necessity of amending the law to meet such
                cases. Money was so obtained by these companies under false pretences, and the
                investing public lost not only their money but their confidence in genuine insurance
                companies which had a definite and stable offer to make to the public. The fact that
                nothing has so far been done is not perhaps entirely the fault of the Commonwealth
                Parliament. The State Governments have had the power to deal fully with this matter.

                State Governments have been negligent to the public. All the States have insurance
                company legislation which this measure will eventually supersede, but the State
                legislation is out of date and inadequate. It has been shown that the State laws in
                actual practice do not afford proper protection to the public.</para>

                            <para>- No. The company laws of the States are far short of what is required, and we
                have not the power to enact a Commonwealth company law. That is why certain
                investing concerns are in their present position. The most recent insurance act is
                that in operation in Queensland, which was passed in 1923. The last New South Wales
                act was passed in 1917, whilst the South Australian act was passed in 1899. The
                Leader of the Opposition referred to certain points which this measure does not
                cover, and quoted some heartrending cases that had come under his notice in South
                Australia ; but I remind the honorable senator that the South Australian Parliament
                has always had the power to fully protect the investing and insuring public. Labour
                and other governments have been in office, and have failed to introduce amending
                legislation.</para>

                    <para>This measure, in which consideration is given to the legislation of other countries,
            appears to embody all that is contained in the State acts, together with a number of
            improvements which time and experience have shown to be necessary. A perusal of the bill
            shows that a very thorough investigation has been made by the officers of the department
            into the insurance laws of other countries, and I congratulate the officers who compiled
            the information upon the fine work they have done. It is a credit to them, and I feel
            sure that when this measure becomes law it will make the position much better for the
            insuring public and those who invest in insurance companies. Honorable senators have not
            the same facility for research as have the departmental officers, and when considering a
            measure of this kind have, to a certain extent, to depend upon the information supplied
            by Government officials. I am prepared to accept their work so far as it has gone,
            although I intend, when the bill is in committee, to move one or two amendments which
            appear reasonable and necessary.</para>
                    <para>This measure will perhaps meet the needs of the position aud remove the reproach
            that Australia is behind other countries in legislation of this character. It provides
            amongst other things for the registration of existing and new companies, and requires
            the payment of a fairly substantial deposit in cash cr in approved securities as a
            guarantee of good faith. In the case of foreign companies the deposit is the same as it
            is in the case of bona fide established Australian companies. In the case of new
            Australian companies desiring to register, some easement is provided in the conditions
            under which they make their deposit, in so far as the &#163;20,000 to be deposited may
            be paid over a series of years on a kind of time payment system. To that extent the
            conditions are much easier for new Australian companies formed and registered under this
            measure. No distinction &#39; is, however, made between established Australian companies
            and foreign companies as &#163;20,000 is required in each case. This provision will
            require some justification by the Minister from the standpoint of the investor or the
            policyholder, as there is an important distinction between the two types of companies.
            An Australian company has practically all its assets in Australia, and these are real
            and tangible. They may be realized upon in cases of emergency, and may be available to
            assist the finances of the country. On the other hand, the greater portion of the assets
            of foreign companies is not held in Australia. An attempt is made to meet the situation
            in clauses 37 and 38 which relate to statutory funds. Two lists of statutory funds are
            to be established. The first relates to life insurance statutory funds, and the second
            to industrial insurance statutory funds. It is provided that all receipts in respect of
            such funds shall be carried to the credit of the respective statutory funds, and shall
            not be available to meet any liabilities of &#34; the company other than those referable
            to the class of business in respect of which the fund was established. Some difficulty
            appears to arise with regard to the investment of those funds by a parent company.

            understand that the funds of one concern may be invested in the securities of another
            insurance company, which, owing to some great national catastrophe, may be unable to
            meet the claims made upon it, in which event the funds of the investing company would be
            dissipated. A foreign company, I remind honorable senators, may invest its funds in any
            part of the world, and in any class of security, other than insurance security. Thus it
            may happen that the Australian assets of a foreign company, plus even the &#163;20,000
            deposit required under this bill, might not be sufficient to meet the claims upon the
            company, and it might not be in a position at the moment to realize upon its investments
            in other countries to meet claims made upon it in Australia. This may be regarded as an
            extreme case, but extreme cases sometimes become hideous realities; it is as well to
            provide for every eventuality.</para>
                    <para>The Australian people, through the legislation passed by the Commonwealth
            Government, should retain some measure of control over the assets of all insurance
            companies doing business in the Commonwealth, because they are virtually in the position
            of trustees for Australian investors, I suggest, therefore, that a new sub-clause be
            inserted to provide that foreign companies shall be compelled to invest in Australia
            sufficient of their statutory funds to meet at least a. fair percentage of possible
            Australian obligations. What this percentage should be must be a matter for
            investigation. It may be desirable to require foreign companies to invest all their
            Australian funds in Australian securities, because the money is earned in Australia, and
            is subscribed in this country. If we require foreign companies to do this it will be all
            to our advantage, not only from the standpoint of development, but also from the
            standpoint of security for the investment. A new sub-clause to embody the suggestion I
            have made, would, I am sure, meet with the approval of the investing public, and at the
            same time would not injure the business of a foreign company.</para>

                their business. They may form nominally Australian companies registered under some

                invested by the companies in various forms of security. I say that all such

                altogether. Speaking generally, a private bank invests its funds in Australia, and
                we should see to it that the insurance companies do the same. It would not do any
                injury to a foreign company, and certainly it would do a great deal of good to

                    <para>I come now to the definition of a &#34; foreign company.&#34; It is defined as &#34;
            any company which is incorporated or the head office of which is outside the
            Commonwealth.&#34; That does not appear to be adequate. The company laws of the various
            States, even more than the State insurance laws, are in a chaotic condition, and this
            Parliament lacks the constitutional power to deal with the position. It would be easy
            for a foreign company to overcome all or a great many of the disabilities imposed upon
            it by registering as an Australian company. This has been done with some success, as
            honorable senators know, by the various foreign film exchanges. Only sufficient shares
            are issued to conform to the requirements of the act under which the company is
            registered, and those shares are generally held by the directors of the company, who are
            officials or servants of the foreign company. The difficulty could be overcome by a new
            definition of an Australian company. We have already defined a foreign company; we
            should also define an Australian company. Following the language of the previous
            definition, I suggest the following definition of an Australian company - &#34; An&#39;
            Australian company&#39; means any company the majority of the shareholders holding a
            majority of the shares of which reside within the Commonwealth.&#34; That would afford
            some protection to the public, and enable us to deal with the situation.</para>

              bill before us, I, personally, should be prouder still to support a bill providing for
              national insurance. When the Labour party gains the Treasury bench, as I expect will
              be the case in a few weeks, a national insurance bill will be introduced.

                            referred to the many mushroom companies
              which have been formed in Australia. In insurance matters, New South Wales has always
              been the happy hunting ground for these mushroom companies. Seeing that the bill
              before us will tighten up the legislation relating to insurance companies, I feel
              confident that before the debate proceeds very far, some honorable senators supporting
              the Government will raise objections to its provisions, for the reason that many of
              the big insurance companies are of the opinion that they should have a free hand.

            delay in introducing legislation to control insurance companies. I remind him that when
            a Labour Government in New South Wales did introduce legislation along those lines the
            Legislative Council prevented it from being placed on the statute-book.</para>

                same way that it placed on the statute-book the Workers&#39; Insurance Act.
                Honorable senators will remember that the big insurance companies in New South Wales
                raised an outcry when that legislation was passed. Not many years ago

                    <para>The Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales has placed in my hand the insurance
            policy of Christina Wilkinson, an office cleaner. The policy is dated 15th April, 1929.
            This woman signed the proposal form in good faith. From her small earnings she was
            prepared to set aside 1s. 3d. each week so that in case of an accident she would not be
            without an income. Later, she developed a carbuncle and was off duty for four weeks. The
            insurance company had paid her for only fourteen days of that period when it altered the
            policy by deleting the word &#34; carbuncle &#34; and adding the following condition -</para>

                        <para>It is hereby declared to be a condition of this policy that no compensation shall
              be payable in the event of disablement, directly or indirectly arising from &#34;
              carbuncle &#34; or traceable thereto, nor shall compensation be payable beyond the
              usual time for any disablement or injury wherefrom the recovery of the insured may in
              consequence thereof be retarded.</para>

            relation to foreign companies operating in Australia. If, as is frequently stated, trade
            follows the flag, I predict that there will soon be a number of Italian companies
            operating in the north of Queensland - a portion of Australia which is controlled by the
            &#34; dagos&#34;.

                the head when he dealt with the definition of a foreign company. I congratulate the
                Minister on having introduced this bill, and feel sure that he is big enough to
                extend its scope so that foreign companies may be effectively controlled. The Leader
                of the Opposition cited instances which have come under his notice of the activities
                of &#34; go-getters &#34; in South Australia. I also remind honorable senators that
                there are insurance &#34;gogetters &#34; as well as land &#34; go-getters,&#34; and
                feel confident that the Minister in charge of the measure will accept suggestions to
                insert in it something to curb the operations of these nefarious individuals, and
                to protect the community against their depredations.

                        Senator R.D. ELLIOTT (Victoria) &#91;4.6&#93;. - We all listened with a great deal
            of interest to the very illuminating history of insurance legislation as given by the
            Honorary Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline>
                        in submitting
            this measure to the Senate last week. I shall not give any time to its consideration at
            this stage, but will proceed to deal with the remarks just made by the Leader of the
            Opposition
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly),</inline>
                        who urged that there was
            need for the fuller protection of policy-holders.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Dunn</inline>
                        laboured the same point. I feel that it is because of the realization of
            the need for something of that kind that the Government has brought down the bill with
            which we are now dealing. I am unable to agree with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Daly</inline>
                        that life assurance should be nationalized. I believe that
            nationalization of industry, whether it be that of insurance business or any other
            branch, is the greatest factor at present damning the progress of Australia. With every
            advance of production, under the impetus of private enterprise, the nation advances
            towards the only communism that can benefit mankind: the communism of opportunity. Such
            a need is not confined to the man of affairs; it applies equally to every section of the
            community. The working man, however poor he may be, should have the same opportunity
            that every other person in Australia enjoys.

                        The honorable senator spoke of the &#34;authorization&#34; of insurance agents. I
            think that in looking at the bill from that viewpoint
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Daly</inline>
                        has approached it from a wrong angle. When we realize that we are
            dealing with an industry which had, in 1922, assets in Australia amounting to
            &#163;80,973,935, and in 1927, five years later, invested assets in Australia amounting
            to &#163;118,274,047, we must recognize that the issue is a big one. It must be
            appreciated that in five years the accumulated assets increased by nearly
            &#163;35,000,000 ! That is why I contend that the angle from which both
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly and Senator Dunn</inline>
                        have approached the subject
            is not in conformity with our status as a Senate.

                    <para>
                        The Leader of the Opposition dealt with surrender values, and here, I agree, there
            is need for protection to all concerned. That causes me to reiterate the statement that
            it is because of a realization of that need that the Federal Government has brought down
            this legislation. My concern in life insurance is limited to a case that may interest
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline>
                        . I am not a shareholder or a director
            of any insurance company. My interest is confined to the fact that shortly after I began
            work, when I was twelve years of age, I wished to lay the foundation of a form of
            compulsory saving, and it was presented to me that a life insurance policy represented
            the best method. I took out a policy, and continued to pay premiums, to the maximum of
            my ability, until my policy had a surrender value of &#163;120. I then surrendered it,
            and that amount was the first capital that I possessed.
                    </para>
                    <para>I confess that I have one fear in connexion with this measure, and that is that it
            presents in clause 6, which provides for the appointment of a registrar, a possibility
            of establishing another big government department. My hope is that before we have
            finished with the bill the provision for the appointment of a registrar will be so
            safeguarded as not to mean another department for the Government to administer. All that
            is necessary is that the registrar shall be an actuary. Whether his charter be
            Australian, English or Scottish is immaterial, provided that he belongs to one of the
            institutes which regard their business as a science. Essentially that scientific outlook
            on figures is required, and I trust, then, that the registrar will be an actuary who
            will become an official of the Treasury.</para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline>
                        dealt with the clause which requires
            a deposit of &#163;20,000 to be lodged by insurance companies. I am afraid that he
            misinterpreted the object of that requirement. Admittedly I speak as a layman, and I may
            be wrong; but I believe that the amount is not to be regarded as being in the nature of
            a security. Twenty thousand pounds would be totally inadequate as a security for almost
            any insurance company at present operating in Australia. Even &#163;500,000 would
            scarcely be sufficient.

                        . - My interpretation of the
            provision is that it is merely to show bona fides, and to prevent the establishment of
            &#34; mushroom &#34; companies such as those to which honorable senators have referred
            this afternoon. I even feel uneasy regarding the intention to allow new companies formed
            within the Commonwealth to pay the deposit of &#163;20,000 by instalments of &#163;2,000
            per annum. If such a company is unable to put down a deposit of &#163;20,000 on
            commencing business, then it should not, in the interests of the community, be permitted
            to begin business. For many years life insurance business in Australia has enjoyed a
            world-wide reputation for the soundness of its practices as well as for strong and
            efficient management. The astonishingly rapid growth of the older offices, their great
            financial strength, the soundness of their investment methods, and the extent of their
            bonus distributions to policy-holders, are features of our life insurance history of
            which every Australian may be proud.

                            - Again I remind honorable senators that I do not speak as an expert; but a study
              of the activities of the mutual offices of Australia reveals that, in life assurance
              principles, they lead the way in the Empire, if not in the world. If, as
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline>
                            suggests, their premiums have been too
              high, that policy has reacted to the advantage of the policy-holders in the shape of
              increased bonuses and the consolidation of the finances of the companies. That
              satisfactory history of insurance in Australia suffered a check after 1920, when
              mushroom companies began to develop, with results that are well-known to most
              honorable senators. Those mushroom companies were due really to the ease of finance,
              and to a very great extent to the gullibility of the public of Australia. The majority
              of them were established for the personal gain of their promoters - individuals, more
              often than not, ill-equipped to assume the management of or responsibility for the
              affairs of such companies. They had been accustomed merely to securing business for
              the larger offices, and all that they could see in life insurance was the obtaining of
              business. They were the &#34; go-getters.&#34; of whom we have heard. There is a good
              deal more in life insurance than the mere getting of business. It is a science, the
              intricacies of which require almost generations of study to master. Honorable senators
              must realize how imperative it is that regulations appertaining to life insurance
              companies should be as stringent as those governing trustee
              companies.Unforfortunately, there has been no Commonwealth law to prevent departures
              from sound practice. It has been possible for a company to become hopelessly
              insolvent, both as regards capital and policy resources, and still continue to
              transact business. It has been possible for a company to disregard all principles of
              sound practice and jeopardise the savings of share-holders and policy-holders alike.
              This bill will call a halt in such circumstances. We know of cases where some of these
              mushroom companies have had an expenses ratio for new business as high as 321 per
              cent. for the first year, while their renewal business has amounted to only 32 per
              cent. For four years the whole of the premium income was utilized to cover
              establishment charges associated with the new business. Only after the lapse of those
              four years had the company an opportunity to make provision to meet its obligations to
              policy-holders.

                    <para>Senator R. D. ELLIOTT .- To the policy-holders. An investigation will reveal that
            many such companies welcomed the early lapsing of policies, as they had not the
            resources to meet their obligations. Let me cite an instance of a company which carried
            an annual premium income of &#163;32,500 after three years operations. The fourth
            year&#39;s collections amounted to only &#163;6,908 for premium renewals. In one year
            the policies issued carried &#163;7,739 premium income; in the next, that company issued
            no renewal notices to the policy-holders, and the revenue from premiums amounted to only
            &#163;483. An investigation of the losses to the public through taking out policies in
            such companies, paying premiums for a few years, and then allowing them to lapse, makes
            very interesting reading. We know from experience that some of these companies have
            resorted to issuing dummy policies in order to hoodwink their directors and the public.
            That practice, which is easily carried out, was followed because the expense ratio in
            most of the companies exceeded the income. In one instance a managing director insured
            the whole of his family for large amounts just before the issue of a balance-sheet, and
            even the office stenographer found herself possessing a very substantial life cover.
            This was done because the expense ratio was showing at over 100 per cent. It was merely
            a matter of an exchange of cheques for the premiums and in this way the finances were
            bolstered up so as to present a reasonable aspect to the directors. There was no renewal
            of these premiums : the policies lapsed after the first premiums had been paid. Then,
            again, we know that in preparing balance-sheets many of these companies included amounts
            for uncollected premiums that they knew would never be collected. They included them, of
            course, as live assets. Many examples of that practice might be given. I have before me
            the. particulars of the case of a company whose income for a year amounted to
            &#163;4,086, and its expenditure was &#163;14,151. That was one of the &#34;
            mushrooms.&#34; Another company, in its third year, had absorbed &#163;41,988 of its
            capital of &#163;44,333, and its income of &#163;11,177 had been obtained at a cost of
            &#163;12,905. In yet another case the income of the company, after six years, was
            &#163;7,685, and the expenditure amounted to &#163;11,769, while, of its capital,
            amounting to &#163;37,920, &#163;21,851 had gone. In still another case, in which the
            revenue was &#163;7,157 and the expenditure amounted to &#163;14,219, of the capital of
            &#163;45,483, no less than &#163;39,848 had disappeared. Those are merely a few examples
            of the &#34;high finance&#34; that has been going on in connexion with insurance in
            Australia during the last few years.</para>
                    <para>Turning to the bill, I am rather afraid of clause 6, because of the danger of it
            leading to the establishment of another Government department. I hope that an assurance
            will be given that in committee that risk will be eliminated. I do not intend to deal
            with the bill in detail, but Division IV., &#34;Policies,&#34; gives scope for a good
            deal of discussion. I hope that there is nothing in the measure that will require life
            insurance policies throughout Australia to be uniform. We ought still to preserve and
            develop the initiative of insurance companies. We should maintain healthy, active
            competition. Any legislation that would bring about a uniform proposal form would be to
            the disadvantage of the public of Australia.</para>

                        - So long as that is made clear, I am satisfied on the point.
            Considering the matter as a layman, I was inclined to fear that it would depend on the
            official charged with the administration of the act, who might place his own
            interpretation upon it and insist on uniform policies. Proposals for insurance that are
            off the beaten track are often received. It would be quite impossible for any business
            concern to submit such a proposal, and the conditions of policy, which would be drawn up
            to suit the particular case, for review by the authorities in Canberra. It would
            probably mean weeks and weeks of delay, and in the meantime the business might be held
            up for want of the policy.
                    </para>
                    <para>A matter upon which I am sure the Minister anticipates a query is that of proof of
            age. The onus should he on the person presenting a proposal for insurance. If the clause
            dealing with this question is passed as it stands, we shall find persons forming a habit
            of underestimating, to put it in a mild way, their age, knowing full well that by doing
            so they will obtain a reduced premium, and at the end of twelve months the company will
            be in the position of having either to cancel the policy or to accept the declaration of
            age by the policy-holder. Intending policy-holders will gamble on the prospects of a
            company being prepared to accept their assurance on the matter.</para>
                    <para>Though the need for effective regulation is urgent, I feel that no legislation
            should be enacted without full consideration of the requirements of this very
            complicated business, and I am certain that that is the attitude of the Government. Care
            must be exercised not to place unnecessarily harsh restrictions on sound and genuine
            enterprises, or restrictions that would give a monopoly to the businesses of the
            older-established organizations. At the present time, however, more companies are
            engaged in insurance business in Australia than the value of the business warrants. The
            outstanding principle of life insurance is that it is essentially a trustee business
            conducted on the savings of every class of citizen. Our first duty, therefore, is to
            require that adequate protection shall at all times be given those savings by compelling
            a company to cease accepting new applications for insurance when its funds are no longer
            sufficient to meet its surrender liabilities. That, I realize, is one of the main
            objectives of the bill.</para>
                    <para>Feeling that this is a highly technical measure, and that no body of laymen is
            capable of giving it the detailed attention that it demands, and seeing, that the
            Treasurer mentioned in his budget speech that he had been in consultation with experts
            on insurance, I wonder whether the Government would consider the advisability of
            appointing a select committee, so that the opinions of a number of outside experts could
            be brought to bear upon the measure. Since most of the heavy work has been done, this
            course would probably involve but very little delay, and I submit the suggestion to the
            Minister for his consideration.</para>

                        (Western Australia)
            &#91;4.28&#93;. - I join with those honorable senators who have already spoken in
            congratulating the Government on bringing down this undoubtedly belated measure, and I
            thank the Minister, too, for his informative speech in moving its second reading. At the
            same time, I direct the attention of the Senate to certain features of the bill which,
            to my mind, constitute defects either of omission or commission, and I suggest that the
            closest Consideration be given to them in committee. I am entirely in accord with the
            general principles of the bill. It should be obvious that in no matter is it more
            necessary that the public should be amply protected than in that of life insurance,
            which, if it is to be of any value at all, must be absolutely safe. Every element of
            risk must be removed, so far as it is possible to remove risk from human affairs, and we
            must have continuity, extending from generation to generation. It is equally important,
            however, that, in protecting the public, we should do nothing to burden unduly or&#39;
            harass unnecessarily bona fide life insurance companies that have performed, and are
            performing, beneficent services throughout the Commonwealth. I know perfectly well that
            entirely undesirable companies have sprung up from time to time; but the people of
            Australia are to be congratulated on the fact that, over a long period of years, they
            have had their choice between a number of competing companies that have always conducted
            their business on a satisfactory basis, and have given absolute security to those who
            have taken out policies with them.
                    </para>
                    <para>Without for a moment passing any reflection on those companies which distribute
            their profits among shareholders, I think that I might take the opportunity to single
            out for special commendation those mutual companies that have not only raised themselves
            to a position of extraordinary importance in the public life of Australia, but have also
            established foi&#34; themselves an unequalled reputation throughout the insurance world.
            It has been suggested this afternoon that these companies have been able to provide
            large bonuses, because the premiums they charge are too high. For that there is an
            explanation, which to my mind serves to emphasize the very distinct advantage of a
            mutual company to the community. Perhaps the greatest reason why the premiums to-day are
            too high is the fact, upon which I think we may all congratulate ourselves, that during
            the last half century there has been an increase of no less than fifteen years in the
            average term of human life. Consequently, premiums that were adequate to meet the
            circumstances of 50 years ago are now too high, but where too high a premium is charged
            by a mutual company, the whole of the excess comes back in the shape of increased
            bonuses to the policy-holders. That may or may not be so in the case of a company of a
            proprietary character that is not entirely mutual in its operations.</para>
                    <para>I am &#39;quite sure that there is no desire on the part of the Government to
            embarrass any bona fide insurance company. I accept in advance the assurance that I know
            the Minister will give, that the act will be administered with wisdom and discretion;
            but, at the same time, I cannot refrain from associating myself with the honorable
            senator who has just resumed his seat in regard to the possibilities of danger
            underlying clause 6. That honorable senator suggests that under that clause another big
            department may come into being. I think that clause 7 makes it abundantly certain that
            another department will arise, because it provides for the appointment of a staff. My
            experience of public affairs is that not infrequently when an officer is appointed with
            a high sounding title, three things occur. First, because of the officer&#39;s high
            sounding title, he must have a high salary, and secondly, because of his high salary he
            must have a big staff - an establishment commensurate with his position. If we have a
            similar experience in connexion with this bill, an already embarrassed Treasury may find
            that it has done something to increase the steadily growing cost of federation - a
            matter that might more appropriately be discussed in connexion with the financial
            statement.</para>

                        Yes ; but I do not believe
            in extravagance, whether it be connected with a good or a bad thing. It seems to me to
            be extremely likely that we shall first have a registrar with a branch of his department
            and a staff in every State. The next thing will be to find something for the staff to
            do. That something, under the provisions of this bill, may amount to vexatious
            interference with the proper activities of insurance companies. That, I am sure, we all
            wish to avoid. Reference has been made to clauses 57 and 58, which require that policy
            and proposal forms shall be submitted for approval. There we have abundant scope for
            officers who want to find work for themselves. I know of one insurance company which, in
            its ordinary department, has no less than 25 tables of policies, and I am inclined to
            think that matters of that kind can be more satisfactorily dealt with by the companies
            themselves than by a staff such as is contemplated under this bill.

                        There is also opportunity for abuse under clauses

                        and 54, which relate to the furnishing of confidential returns. I am not
            at all sure that we ought not to consider whether an order of the court should not be
            necessary before a company is compelled to divulge returns of that character. I entirely
            endorse all that has been said concerning clause 78, because in clauses 73 and 77 we
            have ample provision for adjusting difficulties that arise in regard to proof of age.
            Trouble arose in New South Wales a short time ago because a learned judge in that State
            made a mistake qf twelve months in his age. It is a fact that in 20 per cent, of the
            proposals for life insurance errors in regard to age are inadvertently made, but it is
            also a fact that these errors have never caused any serious trouble or loss to persons
            insured by bona fide companies. Instead of following the practice adopted in the past by
            which an error can be adjusted whenever it is discovered, even after the death of the
            person insured, and without prejudice or without charge against the policy beyond what
            would have been paid had the error not been made it is now proposed that at the end of
            twelve months,
                        <inline font-style="italic">a</inline>
                        quite inadequate period for this
            proof of age to be secured, the company shall take one of two objectionable courses. It
            must either take the extreme step of cancelling the policy, thus causing the person
            insured to forfeit his first year&#39;s premium, or it must be finally and definitely
            bound by the policy. I cannot see any advantage in a provision of that nature, and I ask
            the Honorary Minister to contrast it with the course which is followed to secure
            accuracy in regard to the age of applicants for old age pensions.

            omission from Part rv., which deals with the insurance of children. I do not think I am
            breaking any confidence in saying that at the conferences to which the Honorary Minister
            referred, a very earnest request was submitted by the representatives of some of the
            most important life assurance companies in the Commonwealth, that the legal difficulty
            that had arisen in regard to what are known as deferred insurance policies on the lives
            of children, should be remedied when this measure came before the Federal Parliament.
            These deferred insurance policies provide that if a child dies before reaching the age
            of 21 years, the premiums paid shall be returned with or without interest. For many
            years it was thought, as, indeed, it was intended, both by the persons effecting the
            insurance and by the companies concerned, that these policies were the property of the
            parents until the child reached the age of 21 when they became the property of the
            person insured. A recent English case has thrown doubt upon the question of ownership,
            and it is the desire of all these companies - it is also in the interest of the
            policy-holders, too - that the opportunity should be taken under this bill to remove the
            difficulty. I should be grateful if the minister in charge would carefully peruse
            certain clauses which have been drafted by eminent counsel with the object of overcoming
            this difficulty. There are many minor matters in the measure which I hope to refer to
            when it is in committee, but for the moment I shall content myself with cordially
            supporting the bill.</para>

                        </talker>
                        <para>.- I add my congratulations to those which have already been tendered to the
              Government on the introduction of this measure, although it is true, as some have
              said, that its introduction is somewhat belated. Some honorable senators have urged
              that the States are to blame for not having brought their life insurance company
              legislation up to date. As a fact, the subject has been considered by all the State
              governments from time to time. In Victoria there has not been much necessity for
              amending legislation because our law on this subject is fairly up to date; but it was
              felt by the States generally that the Commonwealth Parliament would, in due course,
              exercise the authority given it under the Constitution to deal with life insurance. It
              is a fit and proper subject for Commonwealth consideration. It is unquestionably a
              matter for uniform Australia-wide legislation and those charged with the conduct of
              insurance companies will find it an advantage to have to deal with only one authority.
              I was particularly interested in the Minister&#39;s reference to the history of life
              insurance, and his story of the legislation on this subject by the Mother Country. The
              evolution and development of life insurance is of special moment to us, inasmuch as
              Australia has contributed in a very large measure to the benefits of the system and to
              the methods which are now employed in the business. The honorable gentleman said that
              Lord Parmoor presided over a committee which considered the question of industrial
              insurance and that as a result of his labours and those of his colleagues an
              industrial insurance measure was introduced into the British Parliament in 1923. It
              may interest honorable senators to know that the greater portion of the alterations
              recommended by that committee had already been adopted by most of the life insurance
              companies - certainly the leading ones - in Australia. That shows that Australia has
              nothing to be ashamed of in its contributions to the system of life insurance. It is
              also pleasing to note that it was an Australian company that in 1870 first introduced
              the non-forfeiture principle which provided that so long as the surrender value of a
              policy was sufficient to pay the premiums, the policy should not be forfeited. That
              revolutionized the whole practice of life insurance throughout the world. At the
              inception of life insurance, as honorable senators are aware, the business was in the!
              hands of proprietary companies, and it was in Australia that the mutual principle was
              developed. &#34;We on this side of the chamber are opposed to the nationalization of
              insurance, which is the - policy of honorable senators opposite. There is a
              fundamental difference between nationalization of insurance and insurance conducted on
              the mutual principle. In the latter, we have the finest embodiment of the principle of
              cooperation that can be imagined. It is sincere, genuine co-operation, and the nearest
              approach to the ideal which the Leader of the Opposition cherishes. The principle of
              co-operation is safer and saner than that of nationalization.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I do not wish to raise the party issue on this measure. It is one which honorable
            senators should approach with due regard for the magnitude of the problem with which it
            deals and a fitting sense of its responsibility in passing a law to govern the
            operations of these institutions. Our policy must be to encourage thrift and foresight,
            and those stabilizing influences which are so essential in the life and character of our
            people. The whole of our influence should be thrown behind any movement which makes for
            stability in the community. We should encourage in every way that which induces people
            to save and make provision for the major contingencies of life. This ideal is not the
            peculiar possession of any one party. It is the well-being of the whole community - rich
            and poor alike - that we have to consider in passing legislation of this kind, and we
            must do all that is possible to protect their interests.</para>
                    <para>I have spoken of the desirability of uniform legislation - of the wisdom of lifting
            the subject from the conflicting laws of the several States and placing it upon an
            Australia-wide basis - and providing facilities for the successful operation of life
            insurance companies throughout the Commonwealth. In our consideration of this bill we
            should give due weight to the importance of the interests involved. By this I do not
            mean the interests of the capitalists or the plutocrats - those people whom our friends
            opposite are pleased to condemn with such fiery enthusiasm from the public platform.
            What I wish to impress upon the Senate is the fact that every section of the community
            is deeply interested in the stability, the strength, and the safety of life insurance
            companies, to whose care the savings of the people are entrusted. Honorable senators
            will have gained from the figures quoted by those who have already spoken in this
            debate, some idea of the magnitude of the operations of life insurance companies, and
            the extent of the interests involved. It seems to me that the placid and undisturbed
            atmosphere of such a chamber as this is an admirable one for the discussion of this
            measure.</para>
                    <para>Some of the provisions of the British bill referred to previously have not yet
            received legislative sanction in the Imperial Parliament, but they form the subject of
            recommendations by an expert committee that has been considering the problem. It should
            be our aim, therefore, to enact a model cod&#39;&#39; of life insurance legislation that
            will he our pride and the envy of other countries. I suggest that we can do this only if
            we approach, the discussion of this bill in a thoroughly impartial manner, and realize
            how important is the position occupied by the numerous life insurance companies whose
            interests are affected by it. I believe all honorable senators realize that the money
            invested in these companies which represents the accumulated savings of, for the most
            part, the poorer sections of the community, and what we may term the middle classes, has
            been, on many occasions, applied to the service of the Commonwealth. They will recall
            how, in times of national crisis, the insurance companies by reason of their financial
            strength and power, have been able to render valuable aid by way of loans to the
            Government. Invariably they have responded magnificently to the call of the State. Apart
            from the financial assistance which they have been able to render to the State, they
            have also been a source of strength to municipal and semi-public bodies in various parts
            of the Commonwealth. Money which has been made available by these companies for.
            investment in municipal and other undertakings has been used advantageously as a
            developing agency for this country.</para>
                    <para>If one had time and the Senate were prepared to listen, one could tell an arresting
            story of useful service rendered not only to members of societies and policy holders,
            but to the general community by the employment of life insurance companies&#39; funds in
            the way I have indicated. I say, therefore, that we should bring to the discussion of
            this bill a due sense of our responsibility, having regard to the extent of their
            operations and the influence of the companies whose interests are affected, and we
            should do nothing that is calculated to restrict in any way the beneficial influence of
            their operations. The provisions of the bill should he designed to protect as far as
            possible all those who have entrusted their savings to these companies, and to guide and
            help those upon whom rests the obligation to invest such funds wisely.</para>
                    <para>
                        I congratulate the Government on having faced this problem and on the introduction
            of this bill. In the main I think that it may be said that the principles enunciated in
            it are sound. I wish, however, to direct attention to one or two matters. In the first
            place, I support my colleagues
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.D. Elliott</inline>
                        and
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline>
                        in the warning note which
            they have sounded with regard to the appointment of the registrar. We have a precedent
            to guide us in the appointment of registrars of friendly societies. These institutions
            are deserving of the greatest encouragement for the reason that, being thrift societies,
            they exert an important stabilizing influence on the community. But Parliament has said
            that there must be legislative supervision of the investment of their funds and some
            check on their actuarial calculations to see whether they are fulfilling the obligations
            resting upon them. In the State of Victoria, at all events, the appointment of a
            registrar of friendly societies has not led to the growth of a huge department. The
            registrar in that State is attached to the Statist&#39;s office. He is generally
            respected, the trustees of societies have confidence in his decisions and are grateful
            for the guidance and direction which he is able to give them in the management of their
            funds. I suggest that the same course might be followed with regard to the appointment
            of the registrar under this bill. It is necessary to have someone competent, from a
            scientific and technical point of view, some one capable of giving wise decisions and
            tendering valuable advice to the Minister who will be charged with the administration of
            this law. But there is the danger, as
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Colebatch</inline>
                        has so strongly stressed, that the person appointed may magnify his
            office. We are all familiar with what has happened on many occasions. We have seen a man
            appointed to a public office start with a table and a chair and before long he has
            gathered round himself a huge department. I should like to have a definite assurance
            from the Government that nothing of that kind is contemplated, that the Government will
            so circumscribe and direct the work of the registrar, that there will be no possibility
            of a big department springing from the appointment.

                impress on the Minister the need to impose effective safeguards. &#34;I magnify mine
                office&#34; is an often quoted Biblical saying. We must see to it that the bill
                contains such restrictions as will prevent the growth of the life insurance
                department into something that will be onerous, expensive, meddlesome and
                interfering. There should be the minimum of government interference where companies
                are discharging their obligations in a right and ; proper manner. Where, however,
                there is wrong doing - where there is any evidence that the public is being
                exploited, the Government, through its officers, should act in the strongest
                possible way, not only for the sake of the good name of the Commonwealth and in the
                interests of honesty and fair dealing, but also for the sake of those whose funds
                are embarked in these enterprises.</para>

                    <para>It is well known that, in the framing of this measure, the Government had the advice
            of an expert committee of public officers of undoubted repute and integrity, whose sole
            concern was the public interest. It is not too much to say that in drafting the bill
            they have done an important work well. The measure is not overloaded. On the whole, it.
            may be said that in. its conception the bill is sound, and in its draftsmanship it
            adequately expresses the Government&#39;s intention. I am, however, advised by those who
            are competent to judge, that it contains a number of irritating provisions which are not
            likely to serve any useful purpose, but will increase the cost of administration. I
            suggest, therefore, that these provisions should be reviewed in the light of expert
            advice which can be tendered to the Government.</para>
                    <para>Other honorable senators have mentioned the clause dealing with proof of age. It is

            provision in this bill will throw the door open to misrepresentation, and, possibly,
            fraud; and, furthermore, it will operate harshly on companies, and will not help the
            cause of life insurance, which we are all anxious to see prosper.</para>
                    <para>There are also one or two other matters which I feel should be reconsidered. For
            example, there is the provision which liberalizes the conditions of policies, probably
            at the expense of the general body of policy-holders. It is, I think, undesirable to
            remove any safeguards that make for security and safety. Clause 69, which I understand
            has been taken from a State act, provides that notice shall be given before the lapse of
            an industrial policy. I am informed by those who are competent to advise me that this
            provision, as operated in the State of Queensland, has not benefited the policy-holders,
            but that on the contrary, it has proved burdensome and expensive to companies, and has
            made industrial insurance in that State largely an unprofitable venture. I am informed,
            further, that the bonuses on industrial policies, in which Queensland policyholders
            share, are largely carried by the other States of the Commonwealth. This provision is
            one that contributes to that end. I, therefore, ask the Minister to give it careful
            consideration.</para>
                    <para>
                        I am informed that in the case of companies which operate outside Australia it will
            be impossible to lodge returns within the time specified in the bill. Many mutual life
            insurance companies operate both in the Mother Country and in Australia; others, in
            South Africa as well, and one at least in India. While we all desire to remove the cause
            for those complaints which have been voiced by the Leader of the Opposition, and to make
            life insurance a clean business, we must be chary about accepting
                        <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline>
                        statements.

              Dunn</inline>
                        referred to the case of an office cleaner. While all that the honorable
            senator said on her behalf may be true from her point of view - and I make no defence of
            the company - we must remember that, after all, her complaint is the complaint of a
            policyholder.

                            . - I desire, in replying, to refer to the several matters raised during the
              debate. The Leader of the Opposition
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator
                Daly),</inline>
                            who referred to surrender values, &#39;will find, on closer
              reference to the measure, that that matter is dealt with, as regards ordinary
              policies, in clauses 66 to 68, and, as regards industrial policies, in clause 70. I do
              not propose to deal at this stage with the desirability or otherwise of nationalizing
              our system of insurance as suggested by the honorable senator. That is a matter beyond
              the scope of the bill, and . is also, in my opinion, out of the sphere of practical
              politics.

                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In the preparation of this measure the Government has been in consultation with
            departmental officers, as well as with experts in the various institutions affected -
            indeed, the bill has been in draft form for two or three years - and it is believed that
            it will not unduly interfere with the business of the country, but, on the contrary,
            will preserve the principle of freedom in relation to life insurance business.
            Nevertheless, it doe.? aim at regulating life insurance.</para>
                    <para>In my introductory speech, I said that I did not blame the States for not having
            introduced legislation to deal with life insurance companies. In 1910 a royal commission
            investigated matters connected with life insurance, and it was then agreed that it was a
            subject for the National Parliament to deal with.</para>
                    <para>It has been said that we have closed the stable door after the horse has been
            stolen. However much the individual investor, in the shape of a company shareholder, may
            suffer through risking his money in loosely controlled or ill-conceived enterprises, or,
            where well conceived, badly managed enterprises, our , concern is not for him, but for
            the policyholder for whom company directors and shareholders are merely trustees. Our
            duty is to safeguard the future of the policy-holders by ensuring that the funds of life
            insurance companies are sufficient to meet their liabilities. If those who invest their
            money in rash enterprises lose it, they have only themselves to blame. This
            legislation does not aim at protecting them; it is introduced to protect those who, in
            good faith, take out policies to provide against death or accident. With that object,
            certain clauses, which may be referred to as disciplinary provisions, are incorporated
            in the bill.</para>
                    <para>It has been suggested that in presenting this bill to the Senate, I should not have
            kept so closely as I did to a prepared memorandum. When submitting important
            legislation, I prefer to adhere fairly closely to a carefully prepared statement. It
            does not appear to me to be important whether that statement has been prepared by my
            officers or by myself, so long as I am the master of my subject : and we shall see as
            the debate proceeds whether or not I am master of the subject with which this bill
            deals. I desire to express my sense of obligation to officers of the Treasury, the
            Statistical, the Attorney-General&#39;s and other departments, who have brought to my
            knowledge the information I have submitted to the Senate.</para>
                    <para>
                        Many of the matters referred to by honorable senators are subjects for consideration
            in committee, rather than in a second-reading speech.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Duncan</inline>
                        advocated the drawing of a distinction between Australian and foreign
            companies in respect of the deposit required. The considered opinion of the committee,
            to which I referred, is that it would be unwise to draw that distinction. My own
            inclination was to make the deposit in the case of a foreign company much higher than
            that required for an Australian company; but, after all, the deposit does not bear any
            relation to the statutory funds of the companies. It is rather in the nature of a
            guarantee of good faith and of capacity to carry on the business. Should an appropriate
            amendment dealing with statutory funds, and designed to take protective measures in the
            interests of the public, be moved, the Government will give it favorable consideration;
            but I remind honorable senators that considerable difficulties arise in connexion with
            such matters. It is impossible to compare insurance companies with banks, for their
            obligations to the community are entirely different.

            If this bill becomes law, we shall have gone a long way towards guarding the community
            against the operations of companies which have done a great deal of harm to the name of
            insurance in this country.</para>

                        suggested the reference of this
            measure to a select committee. I remind him that, before its presentation to Parliament,
            it was carefully considered by a committee of insurance experts and legal gentlemen,
            after which it was carefully considered by Cabinet and by one or two members of the
            Cabinet for four or five months. In my opinion, no better committee exists than this
            chamber to deal with the matters contained in this measure. The Senate is the proper
            place in which to give it that placid consideration to which
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson</inline>
                        has referred. I may be wrong, and I am subject to correction
            by the right honorable the Leader of the Government in the Senate, but I think that it
            was here that our magnificent Bankruptcy Act was introduced and polished into its
            present form.

                            <para>- That is regulated by the provisions which we have taken from existing
                legislation in several States, including Western Australia, South Australia and
                Victoria. After all, the shareholders are not the great concern of the Parliament in
                dealing with this measure. Essentially the bill seeks to provide protection for
                policy-holders. That is the business, first, of the registrar, and secondly of the
                court. No amalgamation will be approved if the policy-holder is not sufficiently
                protected by the existence of sufficient assets on the part of the purchasing
                company to create a statutory fund to meet the combined liabilities of both
                institutions. I draw the attention of honorable senators to the various improvements
                to our existing legislation, which have been taken from British, Indian and South
                African legislation and incorporated in this measure.</para>

                    <para>I appreciate what has been said as to the possibility of some of the provisions of
            the bill irritating well-managed insurance companies. I assure honorable senators that
            if any mistaken policy has been embodied in the bill, the error has arisen from a too
            eager endeavour to make absolutely safe the position of the policyholders. The
            Government has at all times endeavoured not unduly to interfere with the operations of
            any of the highly creditable companies which are at present carrying on business. It has
            endeavoured to give effect to the very best practice at present prevailing amongst the
            reputable insurance offices of Australia. Honorable senators have my assurance that
            suggestions submitted by them for the amendment of any provisions that are considered to
            be too drastic, will receive a good reception from the Government, provided that they
            are consistent with the primary principle for which the measure stands, the safeguarding
            of the interests of the policy-holders.</para>
                    <para>
                        I express my gratitude to honorable senators for the manner in which they have
            received the measure. In conclusion, I may say that the Government has no intention to
            create what in future years may become a big Commonwealth insurance department.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senators
            Lawson, R. D. Elliott and Senator Colebatch,</inline>
                        in
            speeches which were valuable contributions to the debate, referred to that possibility.
            Candidly, I admit that I come from the same political school as they. Frequently I have
            watched legislation passing through Parliaments other than our own, and have heard
            members giving assurances that no additional departments would be created. It is
            difficult, however, to guard against such an eventuality. When an official is entrusted
            with such duties as will be charged to the registrar under this measure, it is difficult
            to prevent the expansion of his bureau. If any suggestion can be made which will enable
            the Government to place a statutory restriction on that contingency, it will meet with
            no objection from me. All that I urge honorable senators to do is to refrain from
            placing the registrar in such a position that he will be leg-roped and unable to
            function satisfactorily in the interest of the policy-holders of Australia. We are
            dealing with a much greater matter than the establishment of a State Registrar of
            Friendly Societies. In common with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson,</inline>
                        I
            am aware that the Registrar of Friendly Societies for South Australia carries out his
            activities with the assistance of a staff of two. But the ambit of his operations is
            limited to the Friendly Societies of South Australia, whereas the ambit of the operations
            of the registrar in this case, is Australian-wide, and we must provide accordingly.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        I wish to call attention to one aspect of the matter, which has occurred to me
            during the debate. Suggestions have been made, one emanating from
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline>
                        , with regard to the authorization - &#34;
            licensing &#34; is too painful a word for the honorable senator to use except in
            association with the liquor laws - of canvassers. That is a double-barrelled proposal.
            We are at present engaged upon the making of one of the most serious pieces of
            legislation, from a commercial point of view, that the Senate has ever passed. Once the
            Government licenses insurance companies it puts upon them the imprimatur of a government
            institution; it gives them government approval. No insurance company has such an
            imprimatur to-day. It therefore behoves us to be particularly careful how we act. I
            venture the opinion that this bill will tend to eliminate the abuses to which
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline>
                        and
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Dunn</inline>
                        referred. I believe that insurance companies will make an endeavour to
            be represented by agents of a highly satisfactory character. The control that will be
            exercised and the pressure that will be brought to bear will eliminate the
            &#34;go-getter&#34; class of business and make for the establishment in Australia of
            that higher standard of life insurance business for which a number of us have heretofore
            looked, in some cases, in vain, but for which, I hope, we shall not long continue to
            seek vainly.

              senators given an opportunity to study it. Extempore amendments may appear speedy, but
              I do not think that, in this instance, they conduce to the satisfactory or expeditious
              despatch of public business. I ask the Minister to give honorable senators an
              opportunity to study any amendment that is moved. I suggest that the Minister report
              progress in order that honorable senators may see the amendment in print and be in a
              position to circulate any further amendments that it is proposed to submit.</para>

                        <para>. - This may be an amendment to which little exception can be taken; but, if
              honorable senators propose to submit amendments as the bill is taken through
              committee, I think that we ought to have the more important ones printed and
              circulated. This is a highly technical measure, and, while the present amendment may
              not involve much discussion, it may be well to report progress at this stage. I invite
              honorable senators who have amendments to propose to put them in writing, so that we
              may consider their effect, not only upon the particular clauses to which they relate,
              but also upon the bill as a whole.</para>

                    <para>&#91;5.42&#93;. - As I understand that honorable senators are not prepared to
            proceed with the debate on the estimates and budget-papers at this juncture, I intend to
            move the adjournment of the Senate; but I ask them again to direct their minds to the
            financial statement, because it has been my invariable experience that, when the
            Appropriation Bill comes before the Senate, the Government is charged with not having
            allowed sufficient time to debate the general financial position. The details of the
            budget are open for discussion on the motion for the printing of the Estimates and
            budget-papers; but, when the Appropriation Bill is brought forward, there may not be
            much time for a general discussion of the financial position. I regret that honorable
            senators are not prepared to proceed with that discussion to-night, and, in view of that
            fact, I move -</para>
