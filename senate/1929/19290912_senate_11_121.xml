          <para>As the available appropriation under Supply Bill (No. 1) of 1929-30 is almost exhausted it is necessary to make a further appropriation of revenue to carry on the services of the Commonwealth pending the passing of the Estimates, and, in this case, to meet the cost of a general election. The amount which the Senate is now asked to appropriate is &#163;6,578,090 which will meet requirements for the months of September, October and November. This sum includes the following services, details of which are set out in the schedule to the bill - </para>

          <para class="block">The items making up these sums are based approximately on last year&#39;s appropriation, or the current year&#39;s Estimates, whichever is the lower. Provision is also made to cover the pay day which falls on the 13th December. No new proposals are included. In addition, provision is made for &#34;Refunds of Revenue,&#34; &#163;100,000, and &#34;Advance to the Treasurer,&#34; &#163;1,500,000. The amount set down for &#34; Advance to the Treasurer,&#34; is required mainly to enable loan works and services in progress to be continued until a loan bill has been passed by Parliament. . The average monthly expenditure on these services is about &#163;450,000. It is also necessary to make provision out of the Treasurer&#39;s advance to carry on works and services in respect to &#34;Additions, New Works and Buildings - Payable from Revenue,&#34; until parliamentary appropriation is available, and to meet miscellaneous and unforeseen contingencies incidental to the services of the Commonwealth. I repeat that honorable senators are not being asked to commit themselves to any new expenditure, as the figures are based on existing expenditure or on the estimates already submitted to Parliament whichever is the lower. </para>

          <para class="block">The circumstances surrounding the introduction of this bill are exactly similar to those associated with the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Appropriation Bill with which the Senate has just dealt. Its purpose is to provide the sum of &#163;10,000,000 from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the payment of war pensions. Parliament has, from time to time, made appropriations of a similar amount, and transfers have been made under the authority of the relative Appropriations Acts to the Trust Account from which payments are made to pensioners. The total amount previously appropriated for this purpose was &#163;75,622,632 of which &#163;72,116,683 had been expended up to the 30th June last, the balance on that date being &#163;3,505,949. That balance is sufficient to meet war pension payments up to the middle of November next. A further appropriation is therefore required to provide for payments from November onward. The appropriation which the Senate is now asked to make will meet requirements until approximately December, 1930. I point out that this measure has nothing whatever to do with the rate of pensions or the conditions under which they are payable. </para>

          <para class="block">This is really a tentative measure, and I would like honorable senators to understand that it binds . no one to the tariff schedule that has been placed on the table of the House of Representatives. Its introduction is due to the peculiar circumstances that have arisen in another place during the past few days. It is merely a validating measure which continues in force the schedule which would have remained in force had Parliament continued to sit. No injustice can be done to any one in the event of the tariff schedule being ultimately rejected by Parliament, as, following the policy that has been observed in the past, refunds will be made to those who have been subjected to increased tariff duties in the interim. </para>

            <para>In this act &#34; Tariff proposals &#34; means the proposed duties of excise introduced into the House of Representatives on the twenty-second day of August, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine. </para>

          <para class="block">Beyond those bare words, honorable senators have no information on this matter. These duties may or may not be very important. Although the House of Representatives has had every opportunity to know what the duties are, the Senate appears to be delightfully in the dark. It is one of those &#34; little big &#34; things that need attention. Honorable senators are simply asked, in the baldest of language, to vote for the imposition of a set of duties which have been mentioned in another place, and about which they know nothing. This chamber should be placed on precisely the same level as another place. We. should be enlightened on the subject, instead of being asked to vote upon something about which we are in the dark. I am sure that it is merely an oversight on the part of the Minister in charge of the bill; but it is certainly not very pleasant to find honorable senators in such an invidious position. </para>

            <para>. -  As the honorable senator understands, the excise schedule has, under the Constitution, to be placed on the table in another place. The position to which he . has referred arises, no doubt, from the expedition which has to be exercised in the peculiar circumstances which exist. I point out that this is really a &#34;without prejudice &#34; measure. Actually, the tariff proposals to which it relates have not yet been discussed in the House of Representatives, and we did not contemplate a discussion in the Senate at this stage.  A  discussion will take place on the </para>

          <para class="block">Excise Tariff Bill itself, which will be duly presented to&#39; the Senate. The &#39; procedure as I understand it, from the constitutional stand-point is this: When the schedule was laid on the table in another place, it came into operation immediately, but is subject to the will of that chamber. When it is finally passed, it will come up for consideration and discussion in the Senate, in the form of a bill. As I explained a few moments ago, this is a tentative measure introduced to cover the period indicated in the next clause. Its introduction in this form cannot be regarded as a suggestion that the dignity or the rights of this chamber are being ignored. It is necessary to pass the bill to protect the revenue. Honorable senators on either side are not bound by the schedule. The purpose of the. bill is to place the department of Trade and Customs in the same position as if Parliament had continued its sittings - no more and no less. </para>
