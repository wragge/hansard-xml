              <para>There is no justification for any such suggestion. I would remind the honorable senator that there are special conditions underlying the offer of a bounty on coal exported overseas or interstate, and that a specified reduction in the selling price of that commodity, to which all parties in the industry are required to contribute, must precede the payment of a bounty. The incidence of the bounty offered in the case of the coal industry would, therefore, be quite different from that of a bonus on wheat. </para>

        <para class="block">The object of this measure is to validate the financial agreement already entered into between the Commonwealth and the States. Honorable senators will remember that when that agreement was submitted to the Senate in December, 1927, I explained the circumstances leading up to it and the history of the financial clauses of the Constitution. They will also remember that the agreement was a prominent issue in the recent election campaign. I do not propose this afternoon to cover that ground again, but shall confine my remarks to the circumstances in which the bill now comes before the Senate and to the main features of the agreement itself. The bill validates the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the States and signed on the 12th December, 1927, which agreement has since been ratified by the Commonwealth Parliament, and also by the Parliament of each of the States. One condition of the agreement was that the Commonwealth would seek an alteration of the Constitution in order to give the agreement constitutional force and effect. That has been done. The agreement sets forth the text of the amendments proposed to be made to the Constitution. As both inside Parliament and outside, that text has been the subject of discussion, I desire to make it clear that not only was it submitted to the Crown Law Officers of the Commonwealth, but also that the advice of eminent counsel outside was obtained before the technical alteration was agreed upon. Briefly, the clause gives power to the Commonwealth to make agreements with the States relating to the public debts of the States, and to validate any such agreement when made. It also provides that the agreement may be varied with  the consent of the parties thereto. The constitutional alteration was approved by an overwhelming majority in each of the States and in the Commonwealth, the voting being - </para>

          <graphic href="120332192903145_2_1.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para class="block">So that the aggregate majority in favour of the proposed alteration was 3 to 1. </para>
        <para>An important feature of the Government policy which was placed before the electors was the validation of the financial agreement. The Government was returned to power by the electors, and thus had a mandate from the people to validate the agreement. It also has the approval of all the State Parliaments for the validation of the agreement. The position of the Government in submitting this measure for the approval of honorable senators is, therefore, very strong indeed. At the recent elections the Leader of the Labour party in another place, while supporting the referendum, opposed the Financial Agreement, and stated that he favoured the restoration of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments and a new agreement with the States with regard to debts. The opposition of the Labour party to the Financial Agreement was, therefore, placed very prominently before the electors, and as that party was returned with a minority the Government is definitely entitled to claim that it has the approval of the people. </para>
        <para>A copy of the agreement is printed with the bill, and I propose briefly to explain some of its main provisions. The agreement is divided into four parts. The most important provisions of Part I relate to the constitution and powers of the Loan Council, the object of which is to bring about permanent co-ordination in our governmental borrowings and debt management, and to mobilize the credit of Australia so as to secure the best terms in the money market. In the past, the credit of the Commonwealth and the States has undoubtedly suffered from competitive borrowing, and it was not until a voluntary Loan Council was formed in 1924 that co-operative methods valle instituted. The experience of that voluntary body has made it clear that our  credit  will be enhanced by the establishment of a permanently constituted Loan Council, which will ultimately result in a large saving in our annual interest bill. </para>
        <para>It is provided in the agreement that the Loan Council shall consist of one representative of the Commonwealth and one representative of each State. Where a vote is necessary the Commonwealth is to have two votes, each State one vote, and the Commonwealth will also have a casting vote. This agreement was reached after considerable discussion, and it was therefore considered to be a fair arrangement. </para>
        <para>One of the most important questions to be decided by the Loan Council will be the amount of money that can be borrowed by a first-class borrower at reasonable rates and conditions. The decision on this question will really not be difficult, as the matter is one that is determined by the money market itself. ! desire to make it perfectly clear that the Loan Council has no power to deal with the loan estimates of the Commonwealth or the States. No sovereign Parliament in Australia would permit any outside body to interfere with its individual rights. If, in times of stringency, it is found that the total programmes of the Commonwealth and the States exceed the amount that the Loan Council considers is available in the market at reasonable rates and conditions for a first-class borrower, the agreement prescribes the method of apportionment of the reduced amount amongst the various Governments. If the Loan Council can reach a unanimous decision, the allocation will be in accord with that decision. If it fails to do so the Commonwealth is to be entitled to have not more than one-fifth of the reduced amount allocated to it, and the States are to be entitled to share the balance in proportion to their net loan expenditure during the preceding five years. Each Government will thus reap an equitable share of any reduced sum, and competition will be avoided. </para>
        <para>Broadly speaking, the Commonwealth is to arrange all borrowing subject to the Loan. Council. There is, however, a provision in the agreement by which a State can borrow moneys outside Australia in its own name, subject to the unanimous consent of the Loan Council. </para>
        <para>Part II. of the agreement deals with the temporary provisions, which are being applied for a period of two years from 1st July, 1927, to 30th June, 1929, and which have already been approved by Parliament. The plan of co-operative borrowing has been in full operation and lias produced beneficial results in our loan transactions. The experience of the temporary period has already demonstrated the advantages to be gained from the establishment of the Loan Council on a constitutional basis. </para>
        <para>Part III. deals with permanent provisions which will come into operation on 1st July, 1929, subject to the approval by Parliament of this bill. The Commonwealth will take over the debts of the States existing on 1st July, 1929, and will thus assume as between the Commonwealth and the States the liabilities of the States to bond-holders. The Commonwealth .will contribute annually towards payment of interest on the debts of the States for the remainder of a period of 58 years, commencing from 1st July, 1927, &#163;7,584,912, and the States will provide the balance required to meet the full interest charges. A sinking fund of 7s. 6d. per cent, is to be established to wipe out in 58 years the net debt of &#163;641,000,000 which existed on 1st July, 1927. Towards this sinking fund the Commonwealth will contribute 2s. 6d. per cent, and the States 5s. per cent. A sinking fund of 10s. per cent, is to be established on all new borrowings after 1st July, 1927, so that each debt will be extinguished in 53 years. Towards the sinking fund the Commonwealth will contribute 5s. per cent, and the States 5s. per cent. The sinking funds are to be controlled by the National Debt Commission. Sinking fund moneys are to be regularly applied to the re-purchase or redemption of debts of each State. </para>
        <para>As securities come into the hands of the National Debt Commission they will be cancelled and, thereafter, during the prescribed sinking fund period, the State concerned will pay to the Sinking Fund Commission an amount equal to 4&#163; per cent, per annum on the cancelled .debt. In that way the sinking fund will receive the benefit of compound interest at the rate of 4-J per cent, on the prescribed contribution. The annual contribution  by the Commonwealth to the sinking fund on debts at 30th June, 1927, will be &#163;801,680 per annum. On new debts the annual contribution will be determined by the amount of new borrowing and will be at the rate of &#163;100,000 a year for 53 years for every &#163;40,000,000 raised by or on behalf of the States. </para>
        <para>Provision is also made for a settlement of the contentious problem of the rate of interest to be paid by the Commonwealth to the States on the value of transferred properties. The States will be discharged of all liability whatsoever in respect of &#163;10,924,323 of the States debts, bearing interest at 5 per cent. That sum is the agreed value of the properties in. question. Up till 30th June, 1927, the Commonwealth had paid interest at the rate of only 3&#163; per cent. The settlement is really equivalent to a payment at the rate of 5 per cent, and represents an annual gain to the States of approximately &#163;164,000. </para>
        <para>The effect of the agreement on the finances of the Commonwealth for 1927-28 was as follows: - </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="120332192903145_3_2.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>It will be noticed that every State received a fair share of the increased payments. This increase was distributed for the benefit of the States thus: - </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="120332192903145_3_3.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>These increased payments were not lightly undertaken by the Commonwealth when the agreement was under discussion, but it was felt that the Commonwealth was warranted in making a substantial contribution from its revenues to secure for the people of Australia the benefits that will accrue from the establishment of adequate and properly safeguarded sinking funds. I do not think that the Commonwealth has received that credit which it should receive from the fact that it was the making of the largely increased payments that practically led to the establishment of these sinking funds. </para>
        <para>The fact that the Commonwealth revenue has had to meet an extra burden of approximately &#163;900,000 under the agreement does not mean that the taxpayers of Australia are being called upon to provide that sum. This extra cost to the Commonwealth is more than compensated by the immediate savings to the State budgets. </para>

He submitted to his Parliament a table showing that the total benefits to Western Australia, including interest on cancelled debt and savings in sinking fund contributions, would amount to &#163;10,613,537 over a period of thirty years, or an average of &#163;353,784 a year. </para>

          <para>If, by the referendum vote, the public in Australia approve of the determination to straighten things out in regard to sinking funds, public credit from that fact alone will be lifted to an extent which will make the sinking fund obligation under the scheme, to all intents nil. In other words, the three-eighths allocated to the common sinking fund will be offset - in time more than offset - by the average saving in the rate of interest. In addition, there will be all the advantages of unity - advantages gained at no cost. A plan  of  this kind is a genuine essay in statesmanship. It embodies the large view and the long view, and without encroachment on any real rights of the States, it is in principle honest and sound. </para>

        <para>I submit to honorable senators that the merits and benefits of this agreement cannot be over-stated. It provides a satisfactory settlement of two long outstanding and contentious problems - financial assistance to the States, and transfer of States&#39; debts - both of which have been discussed by many conferences dating back to the commencement of federation, without any comprehensive plan being agreed upon. The achievement of an agreement on these contentious problems is, therefore, a matter for extreme gratification to the Governments of the States and the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>The agreement safeguards the position of all State finances, inasmuch as it ensures definite Commonwealth assistance on a satisfactory basis, and the States will no longer depend on the will of the Commonwealth Parliament. It also provides for immediate relief to the finances of the States. The establishment of properly safeguarded sinking funds is another important feature of the agreement, and is an essential adjunct of sound Government finance to which lenders of money now pay special attention. The creation of a Loan Council on a permanently constituted basis to deal with our debts and borrowings should result in immeasurable benefits. It will put an end to competition between Governments such as was experienced some years ago with disastrous results, and will enable us to mobilize our credit and obtain better terms for our loans. Above all, it will so enhance Australia&#39;s credit that substantial savings of interest will ultimately be secured to the people through the issue of new and conversion loans on better terms than would be possible in the absence of co-ordinated debt management and adequate sinking fund provision. In conclusion, may I say that the agreement can briefly be described as a business-like arrangement based on the best principles  of  sound finance, and as it has already been approved by the State Parliaments and the people of Australia, I urge honorable senators to vote for the bill so that the final stage may be reached and those immeasurable benefits which considered and representative opinion have no hesitation in saying will be secured by this agreement, may be reaped by the people of the Commonwealth who are also the people of the States. </para>

          <para>. - This is the third occasion on which I have had the honour to  speak upon the all important subject of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. At the federal conventions the allotment of customs revenue was a stumbling block that for a long time prevented the delegates from the various colonies from reaching unanimity, but as I dealt very fully in 1926 with the events that led to the arrangement for the payment of 25s. a head to the States, it is not my intention on this occasion to traverse the same ground again.

However, I do not propose to argue that phase of the proposal at the moment.I am satisfied that if my honorable friend were Prime Minister - and he might have been but for an accident&#39; in the spelling of his name - he would not have had the audacity to promise that an agreement made by this Parliament would come up for review ten years hence, when he might not he a member of the Parliament. </para>

        <para>The Leader of the Senate has referred to the attitude of the Labour party to the financial agreement. The right honorable gentleman did not state the position clearly, so I propose to do so. The Labour party made it plain that it was opposed to the abolition of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, but urged the voters to vote &#34; yes &#34; for the referendum, so as to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to make agreements with the States for the taking over of State debts, and for the control of future borrowing. As a party we have always approved of the establishment of the Loan Council. We realized that it was suicidal to have several States in the money market at the same time and, therefore, we always favored some system of control to safeguard the financial position of the Commonwealth; but as a party we held that a vote in favour of the referendum question would not be regarded as a vote for the financial agreement. Accordingly, the Labour party in another place opposed this bill and the party in this chamber will do likewise. During the election campaign in Western Australia, the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann),</inline> the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> the Honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hal.</inline> Colebatch and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnston,</inline> senators elect, all strongly denounced the financial agreement and advised the people of Western Australia to vote against the referendum question. The vote, however, gave a majority for the question. Consequently, the honorable member for Forrest voted for this bill in another place because the party whip was cracked over his head. To that extent he was recreant to his election pledge, but to his credit it may he said that he had the courage to vote in the division. Another honorable member, I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory,</inline> was lacking in courage, and rather than vote he left the chamber when the division bells were ringing. When a man walks out of the chamber in good health and strength and does not record his vote, I can only describe him as a political coward. If the Prime Minister were so sure of his position with regard to the financial agreement, why did he not submit it to the people in conjunction with the proposal to alter the Constitution? Speaking in another place <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> said- </para>

          <para>It was obvious that if the agreement wore to take a permanent form it must have a basis that could not be altered at the whim of a chance majority in any Parliament. </para>

        <para class="block">Actually that is what is happening now. The Prime Minister has forced this validating hill through another place on a chance majority, other wise, it would not have made its appearance in this chamber. So precarious was the position of the Government at one time that every nerve was strained and every whip was cracked to force the supporters of the Government to record their votes for the bill. As a result we had the spectacle of members who denounced the financial agreement from public platforms in every State during the election, voting for a measure of which personally they did not approve. They did so because they were given to understand that if the Government were defeated on its most important financial proposals there would be another election. </para>

We are now concerned with its ratification. If this bill is agreed to, an arrangement regarding important matters of finance will operate for a period of 58 years.

          <para>That proposed new section recites the matters with respect to which there will be the power to make an agreement. The latter portion gives to the Commonwealth Parliament the power to pass a law validating any agreement entered into prior to the amendment of the Constitution - including the agreement now before us - and to give effect to any alteration of any agreement that may be decided upon by the Commonwealth and the States. The power thus given will not extend beyond the making of a law to give effect to agreements that are entered into, and any alterations thereto that have the approval of all the States, without referring the matter further to the people. I have no doubt that honorable members will wish to study the exact wording of the proposed alteration. The matter has been examined exhaustively by the Crown Law authorities of the Commonwealth and every one of the States. It has been altered considerably since it was originally drafted, but the law authorities of both the Commonwealth and the States agree that, in its present form, it will give effect to what is the intention of all. That is, it will validate this agreement and leave the way open to its being altered at any future date if all parties are agreeable to such an alteration being made. </para>

          <para>I appeal to honorable senators with all the earnestness at my command to reject this agreement. I point out that, if they pass this bill, they will assuredly sign the death warrant of the States financial security and independence. If they do, the fault will be on their own heads. I shall fight the measure to the last ditch, and to the limit of my endurance in Western Australia. I will not allow such a fraud to be perpetrated on the people. The late Chief Justice Griffith described &#34;as an act of fraud under the Constitution &#34; something far less serious than this. This chamber is the custodian of the rights of the States. It is the supposed citadel of State rights. We are here to see that they get a fair deal, and they are entitled to natural justice. The present necessities of the States should not be dealt with as merchandise, as this Government is doing. No doubt normal times will return. Fifty-eight years hence, Western Australia, on a most moderate estimate, should have a population of 1,500,000. When that time comes, the grant to Western Australia under this financial agreement will amount to 30d. per head of the population.

          <para>. - I shall not detain the Senate for more than a few minutes. No one can disguise the tremendous importance of this measure. Honorable senators are called upon to give a vote on a matter of supreme importance to Australia, and figuratively to put their signatures to an agreement which will bind the Commonwealth, in the event of the States declining to make any alteration in its terms, for the next 58 years. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>This Senate has two duties in connexion with the financial agreement. It has a duty to the Commonwealth as a whole, and a duty to the States individually. It is within the memory of a number of honorable senators who are now present, that when we discussed the measure, which originally provided for the cancellation of the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States, but did not substitute any other arrangement, I opposed it. I did so because I considered that it was not right that the existing arrangement should be cancelled until a concrete proposal had been substituted. I thought then, as I do now - and in saying this I do not reflect on the vote of the Senate - that the Senate was not wise at that time in surrendering the rights of the States until their position had been secured. I was also entirely opposed to the tentative proposal -which the Treasurer of the day suggested should be substituted for the existing financial arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth. It consisted of the surrender by the Commonwealth of a large amount of direct taxation to the States. That, I believe, would have led to financial chaos in Australia. I then indicated that I believed that the proper solution of the difficulty was to take over the State debts in such a way as would secure the position of the States for the future. For that I had two reasons. First, I believe in the Commonwealth agreeing definitely to a proposal which stretches away into the future and provides for the payment of a specified sum. Naturally the Commonwealth would be growing continually during the period and the proportion of burden upon its total revenue would be constantly decreasing. Secondly, I felt, and I do so still, that it was wise that the Commonwealth, for a considerable time ahead, should secure to the States some portion of the customs and excise revenue. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> talked about imagination, and the visualizing of the future. It does not take very much imagination to conjure up the position which would result if the Commonwealth were tempted to launch out into some extraordinary form of legislation involving the expenditure of vast sums of money, which might place it in such a position that it would be unable to contribute to the State revenue. So that, from both those aspects, I believe that we are perfectly justified in giving our approval to the bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> questioned the right of the Government, in view of what happened at the last elections, to ratify this agreement. The honorable senator very definitely stated that had the Labour party been returned it would have had no hesitation in giving effect to its policy, which was to return to the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. His only justification for such a course is &#39;that the people would have endorsed the policy - of his party. Surely what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. </para>

Even the State of Western Australia, from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> comes, carried the referendum and returned the Government to office. </para>

            <para>- I do not say that, but the Labour party has made the departure. It insists that every one of its members shall follow the leader and do as he does. It does not matter what they believe, they have to say the same thing. The constitutional procedure which has been built up and followed in British communities is that the government of the day states its policy, and its followers are individually free to say whether they agree to it or not. The final responsibility for whatever happens is always on the government of the day. Honorable senators on this side believe that each individual member of the party should be free to express his opinions and vote as he pleases, and the Government is always in the position that it can modify a measure, withdraw it, or ride for a fall if it so desires. The final responsibility is always with it, and that is the only means by which it is practicable to reconcile that freedom and liberty in which honorable members of this party profess to believe, and at the same time to uphold government responsibility in carrying on the business of the country. </para>

        <para>I believe that the Senate should ratify this agreement. I recognize the tremendous responsibility that rests upon honorable senators in doing so, but taken all in all I believe it is the best thing that can be done for the country. It is perfectly true that the arrangement embodied in the agreement cannot be altered during its currency without the unanimous consent of every State and the Commonwealth, but I have no doubt whatever that if, in the course of time the operation of the agreement is found impracticable, the good sense of the governments then in power may be relied upon to effect the necessary alteration. I repeat what I said on a previous occasion, that I hope that while the Loan Council will exercise the strictest possible control of the whole system of borrowing, it will from time to time make the fullest use of that provision in the agreement which enables individual States to go on the market in their own name. Notwithstanding what has been said in quite a number of influential quarters, both here and in London, I am satisfied that periodically there are conditions of the money market under which the </para>
        <para>States, borrowing in their own names, can obtain better terms in London, and possibly in New York, if it be found necessary again to go there, than they could get by borrowing as a Commonwealth. I shall not weary the Senate with a long dissertation on finance giving my reasons for that conclusion; but I am satisfied that such will be found to be the case. I hope that there will not be a too rigid interpretation of the powers that obtain under the common borrower provisions of the agreement. I hope that the Senate will carry this bill and I congratulate the Government on having finally adopted a means of settlement which I believe to be sound and which, I believe, will prove, in the long run, to be very beneficial to this country. </para>

          <para>. - The importance of this bill cannot be stressed too much, because it affects the financial relationship of the two constitutional authorities which at the present time control the destinies of the Australian people. On that account it is necessary for honorable senators, before they place their final seal upon it, to view it from the respective angles of the Commonwealth and the States, and particularly, because of the constitution of this chamber, from the stand-point of how it will affect the States in the years to come. It is argued by some that because the people of Australia, whether they be controlled in the State spheres by State Parliaments or in the greater or national sphere by the Commonwealth Parliament, are one and the same, their interests are necessarily identical. But even a cursory study of the conditions existing in various parts of the Commonwealth convinces one that that is not altogether correct. Certain legislation passed by the national Parliament may benefit one portion of Australia, and at the same time, in a parochial sense, prove detrimental to another portion. It is, therefore, necessary for us to study very closely a bill which validates the financial agreement made two years ago by the Commonwealth and the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> told us this afternoon that this agreement was adopted unanimously by the States Premiers, but the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> has pointed out that the events which preceded the drawing-up of the agreement made anything but unanimity impossible. The <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments which the States had enjoyed in some form since the inception of federation had- been taken away from them, and they were thus in the position of beggars on the doorstep of the Commonwealth Parliament, ready to accept whatever this Parliament was willing to hand out to them. At least one Premier, who signed the agreement on behalf of his State, is not to-day so enamoured of it as he was then. Let me point out what is the opinion of the public outside in reference to this agreement. I propose to quote from a leading article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> a very responsible organ, which is fully capable of expressing public opinion in Victoria. It also expresses with great accuracy the view-point of South Australia in this regard. In a leading article in its issue of 19th February last it said - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>In his policy speech the Prime Minister explained that &#34;an arrangement was arrived at  which  was mutually acceptable.&#34; Yet the whole nation knows the agreement was presented as it were - a pistol at the head of each State. Governments were free to accept or reject, but whichever they did, their <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> grants were to be stopped; and stopped they were. Compensator amounts were set aside and used as financial bait to lure any State that might hesitate. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>In the end each State succumbed. But the claim made by Federal Ministers during the general election that each State Parliament had ratified the agreement had to be discounted. - It was under duress that certain States consented. The referendum seeking sanction to the amendment of the Constitution was essential to the completion of any agreement. Sanction to the amendment, but not necessarily to the particular agreement now to be brought before a new Federal Parliament was granted. The Government is singularly obtuse if it does not realize that. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">What the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> had in mind at the time were the statements of the Prime Minister on behalf of his party, and of members of his party during the recent election campaign. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> spoke of a growing uneasiness in the minds of the people which was reflected when this bill was discussed in another place, and, if it could only find expression, also exists in the minds of many honorable senators who are sitting on the Government side of this chamber. But the party whips have cracked, and honorable senators must, of necessity, obey the dictates of the powers that be. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> commenced its article in the following words:-__ </para>
        <para>The Bruce-Page Government has all along considered the financial agreement a feather in its cap. During the election the feather was ostentatiously flaunted. Since then the feather has inclined to droop; there is even a danger of it being plucked out. </para>
        <para class="block">There was a danger not many days ago of this feather being plucked out, but fortunately for the Government the danger has been avoided, and we have now before us a bill which is to ratify the financial agreement  between  the Commonwealth and the States. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> this agreement has settled for all time the vexed question of Commonwealth assistance to the States, but I remind the right honorable gentleman that if additional financial assistance is not given to South Australia the people of that State will be coming, cap in hand, and asking the Commonwealth to take over some of the State&#39;s liabilities. In his policy speech at Dandenong, the Prime Minister did not say that the Government would stand or fall by its financial proposals. Nor did he ask the people to return his Government <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> power so that the financial agreement with the States might be validated as &#34;the result of carrying the referendum. He appealed to the people to cast an affirmative vote on the referendum, because he said - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The approval of the referendum by the people does not involve the acceptance of the financial agreement itself, but will merely give the Commonwealth a general power to make agreements with the States in regard to public debts and borrowing. The referendum should, therefore, be supported by the electors whether they favor the particular plan set out in the financial agreement or not. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">And the people did so because there was a realization on their part that the Commonwealth Parliament should have the power sought to be obtained by the referendum. For example, most Labour candidates supported the referendum, although they were opposed to the financial agreement. But a considerable section of the electors did not believe that, when they were casting an affirmative vote, they were giving away the right of the States for all time to an expanding share of the Customs and excise revenue. </para>

            <para>- Not among the candidates for the Senate. The attitude of the Leader of the State Labour party was due, not so much to his objection to the Commonwealth having this power to make agreements as to the manner in which the Premier of South Australia had sacrificed the. interests of his State by signing the agreement without receiving a satisfactory <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> from the Commonwealth. </para>

        <para>Let us examine the position of South Australia under this agreement and compare it with the probable position of the State if the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments had been continued. Our complaint is that South Australia is not receiving a fair deal. When the financial agreement was under consideration, there was a strong feeling that South Australia, with Western Australia and Tasmania, should receive special consideration to compensate it for the financial disabilities which it has suffered under federation. The Gunn and the Hill Governments made strong representations for assistance, apart altogether from the capitation payments; but unfortunately there was a change in the personnel of the South Australian Parliament and a consequent change in the administration. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler,</inline> the Premier, did not adopt the proposals of his predecessors in office. When he attended the conference of Commonwealth and State Premiers to consider the financial proposals in May, 1927, he said he was perfectly satisfied with the agreement that had been made.  His  view was expressed in these words - </para>

          <para>I listened with great interest to the Prime Minister&#39;s explanation of his Government&#39;s proposals. I was struck with the soundness of his argument. I am in entire agreement with the principle he enunciated; but in matters of detail his proposal requires amendment. Although we all desire a continuation of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments for 58 years as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> suggested, I realize that it would probably be impossible for the Commonwealth to continue the present scale of payments beyond twenty years. </para>

            <para>- It may be, but I can assure the Leader of the Senate that the Government&#39;s attitude on this question has an important influence on my attitude towards the bill. The Government of South Australia over two years ago made an urgent request for financial assistance, but the matter has been handled in such a dilatory way by this Government that we have not yet had any definite pronouncement on the subject, and although the royal commission completed its inquiry some time ago its report is not yet available. I suggest that the Government should take steps to expedite the presentation of the report to Parliament, so that we may ascertain to what extent the Government proposes to assist South Australia. . Both the Hill and the Gunn Governments emphasized that South Australia was not receiving sufficient financial aid under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments and asked that the amount be increased. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler</inline> did not press this claim.

            <para>- It has made considerable progress during the last twenty years and would have been in a perfectly sound financial position to-day but for the policy of the party represented by the Butler Government, to which honorable members supporting the Government in federal politics subscribe. The figures which I have quoted show, that while for the first few years of the agreement, the amounts payable to the States may be slightly higher than would have been due in the form of capitation payments, they diminish gradually and over the whole period of the agreement will be considerably less. That is one of the strongest reasons why some <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system should be restored. Practically the whole of the addition to a State&#39;s population is due to the natural increase and the arrival of assisted migrants, none of whom possess much of this world&#39;s goods and immediately become a burden upon the finances of the State. Children have to be educated, and migrants settled on the land or absorbed in industry under governmental schemes. In South Australia, because of the low rainfall in certain portions, and the absence of rivers and natural water supplies, land settlement is becoming more expensive every year. On the other hand, every additional  settler in that or any other State immediately becomes a contributor to Commonwealth revenue in the form of customs and excise duties without the financial obligations of the Federal Government being substantially increased. That important factor should not be overlooked. </para>

            <para>- I remind the Minister that every penny appropriated by the Gunn or Hill Governments was appropriated with the consent of a majority of Liberal members in the Legislative Council, which has the power to reject any appropriation bill. During the 73 years which South Australia has  enjoyed  responsible government the Labour party has been in office - not in power - for only ten and a half years. For the remainder of that period,- Liberals, Nationalist and others masquerading under different political names, who have occupied the Treasury bench, have contributed to the doleful position portrayed by the Premier at Peterborough. If the people of South Australia who are taxed more heavily than those in any other State could see a possibility of a reduction in taxation, they might be able to carry on; but  :is  the Premier pointed out the burden will become heavier. That is due largely to the persistence with which this Government is forcing this financial agreement through Parliament. I stress the point that with the increase of population the obligations of the States in providing railway transport, water conservation and distribution services, housing, public health facilities, police protection, and education become greater, whilst the Commonwealth without incurring expense immediately benefits by increases in customs and excise revenue. </para>

            <para>- No. Parliament was morally bound to retain the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment during the continuance of the federal system. The Labour party believes in keeping the promise made to the people years ago, and had members of that party been returned with a majority we should have introduced a bill to provide for the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment. I hope that even now the Government will recognize its responsibility, particularly to those States which, through no fault of their own, are on the verge of insolvency. As this chamber is allegedly the custodian of the rights of the States, I appeal to honorable senators opposite to reject the bill and force the Government to introduce in its place a measure which should more nearly meet the wishes of the members of a chamber constituted as this is. </para>

          <para>. - It may be a hackneyed phrase to say that the subject of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States is an old friend of the Senate. It would appear now, however, that it is making its last appearance in the Senate for some years, and, I, therefore, feel that I should have a last word, although I realize that it is impossible to say anything new on the subject, other than to make mention of the change of attitude of some persons towards it. All honorable senators are aware that a referendum of the people has been taken in this matter, and that they have emphatically approved of the alterations proposed. Nevertheless, I feel that we should ask ourselves what the electors had in mind when they agreed to the referendum proposals. If they were of the opinion that those proposals meant only that the Commonwealth would have power to make agreements with the States, and not that they were bound to a particular agreement, we are entitled to consider whether this agreement should not, even now, be reviewed. If, on the other hand, wo believe that the electors had this agreement in mind, we have very little ground for opposing the bill. Indeed, in opposing it, we should be like the man who entered into a religious discussion - a foolish enterprise at any time - in Constantinople, and argued that the Mohammedan religion was wrong. It is not easy to take a different view from that expressed by the electors at a referendum, because we have been led to believe that the decision of the people thus expressed is necessarily right. I do not hold that opinion; I believe that sometimes a majority can be decidedly wrong. The only reason for bowing to the decision of the majority is that the majority can force its will upon us. I am not here to follow slavishly the decision of any majority. I remind honorable senators that in the past majorities have blocked reforms. Emerson once said that every reform was at one time the opinion of one individual; as time passed others came to think as he thought, until eventually what was the opinion of one man became the opinion of the majority. There is nothing sacrosanct about the decision of a majority; it has been as often wrong as right. In this case I believe it is wrong. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Although I am here to respect the wishes of the majority, I have grave doubts whether- the electors had this agreement in mind when they gave an affirmative answer to the referendum proposals. I remind honorable senators that the Prime Minister himself, when he asked the electors to give power to the Commonwealth Government to enter into agreements with the States, emphasized that he did not necessarily mean a particular agreement. In the <inline font-style="italic">Daily News</inline> of Friday, November 16, 1928, there appears an artistic representation of an alleged Western Australian crowd. The artist has, however, drawn somewhat on his imagination, for he has depicted some of the men wearing bell-topper hats. I have seldom seen a hat of that description in Western Australia. Beneath that picture, over the signature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> were these words - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I wish to emphasize that by passing the referendum you do not vote for a particular form of financial agreement. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>The Prime Minister gave the electors to understand that, while he sought authority for the Commonwealth to enter into agreements, he referred to no particular agreement. I feel, therefore, that I am entitled to the opinion that this agreement was not clearly in the minds of the electors when they passed an affirmative vote for the referendum proposals. For that reason I shall vote against this bill, as I did previously against the Financial Agreement Bill. Perhaps honorable senators will regard me as a lamb about to be led to the slaughter - and, indeed, I dread the butcher&#39;s knife - but I feel&#39; that some good might result from my opposition to this measure. In any case, I am prepared to be the sacrificial element. </para>
        <para>The success of the Government in connexion with the Financial Agreement with the States has depended on two fallacies. I have referred to them previously. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir George Pearce)</inline> said just now that the day might come when a Labour government would be in office and be at liberty to devote any surplus revenue to the establishment of a child endowment fund. I suggest that the electors would still have a say in the government of the country even though the Labour party were in office, and they would not allow a government to utilize its surplus revenue in a way of which they did not approve. There is, perhaps, some ground for the right honorable gentleman&#39;s fears, but it is not very solid. What has the Labour party done in connexion with this agreement? It has out-Heroded  Herod in coming to the rescue of the States. It is generally understood that the policy of the Labour party is to aggrandize the Commonwealth and to abolish the States, or at least to reduce them to such a state of penury and impotence that they will be like glorified shire councils. What is the reason for this change of front? Why would the Labour party restore the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments if it occupied the Trea.tury bench? That party has changed its policy because it has regard to that large body of electors not associated with any political party. The Labour party realizes that the electors will stand across the path proposed to be followed by any party or government whose policy does not meet with their approval. </para>
        <para>The other fallacy to which the Leader of the Senate gave expression was that owing to its heavy commitments, which imposed a drain on its resources, the Government was forced to take this action. It is a wrong principle to use a passing circumstance as the basis of a permanent arrangement. This agreement is a permanent arrangement, for it will extend for at least 58 years, and, it may be, until the crack of doom. It will remain in operation until a future generation alters it if they can, which is well nigh impossible. </para>
        <para>Australia&#39;s expenses in connexion with the Great War amounted to about &#163;400,000,000, and this Parliament passed a measure in 1923-24 to amortize that debt. We set about in a creditable way to hit upon a device to rid Australia of that millstone, and the result of our efforts will be that the responsibility of Australians in that matter will cease to exist in about 35 years&#39; time. It is wrong to use the effect of a passing circumstance for the purpose of coming to a permanent arrangement. If a man on the land is temporarily experiencing a drought and losing money he does not take that as criteria of his whole career. He realizes that it is but a passing phase, which will be balanced by coming events. So passing circumstances should not be taken into consideration by the Government when formulating a financial agreement with the States practically for all time. The Government has provided a sinking fund in connexion with the redemption of Australia&#39;s war debt which has absorbed many extraneous and large sums of money. Already it has swallowed surpluses amounting to &#163;7,000,000, and nearly &#163;1,500,000 from the profits of the Commonwealth Bank in addition to wai&#34; reparations. In the opinion of myself and many with expert knowledge of the subject, our war debt should be wiped out by 1965. It may be claimed that Australia will then still have to pay pensions which are the result of the war. The war ended in 1918, and a simple calculation discloses that after the lapse of another 58 years, it is extremely unlikely that we shall have a single war veteran in existence to draw a pension. </para>

        <para>The period of 58 years will not see the end of this agreement. Then the States will experience a lean time. The Commonwealth Government will, for the first 53 years, set aside &#163;100,000 annually to sustain a borrowing policy of &#163;40,000,000, and thereafter until the crack of doom, if we want such a sum. What will become of that &#163;40,000,000? The vital point is that in the 59th year the Commonwealth will pay only about &#163;5,200,000 towards a perpetual borrowing rate of about &#163;40,000,000 annually. And this &#163;5,200,000, the peak point of the charge on the Commonwealth Treasury is all that the Commonwealth will pay on behalf of the States. On the other hand, their return from a continuance of the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments would be &#163;25,000,000! So that, with the war obligation of some &#163;10,000,000 per annum saved, and &#163;20,000,000 saved by not paying &#34;the States their capitation due, the Commonwealth Treasury will have a fine time! &#34;What a remarkable change of opinion and mentality! It is difficult to account for such changes. I at one time read an article by some American publisher, in which it was claimed that the opinion of the time is largely moulded by the dominant thought of the hour. He cited the case of the American Constitution, the originators of which were under the influence of the great Newton, who made discoveries based upon the influence of checks and balances in the physical and cosmic sphere. The results are indelibly engraven on the American Constitution. By comparison, what has taken place in this country? When federation was accomplished nobody dreamed that 28 years hence a political party would arise and say unto the States of the Commonwealth &#34;We shall give you no more money from customs and excise revenue. We shall cut you off from that source of supply.&#34; But that is what has actually happened. When federation was accomplished provision was made for the financial assistance of the States and, ten years after, the desire was still to give effect to that policy. The Deakin Government of 1910, propounded a scheme whereby each State should receive 25s. per head of its population from the customs and excise revenue, and proposed to embody it in the Constitution. The country rejected the proposal. I well remember participating in the discussions that then occurred. The general impression was that 25s. per head was insufficient and that was the stand that I took when I argued the matter in Western Australia. I believed then, as I do believe now, that, in view of the possibility of the discovery of untold wealth in that vast region, the amount proposed was totally inadequate for the proper development of the country. And during the last eighteen years there has been a  see-sawing  of opinion as to how the States should be assisted. The reason for the ratification of the present agreement is that the mouthpieces of the States, when in conference  with the Commonwealth authorities at Melbourne not very long ago, were too stiffnecked, and declined to accept the proposal put forward by the Commonwealth Government, when it expressed willingness to evacuate the field of direct taxation. As a result that Government, in turn, got its own back up, bristles rose on both sides, and eventually the States fared worse than they would originally have done. That is only natural, as the Commonwealth holds the key to the position. It collects the money, and has the power of the purse. And just as the power of the purse established the House of Commons in its early and struggling days, and raised it to its present stable and impregnable position, so that power will make this Parliament equally impregnable. This central Government will, as the result of this bill, be denied no avenue of taxation. It will be able to step into the States&#39; arena and levy taxation in any direction that it sees fit. Consequently the States will have to scratch around and take what is left - the crumbs from the rich glutton&#39;s table. </para>
        <para>It is clear that the power of the Federal Government has waxed and not waned. At one time it was found necessary to encourage the federal spirit and to nurse it very indulgently, but now the central power is strong beyond all expectation. The States are in a helpless position, and forced to levy taxation to meet the ordinary demands that are made upon them. </para>
        <para>How will the average citizen fare - the individual responsible for the election of representatives to this and to the State Parliaments? His interests should at all times be kept in mind, but too often they are forgotten. It will be no satisfaction to him to be told that he cannot have an extension of his railway system, his water supply, his educational system, and that he cannot have justice brought to his door instead of having to travel long distances to secure it. He will have, in future, to look to the Federal Government for assistance, and probably go wanting. While the central Government is in the field of direct taxation, it is bound to get all that is available of the surplus earnings of the people, because always the superior authority comes in first and the inferior authority last. The Federal Government will always be safe. The </para>
        <para class="block">Federal Parliament is established as firmly as the House of Commons. It is only the States who are in a helpless position now that they are deprived of portion of their financial resources, their share of the customs and excise revenue. By accepting this agreement they are taking a headlong, course down a steep place. No longer will they be able properly to safeguard the interests of their citizens. I cannot account for the change of mentality on the part of the Nationalist party, the direct descendants of the old Liberal party. I presume that if there had been no war and some of us had not been called upon to &#34;walk the plank,&#34; so to speak - if we were still in the ranks of Labour and Labour was still sane, as we all would wish to see it - the old Liberal party if still in power would be doing exactly what it proposed to do in 1910; that is to provide in the Constitution for the payment for all time of 25s. per head to the States. It is not my responsibility to explain why a party that was formerly friendly to the States is now the spoiler of the States. It is quite enough for me to explain my own actions. It is the country man who will suffer. He will go to the State Parliament and will find an empty Treasury unless the State chooses to impose more taxation. But, as I have already explained, the central authority is bound to get in first in the matter of collecting taxation on the surplus earnings of the people. </para>
        <para>The Canadian provinces, I think, get 5s. or 6s. per head from the Dominion Government, whereas 58 years from now Western Australia, with its population of 1,500,000, which it should have by that time, will get 30d. per head. It will not be enough to provide for the State&#39;s needs. I would say to the Commonwealth Government &#34;Take it back with the rest. Let the tail go with the hide.&#34; At the same time, the populous and opulent States of Victoria and New South Wales will be receiving millions of pounds compared with the small payments made to other States, which will have gradually overhauled them in the matter of population. At least that has been the experience of Canada and United States of America. Although they have now a population of 44,000,000, the thirteen American States which fought England in the War of Revolution, are not the United States of America of to-day. The other States, which have since been included in the union and which were not even settled at the time of the War of the Revolution have a population of 70,000,000. In the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan the increase in population over a period of twenty years has been 35 per cent., whereas in the older settled provinces of Ontario and Quebec the increase has not exceeded 2 per cent. </para>
        <para>One weak feature of the financial agreement is the fixed nature of the Commonwealth&#39;s contribution to the States. It commences with a division of &#163;7,500,000 among a population of 6,000,000, but iu 58 years, when the population of the Commonwealth reaches 20,000,000, the proportion will be exceedingly small. The position of the outer States will theo be like that of a youth who has grown to manhood, but is still compelled to wear the knickerbockers and short jackets of youth. The older and more populous States of to-day will be like the youth pf twenty, who will not grow any bigger and still be able to wear the clothing of to-day. The idea of the Commonwealth Government is that knickerbockers and short jackets should still be the suitable garb for the Western Australia and Queensland States when they reach the age of manhood. </para>

        <para>Another aspect of this question to be taken into consideration are the functions which the States perform to-day compared with what they were in days gone by. Every one knows how Thomas Jefferson in that document so full of poetry in prose, the American Declaration of Independence, laid down the functions of States. As a matter of fact the States that form the Union to-day have  added very little to the traditional task of aiding citizens laid down for them 150 years ago. But the functions performed by the States of Australia are vastly different. Not long after the foundation of Australia, railway lines were projected, built, and owned by the people. The United States of America has never had railway lines owned by the people, and there has been very little of State-owned railway construction in Canada. What there is of it belongs to the Dominion Government, and not to the provinces. The States of Australia are regarded by the people as the agencies that should come to their aid in their everyday occupations. They are not expected simply to maintain law and order while citizens work out their own destinies. For instance, the State of Victoria has its railways, its harbours, its light and power, and its water supplies, which are owned by the people, because the sentiment of the people is in favour of Government control of these utilities. What time would a candidate for parliamentary honours have if he proposed to sell the Victorian railways or hand over to private enterprise the water works which are now under various chartered authorities ? It is time we realized that the States are doing the work of helping the pioneers to have an easier and more progressive time, and that we should encourage them instead of taking from them the wherewithal to administer to the people&#39;s needs. </para>
        <para>It is true that for seven or eight years under this agreement the States will fare better than they would have done under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system, but after that, instead of the Commonwealth&#39;s contribution to the States, expanding as it should do with every increase of population, it will start to shrink in proportion to the population, until in 58 years  it will not  be more than about &#163;13,000,000 compared with the &#163;25,000,000 the States would receive on the <inline font-style="italic">par capita</inline> basis for a population of 20,000,000. Looking at, the matter from the point of <inline font-style="italic">view</inline> of helping the States to do those things which public opinion expects them to do, it is about time we revised our opinions and said that the States should be helped and not hindered in the performance of the services expected of them. I cannot support a measure which is fraught with danger to the States and to future generations of this country. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>. - I  have given considerable thought to the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> and it seems to me that the inquiry which he proposes may be divided into two parts. The first relates to the conditions of those engaged in our primary industries, the rewards which they are receiving for the investment of their capital and the expenditure of their labour, and the second portion seems to suggest that an attempt should be made to ascertain what prospect, if any, there is for an expansion of the farming interests in this country. The inquiry, to be effective, should be of a very comprehensive nature. Whether or not it will have any practical results is another matter. Before securing election to this chamber  I  had some experience in the State Parliament in South Australia. A number of inquiries along the lines now suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> were made in that State; but invariably, in spite of valuable data collected and helpful suggestions made by the respective commissions or committees, successive governments, for one reason or another, took no action.  I  can claim to  speak with knowledge of this subject, because I was reared on a farm. I have been connected with primary production all my life, and I still have land interests in South Australia. With this knowledge as a background, I can say with every confidence that, although the lot of the man on the land to-day is not so good as many of us would like it to be, it is infinitely better than it was 25. or 30 years ago. Our farmers are now working under much better conditions. They can command, the use of improved agricultural machinery and modern means of transport. The &#39;motor car is now in almost universal use. The introduction of modern machinery has taken much of the drudgery out of harvesting operations, and to a great extent it has reduced the volume of labour necessary to carry on farm work. The more general application of better methods of cultivation and the use of superphosphates have had a marked effect upon the development of the industry. The isolation of the primary producer has to a large extent disappeared. Again he lias to thank the motor car as well as the extension of telephone services to country districts and the development of wireless broadcasting. The farmer of to-day, living in what were formerly regarded as isolated districts, enjoys privileges which 30 years ago were the admiration of the unfortunate primary producer of that time and the proud possession of his more fortunate city cousins and dwellers in the larger centres. Despite these advantages, however, the primary producing industry - and in this term I include not only the wheat-grower but the mixed farmer and the pastoralist - is not developing ns Ave should like to see it develop. It is desirable, therefore, that we should take steps to ascertain what should be done to remedy the existing state of affairs. We are told by some that the industry has not progressed because primary producers have to pay high wages and are in other  ways  handicapped by industrial conditions peculiar to Australia. I venture to say that if a comparison were made of the wages costs in relation to production 25 or 30 years ago, and the wages costs of to-day, it would be found that we must look beyond wages for the solution of the problem. One possible explanation is the distribution of the cultivable lands in Australia. Provision should be made for the sons of small farmers who may desire to launch out and become primary producers on their  own  account. Another factor is the provision of suitable farm labour. Although I have not been an employer in a large way I  know  some of the troubles in regard to the employment of labour. The small farmer is in a much more difficult position, from this point of view, than is the man  who  is producing on a more extensive scale. Because of the intermittent nature of farm work it is difficult for the small farmer to attract the right class of labour at the time  when  he most needs it. When the seasonal demand ceases he is obliged to dispense  Avith  his employees,  whereas  a farmer  working  on a comparatively large scale can find employment for a certain number of hands all the year round, and so is able to retain  a  suitable class of labour for the harvest season. In addition to the need to make available suitable land for settlers, there is the financial aspect of farm operations to be taken into account. This difficulty has been, to a certain extent, overcome by the inauguration of State banking systems and by the establishment of the rural credits branch of the Commonwealth Bank. While on this point I may be pardoned if I remind the Senate that the party represented by honorable senators on this side of the chamber pioneered the  way  in granting assistance to primary producers. It  was  a Labour government that established the  Commonwealth  Bank and made possible the present system of rural credits; and in my own State a Labour government, in the teeth of considerable opposition, established the State Bank which to-day is granting considerable assistance to all sections of primary producers. The extension, if any, of such assistance should come  within  the scope of the proposed inquiry, in order to bring about an expansion of the industry. It should be the desire of the Government to go the limit in granting assistance not only to those who receive help from the State institutions, but also to those  who  do not have to call upon financial reserves other than their  own.  In the pastoral industry with which I am associated, we have in the past relied to a great extent upon the financial assistance rendered by stock and station agents to carry us over periods of depression. I have nothing whatever to say against such firms who have carried the producers through difficult periods. I have received assistance from them myself and would be ungrateful indeed if I did not recognize the help they have been to primary producers. But as these firms know that they have to take a risk during periods of depression, the charges imposed for the service they render are higher than they would otherwise be. In these circumstances, higher commissions on sales and higher fees have to be paid for the work which they do in connexion with the pastoral industry. Their policy, however, is not unreasonable as they are holding shareholders capital on which investors expect a dividend. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is the duty of the National Parliament, with the assistance of the Commonwealth Bank, to endeavour to evolve some system whereby the agencies I have mentioned would be relieved of their responsibility, and the burden carried by the nation. One of the great difficulties confronting Australia to-day is the absence of a peasantry such as that which exists in other countries where there are families with an agrarian mind who take a pride in the fact that the farms which they work have been handed down to them through generations. Such people have no desire to leave the land and seek employment in other avenues of industry. The present drift towards the cities is largely due to the possibility for profits in selling land. Land values in certain well established areas have been increasing, with the result that the farmers who, perhaps, 25 or 30 years ago, had no intention of selling their holdings and leaving the country districts, have in consequence of the high prices offered, sold their land and invested their capital in city industries. This has not been beneficial to the country, as the vendors as a rule, settle in the city and take their money with them. . Their place is usually taken by another settler who is struggling with a big mortgage and paying interest which is also spent beyond the confines of the district in which he is living. </para>
          <para>The first essential is to prepare and carry out effective closer land settlement. The smaller primary producer who cannot afford to continuously employ labour to assist him in production must be assisted in some other way. The most effective way that I can visualize is a scheme such as that inaugurated in South Australia many years ago by the late Honorable C. C. Kingston who was afterwards a very prominent member of this Parliament. In the late &#34; nineties &#34; that gentleman, in conjunction with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, was responsible for the sub-division of a huge area of perpetual leasehold in the northern and northeastern portion of South Australia for mixed farming purposes. Workmen&#39;s blocks were provided, homestead leases were granted, and conditions were inserted in the lease to prevent one person securing more than one block. There was also a residential clause. As you, sir, will remember there was, unfortunately, a &#34; fly in the ointment,&#34; as the land sub-divided was not suitable for agriculture, and not only the farmers failed, but the system was also a failure. Had the land been within the good rainfall belt in which mixed farming could have been successfully carried on, the system would, undoubtedly, have been a success. Such a scheme gives a degree of stability to a family in a small country town, it provides a man with a young family with an inducement to settle in the vicinity of a country town, and gives him the knowledge that he can produce from his own block at least a portion of his livelihood. He should also be able to secure casual employment, and there should be reasonable opportunities in rural pursuits for the employment of members of his family. Such systems ought to be encouraged so that the population in country districts could not only be maintained, but increased instead of being encouraged to gravitate to city industries, or during periods of depression be unemployed and a constant drain upon the community. </para>
          <para>What  opportunities  are there for expanding the primary industries of this country?. I have not a very thorough knowledge of the conditions in the States, with the exception of </para>
          <para class="block">South Australia, beyond what I gathered as  Chairman  of the South Australian Railways Standing Committee, in which capacity I visited five of the States in conducting inquiries on behalf of the State Government. In South Australia, however, we shall have to give very serious consideration to the extension of our primary industries. South Australia is unfortunately situated because of the absence of deposits of coal suitable for commercial purposes. Cheap power is not available to encourage the extension of secondary industries. &#34;We shall, therefore, always have to depend upon the primary industries for the greater portion of our production. One would think that South Australia with its huge area of pastoral leasehold land, comprising hundreds of thousands of square miles would, at least, produce sufficient meat to meet the demands of its own consumers. But at present South Australia has to import 40.000 sheep and 14,000 cattle annually to maintain its flocks and herds, and provide for the needs of its own people. Honorable senators will agree that there is something wrong when such conditions exist, especially if they know, as I know, the amount of public money that has been expended in the development of that territory, . in providing railways, water, and hospitals as well as educational, telephonic, telegraphic and other facilities. The wheat-growing industry is far from being in a satisfactory position in South Australia; nor can the position of the wool industry be regarded with equanimity. It is true that the production of wool has increased in that State, but not to the extent that it should have done when we compare the relatively high yield per sheep to-day with the yield a few years ago. In order to find a solution of these difficulties, two commissions of inquiry have been appointed. In 1918, the then Liberal Government in South Australia appointed a royal commission to inquire into the matter. After an exhaustive inquiry, that commission reported that there was an acute&#39; need for the subdivision of land in both agricultural and pastoral districts. Its report showed that one individual held huge tracts of pastoral lands of which very little use was made, whereas other and smaller holdings were put to better use. The majority of the members of that commission were Liberals - a term synonomous  with Nationalists - yet the Liberal Government of that State refused to act upon their recommendation. In 1924, a Labour Government instituted another inquiry by a body of men not connected with politics, but selected because of their practical knowledge of the industry. In the main, they endorsed the recommendations of the 1918 royal commission in relation to the subdivision of large pastoral holdings. For the past two years, a Liberal Government has been in office in South Australia, but it has made no attempt to give effect to those recommendations notwithstanding the serious condition of the pastoral industry in that State. It was because of my knowledge of what had occurred in South Australia that, in my opening remarks, I expressed doubt whether any benefit would accrue from an inquiry such as that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> In addition to instituting an inquiry into the pastoral industry, the Labour Government of South Australia appointed a Rural Settlement Royal Commission in 1924 to inquire into the possibility of closer settlement within the recognized rainfall belt in that State. Again, the men. selected were not connected with political parties. Three experts in the public departments of the State undertook the inquiry. They were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Colebatch,</inline> at that time the principal of the Roseworthy Agricultural College, and now a member of the Irrigation and Drainage Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Field,</inline> then Secretary for Lands, and now  chairman  of the commission referred to, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spalford,</inline> the. soil and plant expert of the Department of Agriculture. Those men conducted an inquiry into the lands within Goyder&#39;s line of rainfall - a line drawn by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goyder,</inline> a former Surveyor-General of South Australia, by means of which he classified the rainfall areas. For the basis of his classification, he took the plant life of .the several districts. Using the salt bush, the blue bush, and the myall as guides he was able very accurately to define the rainfall line. On one side of Goyder&#39;s line, where the average rainfall is 13 or 14 inches per annum, wheat-growing can be profitably carried on, whereas, say 10 miles on the other side of the line, where the rainfall averages only 10 or 11 inches per annum, the possibilities of successful wheat-growing become more and more remote as the settlers move northward and eastward. Before they proceeded very far, the experts discovered a great number of facts which they thought should be placed before the State Parliament in connexion with legislation for the compulsory subdivision of large estates. The greater portion of 23 counties is within Goyder&#39;s line of rainfall. The counties of Robe and Grey were selected for a detailed investigation. The experts found that in those two counties alone there was sufficient land held in large estates, and not being properly utilized, to settle approximately 1,700 additional farmers without extensive works, such as railways, roads or drainage schemes, being necessary. The two counties mentioned are situated in the south-eastern district of South Australia where there is an abundant rainfall. The provision of better railway and road facilities, and the draining of low-lying land would make it possible to settle nearly four times that number of farmers. In County Grey there were at the time 91 land-holders who, according to the latest land taxation assessment, held in estates the unimproved value of which exceeded &#163;5,000, land worth &#163;1,064,847. In County Robe 79 land-holders in the same category held land, the unimproved value of which was &#163;953,326. Thus in the two counties, 170 of such land-holders held land, the unimproved value of which was assessed at &#163;2,018,173, an average of &#163;11,871 each. </para>

              <para>- It is a little under 1,000,000 acres - I speak from memory. The commission classified the land on a scientific basis, and suggested the various classes of settlement for which it was suited. It also recommended that steps be taken to acquire it for closer-settlement purposes. Forty land-holders were approached in that connexion. But only two of them took the trouble to reply; and in each case the owner stated that he was not prepared to offer his land for closer-settlement purposes. Then the Government adopted the recommendation of the royal commission, in which it suggested that the power compulsorily to break up large estates should be sought, subject to fair conditions of valuation and to the conservation of the just rights of the existing owners, and, of course, of the community. The Labour Government of the day introduced what, in my opinion, was a perfectly fair proposal : To apply to that class of resumption similar conditions to those that had applied to the resumption of lands for the buildings of railways, water schemes, and for other public purposes. The bill passed the House of Assembly, in which the Labour party had a majority, but when it went before the Legislative Council, in which the Liberal party predominated, the Minister in charge was not even permitted to make a second speech. And again, for the third time in less than ten years, the party to which the honorable senator who moved this motion belongs, stultified endeavours to bring about closer settlement and the expansion of our primary industries. The State of South Australia has built approximately 2,600 miles of railways, it has spent large sums in providing roads, schools, police stations and public utilities, and no adequate return is being received for that expenditure. That is one of the main reasons for the present unfortunate position of the State which I represent. An improvement of that position can be accomplished only by increased production, which will give our railways and other public utilities an increased revenue to enable them to earn working expenses and interest on their capital cost. </para>

          <para>To demonstrate that this is possible I shall give one or two instances which have come within my own knowledge. In the south-eastern district to which I have referred there have been sporadic attempts at closer settlement, and lands have been cleared for sale from time to time. There is one notably successful instance to be seen in the vicinity of Mount Gambier, the sub-division of the Moorak estate. Thirty years ago when Moorak was run as a sheep-station there  were two inhabited holdings, in addition to the homestead, on the whole of the large area which adjoins Mount Gambier on the north-west, west and south-west. To-day there are approximately 350 families obtaining a living from that area, and the town of Mount Gambier has been benefited thereby to a very great extent. Then we come to a small place like Glencoe, which was subdivided from 22 to 25 years ago. That small township puts more produce on the railway than does the comparatively large town of Penola. Glencoe is a closely settled area, while Penola is mostly grazing country. </para>

              <para>- I know the districts very well,  and  acre for acre I would not exchange Penola for Glencoe land. Of course, honorable senators opposite are inclined to condemn Penola, and if Millicent were held in large estates to-day they would probably condemn it, because the south-eastern land is peculiar. When placed under cultivation it does not immediately respond, as it requires sweetening. Consequently the best returns are not secured in the first few years of settlement. If Penola land had the same cultivation and assistance with superphosphates that Glencoe has received substantially the same results would follow. That has been proved by what has been accomplished by settlers on similar lands at Naracoorte and Lucindale, which, if anything, are not as valuable as Penola. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> were familiar with that district he would be aware that the small settlers there have done remarkably well in recent years. In comparison, I recently met a farmer at Tantanoola who, on 98 acres of land, carries a few head of cows, a small flock of sheep and goes in for pig raising in a small way. He is a thrifty, methodical, small holder. That man, for the past three years, has averaged a net return of over &#163;400 per annum from his block. In addition he has secured from it a substantial portion of his own living. In the same district there are estates, one of which is of 12,000 acres, another of 18,000 and a third of 7,000 acres, of substantially similar country. I put it to honorable senators opposite which is the better proposal - to have a community of small holders producing intensely from their holdings, or to have two or three large estates carrying sheep, giving employment to comparatively few people, and  producing little for the railways to handle. Again, take Kybybolite. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will remember, Kybybolite, up to about 1921 was considered to be very poor country indeed. The introduction of top dressing and subterranean culture has revolutionized the district and to-day it contains many small holdings carrying three sheep to the acre and cutting 10 lb. of wool per sheep. Over the range there are two large estates comprising 63,000 acres, held by one man, and assessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spafford,</inline> the soil expert of the Department of Agriculture, as being 25 per cent better than Kybybolite. That great acreage carries only 18,000 sheep whose average wool production is under 6 lb. </para>

          <para>Only this afternoon this Senate was engaged in a second-reading debate of a bill which to a certain extent, will place the States of Australia under the financial control of the Federal Parliament. I suggest that if it is able to take to itself such powers it can also urge the State Governments actively to interest themselves in establishing the policy of small holdings instead of large estates. It is our duty to tell the States that they must make the best use of the land available. Such&#39; a procedure is essential if we are to populate this country and to maintain our migration policy. This party does not quarrel with a policy of migration, which I think is essential if we are to populate the country. But it does consider that we should not induce people to come here until opportunities are afforded them to sustain themselves in industries which have been established. So far as my own State is concerned, the only scope of any magnitude which presents itself for carrying an increased population is the development of its primary industries. Before those industries can he developed we must solve the land question, as I have endeavoured to explain. For that reason, I hope that the resolution will be carried, that an inquiry will follow, and that before long a scheme will be inaugurated under which the State and Federal Governments will co-operate to bring about closer land  settlement, and to make the conditions of our primary producers such that, having placed them on the land, they will operate successfully and willingly stay there, so that they will build up a peasantry in Australia that will assist to mould this into a great nation, just as the peasantry of older lands have played their part in moulding the destinies of those countries. </para>

          <para>I have often spoken in this chamber about the necessity for turning our attention to what I believe will ultimately prove to be of great help to Australia, the cultivation of small holdings, and their encouragement by every means known to Federal and State authorities. It is because we very seldom get any encouragement from honorable senators opposite, that I so warmly welcome the speech that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> has just made. But while I support all that the honorable senator has said, and&#62; all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said in moving his motion, I want to make a plea for the smaller industries which are to a great extent neglected, and which, in my humble opinion, offer a very fair field for the employment of people who very often are at a loose end. Men who have come from parts of Europe where tobacco is now a staple product, have told me that in some parts of Greece - and it is peculiar that the great bulk of what is known as Turkish tobacco should be grown in Greece - where wheat, farming was carried on without great advantage to the people who grew it - in fact, it kept them poor - they suddenly conceived the idea of growing tobacco for making cigarettes. While cigarettes may not be conducive to the health of a nation, the growing of the tobacco from which they are made affords a very profitable avenue for employment. Within a few years the wheat-farmers in a part of Greece called Morea, with one accord, abandoned the cultivation of wheat and commenced the cultivation of tobacco. Cigarette tobacco grows in a temperate clime, and on land which is a little too moist for the cultivation of modern wheat. I suppose there are millions of acres of land of that type in Australia. Some of the best tobacco I have ever smoked was, grown about 100 miles from Perth, but, strange as it may seem, Australians are really very conservative. If you tell an Australian that he is a conservative he will laugh you to scorn, but nevertheless, if not by his speech, al all events by his actions you have opportunities of telling that conservatism is very strongly rooted in him. I have had cigarettes made in Western Australia from Western Australian leaf grown, not as an experiment,- but as the commencement of an industry, and the leaf would be a credit to any part of Europe. Surely something of a practical nature can be done by the Commonwealth co-operating with the States, because, after all, not in discussing the matter, but in taking active steps to forward it we may be encroaching on the domain of -the States. Surely inquiries and experiments - and an ounce of experiment is very often worth a pound of inquiry - would be welcomed if as a result of them some relief could be found for the ever-growing mass of people who want to employ their energies, not alone by working for wages, with which subject I dealt last night, but also by working for themselves, and in that way adding to the prosperity and stability of their country. In the establishment of small industries there is much to overcome, not only the innate conservatism of the Australian branch of the British race, but also the love for broad acres. When the pioneers came to Australia they found these broad acres open for their selection and they become accustomed to vast expanses. They had no use for intense culture. They preferred to take up large areas of land but did very little with them. They did not hold with the theory of a &#34; little farm well tilled. &#34; Nowadays we have irrigation lands waiting to be taken up, and it is a pity we cannot hy some means, either by taking them young and educating them, or by pointing out to them how profits can be made on these lands, train a lot of our youths to take up these industries and become that peasantry which I feel sure in the case of Australia, as it has been in other countries, would turn out to be the country&#39;s pride. I have read a good deal of the progress which is being made in growing rice in Australia. I hope later on to have an opportunity to see what is being done. Rice-growing is one of the few instances in which, in my .opinion, any good has been derived from Australia&#39;s protective policy. Whether it will continue to make progress I do not know. </para>

They are, therefore, in an entirely different category from those which have to jostle in the markets of the world for the disposal of their products, and to their credit they have held their own up to the present. </para>

              <para>- I am prepared to retain the words if their deletion would imperil the safe passage of my motion, but it will not be child&#39;s play to have an investigation into the condition of all of Australia&#39;s primary industries allied to wheat-growing, fruit-growing and dairying. It means tackling four or five States within the temperate zone, and the inquiry should last for more than twelve months. Of course the work could be undertaken in sections, and if the Government is prepared to allow the investigation to be done by taking one industry after another in turn, I am prepared to allow the first part of my motion to stand as it is. But I wish to amend the latter part of it by omitting from paragraph / the words &#34;what room there is, if any, for the expansion of these industries under present conditions,&#34; and substituting the words &#34; what impediments there are, if any, to the expansion of these industries under present conditions.&#34; I want to give a wider scope to the inquiry. Honorable senators are evidently satisfied that I have, made out a prima facie case. The industries I have particularly mentioned have never been the subject of a proper investigation, except that there had been partial inquiries into wheat and fruit-growing. I thank honorable senators and the Government for the way in which my motion has been received and I hope that it will have beneficial results.. If it is found that these industries are flourishing, it will be the happiest of revelations. If, on the other hand, it is found that they are struggling under disabilities removable  by  law, or under economic disadvantages that can be eased, some good will come from the inquiry. </para>

            <para>. -  If as a result of the financial agreement which has been made, State governments find their resources seriously impaired, they will be unable to carry out efficiently many governmental activities for which they are properly responsible. I agree that we are just at the turning point. There now appears to be a settled conviction in the minds of the people that the States should not venture further into the industrial field. Experience has proved a good teacher. Long before the Labour party rose to power in this country the people, almost by universal consent, approved of State governments becoming actively interested in certain industrial enterprises. In later times in Queensland the State government some years ago bought a number of large station properties and entered into the business of cattle raising on an extensive scale, with most unfortunate results. In stead of showing a profit, the government cattle stations involved the taxpayers of that State in a loss of &#163;1,250,000. </para>

              <para>- We can readily understand the feeling of the people in Queensland to-day concerning that venture. The Government is endeavouring <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> sell the properties. We have had a similar experience in Western Australia in connexion with the State implement works. The Minister in charge of that scheme satisfied himself and apparently the Government also that it would return a profit of 25per cent. in addition to supplying the farmers of Western Australia with agricultural implements and spare parts at a reasonable price. A considerable sum was expended on the erection of the works, but unhappily the enterprise has not fulfilled expectations and the Labour Government is now endeavouring to induce private enterprise to share in the control of the undertaking. If that is not getting out of the business then it is a near approach to it. If we turn to Tasmania we find that the Labour Government there got rid of government-owned ships without a word of complaint from the people. If an anti-Labour government in any of the States mentioned attempted to do what Labour governments have done in the three States mentioned, the air would be thick with curses. Those socialistic schemes failed because those who launched them did not take into account human nature. But there are certain activities which, for good reasons, should still be controlled by the State. No one would suggest, for example, that our railways, our post and telegraph systems and a number of other public utilities should be handed over to private enterprise. And whilst State governments are responsible for the carrying on of these great undertakings, it is essential that they should not have their financial resources impaired. They are entitled to generous treatment at the hands of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

          <para>In the early years of federation, the customs and excise revenue amounted to about &#163;8,000,000 annually. The  framers of the Constitution considered that one-fourth of that amount would be quite enough for the needs of the central government. Actually it was more than sufficient. Careful handling of Commonwealth finances enabled the central government from time to time to return to the States the unexpended balance of the one-fourth of customs and excise revenue earmarked for Commonwealth purposes. To-day the collections from the customs and excise amount to over &#163;40,000,000, and there seems to be a disposition in some quarters to retain the whole of it for Commonwealth purposes. It is true that, with the years, there has been a corresponding increase in Commonwealth financial responsibility; but there is a big difference between &#163;2 a head customs and excise collections in the early years of federation, and over &#163;7 a head to-day. </para>

            <para>. - It appears somewhat extraordinary to most of us that there should be any strong opposition to the validation of this important financial agreement be- tween the Commonwealth and the States, under which the Federal Government is, amongst other things, to assume responsibility for certain State indebtedness. There have been a good many assertions as to what would happen if the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment were continued for the period covered by this agreement. The action of the Government since the expiration of the time fixed by the Braddon section in impinging on the revenue to be paid  to  the States from Customs House receipts has had an adverse affect upon State finances. But the immigration policy to which the Labour party has taken such strong exception, particularly when unemployment began to manifest itself in different parts of the State, was under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system of great benefit to the States. When the Commonwealth first propounded the idea that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment should cease there was naturally some dismay and concern amongst State Treasurers as to how they should adjust their finances. Many of the proposals first submitted were unacceptable to the States. The right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),when</inline> Commonwealth Treasurer, submitted certain proposals which mat with an unfavourable reception, and it is rather surprising now to find that the right honorable gentleman is one of the strongest opponents of this scheme. </para>

              <para>- He spoke against it in Victoria, and voted for it here. The present scheme was of such an unusual and unexpected character that it took the financial advisers and authorities of the States completely off their feet. To them it was an attractive proposal to be relieved of their debts and of the necessity to provide millions of pounds by way of interest on money, which was supposed to have been spent on reproductive works; but much of which has not been spent on anything of the kind. The proposals of the  Government  appeared to State Treasurers like the opening of a direct road to a financial haven. At the time a Labor government was in office in Victoria, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogan,</inline> who was Premier and Treasurer, and who was, of course, opposed to the Bruce-Page Government, welcomed the scheme with open arms. </para>

The Commonwealth Government practically made his Government a present of between &#163;600,000 and &#163;800,000,with the result that the deficit with which he would have had to face the country - and a deficit is always presumed to be a result of Labour administration - completely disappeared. Labour Governments have a reputation of being able to spend more money than they can raise, and the action of the Commonwealth Government allowed the Hogan Administration to close its books in a manner which was creditable to them, and which afforded great relief to the Victorian taxpayers at that time. Mention has been made of the manner in which the Federal Government has been paying off its dead weight war debt, which, amounts to approximately &#163;400,000,000 sterling. The Government has certainly made the position appear satisfactory, but while it has succeeded in reducing the war debt by an appreciable amount, the total indebtedness of the Commonwealth has increased instead of decreased, and to-day is more than it was five or six years ago. When the Government first introduced this means of reducing the dead weight debt it appeared satisfactory; but if the present position continues a situation will arise that will be difficult to meet. Unfortunately it has become the practice of State Governments to borrow money and then spend it in a variety of ways in an endeavour to secure a continuance of the support of the electors. In Victoria that course has been followed to such an extent that money borrowed for closer settlement purposes has actually been wasted, as when the land was found unsuitable and was. sold by auction the proceeds were treated as revenue. </para>

              <para>- During the ten or fifteen years that practice has been in force we have had three or four so-called National or Liberal Governments. The Hogan Government was not in power long enough to make any alteration, and did not appear to fancy such a stupendous task. We are repeatedly informed by different governments that Victoria&#39;s debt is represented by reproductive works, such as our modern railway system which has cost approximately &#163;70,000,000. Valuable works have also been undertaken in connexion with the conservation and distribution of water. But notwithstanding the useful ways in which a great deal of this money was supposed to be invested, the Auditor-General is continually drawing attention to the fact that these works are not in any sense reproductive. Last year, the Auditor-General said that the general revenue in Victoria was drawn upon to the extent of &#163;1,750,000 to pay interest on so-called reproductive works. The Victorian Parliament welcomed the Commonwealth&#39;s scheme because, amongst other things, it approved of the proposals concerning the Loan Council, which it contended would be a check upon the borrowing policies of the States. Even this year the Loan Council has done excellent work in limiting the State borrowing to what it considers a reasonable amount. The members of the British Economic Mission known as the &#34;Big Four &#34; studied the financial situation of the Commonwealth and submitted a report as favorable to Australia as they possibly could. But I am inclined to think some of the members of the Governmentwho met these British magnates over a glass of whisky, heard a different; tale. Doubtless these gentlemen commented upon our excessive borrowing for financing wild schemes, many of which are before their time. In that respect, the Commonwealth is just as much to blame as is the States. The Commonwealth  is constructing railways  200  years before they are required - lines which cannot be expected to pay interest on capital expenditure or one half of their working expenses. There seems to be a tendency on the part of both Commonwealth and State administrations to proceed at a faster rate than circumstances demand. In Victoria we have done wonderful work, particularly in irrigation, and have made a garden of what the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Robertson - when incensed over the duties imposed by Victoria many years ago - said was a cabbage patch. Victoria has been made what  it  was termed  by  its discoverer, the Australia felix of the Commonwealth. Although the Commonwealth has assisted in connexion  with  this huge scheme for the storage of water, production on the Victorian irrigation areas has increased to such an extent that a market for the produce cannot be found. The returns from the irrigated blocks do not justify the payment of the water charges. These are some of  the  problems which we hope will be remedied by the financial agreement. The members of the Victorian Parliament are, for the most part, satisfied with the comprehensive and statesmanlike proposal of the Treasurer to settle the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. &#34;With the withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, the States would indeed be in financial difficulties should this agreement not be validated. Indeed, it is difficult to see how they  would  be able to pay the interest on the money borrowed by them. The Commonwealth has dealt  Avith  these problems in a proper manner. The States are opposed to unification, although the Labour party is strongly in favour of having one Parliament and one purse for the  whole  of Australia. Were the Labour party in  power  in the Common-  wealth  and referendum proposals for unification  were  submitted to the people by way of a referendum, I feel sure that the electors  would  cast a strong negative vote. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> quoted from a leading article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> That newspaper is an unfortunate political guide. It extolled the Hogan Government in Victoria, and, at the same time, supported the Bruce-Page pact. It spoke with  two  voices. Eventually the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> lured the Hogan Government to destruction. When that government, fol- lowing the suggestion of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> introduced a bill for the redistribution of seats, the members of the Country party rose practically as one man, and the Hogan Government went out of office. I predict that it will be a long time before there is another Labour Government in Victoria. </para>

          <para>. - Recently the Prime Minister, in another place, said that this agreement will need to be reviewed in ten years&#39; time. When the proposal  was  previously before the Senate, it was spoken of in such  glowing  terms that honorable senators were almost convinced that it was without blemish. However, some doubt persisted in our minds, and the statement of the Prime Minister now indicates that the measure is not the bright and shiny thing that we were led to believe. I see no provision in the schedule which will permit a review of the agreement in ten years&#39; time, and I wish to know where it is made. It is not sufficient to have a verbal announcement by the Prime Minister that such action will be taken; I wish to see it in black and white in the bill. I admit that it is quite reasonable to expect that the contributory parties may desire to have the measure reviewed before that time, but it has been indicated that the. agreement is to operate for the full 58 years, and I fail to see where the option is provided in the schedule. If that option is implied, I urge that it be directly incorporated in the bill; I contemplate moving an amendment to that effect. If the Government will not undertake to do so. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> drew up many agreements of that* nature for his clients he would not have a very big practice. As was indicated by the Prime Minister it is quite likely that, in the interests of all parties, it may be necessary to review the agreement. But there is no necessity for that to be incorporated in the bill, as provision already exists &#39;that it may be altered, provided that all parties unanimously agree to the alteration. It is not necessary even to wait ten years. If in five years the conditions of the agreement proved irksome and prejudicial to the States or the Commonwealth generally, it could by a unanimous agreement of the parties concerned be altered. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BRUCE.</inline>That is as far as I think we can go, bearing in mind that the agreement must have some permanency because of the liability which the Commonwealth is taking over from the States, and to ensure that the agreement cannot be varied at the will of any one party to it. </para>
          <para>The suggestion I make is that, if the House feels strongly that the agreement should be subject to review from time to time, we should record our opinion that, at the expiration of ten years, if the matter has not previously been discussed between the Commonwealth and the States, it should bo re-examined to determine whether the basis of it should be altered in accordance with changed circumstances. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The right honorable the Leader of the Senate rightly insists that permanency should be established in order to have a sinking fund, but why did the Prime Minister make a statement which would lead the people of Australia to believe that this agreement can be, not only reviewed, but also altered periodically? It is true that the preamble sets forth that the agreement is to remain until it is altered by the parties thereto, but even if the State Parliaments unanimously desired an alteration, no such alteration could be made if the Commonwealth Parliament was not &#34;agreeable. There must be unanimity before any alteration can be made, and the statement made by the Prime Minister and endorsed by the right honorable the Leader of the Senate, promising a review of the agreement within ten years was, therefore, misleading to the people. There is nothing in the bill to indicate that the agreement can be reviewed at any particular time. If the Prime Minister had been sincere in what he said, he would have permitted Parliament to record its opinion in the bill itself that the agreement should be subject to review within a certain time. Honorable senators of the Opposition will oppose the schedule, but I presume that our friends opposite, with the solitary exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> will be bound by party ties to support it. </para>

          <para>. - I should not have spoken at this stage had it not been for the cheap sarcasm of the right honorable the Leader of the Senate. I am not in the habit of giving an opinion unless I believe in what I say. I am of opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is right in saying that the whole of the States could agree that this agreement is not in the best interests of the States, but the Commonwealth could keep them to the compact. There is no need to attempt to mislead honorable senators, and the Leader of the Senate should always be prepared to state what be believes to be the truth. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> that all the parties to the agreement might vary it. In ten years&#39; time it may, if they so desire, be in the best interests of South Australia to withdraw from the scheme on certain terms, yet it could not do so without the consent of all the parties. Of course it could not do so, leaving the Commonwealth in a hole, but I am sure an agreement could be drawn up providing for such a contingency. Whilst providing ample protection for the interests of the Commonwealth it could, at the same time, conserve the interests of the States. </para>

In another place the bill was debated for some days, and would have been discussed at greater length if the Government had not placed a time limit on the debate. It is true that the Leader of the Senate has not attempted to restrict discussion in this chamber, but I suggest that it would be better to take the third reading tomorrow.
